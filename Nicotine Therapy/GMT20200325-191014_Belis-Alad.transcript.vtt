104
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.660
Belis Aladag: Yes, so it's designed to help people with opioid use disorder. So people that are

105
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.630
Belis Aladag: really dependent on like when you were taking tramadol you were taking it as prescribed. Right.

Modoc County: Right for a day, I said to the morning in the evening.

108
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:54.600

141
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:56.880
Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, so yeah. So getting back to the medication, it's going to help you with pain. So that's the good news. J order for you. Yeah, it's going to help because it's it's it's got analgesic properties and it's long acting so the beauty of it is you don't need multiple doses. A day usually

142
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.940
Belis Aladag: However, I take that back for pain purposes, we may want to give you

143
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:12.540
Belis Aladag: A couple of doses, take it all back. So normally, if it's just for opioid use disorder. If you were like, okay, I'm just, I'm hooked on the Tramadol or I'm hooked on the bike it in

144
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:26.640
Belis Aladag: And you know, I don't really have pain issues. We'd say, okay, maybe once a day, but for you, you have pain issues and to cover your pain. We're going to need to do multiple doses, a day. So probably

145
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.640
Belis Aladag: We can try if. Do you think you can do three times a day.

146
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.500
Modoc County: Yes I you can

147
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.670

149
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.010
Modoc County: I can handle my drugs you know enough because I'm a drug user either

161
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:21.120
Belis Aladag: I think it'll work for you. I understand you have the high tolerance, so I'm not afraid to give you. I'm going to give you. I'm going to just jump right into it and give you eight milligrams three times a day. So we have a two milligrams and eight milligrams per

Belis Aladag: Kilogram

163
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:31.590
Belis Aladag: Yeah, I think, I think we can. I think you can handle it. Now if you feel that it's too much. If you feel groggy or

164
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.400
Modoc County: Your day

165
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.290
Belis Aladag: Feel a little higher. So I don't know.

166
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:34.830
Modoc County: Yeah.

167
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:40.530
Belis Aladag: Of course, you let us know and you cut it down. You can cut it to half. If you feel like it's

168
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:51.840
Modoc County: Her. So a question that I had was, okay, when you said if you feel a little high. See that's the thing. I don't want to feel it too strong. Like if

169
00:18:52.410 --> 00:19:03.150
Modoc County: Like unless it gives you energy, it might kick in as energy in my system because I found out that I have all this natural high energy

170
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:14.670
Modoc County: Um, but yeah, if I have a wrong or different kind of drug in my system. It might make me feel like when I smoke weed sometimes

171
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:31.260
Modoc County: I don't like getting to the point where I even just want to hit now makes me all Ooh, and I hate that feeling that stuff. Stupid feeling when you're stuck all inside yourself and stuff, not to the characters I don't sit on the girls with

172
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.070
Yeah.

173
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.350
Modoc County: I

174
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:43.290
Belis Aladag: Yeah, so you'll you'll will experiment and see if you'll take the first one. And you'll see it's it melts under your tongue.

175
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.790
Modoc County: So whether that's perfect.

176
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.580
Belis Aladag: Yeah, if it's a film or tablet, it really doesn't matter. It's whatever your insurance covers

177
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.200
Modoc County: Right, it'll probably a tablet.

178
00:19:52.560 --> 00:20:00.780
Belis Aladag: Probably tablet, you put it under your tongue drink some water. So your tongue is moist. So everything's moist in there, put it under your tongue. Let it melt.

179
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:10.020
Belis Aladag: And and that's how it gets into your blood stream. You don't want to chew it or swallow it too quickly, because then it will bypass your system, it won't, it won't work.

180
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:26.760
Modoc County: Thanks for telling me that I drink lots of water and i i ingest the pure form of vitamin C that my father has introduced me to that works incredibly well you can cook with it. You could read it in your water.

181
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:32.610
Modoc County: It's very strong tasting. But when you get used to it in small doses, you're able to handle more

182
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:41.010
Modoc County: And it builds up your immune system very nicely against any type of viruses that might be out there.

183
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.310
Modoc County: Is your vitamin C.

184
00:20:47.730 --> 00:21:02.280
Belis Aladag: Vitamin C is good for your immunity for sure. So okay, so, so you're going to try this. And when you take the first one. You see how you feel. In about 20 MINUTES. HALF HOUR. And you'll be like, oh, I think my pain is a bit better.

185
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.660
Modoc County: Thank you. Okay.

186
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:11.610

188
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.150
Belis Aladag: You'll be like, Okay, let me try the other one. And you take another pill.

189
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.890
Modoc County: Right. And for the same thing.

190
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:32.640
Belis Aladag: At night and you do that three times a day. Now if you find you take the first one. And you're like, Whoa, this makes me feel a little off or my energy levels are all like this too much, then the next time. It's

Modoc County: Yeah, okay.

208
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.340
Belis Aladag: Um, you mentioned marijuana. Do you drink alcohol because it's enough not to drink on this.

209
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:45.720
Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, awesome. Um, and, you know, sedatives so you're trying to stay away from Xanax additive and all that stuff.

212
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:05.490
Belis Aladag: Day. I really hope so. I think it will work. I think, though, that you should remember. Keep in mind though that it is

213
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:20.550
Belis Aladag: It is a partial opioids. So you don't want to be. I know you were on it for years, but it's really not a good idea to be on opioid and a sedative type of medication because they can lower your breathing and stop your breathing.

214
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:38.850
Modoc County: See, now I have been on opioids and then SOS consistently to gather all my life. And now that I'm off of it. That's exactly what I don't want yes a balanced.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:44.700
Modoc County: See the doctor only need to see you for other little issues, not a huge thing and then overwhelmed by for Dr. In the making him feel like he's known and he's the medication.

239
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.410

284
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.720
Modoc County: Patch and cigarettes.

285
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.550
Belis Aladag: We you

286
00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.440
Belis Aladag: And you smoke.

287
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:04.620
Modoc County: Yeah, I get the patches rub they she helped me out with that and say,

288
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:22.680
Modoc County: You're smoking. Yes, I have. It's a pack a day and patches on every 24 hours I put a new one on the morning. And so I do very well like that. Okay, so were you

289
00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.260
Belis Aladag: Were you like double that amount before

290
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.240
Modoc County: Yeah okay so

291
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.320
Modoc County: Yeah.

292
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:40.950
Modoc County: I was two bags a day just not too long ago and I was able to reduce it on my own without the patch now that I was in the hospital. I had the past in there.

293
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:57.270
Modoc County: And in my other hospital of this circumstances because I've been just in the last year in like five different hospitals for five different reasons and all this other shit incredible bleeding problems after having my baby. You just bad stuff and so

294
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:03.960
Modoc County: I'd say the cigarettes help if anything, I mean with my anxiety levels.

295
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.670
Modoc County: I use it as my major anxiety relief.

296
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:17.130
Belis Aladag: Well, you know what one pack a day is better than two. So I'm glad you're using the patch to reduce that

297
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:32.490
Belis Aladag: And and I hear you, it's associated in your mind with anxiety relief. So we don't want to like push it too hard. But eventually, you know, I'm glad phase, kind of on you and maybe you can start working on it. Once we get the pain under control. Okay.

298
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:41.130
Modoc County: Maybe we should see if my pain to get under control. I won't need to smoke as much either. Yes.

299
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.000
Belis Aladag: And I left.

300
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:42.930
Belis Aladag: Let's try this.

301
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:50.070
Belis Aladag: Let's try. I'm going to prescribe this for you. I'm also going to prescribe something called Narc can

302
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:59.400
Belis Aladag: It's not likely that you overdose with Suboxone Suboxone as a partial opioids, so that respiratory depression effect is very limited.

303
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:13.530
Belis Aladag: Unlike the other opiates, but just California law we want to be careful will give you something called Narcan it's a spray in your nose. If you were to pass out. And people don't know what it's from. And they think, maybe it's an opioid overdose.

304
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:22.170
Modoc County: Thank you. So, what will that spray help with another words like like if that were to happen if you were to overdose.

305
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.750
Belis Aladag: And it would reverse it would reverse the the overdose. It would take away the Suboxone

306
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.510
Modoc County: From you overdose on it. Sorry, I don't mean to

307
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:51.420
Modoc County: interrupt you, but when you overdose on if you do that means that it makes your respiratory system slow down too much. Right. Yes. Therefore, I can tell if I have to slow down and we'll need that spray

308
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.720
Belis Aladag: Yeah, if you feel short of breath and stuff but

309
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.820
Modoc County: That happened in the beetle.

310
00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.530
Belis Aladag: Most of the time, this is not to be used by you.

311
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.810
Modoc County: It's tonight persona life.

312
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:04.620
Yes.

313
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.740
Modoc County: But remember to save our life before I asked for help.

314
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:24.600
Modoc County: In case I know that this is what's happening to me right now the breathing is really slow down. It's really hard and I feel like I really need some help and I don't want to scare my fiance all go

315
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:40.530
Belis Aladag: Well well well the disclaimer is this. This is a temporary reversal agent, it's, it's used immediately to reverse it, but it got you can slip back into the overdose within 30 minutes so you still have to call

316
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.410
Modoc County: Nine is still in while you still would be enough for me to go

317
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.870
Modoc County: And then be able to call 911

318
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.630
Belis Aladag: Yeah, you could do that. Yes.
