00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.149
Nadine Quintana: You know, just

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.649
Nadine Quintana: Focus on myself and

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.580
Nadine Quintana: Not worry about anybody else because

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.910
Nadine Quintana: That's what I've been doing

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.910
So,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to begin to kind of move into the preparation phase to do some em Dr work with you.

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And part of that is still a little bit of imagery wanting to do a couple of resource kind of imagery. Are you open to doing a little bit of that with me today.

8
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.790
Nadine Quintana: Sure.

9
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard for me to keep track if I've done some of these exercises in group like which days clients with their and which Jason

10
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you say oh yeah yeah I did that one, then that's fine, just if you can remember what it was. Then, just tell me

11
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.520
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

12
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's that

13
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The previous Nope.

14
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't follow into the new notes there might be pieces that got lost.

15
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's start with

16
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

17
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.590
Think about

18
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I want you to think about 333 fingers three images. One is a protective figure was a nurturing figure and one's a wise figure to remember doing that with me.

19
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.250
You're frozen.

20
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.970
Nadine Quintana: Maybe it's because my wife buys on me.

21
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.010
Nadine Quintana: To turn that off.

22
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

23
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to picture.

24
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Me in sometimes it's helpful to be a little bit in distress moments. So just put yourself in a little bit of a distress moment. Maybe you're at work. Maybe you're caring about what other people think and all of a sudden, I want you to picture.

25
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of image either real or imagined has the quality of being protective might be someone that actually exists or is in a movie a book TV show that really has the quality of a protective figure

26
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up for you.

27
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.320
Nadine Quintana: What happened.

28
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.550
Nadine Quintana: Okay, I caught, most of it just self.

29
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective figure. I want you to think about someone that really embodies the quality of a protective figure either real or imagined. What do you think of

30
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.760
Nadine Quintana: Actually what came to mind was this

31
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.120
Nadine Quintana: Guy that I work with.

32
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What's his name.

33
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.470
Nadine Quintana: Um, Chris.

34
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, God, what is it about Chris that he really represents that quality.

35
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.440
Nadine Quintana: Because he's

36
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:50.100
Nadine Quintana: Defensive when it comes for me and us you know me, not towards me, but like when other people like see that things or or try to treat me bad or something. He's like grill defensive when it comes to that and

37
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.040
Nadine Quintana: He always tries to talk to me, just to, you know, to make me feel better and stuff so I kinda

38
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.390
Nadine Quintana: Got that he came to mind.

39
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Does anyone else come to mind because it can be a combination of different images. We've got Chris who defends you when someone maybe says something negative about you and he also tries to talk to you, to help you feel better.

40
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.060
Nadine Quintana: And

41
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.630
Nadine Quintana: this other guy that I work with to His name's James. He's like an older man, kind of like, I don't know, I, I kind of see him kind of Zico

42
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.300
Nadine Quintana: father figure type person. Okay.

43
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.280
Nadine Quintana: Because he just gives me like that warm feeling

44
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:54.060
Nadine Quintana: That everything's gonna be okay kind of filling when he sees. I'm like really down or mad or sad or, you know,

45
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta send a quick message here for a second.

46
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

47
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So kind of a father figures this protective figure right and maybe it's this combination of James, as well as Chris

48
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now let's picture nurturing and a nurturing figure tends to be someone that really wants your growth really wants to promote it support it, your growth and development. It might also include

49
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Affection, but not always like nurturing is now helping you grow.

50
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.670
Nadine Quintana: I don't know.

51
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can't find anyone picture. Maybe you recognize that type of nurturing maybe in a TV show and the movie might have been in a book and some other

52
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of your life that you've seen it, you know, it's maybe not something you have felt directly

53
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you have

54
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.600
See if we can try and find that

55
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.690
Nadine Quintana: For some reason on this book that I've been reading. I don't know.

56
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.930
Nadine Quintana: I kind of thought about that.

57
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.800
Nadine Quintana: Which I don't know why.

58
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I heard you say is, you're thinking of a book.

59
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.710
Mm hmm.

60
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say, think of a nurturing figure. Can you give me a little more information.

61
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.090
Nadine Quintana: Um, well, the book that I'm reading the character in the book you

62
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:47.880
Nadine Quintana: Are I don't know when it comes to like the girl who's like really like carrying with her and like really like just wants the best for her.

63
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.940
Nadine Quintana: Even though it's not him, but

64
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.650
Nadine Quintana: He's like, girl.

65
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.670
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, like protective I guess you could say, and just wants the best for her.

66
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so this character in the book is caring wants the best for her and his protective

67
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.780
Nadine Quintana: Yes. Okay.

68
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You get a sense of what he does that really

69
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Represents that kind of picture it

70
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:45.960
Nadine Quintana: Well, when it comes to like her safety or her like her future or her well being. He's really protective with her about that you always make sure she's

71
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.640
Nadine Quintana: Taking care of. Yeah.

72
00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Let's go to the third, figure out my ship Fisher someone real or imagined that represents the quality of a wise figure

73
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.310
Nadine Quintana: Oh my God came to mind again. Okay, so

74
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What

75
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.260
Nadine Quintana: Not but he's not alive anymore. That's who came to mind when it came to wise.

76
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I had you think about someone that's wise someone that's nurturing and a protective figure all three of these as a team, would you want to picture the wisdom in your data.

77
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.190
Beautiful.

78
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's develop another

79
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's develop I'M PRETTY SURE YOU WERE YOU WEREN'T YOU in one of the groups where I did the container a container that's big enough that strong enough to hold all your emotional stuff that one.

80
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.080
Nadine Quintana: Yes.

81
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your container.

82
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.760
Nadine Quintana: It was a jar with the top on it.

83
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.940
Nadine Quintana: I think I still have the picture.

84
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I wrote container in here just beautiful. And then another one. Let's do a distancing metaphor distancing

85
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Metaphor. Okay. So for this one, it would be

86
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll give you a metaphor. Do you know what a metaphor is

87
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.920
Nadine Quintana: Um,

88
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.230
Nadine Quintana: I think so.

89
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how would you just describe a metaphor. Let's just say

90
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.590
Nadine Quintana: I'm right.

91
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.550
Nadine Quintana: I mean, I

92
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.300
Nadine Quintana: This is hard. I'm

93
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.050
Like

94
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.770
Nadine Quintana: I can't think of anything now.

95
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You could try an example.

96
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.590
Nadine Quintana: Okay, you're trying to think of like

97
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.720
Nadine Quintana: Like a

98
00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.190
Shoe

99
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.890
Nadine Quintana: I'll pull up a definition.

100
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just pull up the definition

101
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Meta metaphor will go and afford to finish so that we have that all on the same page here.

102
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we got a metaphor for sure. Alright, so a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. So a figure of speech a figurative expression.

103
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: An image.

104
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

105
00:12:48.180 --> 00:13:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a thing regarded as representative a symbol of something else that might be what most people think of it as it's a symbol of something else. It doesn't literally raining cats and dogs.

106
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

107
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.470
Obviously, it isn't real.

108
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just raining very heavily. Can you imagine a cat and dog fallen.

109
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Under that's a, that's a metaphor.

110
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You picture in

111
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.980
Nadine Quintana: It right

112
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got it. So now what I want you to do is I'm going to give you an example of a distancing metaphor and the purpose behind this is

113
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.510
Nadine Quintana: To bring up some

114
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: imagery that feels like you're getting distance between something and it's kind of going further and further away.

115
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be useful sometimes if let's say you have a negative thought and negative emotion negative body experience and you want to put a little distance. Let's say something happens and you and I are talking

116
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a lot. It's like overwhelming, or it's intense, let's say, and you're like yeah

117
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed that or you notice it. And we say, well, let's put a little distance between

118
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You and that experience and we picture maybe on the riverbank

119
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Or beside a lake, and you're on. You're on the shore and you can picture a log kind of moving down the river and it's going further and further away.

120
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's getting like you can almost see it getting smaller and smaller. So you could barely see it anymore.

121
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the idea is, what we do is we kind of hold this. Maybe I have a negative thought or a negative feeling and I have it sat on that log and it's moving further and further away. That's a distancing it's getting further away.

122
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's a train and they picture the car, right, one of the train cars, maybe it has a label on it or something. There's a particular color and it's going further and further away down the train tracks. It might be an airplane flying further away one person came up with spaceship.

123
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: flying out of space, one person put

124
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: They were on the seaside and the boat was kind of going further into the ocean going further away. So you think of a distancing metaphor, one that you kind of can summon up if you needed to. And I'll write it down in case it needs some reminding we can use it.

125
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Which got

126
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:47.820
Nadine Quintana: Picture like a start, like a shooting star how it just keeps going further and further to you just can't see it, no more. Yeah, I got it. I like it.

127
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Shooting Star getting further and further away can tell you can't see it.

128
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

129
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go up here to be starting working on with me.

130
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.490
Started a couple of times to work on your anchor room. Don't get too far.

131
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.830
See, try that twice. One was

132
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.070
My hand.

133
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so one of them. We got blocked around people, and trust.

134
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And protective I have missed trust with people because I'm trying to protect myself from getting hurt or misused.

135
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of remember

136
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Describing

137
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:56.610
At one point,

138
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And how often does that bother you.

139
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.490
Nadine Quintana: I mean it, it actually

140
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.220
Nadine Quintana: I've actually gotten better at that. But the the trust and the

141
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:29.310
Nadine Quintana: And the not, you know, putting a boss. I've learned to take them down, even if I I've even been tested a couple of times in it. I have it like

142
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:39.630
Nadine Quintana: Pushed everybody way after stuff has happened. So I've gotten really, really good at that, which I'm actually really proud of myself for that.

143
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.870
Nadine Quintana: Because I was really bad.

144
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you weren't going out into the world.

145
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.410
Nadine Quintana: Having relationships with

146
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: People, because you're afraid you get hurt. So you've made a lot of progress with that.

Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I remember them. Okay.

153
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And would you be comfortable exploring a little bit more in detail about what's going on in them.

154
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: If it meant

155
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.060

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Resolution. Okay, so is there. Is this the the break in. Is this what was it, what's the nightmare about

157
00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:09.420
Nadine Quintana: Um, it's about like this like something evil. Like, I can't look at first one was like something like evil is in the room with me when I'm sleeping.

158
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.030
Nadine Quintana: And I wake up.

159
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:23.940
Nadine Quintana: And I can see it, but I know it's there and it feels like I'm awake. Because everything is the way it is. When I really fell asleep. So at the time. I'm thinking I'm REALLY AWAKE

160
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.370
Nadine Quintana: And

161
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.200
Nadine Quintana: I could just feel somebody in the room with me.

162
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You can sense that they're there.

163
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.190
Yeah.

164
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.420
Nadine Quintana: And how did I know that it's sorry

165
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I rather hear what you have to say.

166
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.160
Nadine Quintana: I could sense that it's not like evil that it's not good.

167
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.200
Nadine Quintana: When you then after you notice that it's evil, what happens

168
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.840
Nadine Quintana: I noticed, like I've been

169
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.320
Nadine Quintana: I know I'm asleep.

170
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.650
Nadine Quintana: So I tried to yell for somebody to wake me up to help me. Okay.

171
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.840
Nadine Quintana: And whether or not that's something guy.

172
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.400
Nadine Quintana: taught myself or

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.610
Nadine Quintana: I don't know what

175
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.660
What do you

176
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:39.390
Nadine Quintana: I snapped that I'm sleeping that it's just a nightmare. And I try to call for somebody to come and help me to wake me up and I'm in my dream. I'm like yelling for like one of my kids to come and wake me up to help me and wake me up.

177
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what happens

178
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:48.660
Nadine Quintana: And then I end up waking up, but I end up waking up crying and like I can't breathe and kind of having like a panic attack.

179
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.090
Nadine Quintana: And I have to calm myself down and I just opened the lights and

180
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.040
Nadine Quintana: You turn the light on. Yeah.

181
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And only you said maybe you only remember to in January.

182
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.920
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

183
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That feel like

184
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: For you.

185
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.220
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

186
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.870
Nadine Quintana: It has

187
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever in your dream turned around and faced the evil.

188
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.990
Nadine Quintana: Um, well, the second dream that I had, I actually

189
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:41.340
Nadine Quintana: I thought I was awake again. I didn't know I was dreaming up first and I could feel something hovering over me.

190
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:49.770
Nadine Quintana: And when I like turned to look around. I just saw like this black figure this to say

191
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.050
Nadine Quintana: I want to say like a kid, but I

192
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:56.760
Nadine Quintana: I know it was

193
00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.370
Nadine Quintana: Like

194
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.280
Nadine Quintana: I knew it was an evil.

195
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.970
Nadine Quintana: Being like, it was a kid. But it was like small like one and I

196
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:17.340
Nadine Quintana: And I could see like hair like like short hair but like all over the place. And I couldn't see a face.

197
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:40.950
Nadine Quintana: And there was standing right right by the side of my bed right by my lamp, and it was a covering over me. And when I turned. I was trying to then I snapped. I was sleeping. Yeah. And that's, I tried to call for my son that time to wake me up.

198
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:54.900
Nadine Quintana: But then it kind of happened again because when I woke myself up. I thought I really woke myself up in real life, but I didn't, I just, I was dreaming it again so

199
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.970
Nadine Quintana: That one was a little awful, then the last one.

200
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your belief about yourself and this ongoing nightmares. You have

201
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I hang on there. If you can answer it, you can do it.

202
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:23.940
Nadine Quintana: And

203
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a really hard question ad and so take your time.

204
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.540
Nadine Quintana: When we say that again, sorry. When I kinda

205
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I shouldn't have interrupted you. You just typically asked a question when I

206
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.570
Nadine Quintana: Wanted to nip it in

207
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was my fault.

208
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about that awful dream. What is your belief about yourself.

209
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.160
Nadine Quintana: Well, good at that.

210
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Time. It'll. It'll get there. Sometimes it helps to just sort of first things that come to mind. Try not to do a lot of editing just sort of free associate what were things that crossed your mind.

211
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.880
Nadine Quintana: Um, well, my

212
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.390
Nadine Quintana: belief is that i i

213
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:36.720
Nadine Quintana: Could I could get through it that I could arm that it's not gonna hurt me that I'll be all right. You know, okay.

214
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.830
Nadine Quintana: That's looking to mind for me.

215
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:57.540
Nadine Quintana: Like before, I used to get really scared to where I would let it really take over me and I wouldn't go back to sleep. And I would stay up and I would get paranoid and I would get scared at any noise but

216
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:15.360
Nadine Quintana: Now it's like I i may stay up for a little bit while I come down and I may turn on the lights. But then eventually I calm myself down and I turn off the lights and I able to go back to sleep because I notice you know it's not going to hurt me. They come to be okay.

217
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:16.800
Yeah.

218
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you remember

219
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What you used to think about yourself. When the worse.

220
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.000
Nadine Quintana: I was just really scared I was, I felt helpless.

221
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.620
Nadine Quintana: And I kind of felt

222
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.670
Nadine Quintana: Like tired like I was tired of

223
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.130
Nadine Quintana: Going through that I kind of like to the point where you're like,

224
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.530
Nadine Quintana: I want to say like give up that kind of sounds a little too.

225
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.180
Nadine Quintana: Kind of like you're like,

226
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:07.050
Nadine Quintana: Like helpless just I felt helpless and like it was never going to get better and

227
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:14.370
Nadine Quintana: I wasn't always going to have those dreams and I was always going to be scared. And, you know,

228
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.940
Nadine Quintana: So it'll always been like how I used to be.

229
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.580
Nadine Quintana: But that was before. Yeah.

230
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it is I can get through this. It is not going to hurt me, I will be all right. Yeah. And that helps you calm down the body relaxes more after you turn the lights on some time passes, and you feel better.

231
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

232
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot less you were having them about five times a month before. So your head. The frequency just on its own has gone down.

233
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.120
Okay.

234
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: He's that still seem about right like twice in January.

235
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.810
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, okay.

236
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to do a little bit of work around this nightmare that you had

237
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.140
Nadine Quintana: Like I don't think

238
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.580
Nadine Quintana: Think I've handled it pretty good. I've handled it pretty good.

239
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're okay with if we don't don't do anything with it that you're comfortable with just the way it is. No, no real change needed. We can just leave it just the way it is.

240
00:27:54.810 --> 00:28:02.670
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I think so because I mean if it happens again. I mean, I can't stop them from coming, but I could control what I do.

241
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you. What if you could stop them from coming and that's why I'm bringing it up.

242
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.890
Nadine Quintana: Oh, oh, then that case. Well, yeah, I would like to do that.

243
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I initially said would you like to do some work around that.

244
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You were thinking what we would do what

245
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.080
Nadine Quintana: Um,

246
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:26.730
Nadine Quintana: I don't know.

247
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:38.820
Nadine Quintana: Just talk about it. Try to get me to like not get me but to like do something to where I could not be as scared. You know, when I have them.

248
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.070
Nadine Quintana: kind of figured why kind of already taught myself to do that. So yeah.

249
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: After the fact. I see.

250
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:45.930
Nadine Quintana: That's what I thought.

251
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you already

252
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a handle on the self regulation part, I would just be interested. And now I find out you are to is to not have them at all.

253
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:04.380
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, yeah. If I could get rid of them, like all together. That would be awesome.

254
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you're open to it. Let's, let's give it a shot.

255
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.140
Nadine Quintana: Alright, alright, cool.

256
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to

257
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just do a quick check in. So right now.

258
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: On this idea of

259
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What's a subjective unit of distress from like zero to 100 how distressed. Are you right now as we talk about that nightmare.

260
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.850

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.090
Good.

264
00:29:49.650 --> 00:30:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's go right so let's go over to let's go to trying to remember and there's not going to be a lot of history, telling. I just want to know the age

265
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When you remember back. The earliest time or the most intense of a nightmare like that how old you were

266
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.840
Nadine Quintana: All right, I remember getting them when I was like 13

267
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:23.520
But

268
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:35.550
Nadine Quintana: I remember they got like more intense like around 2324 around those ages.

269
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember what was different about

270
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Those 10 years like what was different.

271
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:53.820
Nadine Quintana: I'm like the breathing. I had a difficult time breathing, where I would panic and I was asking for help to help me breathe.

272
00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:02.340
Nadine Quintana: Like I felt like I was like, I like it felt like I was gonna die right it was bad.

273
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was going on in the context of your life like compare like on one screen you see the 13 year old self. On the other screen you see this 23 year old just sort of bring compare those two memories. How was your life different between 13 and 23

274
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:30.360
Nadine Quintana: Or more when I was 13 my mom and my dad divorced, which I hated the fact that the divorce.

275
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:37.530
Nadine Quintana: When I was around 2324 I was actually addicted to drugs.

276
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And honey, you know, go back to age 12 for a second, get a sense of what was going on at age 12 and there were no nightmares there there was, Linda.

277
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.740
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, remember, um,

278
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.750
Nadine Quintana: It was kind of a carefree we'll see

279
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.290
Nadine Quintana: You know, just being a kid having fun.

280
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.900
Nadine Quintana: Visiting with family and having a great summers and

281
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.570
Nadine Quintana: Nick I had a really

282
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.410
Nadine Quintana: Good. It was fun. It was nice.

283
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.330
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I was actually happy.

284
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's bring this awareness of this age 13 year old and

285
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring her into this

286
00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Anchor room. We've started a couple of times, we started

287
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were thinking young adult. We've also started at age six and seven and we don't get too too far into it. Um,

288
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I can see some of the notes on it.

289
00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just kind of close your eyes. If you're willing to, to the degree that you want to, you can always open them again.

290
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And just picture this teal realm of beds and curtains and throw pillows with white walls, a closed. They window.

291
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

292
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: They windows with a pillow and it's dark outside

293
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a lamp by the bed. It's comforting the picture of a white or you pictured of the white fluffy carpet and you see yourself laying and reading

294
00:33:52.860 --> 00:34:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice it's nice and quiet when you focus on what sounds you hear and you smell coconut you taste mint and you notice the white door with a silver handle leads to the dining room and the emotion is comfortable. There's no worries outside the room.

295
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Trees and it's dark can seen the moon light hitting the ground.

296
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And the body is relaxed.

297
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And for this 13 year old in this room.

298
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the lie. What was the misinformation that this young girl had to believe

299
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to survive at age 13

300
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This adult, of course knows that wasn't true. But in order to survive in that environment.

301
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: As a 13 year old.

302
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What did she have to believe was true.

303
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to

304
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Be okay

305
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.460
Nadine Quintana: He

306
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't be hurt. That was the misinformation.

307
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a sense of being that age right now being in that room.

308
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And really taking on this quality of

309
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There's

310
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:21.660
Nadine Quintana: Night night.

311
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.190
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

312
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.850
Nadine Quintana: Would be fine.

313
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.720
Nadine Quintana: Everything would be good. When I get older.

314
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What does the adult know that the little girl. This young 13 year old doesn't know what is the adult now.

315
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.260
Nadine Quintana: You're always

316
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.760
Nadine Quintana: There's always going to be things to you, you just

317
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.140
Nadine Quintana: Everything's gonna be perfect and happy all the time.

318
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.580
Nadine Quintana: People aren't always going to be good people.

319
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.440
Nadine Quintana: Trust.

320
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look at the little girl has she been treated

321
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Her whole life thus far.

322
00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

323
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Even the six or seven year old was treated. Good.

324
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.530
Nadine Quintana: Yes.

325
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When was

326
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The young girl not treated. Good.

327
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Was not treating her good

328
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.170
Nadine Quintana: She felt as her mom.

329
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.540
Nadine Quintana: Changed after she divorced her dad.

330
00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Screen was frozen. So here's what she said that I heard I had asked you, when she got hurt. And you said

331
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: She felt as

332
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom changed after divorcing dad. Then I I don't know, that's kind of an incomplete sentence. Could you finish that

333
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.050
Nadine Quintana: Okay, um,

334
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: How would that hurt the little girl, girl.

335
00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.620
Nadine Quintana: Because she became

336
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.680
Nadine Quintana: more distant, you know,

337
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.170
Nadine Quintana: Was carrying more about

338
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.140
Nadine Quintana: her new boyfriend and his kid and just kind of pushed

339
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.600
Nadine Quintana: The 13 year old out of the way.

340
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: two year old feel

341
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:38.550
Nadine Quintana: Angry

342
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.110
Nadine Quintana: Angry and

343
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.940
Nadine Quintana: Frustrated, and just most be angry.

344
00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are you feeling right now.

345
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.420
Nadine Quintana: kind of relieved

346
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention now.

347
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.170
Nadine Quintana: We become

348
00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.120
Nadine Quintana: Closer.

349
00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.550
Nadine Quintana: We talk more

350
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.520
Nadine Quintana: We spend more time together.

351
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.280
Nadine Quintana: She doesn't choose anybody over her kids anymore.

352
00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.170
Yeah.

353
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get a sense of this 13 year old and

354
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A 13 year old maybe in this room.

355
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, getting everything that she needs. She's got the attention of her mother. She's got all the things that give her comfort and peace and relaxation in the room.

356
00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And just see, see if this 13 year old.

357
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Can have the awareness that this

358
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Shadow

359
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

360
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: outside the room.

361
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And outside the room, and as far away as she wants it to be.

362
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get a sense of where this 13 year old would place that shadow. How far away.

363
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Far away she wants.

364
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.040
Nadine Quintana: Did you hear what I said.

365
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me that. Correct. Yeah, cut off so far, like

366
00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:36.120
Nadine Quintana: I said, for some reason I'm picturing the shadow on the other side of the door, which is even scarier.

367
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah.

368
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting. Let's just go with that for just a minute, just say okay so this 13 year old, what could she do what magic.

369
00:43:50.160 --> 00:44:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Can she use and she can use a, you know, and the compartment on the side of the wall is so secret compartment and there's a magic wand in there and she can do whatever she wants with this, with this shadow

370
00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What was she like to do with it.

371
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:11.700
Nadine Quintana: Me, make it disappear, where couldn't ever come back.

372
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What's preventing it from disappearing.

373
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What's preventing it from disappearing.

374
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.440
Nadine Quintana: Cuz she keeps thinking about it.

375
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.330
Nadine Quintana: Sometimes

376
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the thoughts.

377
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.680
Nadine Quintana: That's mostly

378
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.550
Nadine Quintana: About is the

379
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:12.540
Nadine Quintana: Way it looked like it was even though there wasn't a face. It was scary.

380
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it want

381
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To

382
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if this 13 year old.

383
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Either on her own or with her resource of

384
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective figure nurturing figure and wise figure

385
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.570
Nadine Quintana: Maybe we could

386
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that quality present in the room.

387
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: See if this

388
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Young woman can

389
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Somehow, ask the shadow what it wants.

390
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be further away from the door when it asks, it can magically ask it can happen in whatever way comes to mind. But see if she's able to ask a question, find out what it wants.

391
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.140
Nadine Quintana: Yes.

392
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.690
Nadine Quintana: She would if she had those

393
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.150
Nadine Quintana: You know, nurturing and wise and

394
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Protecting

395
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.540
Nadine Quintana: You know, caring people protective people on their own, with her.

396
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.480
Nadine Quintana: She was able to

397
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.080
Nadine Quintana: You know, be more

398
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.290
Nadine Quintana: What's the word

399
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see if she can ask the

400
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:04.800
chatroom.

401
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:11.910
Nadine Quintana: Yes, she

402
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it sound. Let me hear

403
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:24.840
Nadine Quintana: What do you want with me. Why do you keep popping up here.

404
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you picture happening with the shadow

405
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.810
Nadine Quintana: I just picture it standing there in silence.

406
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:43.770
Nadine Quintana: Hovering

407
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. And where is it now in that picture. You just thought of.

408
00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:06.240
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

409
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So how are you from zero to 100 right now.

410
00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.150
Nadine Quintana: I don't, I wouldn't crush just like

411
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Distress encompasses all negative feelings. So just give me a number zero to 100

412
00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:48.600
Nadine Quintana: Sorry Quinn. Okay.

413
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling nervous and zero to 100

414
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Hundred being the worst nervous and zero being like none.

415
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.310
Nadine Quintana: I would say they could

416
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever felt 100

417
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And nervous.

418
00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.850
Nadine Quintana: Yes you have. Okay.

419
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now it's

420
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if you can, you can bring in more of that awareness of that team. Don't just stay there for a little bit.

421
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And why don't you use the distancing

422
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that shadow and put it

423
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.650
Nadine Quintana: Okay, sorry, Greg. Can you say that again.

424
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Put the picture. The team with you in your room. This 13 year old really really being present with protection nurturing and wisdom.

425
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So that she really knows it believes it.

426
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Safe nurtured protected.

427
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And wise all around her.

428
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can do a little distancing to get that that shadow, you had before was this shooting star that could kind of

429
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Get whatever negative thing was going on, you could get some distance, maybe you can picture that shadow

430
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Heading away.

431
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.420
Nadine Quintana: And you could picture.

432
00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're not able to get much further into this in the sense that you would have been nice to kind of have gone through understanding with the shadow wanted

433
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

434
00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:57.750
But

435
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Without that around. How do you feel in the room.

436
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.140
Nadine Quintana: I don't know. I don't know.

437
00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:27.660
Nadine Quintana: Just nervous.

438
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's do this. I think someone else might be able to communicate and get that thing out of there.

439
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Who knows what to do.

440
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:46.890
Nadine Quintana: That again.

441
00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What or who knows how to get that shadow out of there.

442
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:58.860
Nadine Quintana: I think my dad.

443
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So long to picture him.

444
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What would he do to make sure that shadow was nowhere nowhere around

445
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.170
Nadine Quintana: I think you would chaser away. Yeah.

446
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

447
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then how would you feel once it was chased away and yelled out

448
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.090

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of your wisdom is this awareness. So the quality of your dad.

Gwenevere Abriel: So Dad could do it. Dad can find out

466
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe picture maybe dad chasing it right yelling at it.

467
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Down the road far away.

468
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.550

469
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it bigger or smaller than job.

512
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:49.410
Nadine Quintana: I get mad at myself sometimes because

513
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.010
Nadine Quintana: I

514
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.370
Nadine Quintana: Think that if I would have

515
00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:08.940
Nadine Quintana: Not gotten back with my husband and I would have went back to school and I would have done something with my life that my life would be different Mickey had wanted it to be, but

516
01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.840
Nadine Quintana: Instead, it just, I kept

517
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:15.780
Nadine Quintana: Going back and

518
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.770
Nadine Quintana: Then I got into drugs and

519
01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:25.200
Nadine Quintana: I didn't do anything with my life. I do nothing with my life.

520
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you think now that you haven't done anything with your life.

521
01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:42.180
Nadine Quintana: I always

522
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:49.860
Nadine Quintana: Something that really

523
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.840
Nadine Quintana: Really

524
01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like you're you're have a judgment about yourself. What is the judgment. You have about yourself.

525
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.410
Nadine Quintana: That I would have made better decisions that I would have

526
01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.280
Nadine Quintana: You know if I would have gone to school and finish school and

527
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:20.430
Nadine Quintana: You know, met a

528
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:26.940

530
01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.930
Nadine Quintana: Been doing good for myself.

531
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, stepping back from what you did say

532
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All the places that you went

535
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:21.570
Nadine Quintana: I'd like

536
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:24.750
Nadine Quintana: To actually

537
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:38.910
Nadine Quintana: Instead of questioning you every time you ask me something that are just able to just say it say whatever, even if it didn't go with what you were asking me

538
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:40.380
Nadine Quintana: I was

539
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.480
Nadine Quintana: really scared to just let out what first came to mind.

540
01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:00.420
Nadine Quintana: Like I usually am I overthink it. And I mean, I know I still do that but then I just go back to. Okay, this is what I thought open. That's what popped up and I was able to do that and just say it.

541
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like that about what you did that you were able to just trust yourself. You are good enough to say whatever comes to mind.

542
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.340
Nadine Quintana: Yeah. Oh, good.

543
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:16.140
Nadine Quintana: I did.

544
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We all want that feeling all day long. Whatever, I'm thinking of that's just fine. Right.

545
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:26.400
Nadine Quintana: Here.

546
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you noticed that I liked seeing it happen where you didn't have to question yourself all the time. Question. Your first response, you know, and my next clients here Nicole needing but thinking about for a second.

547
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:49.470

549
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:54.540

551
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.910
Nadine Quintana: Um, I just, I usually don't don't cry.

552
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.880
Nadine Quintana: It's just I guess kind of got to me.

553
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:15.540
Nadine Quintana: More than

554
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:19.740
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

555
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you need to do today just to sort of either put these intense feelings. Maybe you want to keep them out and sit with them a little longer. Maybe you want to do some drawing. Maybe you want to put them away.

556
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:40.770
Nadine Quintana: The container.

557
01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: In the jar or maybe send them on the shooting star.

558
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:47.640
Do you like to

559
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.380
Nadine Quintana: Alright, the guy would just like just get myself together real quick.

560
01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's a metaphor. Right.

561
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sure. Where would you please feelings. You're having right now we want to put them in a container or leave them out so they can be present. Where do you want to kind of send them on the star instead of shooting the way

562
01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:22.560
Nadine Quintana: I think I would just like to put it away for now.

563
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then the jar.

564
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: coziness that's in there.

565
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Something comfortable. So those feelings will want to stay in there.

566
01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture. What would be their

567
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.280
Nadine Quintana: Benches some big pillows and

568
01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.130

Gwenevere Abriel: So, picture that and just sort of gently inviting these memories and all the feelings and just let them, let them be inside the char with all his comfy pillows.

572
01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And those feelings and memories. They want to stay there and they can come out when you want to visit them. Maybe you can view them because it might be transparent, not sure, but they're there, and they want to stay there and it's okay.

573
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no problem to solve. Nothing urgent, we took them out and we can put them back.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:12.810
Good timer, I guess. It should take about 10 minutes. Eat up. I'm guessing may hear a beep start. Okay.

607
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So how have you been

608
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

609
01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Staring at my picture. You've been good. All right.

610
01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:25.290
Katrina Gutierrez: Put my phone away.

611
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: No been good.

612
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't had any issues. Okay. Oh, are you mentoring thing learning issue is, is me and Trinity will want me and Trinity. TRINITY. And everybody okay

613
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, oftentimes, you have to stress about, you know, questioning you know your role and whether you know that whole thing, you sound really comfortable that you've settled in with this isn't about me. This is something going on with Trinity.

614
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And are you increasing the frequency of her therapy. What are you doing to address it. I'm actually heard therapist.

615
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.090
About

616
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:18.450
Katrina Gutierrez: Six months ago stopped seeing her. She said that she was good and that she didn't need them anymore.

617
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:24.180
Katrina Gutierrez: And at the time, she was good but now I don't know what's going on with the kid.

618
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:31.650
Katrina Gutierrez: I, I talked to her last night, she was doing the dishes and I came out and I said, what's going on with you.

619
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:45.270
Katrina Gutierrez: Are you is anything bothering you, is anything you want to talk about because I hadn't some interaction with her like prior to that, and she was just real real cold real distant and just kind of looks

620
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:53.580
Katrina Gutierrez: Not sad, but not like mad, either. It's like a combination of, like, I guess last

621
01:11:54.990 --> 01:12:05.340
Katrina Gutierrez: She looks confused and lost. And so I was trying to like just, you know, you know, shoot the shit with her, ask her about her day and everything. And she was just just been so like

622
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:13.830
Katrina Gutierrez: She didn't even want to do it. And she's usually not like that. And she's been like that for a few days now.

623
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:32.880
Katrina Gutierrez: And I finally just said I was like I don't know what's going on with you. But there's something going on and we need to talk about it you I will give you time to think about how you want to share it, but you need to talk to somebody about it so

624
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.760
Katrina Gutierrez: What do you want her

625
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:44.250
She's there Washington

626
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want her. I want her to just have

627
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:54.480
Contact. And I just want her to have someone

628
01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:05.250
That she's sharing with because there's something going on with her and I can't pinpoint it and nobody can in the house and

629
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:08.280
She's being really weird.

630
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:10.050
Tell me what you mean.

631
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.000
She looks like she's

632
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:21.360
Okay, so

633
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.620
She doesn't talk to anyone. She goes into her room, she can't stay. You can stay awake.

634
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:33.630
She's constantly tired and

635
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:37.830
She's constantly irritated.

636
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So have you drug tested her. Yeah, yeah. What you find nothing okay

637
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: How long is this thing going on. This has been going on for about a week now, but there was things that were leading up to this that were just like the sickness.

638
01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:04.770
When she got sick again like that there was two times in less than a month where she was going up for three days straight.

639
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:16.620
And come to find out is because she wasn't listening to me and she kept drinking water really fast. I told her snippet don't keep putting like a bunch of water in you. You're just going to continue to get sick.

640
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.390
And so

641
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:22.500
She just she overindulges in food.

642
01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.430
Katrina Gutierrez: I'm starting to think maybe she might be

643
01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:30.060
I don't know if it's believe me or not.

644
01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You tend to eat a lot of sort of calories at one time and then purge it in some way.

645
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:45.780
What are you saying there was, I think it might be that because

646
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:50.520
I've noticed she will go to the bathroom immediately after she eats

647
01:14:51.840 --> 01:15:05.370
Katrina Gutierrez: And last night after she or no night before last. She was eating and then she was like we were talking. She's like, Okay, I gotta go the bathroom really quick. I was like, that's fine. And I got closer to the dorm to listen.

648
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:13.110
Katrina Gutierrez: And it didn't. I didn't hear anything. So, and she was in pretty pretty fast in and out. So

649
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.400
Katrina Gutierrez: I don't know because she she ordered this app.

650
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.330
Katrina Gutierrez: It's called better me and it's like a workout app.

651
01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:29.250
Katrina Gutierrez: And she came and got all like my weights and stuff and you know one night went on a run and everything. And there's just that one night.

652
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:43.920
Katrina Gutierrez: And she constantly saying stuff like she's fat and where do you see it when I had her point out where she thought she was fat and it just it's a lot of the same signs my sister. I believe you. And it is a lot of similarities but

653
01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:50.040
Then I don't know because when she does get sick. She hates it.

654
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:53.010
She's amazing. Well, she just wants to stop throwing up

655
01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:56.850
So I'm wondering if it's maybe

656
01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:04.710
I don't know. I don't know when she's literally borrowing money from people to eat his food here. I don't know what

657
01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:08.490
Is McDonald's. I mean, she and there's this one guy.

658
01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:11.520
That was a neighbor of my brothers.

659
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:18.630
Katrina Gutierrez: And he used to give her food because my brother never had food. Well, she ran into a modern way home from school and

660
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:30.090
Katrina Gutierrez: You know he he always wants to take her out to eat and like, Okay, well, maybe he just thinks that she's in the same situation. It doesn't know. And then I noticed on her email.

661
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:41.940
That she's been getting money from him and her mom every day like 2040 $50 he said her 40 and then the next day sent her 50

662
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:52.080
Katrina Gutierrez: I don't know that's there's something. There's something weird about that. Yeah, I'm like that's not that's not normal. That's not what people do and I keep telling her

663
01:16:52.620 --> 01:17:00.990
Katrina Gutierrez: You can't just trust everybody baby. I know you. You think you know you've known him for a long time, but you're also not a little girl anymore and

664
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:08.550
People don't just give money for no reason. So either you're telling him something that's not necessarily true.

665
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:14.520
Or he's got ulterior motives and she just like thinks I'm crazy, she looks at me like,

666
01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:21.030
Katrina Gutierrez: She doesn't listen to me. She thinks I don't know anything about life, I swear. And then I'm just crazy entity.

667
01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:26.820
And I don't know what to do. It's to the point where I'm like, You gotta go to your mom's

668
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.250
I mean, you got to that point.

669
01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Last week, but wait, it got that bad because she was lying.

670
01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: lying about what

671
01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:49.110
Katrina Gutierrez: She went she said she was gonna go apply it. This place right at the street. So we're like, okay, you know, let's good get I'll get some fresh air. You know, we want her out of the house.

672
01:17:50.160 --> 01:18:07.170
Katrina Gutierrez: You know out of her room and we something constructive and so we're like, okay, that's fine. She's not happy as a place. She's so you want to go somewhere else and apply. So we're like, okay, and then I get on my email and my email is connected to hers.

673
01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:19.110
Katrina Gutierrez: Somehow I signed on to one of her her things way back when, when I was setting it up and it stayed like that. And I came across her Google map where it tractor.

674
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:32.730
Katrina Gutierrez: And of course, me being, you know, concerned I looked at it. Well, while she was out and about his show that she was not where she was going. And then we get a phone call from Elisa sister.

675
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:42.480
Katrina Gutierrez: Thing that she's over at the twins, this House knocking on the door and this is this Lisa sisters, best friends. They live right behind us.

676
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:51.510
Katrina Gutierrez: And they could see her on the walkie talkie the doorbell THING THEY WEREN'T HOME, but they couldn't get the mic to work so they didn't know what she needed

677
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:52.980
And

678
01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:55.830
We don't know why she went over there.

679
01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:00.750
And I asked her, and she was like, there was a dog.

680
01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:07.170
Well, you can see the background it from like the center of the video right

681
01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:15.420
And there's no dog. And I'm like, Okay, well maybe we couldn't see it. But why were you all these other places, you said you weren't

682
01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.090
Katrina Gutierrez: And then you go over there and on the video. She looks worried, she looks scared.

683
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.410
Katrina Gutierrez: And that's why we're so concerned because she doesn't go over there. She really knows those people and

684
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I come right back.

685
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like you got some missing information.

686
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and

687
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:45.990
Katrina Gutierrez: My concern is, is, you know, what did she did something maybe already happened with this guy that that made her uncomfortable that day or something. And she didn't know what to do. And she got scared.

688
01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:54.540
Katrina Gutierrez: thinking I was going to freak out or something. I don't like that she doesn't want to talk to me. And I understand that that's probably my doing

689
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:55.650
Right.

690
01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Here when the one time that I met you two together it. The one thing I forgot a lot about what that interaction was that the one thing that stuck with me. The one thing she said, which was because it's so the hierarchy is so off kilter when she says, Well, I'll, I'll do anything.

691
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To help you

692
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Was to help you. Mm hmm.

693
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It brought Trinity in there to help her and her whole mindset is about taking care of you. So you're right. There may still be this.

694
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: She can't tell you. Maybe everything that's going on for fear that it will cause you distress caused a seizure. You know, there may still be sort of that underlying thing, um,

695
01:21:51.810 --> 01:22:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how a lot of what you shared with me is, you know, I've had to take care of a baby when I was just a kid myself you know people in general we pick up on things. We may not hear it directly but

696
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, I, I've accidentally let it slip and then I've had explained to her that it's like it was one time I told I said I was saying it's released. I didn't realize she was here.

697
01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This is why I didn't want kids, and it was in the sense of, I'm terrified of having kids because I worry about them constantly and I'll helicopter them and

698
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:34.800
Katrina Gutierrez: I had to go. Explain it to her when I realized she was here. I was like, I don't mean it like I would

699
01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:48.150
Katrina Gutierrez: Not want you or that I would change that. Yeah, I'm a citizen. I didn't want to have kids because I didn't want to have to worry about them. And, you know, basically, I didn't want to mess them up, possibly

700
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: For Katrina. What she may be left with is she doesn't want you to worry

701
01:22:54.030 --> 01:23:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: She makes such choices like she has to she surviving uncollected her parents are just

702
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just failed her terribly and she's just not you know it sucks because she's not mentally where she should be yeah I mean 18 and she

703
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: She refuses to do anything. She has a car that Elisa sister gave her. Uh huh. She has a permit. She won't wear her glasses. That's what stopping her from driving

704
01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:32.460
She won't remember to wear her glasses.

705
01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:37.770
And she has such bad vision. She has this stigma.

706
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:54.390
Katrina Gutierrez: I think actually involve if she has like horrible vision because she needed glasses from a very young age, and my brother literally worked in an eyeglass place as a entrepreneur a tech. He couldn't make her glasses.

707
01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:03.390
Katrina Gutierrez: And her eyes just got worse and worse and worse and they're just horrible. Now she can barely see the optometrist, and when we took her

708
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:11.070
And she snuck out to see a boy and she won't get her Devo like these are things

709
01:24:12.450 --> 01:24:24.840
Katrina Gutierrez: Why are you making it hard for yourself. You know, we're trying to get her to transition into doing stuff for herself like calling a doctor scheduling appointments. She's got a tooth that hurting when she drinks hot and cold.

710
01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.620
She just won't make a dentist appointment.

711
01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.750
And it pisses Lisa off because

712
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:44.520
Katrina Gutierrez: At least you made the effort to make sure she got to those appointments prior to this. Yeah. You know, when my brother wouldn't sign over medical

713
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:53.070
Because he wanted to be a jerk to me. Lisa literally figured out a way to get it signed over

714
01:24:55.140 --> 01:25:06.300
And she did all of that. And God or the regular checkups and Trinity and never had that before. And she was trying to explain how important that is in terms of you liked it, that somebody was doing that and cared and

715
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:11.010
Now she just won't continue it and

716
01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:18.120
It makes me mad because she's like you. What did I do that for if you're not going to continue to take care of yourself.

717
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I

718
01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: was watching

719
01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Us to do with reaching some sort of point of wanting to go back, um, is that about or about wanting to prevent disharmony with Elisa

720
01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:38.280
Oh no, I mean,

721
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:55.650
I mean, I mean, at least you have gotten into the worst arguments over our relationship out of the 12 years this last, you know, not this year. I mean, not this last year but like the first two years out of these four

722
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.360
was horrible. I mean, it literally almost broke us at times because we just do not see I die.

723
01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.220
I'm more of a

724
01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:12.000
I don't believe in spanking. And just one of the more laid back and

725
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:15.720
Understanding of like a teenager, being a teenager.

726
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.550
And

727
01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.900
She's a Nazi about, you know, the chore or

728
01:26:23.130 --> 01:26:26.490
You know, handling your business. Yeah, and

729
01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:41.730
It at first it was like, okay, you're just you're being a little harsh as a teenager, but now it's like okay, it's been four years, you're still not doing this, like, you're still not doing this right. We all we want is for her not to sleep during the day.

730
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:48.030
Katrina Gutierrez: To get out of the house, you know, have some friends, but this is her thing.

731
01:26:49.170 --> 01:27:02.520
Katrina Gutierrez: We don't let her have friends. We don't like her friends. Well, when your friends ditch school to go pull a runner at a store, bro. Yeah, no, you're not going to have those friends. I'm sorry. Don't pick

732
01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so maybe she doesn't know how to do it. What could she be doing that you guys would approve of because may just not be drawing unhealthy people we've tried to get her into habits. I mean not habits hobbies.

733
01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:26.160
We've tried everything together a hobby store we've, you know, had a Google stuff I've Google stuff with her. She's just like,

734
01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:41.640
She has no motivation or driver anything to want to do anything. And it's like, I don't know what that is. And I don't understand it. Because even at my worst I I still had that like

735
01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:47.790
Katrina Gutierrez: That voice outage, get up, get out of this bed, you know,

736
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:53.850
And I was at my bad days, and it's just I don't know.

737
01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:03.300
I swear it has to do with the, the abandonment issues and stuff and just not connecting with she doesn't have that mom thing.

738
01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:09.270
That mom trust relationship with anyone. I mean, I'm the closest one

739
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:18.900
Katrina Gutierrez: And I don't know if I ruin that because the first three months she was born after she was born for best and it was in my room. I was waiting for feeding her

740
01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:29.160
It wasn't so she had the RSV and she had like a cold on top of it this year, she had a yeah the respiratory infection and Nicole.

741
01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:33.570
And she was like blimp like two in the morning. It freaked me out.

742
01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:44.910
We go to the doctor and the emergency doctor said that if she had been she had RSV and then we brought her in. She would have made it through another hour

743
01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:51.930
And so after that. It's like, I don't know, made her mom realize, oh, wow. Maybe I should be doing this.

744
01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:54.090
And then

745
01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:58.320
I don't know if I took that connection from that bond hundred

746
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The bonding anybody doesn't have to be. I'm leaching connected doesn't have to be with the birth.

747
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.710
And the connection with me and her but

748
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:24.990
I mean, she's doing things that are just this should not be explained it, and I don't understand why, like when she was sick. She let her trash can get so full.

749
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.270
And then was

750
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:30.030
She was getting sick in dishes.

751
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:39.390
Katrina Gutierrez: That's not normal, like what the hell, she left her sickness on the floor there for two days. And even after she started to feel better after

752
01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:50.190
Katrina Gutierrez: The. NET a bitch no go clean it up. Jesus month that's just and I tried to be very nice about it because I didn't want to be like oh my god you're discussing. That's just wrong.

753
01:29:51.420 --> 01:30:00.570
So it's like baby. You can't do that. You even when you feel horrible. You gotta clean it up because you can make stuff more sick, you can't have that stuff just laying around that.

754
01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:09.570
And are you know when you have kids, you're not going to feel good. At times they get sick. You got cleaned up right away. You gotta gotta do it.

755
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:22.320
And I just don't understand how come. She's okay with like logically. What is what would make you think it's okay to vomit in a cup and then

756
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:24.360
Put it in the sink.

757
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:27.990
And let others like that's a bodily fluid, it's

758
01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:30.660
Not sentence.

759
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:34.350
You know, possibly drink out of it. Oh.

760
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:43.230
Yeah, man. He doesn't do dishes well at all. I mean I have to rewatch every dish that they wash, because

761
01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:51.000
There's stuff stuck to them they stink like it's just, it's too dangerous. It's too risky for me and

762
01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.900
She knows how bad it was delicious, especially in

763
01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:01.230
This story to me away and he is like his dad, it just

764
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.590
Is that says it's, it's just a man thing.

765
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:11.310
And I think, I think it's because it's dead point blank. But Matthew just too busy staring at his phone.

766
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.530
And

767
01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: He

768
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: She experienced some sort of developmental

769
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We say problem and has not kept pace with the current chronological age.

770
01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: For whatever reason, and there might be some some disordered eating. She might be spending money on something that will cause her to throw up could be any number of things. So she's purging and and for most people with that. There's so much shame. There's no way she's going to tell you

771
01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well what caught my attention was I was telling her the other night when she was eating and she said can go the bathroom. I was telling her right before that, before she was eating that if she needs to if she could start to pay attention, just to how much she's taking in because

772
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:25.500
I worry that maybe she's not realizing, and it may be. She's over you know over eating and

773
01:32:26.610 --> 01:32:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, so I know what you're registering is too much what's too much.

774
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:43.620
Like for burgers from McDonald's fries and then an ice cream and maybe her our, you know, half a bag of

775
01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.260
Chicken nuggets and fries.

776
01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.230
It's like four servings. I'm like,

777
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's much and she inhales it

778
01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: DOESN'T SHOE and when she does it.

779
01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:10.110
Katrina Gutierrez: Like my brother. She eats like my brother and as a baby. My mom used to have to pull the ball away from him because he would just eat it so fast. And then he gets sick. And then he'd be starving again screaming

780
01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:17.070
Katrina Gutierrez: Trinity did the same thing when she was a baby. I'd have to literally like just, you know, pull it away for a minute and let her get

781
01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:22.020
And I don't know what it is. If it's just them or like

782
01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with her therapist again.

783
01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some something's going on with that eating, it's, it's the same basically the same process as substance addiction it substance abuse because

784
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a solution for her. Something's going on underneath it.

785
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know how old it is. I mean, if you're really saying this happened in infancy.

786
01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to take some work. But if she could become conscious of it. Yes, that would be good, but this

787
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think as as you're giving out this evidence. Right. Do you think that that's probably what

788
01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: She's got some binge eating going on oh yeah I know she does it defeats in her email that she's eating like five times a day, while she's in school. Yeah, there's something going on. So why haven't you already reached out. What's your hesitation. Do not trust your own intuition.

789
01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I just

790
01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It just like barely started up again this is she wasn't doing that, like for a minute. There she wasn't eating anything. And she got really skinny and I thought she was like

791
01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:48.690
Crack

792
01:34:51.690 --> 01:35:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Belief that you just showed another sign of it. So there's it's you can control eating what you restrict or you over exercise or you use a laxative, or you induce vomiting.

793
01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's, it's all the same phenomenon. It's a disordered eating and I think she does need to see someone

794
01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:18.030
Katrina Gutierrez: Would that make sense to why she's so comfortable with moment like just

795
01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because I've seen like I seen a movie where this this girl was like growing up in jars and then hiding in closet and was totally okay with it. So,

796
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:38.430
Katrina Gutierrez: It might notice the other night when I was talking to her about like just paying attention. Maybe that she's taken too much in it. Maybe she needs to just realize like sit back and think in my fault.

797
01:35:39.630 --> 01:35:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: She had this look the shame. Look. Yeah. So in our work together.

798
01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Take about it.

799
01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I tell you

800
01:35:54.810 --> 01:35:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about how much

801
01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Math you're doing

802
01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is our focus on what's the unmet need

803
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

804
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the focus

805
01:36:13.230 --> 01:36:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the skill. So if you can't get her to on her solution. She's doing the best you can. Okay, she's a young woman. She's trying, she's not trying to inconvenience you to know it wasn't like that when I when I went

806
01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:42.510
Katrina Gutierrez: When I brought that up to her it wasn't like I was trying to go to that area. So I didn't even think of that. I thought maybe she was over eating and didn't realize it. And that's what was causing her to get sick like this later on. And then I was just trying to maybe

807
01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.350
Katrina Gutierrez: Figure out help her figure out

808
01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:54.330
Maybe she's overdoing because she didn't realize she was over drinking water. And that's what continue to make her stick for that long.

809
01:36:57.210 --> 01:37:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Okay, I'll put us on that water thing. But if this young woman has this phenomenon going on. This is a real condition and it can be life threatening. So I definitely recommend you get vegetables involved, but your part you're being able to come at it from a

810
01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We all are doing the best we can. We try and find solutions to help ourselves feel okay with ourselves to feel loved.

811
01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But we don't know. Maybe how to feel particular emotions like what do I do with it. I've got no modeling. What do I do, I can't go to can't go here. I can't go there. What can I go with these feelings of an adolescent. That's intense. Being an adolescent is hard, hard, hard

812
01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And we all we can control our eating. If you can go to the space of

813
01:37:46.890 --> 01:37:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What does eating do for you. What does it do for you, even though you know reasonable amount of food.

814
01:37:55.470 --> 01:38:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is is, is there something else we could be doing that would feel just as good and let's experiment with it. Well, that's what I told her last night, I said we're going to sit down and talk. You don't have to tell me anything that you don't want to

815
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:15.690
Katrina Gutierrez: We got at least sit down and you get it. Give me something, anything just a conversation

816
01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So Katrina was doing anything.

817
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.500
Trying to insert myself but not forth

818
01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you almost center to our moms and you really want this. But to the point I'm going to do, because what it's going to help over at moms.

819
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:41.340
This is really hard and my niece is really fragile in the sense of

820
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:45.420
You can't tell this kid.

821
01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:55.230
The slightest you know the slightest mean thing and not even mean just honestly truthful. Yeah.

822
01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:01.830
Katrina Gutierrez: Like I told her you got to get you got to find it in you. You got to pull it out of you get yourself out of bed.

823
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:09.720
Nobody can do it for you. And it looked like she was going to crumble. She wanted to throw away all the other night because it was greasy.

824
01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:22.440
She couldn't get the grease I when I said just put more so, and she like literally started like she was going to break. And she was like, and I was a calm down, it's a it's a little you've got this

825
01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:41.220
Katrina Gutierrez: It's the additional will get it more additional they clean, you know, birds that have all kinds of stuff from the ocean on oil. It'll come off. They clean the birds. They can clean the bowl will do it my shoulder like what to do. And she was just like

826
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:44.580
I'm like, why are you

827
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:54.030
Katrina Gutierrez: I will. I mean, I didn't say this part, I'm thinking to myself, why are you like ready to like just dropped to the ground and give up because a goal is

828
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:57.810
To go greasy and you rather just throw it away.

829
01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:06.570
Katrina Gutierrez: And I get understand, you know, kids don't want to clean necessarily so it's easy to throw it away, but

830
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:09.300
Katrina Gutierrez: The reaction I got was like

831
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:17.490
Katrina Gutierrez: Wow. If there's anything challenging in your life. I'm really worried because that was a dish.

832
01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I you're onto something there is something going on. So, but I heard you say is you're trying to protect Trinity for Elisa

833
01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:30.450
Well, no, it's just not it's not from only issue is that

834
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: At least it doesn't have a filter and she she tells it like it is. And Elisa is unfiltered words you're protecting Trinity from Alicia is on filters words you

835
01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:48.090
Katrina Gutierrez: Did one. Yeah. And I'm also protected from me because

836
01:40:49.350 --> 01:41:05.160
Katrina Gutierrez: I don't have patience for because I really don't. And I'm like, ready to lose my shit on her and I know there's something deep seated, there's something going on behavioral health wise, she's not not okay and I

837
01:41:05.970 --> 01:41:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to live with you, versus our moms, but it's what I asked her, and

838
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.780
She said she wanted to go

839
01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:19.440
But then she told me she wanted to stay because she won't be able to finish school and stuff. Yeah.

840
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:24.630
See you heard at least you have a more clear relationship of

841
01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:29.640
I don't know, it's just weird how

842
01:41:32.370 --> 01:41:35.580
Can I guess maybe that's when it's just try and protect me. And she, I don't know.

843
01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:38.130
Or

844
01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:49.200
I don't know. I mean, obviously she's going to look at least the a little differently because Lisa has been doing everything you know like an adult figure would

845
01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:51.630
Katrina Gutierrez: An apparent figure. So, of course,

846
01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.560
But when I'm worried about is that

847
01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:05.910
I mean everybody in this House is done with her there. So just flustered with her because she doesn't care. She doesn't respect people's stuff for boundaries.

848
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:10.920
She doesn't care to even clean up right to

849
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:15.060
Like show that she is thankful to be here.

850
01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.340
And it's like,

851
01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:23.910
Katrina Gutierrez: I love the next thing that we can do is either throw router beater, and I don't want to do either one of those

852
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:26.100
Katrina Gutierrez: So I wouldn't

853
01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Hurt being thankful to be there, that that's an uncomfortable thing look

854
01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you're not asking for advice, and it's unsolicited but I would get her to a professional if you make it about you and making sure that she hears you that you're doing everything that you feel that you may want to just back off a little bit. Take the pressure off yourself because

855
01:42:57.570 --> 01:43:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Eating disorders are really difficult to treat.

856
01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not gonna be able to do this on your own.

857
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:12.090
Katrina Gutierrez: I don't want to do it. I feel like I shouldn't have to do it, and her mom is literally

858
01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.360
You know, doing whatever she wants. And

859
01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:28.410
Katrina Gutierrez: This is her mom's job her mom needs to be doing this for her and helping her through it. I can't do it. I don't know how I'm scared. I'm going to say the wrong thing I'm going to do the wrong thing and if I just step back

860
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:45.210
Katrina Gutierrez: It could get worse, or it can get better. But either way, everybody in the house is still done, they don't want her here because of the way she acts and I mean showing appreciation like being hairs just doing what they asked like don't eat your room.

861
01:43:46.410 --> 01:43:57.090
It's a respect thing, you know. She smoked in the house the other day because we didn't allow her to go outside because she kept leaving the door unlocked all night long and we live across from a ditch.

862
01:43:58.470 --> 01:44:03.990
And so her punishment was, you can't go outside after dark smoke. You're done for the night.

863
01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:08.160
She decided she was gonna smoke in her room. That doesn't even have a window.

864
01:44:10.050 --> 01:44:12.150
That's that's like where she's that she just

865
01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:15.270
Is either she doesn't care or she

866
01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't I think there's two things going on there some sort of developmental

867
01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Delay going on at night and I mean from up from a some sort of deprivation in in her development. Okay, whether it's trauma, whether it's whatever, you know, not just a little bit of everything. Okay. Um, but, but you're my client Katrina and

868
01:44:42.690 --> 01:44:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I want for you to have peace of mind. I want for you to be keeping in mind, you know, preserving recovery and protecting it at all costs.

869
01:44:53.610 --> 01:44:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you're getting to the point where

870
01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to get a little bit of space and it's time for critical over there.

871
01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. You were there for Trinity, a long time and a lot. There's nothing to feel bad about this might just be time you need a break. You don't have to spend time thinking I'm a bad person for doing it.

872
01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know what's going to happen over there. None of us are God. We don't know.

873
01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Something might click something she sees with her mother, maybe not. It might get worse. It's still not your fault. None of it's your fault. It was never your promise to raise this child. You did not give birth to it.

874
01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've taken that on huge

875
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have missed out on time to do you

876
01:45:48.090 --> 01:45:48.720
Rather than

877
01:45:51.630 --> 01:45:57.540
My spiritual path just mean recovery that's been put on a whole

878
01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: knock on my door.

879
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: At the same time,

880
01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now you know you, you're, you're talking about something that is pretty important. How do you see I could offer help. Was this helpful to get it off your chest. Yeah.

881
01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:52.200
Katrina Gutierrez: You know, I think it was helpful to get it off and earlier I told myself the same thing that if it's time for her to go. It's time for her to go I

882
01:46:53.130 --> 01:47:09.870
Katrina Gutierrez: I'm not doing anything wrong. I deserve a break. If I need a break because of my own sanity is at risk, then maybe this was best because obviously it's not going to be bit. Good for her or me. I'm not going to be best for her and

883
01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:18.540
Maybe, like you said, maybe something will click maybe her mom can get through to her. I don't know, but it's not

884
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:21.420
I can't worry about the future.

885
01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:26.160
When the moment I mean isn't even like

886
01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:29.250
Feeling right ladies, I just got to get

887
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:36.330
His trust and just go with what I feel is right and I think she should she should go. I'm going to ask her.

888
01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:41.280
Because I think she wants to go.

889
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:47.070
I think it's too hard for her hair. I think I don't think she's built for it.

890
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.880
And

891
01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:54.990
It's not right because I look at it is

892
01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:00.750
I mean, I just see you know fight in her known me. She's just

893
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:02.130
So,

894
01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:12.180
You know, beat down. She's it's hard to even be mad at that for not having willpower strength or anything. Just motivation.

895
01:48:13.890 --> 01:48:14.340
And I

896
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.940
It hurts, because I know she wants it. She has it somewhere. It's just

897
01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:24.150
She can't find it, or something. I don't

898
01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.000
Know there's something seriously wrong.

899
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

900
01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

901
01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I continue to encourage the idea of getting someone who can offer her some information around if there is some binge eating just addressing their relationship with food and control.

902
01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a professional can do that. And that's not your responsibility. That's someone else and maybe get that in place.

903
01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and then also talking with her about

904
01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Your truth.

905
01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, finding out what she wants.

906
01:49:08.010 --> 01:49:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might be an evolution. You go there and we see how it goes. Let's see if you like it better. Let's see if you like yourself better. Let's see if something positive happens

907
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we've been trying it this way and not seeing. I mean, I'm assuming Trinity. You don't really like what's going on in your life. So let's try something else. See if it works for you.

908
01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then let's talk. Let's talk every month and see if it's getting better. And we'll take it from there.

909
01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, just, it's just a little experiment. Yeah, that's what I was planning on doing tonight when we talk to this.

910
01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:49.500
Just seeing what she wanted. And seeing like maybe might be best for both of us. Yeah. In the whole situation in general because

911
01:49:50.970 --> 01:49:54.000
The kind of environment that she's created for herself.

912
01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.510
And relationships with others in the house. It is is not healthy for for her.

913
01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:02.340
And

914
01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:06.870
There are some of the other people in the house. Don't

915
01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.240
see eye to eye with

916
01:50:10.590 --> 01:50:12.930
Maybe what's that there's something deeper

917
01:50:14.610 --> 01:50:18.360
And I don't want it to become any more.

918
01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.930
Katrina Gutierrez: traumatic for her. I don't want any more things to happen to her mental health.

919
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:29.250
Because somebody doesn't understand necessarily or

920
01:50:30.570 --> 01:50:30.900
Getting

921
01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:33.900
Feel bad or

922
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Katrina, we look at another time to meet. Do you want to meet next week, or wait two weeks. What do you want to do.

923
01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.900
Katrina Gutierrez: Whatever, whatever works for you. I'm good. Either way,

924
01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you're if you're really busy. Next week we can do in two weeks, if not then I'll take whatever you get well we're

925
01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, we got a little off track. But we were working on before I wouldn't mind returning to some of the sort of that processing that I think that it's really good to know. How about we meet on Wednesday, February 12 at about 1210

926
01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.800
Well, yeah.

927
01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:24.150
Okay.

928
01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

929
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Deep breath, you know,

930
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna be okay. No, it's gonna be okay. The solutions there. It's just maybe we need a little more information we need more professionals, you may need a break. Let's switch it up just take that pressure off gonna be okay.

931
01:51:51.150 --> 01:51:53.430
Me. I knew it wasn't gonna be up with a teenager.

932
01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: On it.

933
01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:59.400
Life now prior to this, did she did so.

934
01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:04.830
Katrina Gutierrez: She's, she's better than she. You know, you would imagine.

935
01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To spend some time in the next little bit kind of doing some meditation around peace and sort of getting centered with the I'm okay. I'm doing the best I can. I'm not in control of this. I'm not in the ultimate control. I have good intentions.

936
01:52:23.010 --> 01:52:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of do a little meditation around that. Okay.

937
01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, my dear. I will see you Thursday.

938
01:52:31.170 --> 01:52:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right for group. Yep. Excellent. I'll see you then I'd be curious to know if you want to share a little bit about the status of right okay yeah

939
01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi Nicole.

Nicole Bacon: I'm in Albuquerque it Ortiz house.

Nicole Bacon: It's the House on Ortiz is it's my mom, my dad's house and

01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Anybody there now.

01:53:10.830 --> 01:53:11.910
Nicole Bacon: Is my kitty cat.

947
01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we we still need a little bit more clarification. Okay, we got to talk a little bit so we, let's just talk about the behavior contract, you and I went over it on Wednesday.

948
01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday. Wednesday. Wednesday is the 29th.

949
01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And

950
01:53:34.410 --> 01:53:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember that you were to attend 11am on Thursday.

951
01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:48.330
Nicole Bacon: Yes, and I was told that I couldn't go to group, unless I peed in my cup and

952
01:53:50.370 --> 01:53:53.220
Nicole Bacon: I one of the bright

953
01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:58.950
Nicole Bacon: Heart Health people and I called

954
01:53:59.970 --> 01:54:10.590
Nicole Bacon: They didn't fax it over. I had to, I call them late last night at like 130 add a column, they still didn't do it. I had a column, like just

955
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.410
Nicole Bacon: A couple hours ago. I know.

956
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot that followed that this is this is all I want to talk about for just a second.

957
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There was so much at stake for Thursday. I don't want to go into any other days.

958
01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to understand how I'm sitting here with no note in my record. No one being able to tell me that Nicole was trying to enter group I'm sitting here going,

959
01:54:36.450 --> 01:54:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole's not interested in treatment anymore. Right. I'm blind.

960
01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I get a text from you out of the blue about today because your regular route was Monday. So I'm completely blown away right now so I

961
01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to gather information. And so it would be nice if I could get something from my care navigators to tell me about last Thursday and I can't find it.

962
01:54:59.190 --> 01:55:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Will do you know if you talk to anyone you recognize, like if I said a name ICO or

963
01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Christina. Oh, okay. Christina. Let me see if we've got one because it's a start. And I could do a little detective work.

964
01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:15.300
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

965
01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, I'm glad you're here. Okay. Because I was scared. I thought you'd given up.

966
01:55:23.370 --> 01:55:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The one piece that is missing. Regardless, would have been a message to me that day saying I can't go to group. They're not letting me in.

967
01:55:32.130 --> 01:55:32.730
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

968
01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: See that

969
01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:34.800
Nicole Bacon: You know,

970
01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people do that they have myself. You can say, man, I'm here, I'm knocking on the door. They're not letting me in. Because I need to do this, this lab work. I'm going to go over here and go get it done.

971
01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So that part was missing that one. If you can let that in, you know, you have your therapist direct line.

972
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:55.140
Okay, okay.

973
01:55:56.190 --> 01:56:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit on that date and see if I can see anything so name sounds familiar, it's not a Janie, though, right.

974
01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.080
Nicole Bacon: No, no, she has like an accident.

975
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:08.970
Katrina.

976
01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:20.310
Nicole Bacon: Pretty sure is Christina. But if that's the closest and let me keep looking. I don't. I'm trying to see if there's any days on these notes this particular databases.

977
01:56:22.290 --> 01:56:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: All know that also yesterday. That's why, who has a lot of notes. Oh boy. Okay, there's Friday 31 we're getting closer. Okay, so up. I just saw I just saw 30 go by. We skipped down

978
01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the 30th, Chris. No, no, nevermind.

979
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:41.970
Yeah.

980
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, what are we looking at your. Now, I don't know what the time is when there's so many time zones. I never know if this is Pacific

981
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:53.640
Let's see who

982
01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Gets it gets Mountain Standard, maybe. Mm hmm.

983
01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.930
Jamie. Jamie

984
01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:17.760
Nicole Bacon: I talked to, like, three or four different people along the way. And for some reason, when I when I call I have to call through an actual app to bright health

985
01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:25.890
Nicole Bacon: Right heart because it's so actually, it's the connections messed up. But basically took

986
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:32.160
Nicole Bacon: A while to get their request facts to the labs, even though they told me it was going to be there.

987
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:42.690
Nicole Bacon: Because they had an issue last time. So I called and I'm like, is it there. They're like, No. And so I asked for them to be send it. They didn't we send it for a couple days. I should have been in contact with you about that.

988
01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, one more thing to also keep in mind this is something from from the doctor, which is

989
01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so easy to get on regurgitating it so. Don't shoot the messenger. It's so easy to get a referral from break hard don't leave the lab.

990
01:57:57.390 --> 01:58:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Call Brian hard while you're at the lab. She keeps saying the same thing. Don't leave the lab, it's not there, they're frozen out there don't leave the lab. She says the same thing over and over, don't leave don't leave, it's so easy to get that referral over

991
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So my eye right now what I'm doing is I'm looking for a Christina's picture and then I'm going to show you a little picture and see if you're like yeah that was her

992
01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:27.300
Nicole Bacon: It was through the phone.

993
01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:36.600
Nicole Bacon: Not video. Oh, okay. Christina through the phone. Okay.

994
01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I look in a different database. What do I look QuickBooks.

995
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.270
Nicole Bacon: Either different people on the phone versus video

996
01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no idea.

997
01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:48.060
Nicole Bacon: Okay, I

998
01:58:48.150 --> 01:58:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's starting to seem like it.

999
01:58:51.330 --> 01:58:51.750
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

1000
01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.730

Like to see some notes.

1005
02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, I will have to come back to this. What I'll do is I will assume

1006
02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:11.640
Nicole Bacon: Oh, now I'm remembering

1007
02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:25.470
Nicole Bacon: Okay, it might have been a Jamie, I talked to a couple of different people. But I think the specific person that said, I can't

1008
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.370
Nicole Bacon: Go to a group until I go

1009
02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:36.900
Nicole Bacon: To the lab. I think might be in Jamie, I don't know. She always wears her hair in a ponytail.

1010
02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:41.940
Nicole Bacon: Caucasian brown hair. I am not, I'm not positive.

1011
02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:44.730

This is on the 30th. I don't see anything.

02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:58.140

Nicole Bacon: Know somewhere else it when I checked in.

1018

Gwenevere Abriel: Person. Hold on a second. I need to

1020
02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:18.750

Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds a bit like that word that name, you were using before.

1032
02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:10.890
Nicole Bacon: Yeah i don't i talked. I feel like I talked to a Christina. That's that had some type of accident, maybe Asian or something.

1033
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:18.240
Nicole Bacon: On the phone, but through virtual clinic. I was like a

1034
02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:32.520
Nicole Bacon: She doesn't wear makeup just pale skin like like paler skin and dark brown hair that she puts in a ponytail. That's remember it might be her. I don't know. People that complete different with makeup.

1035
02:02:33.150 --> 02:02:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know, I know, and pictures we can mess with them.

1036
02:02:41.190 --> 02:02:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Katrina Katrina grow.

1037
02:02:43.890 --> 02:02:44.790
Nicole Bacon: So Craig.

02:02:45.450 --> 02:02:46.260
Nicole Bacon: Might have been

02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Bred also

1040
02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So Chris,

1041
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:52.020
Nicole Bacon: Maybe

1042
02:02:52.710 --> 02:02:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I see your face.

1043
02:02:55.980 --> 02:03:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, okay. So ultimately, something broke down in in record keeping. So I'm going to put a pin in that

1044
02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I do want you to stay in this program, I do want it to work for you, but I had already kind of like said goodbye. So I'm having to really make a shift right now. That's what you're

1045
02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:19.380
Nicole Bacon: Right, I understand and awesome

1046
02:03:19.410 --> 02:03:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to stop trying there because I'm hitting a wall. Let's go to work, clinical stuff now.

1047
02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go over to this idea of. Have you talked with your, your new partner is the one where you're going to travel around the state and do some shopping and I'm assuming it's like beads or something. What are you actually going to be

1048
02:03:41.550 --> 02:03:50.070
Nicole Bacon: I'm just jewelry jewelry making and yeah, we've been in contact every day. And so

1049
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:57.840
Nicole Bacon: It feels good. It feels good. She knows I'm in

1050
02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:14.220
Nicole Bacon: This program and just kind of taking baby steps because, you know, I need to be in this program and get balanced and then talk to my probation officer to see if I can even

1051
02:04:15.810 --> 02:04:21.270
Nicole Bacon: fly out to Hawaii to help her for a month and come back, or how that works or

1052
02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:28.710
Nicole Bacon: If I'm balance and it feel good. She wants to hire me as your business partner so

1053
02:04:31.050 --> 02:04:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And you will

1054
02:04:31.650 --> 02:04:45.060
Nicole Bacon: Have to come back and forth, then they'll be what happens, but I'm also looking at maybe moving probation over there, but I need to get bounds first. Okay, so

1055
02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, all of that. If you end up in residential treatment. All of that's just going to be

1056
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:52.200
Nicole Bacon: Great.

1057
02:04:52.770 --> 02:04:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let me get

1058
02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:56.910
No, that's fine.

1059
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

1060
02:05:07.110 --> 02:05:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just take a look at this together and see, see what you see will assess it to share okay right in here. This is what we were kind of saying is the behavior contact. So a debt attend individual therapy at least twice a week over the next 30 days. So you're here today.

1061
02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been a blip, and we're trying to uncover what happened with the group that's once a week. So we're going to put that aside for a second because you're here today. You did try to confirm with me trying to communicate.

1062
02:05:41.130 --> 02:05:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: With the improvement there might just be if something goes sideways. There's so much at stake.

1063
02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't afford to have me thinking. You didn't show up. You see it.

1064
02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right at you thought bright heart had better communication, it doesn't

1065
02:05:56.250 --> 02:06:08.340
Nicole Bacon: I thought it. I thought so. Yeah. Cuz I'm like, if she's telling me like not to come into group. Yeah. Then I'm going to listen, but I didn't know you guys weren't talking about that.

1066
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

1067
02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:11.670
Nicole Bacon: Just assume

1068
02:06:11.970 --> 02:06:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: They haven't told me

1069
02:06:13.710 --> 02:06:14.160
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

1070
02:06:14.730 --> 02:06:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They have so much going on.

1071
02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So right so you what the thinking I think recommended here is there's so much at stake, I need to, no matter what message when

1072
02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't write you back. Well, that's fine. But at least you did your part, maybe send an email and

1073
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or even say to people, wherever you go, like, make sure you please message when let her know I'm here, I'm trying to I'm on a behavior contract, like there's so much at stake here like put fire under there, but a little

1074
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and directly messaged me. That's fine. Okay, so let's go here after no later than five minutes past the hour. It'll be considered a no show. So you really want to be there early

1075
02:06:54.390 --> 02:07:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to text call email your therapist if you're experiencing continued anxiety, guilt, depression, anger, other intruding psychiatric emotional issues. So why don't we get into that a little bit we last met almost a week ago.

1076
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What has it been like for you. How intense has anxiety or depression or fear what. What's that been like

1077
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:21.300
Nicole Bacon: I'm

1078
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:26.820
Nicole Bacon: Dealing with fear. I feel like fears been a major

1079
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:53.490
Nicole Bacon: Major thing and then leads to anxiety and it's mostly I realized I get ahead of myself. And then that's where the depression. That's where the fear and anxiety. It's not me, it's me not being comfortable in my present moment, cuz I'm kind of feeling not so

1080
02:07:54.570 --> 02:07:58.230
Nicole Bacon: Comfortable in my body, not so balanced on medication.

1081
02:07:59.130 --> 02:08:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's start there. So I heard you saying you're getting ahead of yourself and then it causes anxiety and a lot happens so

1082
02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm how many milligrams. Are you on and for how many days at this point.

1083
02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:16.710
Nicole Bacon: four milligrams for

1084
02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.460
Nicole Bacon: So weeks.

1085
02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.000
Nicole Bacon: So bye week. Yeah.

1086
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what symptoms are you presenting with

02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:43.620
Nicole Bacon: A little bit of shaky leg at night, a little sweaty at night shaky.

02:08:58.290 --> 02:09:00.030
Nicole Bacon: Out in public. Yeah.

1094
02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you, attributing that to maybe more psychological

1095
02:09:11.490 --> 02:09:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Style. I'm going to just push that one off a little bit, just going to stick here with this one I'm going to look at the restless leg and the sweaty about. What time of night is that kicking in.

1096
02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.070
Nicole Bacon: About

1097
02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:34.650
Nicole Bacon: I would say AROUND LIKE THREE, ISH.

1098
02:09:35.490 --> 02:09:41.280
Nicole Bacon: 3am yeah and then I wake up a couple more times after that usually

1099
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and on a scale of zero to 10 how distressing is just the restless leg part

1100
02:09:52.170 --> 02:09:55.380
Nicole Bacon: Um, my for, I guess,

1101
02:09:56.730 --> 02:09:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And the sweaty now know

1102
02:09:59.670 --> 02:10:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Going into full withdrawal. In the past, that's a 10. That's the worst of the sweats, this one at night at about 3am. What's it like

1103
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:09.570

Gwenevere Abriel: Over the last couple days. Okay, um,

1110
02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what is stable, let's let's cover big domains of life. Let me just kind of get a sense of things there.

1111
02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Residents you have been in various residences.

1112
02:10:54.750 --> 02:11:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: My concern with when you were the last time I had seen you, was in Santa Fe, and I was quite concerned, there was the storyline, you know, around Christmas and being alone and just this just, I was like, oh, and G.

1113
02:11:13.050 --> 02:11:14.010
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I'm

1114
02:11:14.070 --> 02:11:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Really worried about you.

1115
02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you actually living

1116
02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:26.700
Nicole Bacon: In Albuquerque at the townhome and I've been mostly here.

1117
02:11:29.370 --> 02:11:32.220
Nicole Bacon: I haven't been taking trips to Santa Fe that much.

1118
02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:39.030
Nicole Bacon: I hadn't gone for like couple weeks until the last time I talked to

1119
02:11:40.530 --> 02:11:50.280
Nicole Bacon: So this is stable here for me. I have my cat that that's kind of new ish and she's a good, a good little buddy for me.

1120
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So whose cat is it. Where does this cat come from.

1121
02:11:53.190 --> 02:11:54.030
Nicole Bacon: It's my cat.

1122
02:11:55.170 --> 02:11:55.950
Nicole Bacon: But she

1123
02:11:56.610 --> 02:11:59.430
Nicole Bacon: Used to live at my parents house. Yeah.

1124
02:12:00.450 --> 02:12:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is okay. What's your cat's name.

1125
02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Bear and it's okay that bears there everyone's on the same page.

1126
02:12:09.450 --> 02:12:09.810
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

1127
02:12:10.410 --> 02:12:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How often are you eating.

1128
02:12:13.950 --> 02:12:16.080
Nicole Bacon: I should be eating more often.

1129
02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:20.760
Nicole Bacon: I'm out of food stamps and

1130
02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:26.460
Nicole Bacon: I have food. I have some food to make but I

1131
02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:30.240
Nicole Bacon: I could be eating better. Okay.

1132
02:12:30.570 --> 02:12:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And what is the, is it because oh I, you know, we need to get back on point with following through with food stamps, for example.

1133
02:12:39.330 --> 02:12:43.440
Nicole Bacon: I have food stamps. It's just I ran out for the month. Okay.

1134
02:12:43.890 --> 02:12:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you think the real crux of it is with the eating. What do you think the problem is

1135
02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:52.770
Nicole Bacon: I'm

1136
02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:55.740
Nicole Bacon: running out of food stamps. I don't know.

1137
02:12:56.700 --> 02:13:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you use them quickly. Like did you give them away.

1138
02:13:00.810 --> 02:13:01.830
Nicole Bacon: Did you know no

1139
02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:05.460
Nicole Bacon: I usually honestly they usually run out.

1140
02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:20.280
Nicole Bacon: Like a week before like I have a week usually where I don't I run out. Usually the funnel. I'm gonna have to do better shopping with the food stamps like go to Trader Joe's instead

1141
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're. Are you going to Whole Foods or something expensive for them.

1142
02:13:24.450 --> 02:13:26.130
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, just because it's right there.

1143
02:13:27.450 --> 02:13:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. So the more frugal maybe with it.

1144
02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:30.660
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

1145
02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Mix it up. So hopefully, so maybe creating a budget on there. Okay, and let's talk a little bit about we know about career you've kind of identified and and it does kind of surprise me.

1146
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That this was new information to you that you don't like touching haired from out here. It does sound conflicting you've touched tear you've enjoyed

1147
02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking care of one of your friend's daughter's hair and I never heard anything about I don't like touching here what what's new about this.

1148
02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:16.980
Nicole Bacon: Not like they don't like touching the hair is is just, it's overwhelming. For me, it's a trigger. It's definitely a trigger. I feel like I need to get high to touch people

1149
02:14:18.690 --> 02:14:30.870
Nicole Bacon: Strangers. And then I have this Magellan in his skin parasite disease that I'm dealing with. So my skin is still healing and

1150
02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:41.970
Nicole Bacon: I don't feel like I could hold space for people doing their hair when my skin is looking bad and I'm not feeling presentable.

1151
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this around that self esteem stuff like I don't stop. Are we getting close to it there.

1152
02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:55.770
Nicole Bacon: Um, it's an actual physical a parasite that I'm dealing with. Yeah.

1153
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:59.520
Nicole Bacon: So effects that yes effects myself as being

1154
02:15:06.810 --> 02:15:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. And what medication you taking to treat it.

1155
02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:14.010
Nicole Bacon: I'm on antibiotics.

1156
02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: WHERE DID. WHERE DID.

1157
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did they suspect

1158
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:22.470
Nicole Bacon: It honestly they told me it was in my head.

1159
02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.790
Nicole Bacon: But still gave me antibiotics.

1160
02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:28.770
Okay.

1161
02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That is confusing.

1162
02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:32.400
Yeah.

1163
02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:42.480
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it's a it's a weird one. It's a weird one that doctors don't like to accept that it's a real thing.

1164
02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you spell it.

02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:59.040

1206
02:20:01.350 --> 02:20:03.510
Nicole Bacon: Fit into my life and

1207
02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:11.070
Nicole Bacon: feeling safe and good in that way, seeing how it can work out. Yeah.

1208
02:20:14.910 --> 02:20:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And how much sleep. Are you getting at night.

1209
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:19.380
Nicole Bacon: Um,

1210
02:20:20.490 --> 02:20:29.580
Nicole Bacon: The last couple nights have been way better. Like, I'm actually dreaming again. I hadn't been dreaming for a long time.

1211
02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:34.560
Nicole Bacon: So last couple nights have been good.

1212
02:20:37.980 --> 02:20:49.680
Nicole Bacon: Sometimes I don't get to bed, till two but I'm trying to start to lay down by, like, midnight. At least I'm trying to get on a schedule trying to go on a schedule because

1213
02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:59.280
Nicole Bacon: I always the day away if I don't do that. It's hard to implement that after not having that and just doing whatever I want.

1214
02:21:00.690 --> 02:21:02.280
Nicole Bacon: And that's not how I want to

1215
02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:06.420
Nicole Bacon: Continue my life I want to get stuff done, and

1216
02:21:08.010 --> 02:21:11.550
Nicole Bacon: Have a schedule, you know, not necessarily a schedule but like

1217
02:21:15.330 --> 02:21:16.230
Nicole Bacon: get stuff done.

1218
02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1219
02:21:20.970 --> 02:21:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So in general, people right we

1220
02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We will wait to the last minute to get something done if we don't have a set deadline.

1221
02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how most people are. And for some people. This self regulation of getting a task done without someone pushing it and saying, well, you're going to lose this thing.

1222
02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't get it done without those constraints, it's difficult for people to follow through.

1223
02:21:51.690 --> 02:22:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice, like in your language just now. You're like, boy, I know I need to schedule, but I can tell you don't really want one. But there's a part that you don't want to waste your day. And so you're kind of stuck with nobody's asking you to have a schedule.

1224
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:06.360
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

1225
02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:12.750
Nicole Bacon: I feel like I'm like learning how to self talk to myself again.

1226
02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:29.580
Nicole Bacon: Of being like okay, I'm going to do this and then Dutta duh. And then our did it up like I haven't. I hadn't I lost that I lost that self talk for a long time. And so I feel like that helps

1227
02:22:31.350 --> 02:22:32.400
Nicole Bacon: That helps me

1228
02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:46.560
Nicole Bacon: stay on task or like do goals that I'm trying to do, you know, right now there's simple and I'm just trying to balance out and be careful with myself.

1229
02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just

1230
02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just find out because what I just said was without a constraint. Most people will waste a day away.

1231
02:22:57.750 --> 02:23:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Will spark rain will say, just do it later. There's no one watching

1232
02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Shane nothing. And I happen.

1233
02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's most people. So you're saying that self talk alone because you've been able to talk to yourself for months and years.

1234
02:23:11.130 --> 02:23:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. How is that going to motivate you. How is yourself talking to actually be a constraint. How does that work doesn't work for most people. How can it work for you.

1235
02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:22.380
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, no, I mean, I'm

1236
02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:34.650
Nicole Bacon: I haven't implemented it okay for a while. But the real fire under My ass is Barbie, honestly.

1237
02:23:36.330 --> 02:23:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see where it actually exists RV is a person there.

1238
02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually is a metaphor. So what is she actually providing that is a timeline that is a real expectation what's real.

1239
02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:54.810
Nicole Bacon: Yes, what's real.

1240
02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Constraint. What is she actually expecting

1241
02:23:59.010 --> 02:24:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What is she asking for

1242
02:24:03.450 --> 02:24:04.080
Nicole Bacon: I'm

1243
02:24:06.450 --> 02:24:06.990
Nicole Bacon: Kind of

1244
02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:11.610
Nicole Bacon: I mean she wants me to be her business partner so I

1245
02:24:14.250 --> 02:24:37.920
Nicole Bacon: We talked about like different things that I can make or helper do she wants me to go visit Hawaii. And I want to heal my skin and and feel good before I can go out there, if I can even go up there. So she's asking me if I can like go visit her and see if it's going to work out.

1246
02:24:39.450 --> 02:24:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty big. Let me see if I caught some things that are tangible, though.

1247
02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a business partner, which if you went into more depth about that there for some businesses, there would be a long list of things.

1248
02:24:55.350 --> 02:25:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Administrative things that would be required, as far as your obligation. The tasks and responsibilities that you'd be taking on that you could be learning right now.

1249
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: She could be saying, I want you to do this, this, this, and this, that might structure your day. I didn't hear it. I heard a little bit, let me see if I cut picked up on some I've heard

1250
02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: business partner things I can make what is she talking about

1251
02:25:23.010 --> 02:25:31.170
Nicole Bacon: As well, jewelry, different, different ideas things she's working on. She's gonna send me

1252
02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:35.130
Nicole Bacon: A couple for pieces. She's made

1253
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:40.260
Nicole Bacon: I might set up a booth this Saturday.

1254
02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:43.050
Nicole Bacon: There's a pop up shop.

1257
02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:02.280
Nicole Bacon: I might do that and see how her stuff sells

1258
02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:07.590
Nicole Bacon: Okay, mostly. I've been a consultant. The last week.

1259
02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:11.670
Nicole Bacon: One of her asking me ideas of like

Nicole Bacon: will sell in the southwest and

1262
02:26:18.990 --> 02:26:33.780
Nicole Bacon: She's kind of a scatterbrained so it's, there's going to be different things that are sold in the gallery different things sold on Etsy. Different things sold on the website. If anything, sold in stores. So just kind of

1263
02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:40.410
Nicole Bacon: Gathering information and trying to ground. What makes sense.

1264
02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so consult

1265
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:45.000

02:26:46.770 --> 02:26:47.100
Yeah.

1267
02:26:48.750 --> 02:27:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. You're consulting about what you know about, which is what you think would sell well in Santa Fe. Are you also offering information on what would sell on Etsy and which pieces to sort of focus on on the different platforms.

1268
02:27:06.270 --> 02:27:16.110
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and I made a list of, like, three stores, each in here house and Santa Fe of

1269
02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:24.030
Nicole Bacon: If she could approach them like stores that might like to sell her jewelry.

1270
02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's talk about Saturday that offers a real notice that Saturday's right around the corner. That's an actual deadline.

1271
02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, set up a booth this Saturday. So it's her stuff. Is there something that you've been tasked with doing to set up that both

1272
02:27:48.450 --> 02:28:00.150
Nicole Bacon: Um, I have to check in with her and see she she was making. She didn't have inventory. So I don't know if it's gonna work out but I'm hoping to

1273
02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:13.020
Nicole Bacon: Sew some shelves that I can sell of my own stuff because she she's open to me selling making whatever and selling my stuff through her platform as well.

1274
02:28:16.770 --> 02:28:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

1275
02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: She scattered

1276
02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:23.370
Nicole Bacon: Scattered

1277
02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:28.620
Nicole Bacon: really crazy peaches.

1278
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And that might be fun. That might be fun, where everything is just whatever comes up next. That's the new inspiration.

1279
02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You may end up finding that not much gets done with just that alone, it might be fun in the moment like fun to brainstorm and just be creative and like on to the next thing, and just really connecting with each other.

1280
02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But a business that's different than word business is a different

1281
02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:02.040
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, no, I already talked to her about this because I'm like, girl.

1282
02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:10.110
Nicole Bacon: I'm going to have to grab help you ground these like ideas because they're all over the place. I, what are you focusing on right now.

1283
02:29:11.250 --> 02:29:20.100
Nicole Bacon: Like, and I told her, like I had to put a boundary of yesterday because she she read my text wrong.

1284
02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:30.480
Nicole Bacon: And she thought I was having like a meltdown. When I was actually saying, I need to clean this mess like messy house and

1285
02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:41.790
Nicole Bacon: Instead, she thought I said I'm a mess or something like that. And so she was calling me over and over again. And I can't do that and I and my girl, I, I can't

1286
02:29:42.420 --> 02:30:00.720
Nicole Bacon: That boundary really triggers me when people call me over and over again. Or if I'm not replying with a text and you keep texting and texting texting this idea, this idea that, like, I can't do that. So we're trying to figure out how to communicate with each other in a respectful way.

1287
02:30:01.170 --> 02:30:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your idea.

1288
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: For solution.

1289
02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:20.910
Nicole Bacon: I thought that we could have a set time of the day that we can call and talk to each other. And if if one of us is not texting each other back just write an email, and especially if it's

1290
02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:29.700
Nicole Bacon: AT NIGHT LIKE LATE AT NIGHT. IF SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE YOUR express write an email. Okay.

1291
02:30:30.450 --> 02:30:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's amenable to that.

1292
02:30:32.130 --> 02:30:32.550
Mm hmm.

1293
02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And just curious, and we were going to come to a close here shortly, but

1294
02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it the

1295
02:30:44.190 --> 02:30:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: SMS pressure of TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT that's the trigger or is it

1296
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The content of it. Like, I can't, I can't quite

1297
02:30:54.330 --> 02:30:59.640
Nicole Bacon: I'm not use I'm not used to talking to the same person every day.

1298
02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:02.520
Nicole Bacon: I haven't been

1299
02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:09.750
Nicole Bacon: So it's, it's a lot more communication than I'm used to. Okay.

1300
02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:16.560
Nicole Bacon: I mean, I live. I had a roommate, a while back that

1301
02:31:18.090 --> 02:31:25.950
Nicole Bacon: Would text me everything that came into her head, and I was kind of afraid that it was starting to go that way. But I think it's

1302
02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:46.020
Nicole Bacon: Like I haven't talked to her at all today because she told me she needed to get work done. So I was hoping that it was just like we're reconnecting or sharing ideas and excitement. Yeah, and that it would chill out and it has like I haven't talked to her today so

1303
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You realize that was setting a boundary. That was smart. Yeah, that's also very consistent with an efficient way to spend time we put all of the brainstorming during a meeting.

1304
02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This is our business meeting. This is when the set time we can hold off and and we have time to also think through, is this really something that I want to bring up we can be kind of prudent with the time

1305
02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:11.460
Nicole Bacon: Right. Right. Yeah, that was that was smart.

1306
02:32:13.050 --> 02:32:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be right out the okay the day or Singing I'm I'm I'm

1307
02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Set it for another 10 minutes. Thank you.

1308
02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I hopefully won't burn the food. I'll say.

1309
02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, don't take it out. No, no.

1310
02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1311
02:32:50.850 --> 02:32:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want to keep today light and fluffy. So I'm just going to kind of leave it there. All right.

1312
02:32:55.620 --> 02:32:56.010
Okay.

1313
02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'll do a little more investigation. Oh, I know what, actually let's. This is pretty important. Let's do this. What is the name of the agency that your PO referred you to an Albuquerque.

1314
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.800
Nicole Bacon: Um, yeah.

1315
02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:27.540
Nicole Bacon: A new awakening.

1316
02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a residential level of care.

1317
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:36.180
Nicole Bacon: It's an outpatient, it's exactly what this is. So,

1318
02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:37.830
Nicole Bacon: I don't think God

1319
02:33:38.490 --> 02:33:41.730
Nicole Bacon: I don't think he got that, like I'm in a program

1320
02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

1321
02:33:44.370 --> 02:33:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Online is it Tele health

1322
02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:49.800
Nicole Bacon: No, it's in person and and

1323
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'd be getting the psychotherapy once a week or how whatever frequency, they

1324
02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:56.730
I mean,

1325
02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:58.980
Nicole Bacon: I think it'd be

1326
02:34:03.090 --> 02:34:04.320
Nicole Bacon: Over. Over.

1327
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:07.050
Nicole Bacon: Over doing it.

1328
02:34:08.490 --> 02:34:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

1329
02:34:10.830 --> 02:34:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, if

1330
02:34:15.150 --> 02:34:17.940
Nicole Bacon: They can't get medication twice. You know what I mean.

1331
02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I understand that you said before, was that it was a higher level of care who's more intense that they might offer three or four hours a day, three days a week, something like that. But that's not what they say.

1332
02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:35.040
Nicole Bacon: I guess I don't really know.

1333
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:37.500
Nicole Bacon: I guess I just have to go and see, honestly.

1334
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:40.800
Nicole Bacon: I don't know what these different terms are really

1335
02:34:41.370 --> 02:34:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fair.

1336
02:34:42.450 --> 02:34:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And the reason I'm asking is because

1337
02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to benefit from the additional services if you come to find out. Oh, looks like the self talk that you're relying on right now or the little bit of pressure from

1338
02:35:01.470 --> 02:35:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Becky, what the heck was her name.

1339
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.320
Nicole Bacon: Barbie. Thank you.

1340
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:05.670
From harpy.

1341
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If it doesn't cut it. If you can't rely on little bit of pressure from new new acquaintance new potential business friend and that you are enough to do this work.

1342
02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What a more intense level of care can do is put external sort of pressure and say you need to do this and you're fortunate you happen to have this probation that you're on which is definitely pressure

1343
02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you do it may be that your psyche right might end up going that for you may end up sort of what you would call self sabotage in order to force you to go in to the care. Does that make sense.

1344
02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:51.480
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

1345
02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

1346
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll see.

1347
02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But we've we've been trying. We've been relying on

1348
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: The self talk that you innately see the value of your healing and

1349
02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you pull away again.

1350
02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've been doing that and hasn't worked. So let's see. But I'm ready right I'm ready to concede that it's not enough. And we know the part I wanted to tell you about in person.

1351
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of healing when when when the problem that the the harm or the damage that was done was interpersonal if someone is the cause of the harm.

1352
02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something to be said about meeting with another human being face to face, where you can sort of

1353
02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Connect more directly. So even though you say it's the same thing if you're meeting with someone face to face. You might benefit more from it.

1354
02:36:49.650 --> 02:36:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not saying people haven't aren't healing from from the work they're doing with me. But I mean, come on.

1355
02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I can only see you know your chest down. There's a lot more that can be done. There's more intimacy more connection we face to face with someone, so I don't want you to miss out on that.

1356
02:37:06.750 --> 02:37:07.020
Nicole Bacon: If

1357
02:37:07.170 --> 02:37:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Turns out that that's what's needed. So I'm just saying that out loud, I realized the limitations of this Tele health stuff. Okay.

1358
02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:15.330
Nicole Bacon: Right. Right. Okay.

1359
02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go over to

1360
02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:24.540
Nicole Bacon: Over to

1361
02:37:24.990 --> 02:37:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we might need to leave. I don't know how busy it is over in virtual clinic. But what I'd like if you're a medical is sign me. You may already have it. Did you already sign a release of information to your PO

1362
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:46.230
Nicole Bacon: Um, oh, oh, we were going to do that last time. And then, and then we got off and I pray about that.

1363
02:37:46.440 --> 02:38:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if this gal Angelina's available. Okay, let's do something because she's my new person she used to be. Our Gang. And now I got all i Angelina, and I just went into virtual clinic did this with someone else, Angelina, I used to do myself.

1364
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you send

1365
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.830
Nicole.

1366
02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:10.350
Nicole.

1367
02:38:11.430 --> 02:38:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you said you didn't do it right. So it's not like okay I'm being

1368
02:38:17.730 --> 02:38:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: A release.

1369
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:23.340
Of information or

1370
02:38:24.450 --> 02:38:26.100
I'll say family but

1371
02:38:27.570 --> 02:38:29.100
There's a reason for that. It

1372
02:38:30.540 --> 02:38:32.130
Is for

1373
02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we don't have to say why. So we'll just say for family because it's the way it's the release the structured, it's better that way.

1374
02:38:38.850 --> 02:38:39.270
Okay.

1375
02:38:40.890 --> 02:38:41.220
What

1376
02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:43.650
Is

1377
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:50.400
Good. Demographics

1378
02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So today has it been terribly stressful for you to meet today.

1379
02:39:01.980 --> 02:39:13.050
Nicole Bacon: And now the labs was a little bit stressful. I got a little nauseous and had to leave pretty quickly after it didn't cut but I'm okay.

1380
02:39:13.890 --> 02:39:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that that same reason like just being around people, or was it something else.

1381
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:23.760
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I'm just kind of really sensitive to the bright lights in Walmart.

1382
02:39:28.650 --> 02:39:28.950
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

1383
02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there's also maybe a self consciousness isn't worsened with what's going on with your skin too.

1384
02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:36.870
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, it

1385
02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is so. All right. Let's review.

1386
02:39:44.490 --> 02:39:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Me see if she can respond to me here.

1387
02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh 4am, where is it

1388
02:39:55.290 --> 02:39:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What country is she in

1389
02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa, yeah. She I'm in the Philippines or something, I don't know.

1390
02:40:02.670 --> 02:40:03.150
Yeah.

1391
02:40:04.470 --> 02:40:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This program. So while

1392
02:40:06.390 --> 02:40:06.870
It is

1393
02:40:08.310 --> 02:40:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, now I again. I did think that you were done with us here. So I booked somewhere in at 12 o'clock on Thursday.

1394
02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But you'll be happy that that means that one o'clock is is open.

1395
02:40:23.430 --> 02:40:24.060
And later.

1396
02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And based on what you've just been talking about. It sounds like you are the organized one in this partnership with this potential partnership.

1397
02:40:37.170 --> 02:40:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so

1398
02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe using a model that already exists around sort of freelance jewelry organization like how do people when there's that much loose.

1399
02:40:48.150 --> 02:41:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: stuff going on. How does one focus their energy and if today is about, sort of, I need to work on shawls, I want to have a minimum of two or three, you know, setting those parameters member how you were saying, I want to have a little bit more structure so that I don't anyway.

1400
02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be a way to do it is to say this is the expectation and you tell someone you're going to do it.

1401
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where the deadline comes in because once we commit to something. Hey, I'm going to go to a yoga class and you tell someone. I'm going to be ready at this time.

1402
02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Or right same thing with me like I'm going to meet you at this time for for therapy. Notice there's a little bit more like I've got a plan my day a little bit more around it.

1403
02:41:28.050 --> 02:41:29.610
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

1404
02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you make commitments, you call them up and you say, in order to get myself a little bit more fire.

1405
02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's set some deadlines for ourselves because we need this incremental progress. I know I do. And maybe you do and

1406
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you and Barbie might be on the same page there, but sometimes it's literally about scheduling a date. It's about scheduling like I'm going to be somewhere. I'm going to stick with this and that social pressure that'll get you moving

1407
02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:00.750
Nicole Bacon: Right, yeah. Um,

1408
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:06.360
