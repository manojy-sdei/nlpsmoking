00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me guess.

Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know, let me be nice. I'LL BEHAVE

12
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.430
Okay.

13
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like you guys. You can either write little emails you can send little messages.

14
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.690
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh no, I would not do that.

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you wouldn't, but you can

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.680
Okay.

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: At some point, right. Somebody doesn't say something

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

19
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see anything. I only hear from you guys.

20
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get this and see

22
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Which got me in there. WHAT YOU GOT HERE IT IS SE y

23
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.080
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am guessing.

25
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That things are pretty much same over there that healthier some

26
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that was predictable. But you, you get to be different.

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:07.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. And I love that and between group on Tuesday and just our sessions. It just, it's a constant reminder effort change effort change effort change.

28
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.610
Yeah.

29
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: growth mindset and so

30
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds very simple but it's hard to accomplish sometimes

31
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.660
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, for sure.

32
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So where are you noticing, it's been difficult on most recently.

33
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of

34
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.460
Lyndsey Lorett: In what area.

35
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wide open. We can go wherever you want to. Whatever you want to do.

36
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.360
Lyndsey Lorett: So I have a daughter.

37
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.990
Lyndsey Lorett: I know we haven't talked about her yet.

38
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.770
Lyndsey Lorett: When my when when Clint passed away.

39
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:06.210
Lyndsey Lorett: We were all living together, she was with me. She's I've been her mom for 10 years. Yeah, but my parents didn't like Clint. Very much so. There was a lot of

40
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.520
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know uneasiness about her living with us.

41
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.090
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, because they didn't know him very well and they wouldn't take the time to get to know him.

42
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:40.620
Lyndsey Lorett: But when Clint passed away. It was the middle school year and I knew I was coming to gallop. And I didn't want to post Sophie out of school and put her at a new school. And so she is with my parents in Farmington

43
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.620
Lyndsey Lorett: And I go back and forth as much as possible.

44
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Obviously, they will let Sophie come up here. They don't like Tom and Lori.

45
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Not obvious to me. Tell me why.

46
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.210
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm they don't like Tom and Maury because

47
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.640
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm

48
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Man.

49
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.690
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm not even sure I could say there was a specific reason.

50
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.410
Okay.

51
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.990
Lyndsey Lorett: To be honest,

52
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:24.180
Lyndsey Lorett: I just know that's a boundary. They've set it. They don't want her and Gallop and they don't want me taking all over to Farmington

53
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.880
Lyndsey Lorett: To see my daughter.

54
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.150
Lyndsey Lorett: So it's very complicated.

55
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.940
Lyndsey Lorett: so complicated.

56
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:49.170
Lyndsey Lorett: But during the lockdown. My daughter, she's been snacking a lot. Okay. And normally, she she loves her fruits and veggies. Okay. She is a fruit girl.

57
00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:08.730
Lyndsey Lorett: She snacking cuz she's bored and my mom made a comment to her that she was getting a little bit of a belly and that really hurt her feelings and it made me upset because you don't tell a 10 year old. She's getting a belly. You just don't

58
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're right and

59
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:25.200
Lyndsey Lorett: I expressed how I felt about it. And my mom says, well, if you don't, if we don't tell her she's not going to know and I said, Exactly. Let her figure out to her body on our own.

60
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

61
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.930
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just frustrating to have Sophie, call me and say mean he said I was fat.

62
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.950
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just like so breaks my heart and I know that if she was with me. She would never hurt.

63
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So how much now I'm entering these pretty blind. I don't know these relationships.

64
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.610
Yes.

65
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much about

66
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Assertiveness and things like that. But I do have a little clue because we were talking about can I speak my mind with even a virtual clinic staff care navigator, and it was like, that's not going to happen. And this is someone with

67
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no love lost. There's no love on the line with whoever this is. And yet, I wouldn't dare

68
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:38.610
Lyndsey Lorett: I feel like to actually go through with it. There's probably got to be something pretty important. And since I knew just because she's snarky with me doesn't mean she has done something enough to make

69
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.120
Lyndsey Lorett: A comment. However, if that point came I would consider doing it.

70
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.870
Okay.

71
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know much about how much room there is between you and what do you call you call your mom Mimi, or that's just like a grandma name for Sophie.

72
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.910
Lyndsey Lorett: That's what Sophie calls her Mimi, and papa. My mom and dad.

73
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So you spoke with your mom and you said something like, you can't say that or

74
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.200
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't have a problem, expressing myself with my parents.

75
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, great.

76
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I needed so fantastic. So then let's

77
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Look great so she said to you, she asked your question. Well, then how is she supposed to know you said she's not supposed to know we don't say those kinds of things. We don't body shame, right. That's right.

78
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.070
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

79
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you tell your mom what she can do

80
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:55.710
Lyndsey Lorett: I said if you put negative and negative criticizing comments in her mind. She will turn around and do the same thing to herself.

81
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what not to do. I've heard what not to do again.

82
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. So I asked her to I'm

83
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:15.030
Lyndsey Lorett: Not encouraged, but like affirmations about things she's doing during the day, like, Oh, you went to ride your bike that's really great more physical activities.

84
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay do and to encourage it.

85
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got activities. That's the exercise. That's the movement.

86
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And what is your belief. Let's see what yours is around what food is. What's your relationship with food.

87
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, well, it's changed in the last year and a half.

88
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

89
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.670
Lyndsey Lorett: I love eating. Obviously, I'm a bigger girl, um,

90
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.490
Lyndsey Lorett: But I've lost over 100 pounds this last year and eating sucks.

91
00:08:51.960 --> 00:09:05.130
Lyndsey Lorett: It just sucks. And so I couldn't say that I have a good or a bad relationship with food right now it's I not overeating. I may under eat sometimes because of the pain but

92
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.910
Lyndsey Lorett: I know

93
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:16.050
Lyndsey Lorett: I know that fruits and vegetables like there's so much there that can bring health to your body.

94
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:24.840
Lyndsey Lorett: And Sophie knows that. And when we were living together, we would make our juices every morning before school

95
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.630
Lyndsey Lorett: And my mom doesn't. I even got her a juicer.

96
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:39.060
Lyndsey Lorett: I got her a jack LaLanne juicer and I'm sure they'll do every once in a while, but

97
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: physical activities. You said let's reinforce them. And did your mom. Stay talking with you after you said that

98
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she was still listening. She still wanted to hear what you have to say.

99
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

100
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's a good sign.

101
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.680
Yes.

102
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what was said.

103
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:11.430
Lyndsey Lorett: She, she was talking about going and visiting her dad. My grandpa in Arizona.

104
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.850
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't agree with it. I told her I didn't agree with it, but

105
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.850
Lyndsey Lorett: She's an adult.

106
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The topic of food was dropped and you moved on to travel.

107
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.330
Yes.

108
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So you mentioned something else. He said so much would bring health to our bodies.

109
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Something don't like

110
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:43.110
Lyndsey Lorett: Fruits and veggies would bring health to our bodies.

111
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, did that part get said to mom.

112
00:10:48.270 --> 00:11:00.900
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, she knows how I feel about it, but I also reiterated it and I said if if because they give her money for groceries. If you buy it. She's gonna eat it.

113
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Just give me, you know,

114
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

115
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:12.540
Lyndsey Lorett: celery and carrots, put it in a water, put it, put it in a bag. You know, just snacks that she can grab that are easy.

116
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, make them easy kids want easy. They don't want to wash it clean it, fix it. Okay, and what about sometimes maybe wasn't you. I haven't heard it, he said, I used to love to eat. Now, it sucks. And I was hearing it actually causes pain through the digestive system and because it was

117
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not as simple. I love it used to be. I love it. Was there ever a time that you ate your feelings. In other words, eight

118
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotion. Yeah.

119
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

120
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you ever did it when you were little, like, about Sophie sage.

121
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:07.500
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Until I was working and could buy my own fast food or by what I wanted to eat, so

122
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What about when you were bored.

123
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.740
Lyndsey Lorett: What I eat when I was bored.

124
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.330
Oh, yeah.

125
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a pretty common one for people

126
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.770
Lyndsey Lorett: To eat when they're bored.

127
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, it's

128
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.570
Lyndsey Lorett: popsicles. And just, you know, little kid, things that we would eat nothing major.

129
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But the point is, is that it could be. It's not about health. It's not about even being in distress. It's may just be as simple as board.

130
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be something simple.

131
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.110
Yeah.

132
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you again, this isn't a value system. This is a tender place. This is how I raise my child. You know, I mean this is important stuff here. So I'm walking, nice and slow.

133
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:55.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

134
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: See, see if there's any you know

135
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: hot zones.

136
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

137
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it in your

138
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of mindset to say that emotional intelligence physical wellness, they kind of go hand in hand. And that's part of what you're educating your daughter around knowing her own emotions, knowing her own hunger knowing her own self.

139
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.550
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Okay.

140
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So where does emotional intelligence come in when we're starting to talk about boredom and food. Where does that start to come into play. I wonder what

141
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:48.000
Lyndsey Lorett: The issue is that I struggle with my own emotional intelligence. And so I'm

142
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:56.370
Lyndsey Lorett: Trying treading softly with her, as I learned because my mother didn't teach me these things.

143
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you sure

144
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, pretty, pretty darn emotionally intelligent to me. What makes you think you're not telling. Tell me why you think that

145
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Because I'm a basket case some

146
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

147
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, maybe I'll see. I don't know yet because so far, I haven't seen you be a basket case.

148
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.880
Lyndsey Lorett: When I was thinking I was going crazy. I wasn't a basket case.

149
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Lindsay

150
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.520
Yeah.

151
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone

152
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Who was trying to make sense of their craziness.

153
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When you felt you aren't basket case, you were you remained emotionally intelligent just couldn't see or imagined even remember what you were doing. I can't imagine someone being so mean.

154
00:14:54.330 --> 00:15:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't a basket case you would try to apply logic to to a system that they're not using logic and I don't consider this lack of emotional intelligence. I just don't

155
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:25.920
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, what about this when I am dealing with emotional intelligence. I'm good at recognizing and knowing what's going on. But I don't know the healthy questions to ask like you do to figure out the situation.

156
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what is emotional intelligence is

157
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Learning some words to name.

158
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Our experience.

159
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So, for example, sometimes people don't even know their board.

160
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I don't even know where she's at or Sophie's out with that.

161
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:49.950
That

162
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How does she know the difference between I'm lonely versus

163
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Lonely shes lonely. Okay.

164
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. So it could be will back away from what you're, you know, emotional intelligence. I don't know.

165
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's just go over to it sounds like it's something that interests you. It does sound like it's a value system you assess yourself as somehow

166
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Lower on a scale somehow I'm not sure how you, how you do that you called yourself a basket case. But if you say yep it's important, and maybe part of the conversation with me. Me, you and me, you and your mom is

167
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a learning opportunity.

168
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, I struggle with this too.

169
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But this might be a time to name how she's feeling so that it doesn't go. Another year, another 10 years is this mystery and why am I eating them. I'm. Why am I doing this unconsciously eating.

170
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's catch it early, you know, it may be. It could be, you know, disclosure on your part, like I'm learning this myself and I don't really have it all figured out.

171
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet, I'm labeling it first. I'm feeling how I'm feeling. Wait a minute. I'm not hungry. But I'm walking to the fridge. Why am I doing this. I don't have anything else to do. I'm bored. Okay. Well, that's not what food is really for

172
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it can be sometimes we eat a cake and we ice cream and there's a really special treat is amazing. And if it wins. A lot of the time.

173
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can never get enough

174
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what we don't need

175
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.180
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, oh, I want to write that down.

176
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a writer downer one. That's why I said

177
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's usually a mantra for people when they're, it's a drinking or if it's a smoking or if it's something, it gives enough time to take pause and check and say,

178
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No amount of popsicles is going to fill. I'm lonely. It just won't

179
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, so

180
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.560
Lyndsey Lorett: Can you say it again.

181
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.550
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm going to write it down.

182
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I can never get enough of what I don't need

183
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can never get enough. What we don't need you can never get enough of what you don't need

184
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And that goes with alcohol, drugs, gambling sex talk chips goes with everything. If it's not what you needed

185
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, using that as the solution, right, I mean yeah wish it was that easy, but that isn't what you need. I keep reaching for the salty thing would really

186
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I just took a second I'm just thirsty. I need some water and keep putting. Okay, so I just need to take a minute and say, I just keep and

187
00:18:50.670 --> 00:19:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This could be an opportunity to teach a young person real early what that is. How are you feeling well. There's different feelings. There's how the body feels. Usually it's like we can tell whether we're anxious because our hearts racing.

188
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Our palms are sweaty our muscles are tense. That's the one. People like kids can find we know and we're mad.

189
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We know, and we're happy who usually know when we're hungry. That's a good body when to

190
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We know and we have a sore muscle, we know and we spring something so when we use the word feeling sometimes it's nice to say, you know what I'm going to distinguish the word feeling I'm going to be talking about our bodies.

191
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to say, emotions, what emotions are you having what do we label the emotion you have around that feeling. Hmm.

192
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another way to go about it. We can give some labels to things that kids don't normally take the time to label.

193
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:49.980
Huh.

194
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So, mom, what do you do when you are lonely.

195
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:08.340
Lyndsey Lorett: I have my child I N, N, you know, my children. I don't think I will ever feel lonely.

196
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it just doesn't happen like it used to.

197
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.750
Lyndsey Lorett: Know, yeah.

198
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I have. I haven't felt lonely or bored. I even in a really long time.

199
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But I remember it.

200
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh yeah, I remember it.

201
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can remember unconsciously eating just my wife. I said, I'm still eating. Why does it taste good anymore. Why we're still doing this.

202
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yeah. Okay, so for her this conversation with mom is, you know, reinforce the activities.

203
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But also might be part of let's let's name. What's going on normal like normalizing it you know what Sophie. Sometimes we eat when reports. Sometimes we eat, we eat our feelings.

204
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But that isn't gonna make the body. Now you might say it in kid language make somebody happy but us. It's going to be satiate it won't

205
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Meet the need. So in kid language. Right. That isn't what the body wants body might want you to go do something interesting.

206
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're you're you're busy it with walking to the fridge and finding. Is there another great flavor.

207
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I really like grape flavor, but that's not going to keep the mind really going it wants to be kind of concentrated in it loves new things. By the way, the mind.

208
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: New so let's let's give it what it wants. Now, sometimes it's tired, you know the difference of when you're bored. You're tired or lonely. Whoo. Let's get into that new ones. How would you know the difference.

209
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well maybe we don't even know.

210
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I don't know. Well, no, I

211
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Tired.

212
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.580
Lyndsey Lorett: I am

213
00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Ricky one sometimes retirement get short tempered or there's little signs for different people, or we can't find words like oh I know I'm tired when

214
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I usually when I opened my eyes and look around the room. I'm like, I can assess what everybody's doing what everybody's doing it, I can do it instantaneous and I noticed my brains, like with

215
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It fires like good so I'm like, oh, I know I'm tired when my brain doesn't fire as fast. I can't find my words as fast

216
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't really, I can't really picture what everybody's doing before I got in there and what game their plan and what conversation they were having my brain just it's like it's I'm sort of in molasses and syrup or honey.

217
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.810
Yes.

218
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So that could be one. So it's an opportunity to kind of teach about emotions and how we feel them.

219
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:56.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Mm hmm.

220
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Give them names and then give it what it really wants right we can never get enough of what we don't need. So we give it what it really what it really wants

221
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah, we're cooked up probably

222
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Making ourselves go outside is going to be the way just audit. I just got to get out that sun. We do need sunshine. We do need it.

223
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Do

224
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And same with food. It isn't just our taste buds are taste buds are there. Okay, so that we remember to eat. We don't forget, and so we don't starve and die. Those

225
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why they're there is they make it yummy. Maybe she's not gonna know about domain, but it does get a little tiny reinforced eat something yummy something salty something sweet because it wants you to keep eating so you don't start

226
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:41.820
Right.

227
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But the taste buds won't tell you to eat kale or your broccoli.

228
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It probably

229
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.920
Lyndsey Lorett: sneak it in with something that tastes good.

230
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Leave me. I know, that's why we love that movie.

231
00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, all not fruit smoothie. I can't tell it in there.

232
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:12.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Thank you for that. I did, I did take a look at the situation and realize that she really is struggling not being at school not being around other children.

233
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:27.300
Lyndsey Lorett: They can't play together. You can't even go on a bike ride together and just all these things. And the only thing I could come up with was, um, I went on mine to Amazon and I ordered a bunch of crafts.

234
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Projects that she could do. Um,

235
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.990
Lyndsey Lorett: I got her a skip it.

236
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Up you know where you kick it and hop over it.

237
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Just thinks she can do by yourself.

238
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:47.370
Lyndsey Lorett: Now if that will help or not, we won't know but

239
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.800
Lyndsey Lorett: It's worth a try.

240
00:24:51.150 --> 00:25:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been watching my family and listening to other families and there's a lot of online video chatting going on that won't happen in your house.

241
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.530
No.

242
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

243
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.850
Lyndsey Lorett: She's good. Other than me when she calls videos me. She doesn't video anyone else.

244
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: How come

245
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:11.940
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm

246
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.920
Lyndsey Lorett: How come she videos me

247
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how come. She's not gonna kids like that face time thing, or Google something something

248
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We could be doing like little scavenger hunts that could be doing games together socializing, but like in play. But playing the same game but online.

249
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.740
Lyndsey Lorett: So not a video game.

250
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but in here like this.

251
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.190
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, I didn't know that you could do that.

252
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not. I mean, so picture. We're here like this.

253
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.660
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

254
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And I could either

255
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Be

256
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be looking at a game here we could both be looking at an online game that's another alternative. I could be sharing. Let me see if I can do this thing where is my manage participants.

257
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Share screen. That's it. I can do whiteboard. So then I can do this.

258
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

259
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.380
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh,

260
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can draw I draw

261
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So I could do

262
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I know this is oversimplify but I could play. Hang man, really quick.

263
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.280
Lyndsey Lorett: You could, could you

264
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I could play tic tac toe, we could pick her board here somehow I'm sure if we put our minds to we could come up with creative ways to play. I just haven't really sat down and kind of made myself do it, but this is what I'm coming up with now.

265
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:53.580
Lyndsey Lorett: I'd like that.

266
00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And little scavenger hunts. There's educational scavenger hunts online, you could do her in a little friend could start like okay let's do this together.

267
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got 10 minutes you go find these things. I'll go find these things. On your mark, get set, go. Could have a group of kids doing that.

268
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe developing you know friendships that maybe there might be some blossoming invite some kids that don't normally would connect with. But we explore something like that.

269
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Don't let that mean going. But how do you do, how do you connect the children.

270
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK.

271
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.980
Lyndsey Lorett: I will text them the mom or called the mom or dad. Okay.

272
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you would go to your zoom app.

273
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. When I had a little night ladies night in on last Friday and I had to do this because I was like, Well, I don't want to take my own advice.

274
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was great. I mean, it was a little weird, because we're all like, Well, I don't know you. You don't know me. So I took over and you know I love it. So I was like, look, I can only take this result log y'all know me, I'm going to start boss and yellow around

275
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was like okay let's pick a topic. Here's our talking and then it was great. After that,

276
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was kind of like needs to have a, like a book club kind of focus. Because if people don't know each other, there's not this flow.

277
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're normally we can GIGGLE AND TALK OVER EACH OTHER. This format, doesn't it doesn't allow for this kind of cross talking

278
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That a dinner table will will offer you know where you go here and then this person hears across the table. Like it doesn't work quite as fluidly so there's more weight than talk. And I'm like, oh, let's get going.

279
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Well,

280
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you go, you go. Go into zoom. See, we go into zoom

281
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, make sure I'm saying it correctly. And then I'll

282
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.940
Lyndsey Lorett: Just tell me, I'ma write it down as you tell me

283
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: He's like, get it.

284
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Correct. See if I'm doing it, maybe it's in settings.

285
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I did it before and he's joining

286
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

287
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Creation is personal require meetings host participant video advanced options now all I can say at this point is there was a little spot on here that was invite

288
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And what happened was, um, gave me an option.

289
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It was like, yeah, invite and then it gave me like, Well, do you want to do it through a text message. Do you want to do it through an email. I can't text.

290
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'll pop my contacts and then there's a mom's name and there's mom's name, and I would send it, and then it had this number of the 765 number two. Um, I would do it to you if I could find that option. So it's probably that. See how I'm here my hosting, here it's not on my phone.

291
00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when I was doing it. This is where I was logged in. Right now, I'm guessing on here.

292
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:01.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

293
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What's my guest. And so now it doesn't given given me the option.

294
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.120
Lyndsey Lorett: That I know it's there. I can get on and

295
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Figure it out.

296
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if it's tenuous. Wait, let me see if I got it, my backup. See if I can do it again. I'm pretty sure it's under the word meetings.

297
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that you goes up.

298
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You hit a think this word down here.

299
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Meetings.

300
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.020
Meetings.

301
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Meetings and then look at this. See how it has my, my main number

302
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it gives me

303
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Send invitation button right there right at the top. It's like there's buttons and one right there. So I hit send invitation. Then, there it is. Look at my choices.

304
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, text email or Copy to Clipboard.

305
00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So then I get a message and it pulls up all my peeps on my phone. Send it and I do it again send it off again.

306
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And then all they do. Now what I told my friends is they said, listen, yo goes I'll tell you why later.

307
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Cope with zoom on your phone. Wow, okay. They go and do it. And then I'm like, Okay, well, it's gonna be easy. Don't get yourself all complicated with it just hit this link, when I send it to you. And they were fine. So just, it seems overwhelming, but our kids know a lot

308
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:38.370
Lyndsey Lorett: They do and they think that everyone is getting familiar familiar your I don't know familiar with the zoom app.

309
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so too. I

310
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Think

311
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all over the place. So yes, could be fun could do scavenger hunts, you could do some kind of like little drawing together.

312
00:31:48.660 --> 00:32:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: All you know we should do. I don't know if you guys are into Pictionary. But one person could dry it. So let's say I'm drawing it and then everybody's going to try and and shout it out or you have to chat at check the word

313
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture.

314
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Or look I could even look at this, I could do watch. I could do charades.

315
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:11.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Camera

316
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:12.630
Yeah.

317
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we can we can translate recently and kids are creative, they can come up with something

318
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.850
Lyndsey Lorett: I like that. Thank you for opening my mind.

319
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.130
Lyndsey Lorett: Because it's really important.

320
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, shes lonely or board. This is a great time and it's been an interesting to watch my client population and I'm reminding everyone about this platform and they're expanding their ideas about how to stay connected

321
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: While this is going on and it's bringing out different creative angles because now's the time you can do something really different.

322
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of, you know, like the new person at the job like I should have, like, all kinds of stuff. Right now I'm brand new.

323
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So take advantage of it.

324
00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.000
Yes.

325
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.120
Lyndsey Lorett: I think there's just so much to make up the situation.

326
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:13.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah and now is a really important time to and it makes me feel horrible that shes lonely.

327
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:20.580
Lyndsey Lorett: Because we've done everything together for 10 years everything

328
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So inconvenient. The fact that these families are

329
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:28.890
Time. Oh.

330
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.450
Lyndsey Lorett: It's sad for the children.

331
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.960
Lyndsey Lorett: But what I worry about is that

332
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:47.490
Lyndsey Lorett: I know we that Sophie and I have talked about it that I didn't choose all over, over her because I'm not with her.

333
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:58.470
Lyndsey Lorett: And that we're working towards a common goal to be together as a family under one roof our own roof.

334
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, but

335
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.900
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know where I started at

336
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's about your families have a conflict you need. I'm assuming you're with cleanse family because it's their ground, son.

337
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.170
Mm hmm.

338
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:30.180
Lyndsey Lorett: And it was it was a very immediate thing like Clint passed away I they came to town.

339
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:44.010
Lyndsey Lorett: To to our house and just immediately said you know you you need to come and stay with us for a little bit, till you're better and I thought it was going to be very temporary

340
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.360
Lyndsey Lorett: And it's gone on way too long.

341
00:34:49.380 --> 00:35:01.770
Lyndsey Lorett: But I'm worried about them developing a relationship together. I am worried about how they bond. I mean we video chat, but it's not the same.

342
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about Sophie and Ali.

343
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's right.

344
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:10.560
Yeah.

345
00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:14.250
Lyndsey Lorett: How their relationship will be

346
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:23.220
Lyndsey Lorett: Because she was the only child, and only grandchild for 10 years

347
00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: When you have so many things you could be worrying about You sure that's the one that you need to worry about right now.

348
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.430
Lyndsey Lorett: That the relation. My relationship with Sophie is very important to me.

349
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, Sophie and always

350
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:53.790
Lyndsey Lorett: You know that will happen in time. And if we need to do some family counseling to make it the transition easier. I'm willing to do, but it's a big worry of mine.

351
00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:00.540
Lyndsey Lorett: It is you're not supposed to have family split this

352
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.470
Oh,

353
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't we just take a little look at how it got here. Okay. Well, I can tell this is not not what you want.

354
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.990
Lyndsey Lorett: No, but I can't change, you know,

355
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about the I can't change. Tell me more about it.

356
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.340
Lyndsey Lorett: I make my parents be comfortable with Sophie being here.

357
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:45.960
Lyndsey Lorett: And I can't make Tom and Lori comfortable with me taking all over. I've never taken over on my own. I'm it since we've been in Gallup for his first three months of course we did everything I did everything

358
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.990
Lyndsey Lorett: They're just both very uncomfortable.

359
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.130
Okay.

360
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the harder question, I'm sorry, the hard one hasn't come out yet, but here it is.

361
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, why is the comfort of the sets of parents so important to you.

362
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Were just

363
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:13.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Because I feel like I'm not enough the support system for that.

364
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.210
Lyndsey Lorett: They need their grandparents their own goals, you know,

365
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Why on earth would they be lost.

366
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you

367
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: brought your children under the same household, I would you lose a set of grandparents that what makes you think they would be lost.

368
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:42.090
Lyndsey Lorett: I, I know that my parents will always, always do whatever is best for us.

369
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:52.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, but I do know that if I were to take all of her and move out. Um, it wouldn't be good for the in laws.

370
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's an understatement. What do you really think will happen.

371
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.640
Lyndsey Lorett: They've already said will take you to court. If you leave with Oliver.

372
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When did this into

373
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:32.640
Lyndsey Lorett: Our very first argument. So it was around sep tember that I finally stood up for myself and it just went bad so quickly. I mean literally in a snap it went from okay let's talk about this to find will take over will take you to court for all over. I mean, in seconds.

374
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.650
Lyndsey Lorett: And I don't understand. That's like the lowest, you can go to see

375
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:41.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Some, like that. And it went there so quickly.

376
00:38:48.690 --> 00:39:12.570
Lyndsey Lorett: But I do know that my heart that I haven't done anything that a judge would say, can't you can't beat this person's mother. I haven't, but just the fact of being taken to court, just, you know, being a custody battle, not even with the parent. It's the grandparent in laws.

377
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

378
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, you're in a pickle.

379
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:31.050
Lyndsey Lorett: All I can do is not not worry and focus too much on it. Just know that when the band is lifted, I will have surgery and I can return to work.

380
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:39.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Like a new like it just makes me feel normalized people are not supposed to not work. I don't think so.

381
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The band talking about is the governor's order to stay home.

382
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:49.320
Lyndsey Lorett: And that all elective procedures are to be cancelled for the next three months.

383
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this has nothing to do with you, facing your worst fear of going to court.

384
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This has to do with I need to demonstrate that I'm working in case someone brings me to court.

385
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:18.810
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I just want if it will. Yes. In case. But I want to be able to stand up and say, I am the working mom. The single mom that I been for 10 years just now with another child.

386
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.900
Lyndsey Lorett: And that will work and provide for these children.

387
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have to defend yourself. You want to have the added

388
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Clarity and confidence with working

389
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:37.500
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, because you can't just say I'm going to move out with my two children, and I don't have a job and

390
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.970
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm, I'm not, I have haven't had surgery.

391
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.530
Lyndsey Lorett: By default, that

392
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:47.580
Understand

393
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And all I'm doing is just playing devil's advocate right here. But let's just watch the difference because I'm trying to see the difference. This is you, your gratitude.

394
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're over here.

395
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Lori and Tom, I think.

396
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and Ali. Yeah.

397
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But then

398
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You and

399
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Ali. Did you do well now you're on with to grandparents, who's helping you while you're unemployed, baby. Still, baby.

400
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But then girls go over here.

401
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To another set of parents also not working, still a baby. What's the actual difference

402
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.180
Lyndsey Lorett: Of the two households.

403
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So from a judges perspective, watch.

404
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're here. She was dependent. He is dependent

405
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Now over here. I'm gonna judges perspective. What's the difference between these two homes.

406
00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:01.200
Lyndsey Lorett: There's a safety issue. Yeah, my parents house would be better.

407
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

408
00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:07.470
Lyndsey Lorett: Tell me, there's, there's just some safety issues that Tom and Lori's it's um

409
00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:21.990
Lyndsey Lorett: They've got all kinds of wood antique furniture and she's got breakable plates, she collects and he can't go anywhere. He can't, you know, move like a little boy.

410
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We are almost to my point. Let me see if we can get there. You came from, but I never thought about the one you just came up with.

411
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm, I'm the judge your receipt make them bigger. You guys are over here. Laura and Tom's

412
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're unemployed, which is true. Right.

413
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, maybe

414
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.050
Yes.

415
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: There's two sets of grandparents over here on this side. But then, now watch. I'm watching, I'm the judge and I go, so let me get this straight to YouTube. We're here and now you're

416
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Here. So Lori and Tom. What's your complaint again.

417
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Lauren, Tom, what, what's your, what's your complaint again.

418
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.880
Lyndsey Lorett: It will always be about his safety. We are worried about all of our safety.

419
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But look, this is what I see.

420
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:12.510
Uh huh.

421
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what do I see, I see. Grandparents here supporting you, that are dependent right now I see grandparents here. So what is their position on safety. I don't know what their argument is, I can't see it yet. What is it,

422
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Mainly the

423
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.500
Lyndsey Lorett: Giving him a bath.

424
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay. So over here, you're so Papa and Me. Me.

425
00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, give him BASS, IS THAT RIGHT.

426
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:50.700
Lyndsey Lorett: They could, you know, they could

427
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: They will

428
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: They will. So what am I making that up.

429
00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. Okay.

430
00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:05.670
Lyndsey Lorett: What you're saying that he's we're getting the same thing, but maybe in a healthier environment.

431
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, the judges perspective when I'm looking at what the complaint is you didn't move into a car in move into a hotel you continue to reasonably

432
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Reasonably assess your continued dependence and use the resources available to the same type of resources over here.

433
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: As over here, except this one's pissed because it's their grandson just doesn't seem

434
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

435
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No, just I'm trying to, if I'm the judge. I want to look at facts. That's why I'm, I'm just trying to hear something so I'm like Tom and Lori, why are we here today. I don't understand.

436
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: They are in good care with these grandparents, as they were with you. Why was your complaint not made about safety, then

437
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Why now, when she's now over and you've almost. Have you been depriving them of their right to their equal grandson. I'm confused because I don't quite understand what the complaint is

438
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Yet they don't really have one when you stated like that. There isn't one.

439
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I'm wondering if your fear.

440
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is was keeping you tracked

441
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:30.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Mo for her and I don't want to hurt anyone in my actions and I don't understand why we can't just come to the table and say,

442
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:47.250
Lyndsey Lorett: We will always he will always visit you guys, he will always have time with you guys, but it's just not good for us this environment is not good for me and I can't give Ali what he needs in an unhealthy environment.

443
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not understanding why people do dysfunctional things may lead you to feeling like a basket case and your daughter feeling lonely. Those are the. Those are some hard things to hear

444
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet are not easy for me to say.

445
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what's at stake. Am I wrong. No.

446
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:07.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Here, right.

447
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. I know. Nobody wants to hear that stuff. But when you see it played out like that. It's like, what can these people say except

448
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Say whatever nonsense louder. It doesn't have any more value just because they're yelling it and when it's on paper, they can't call you. They can say she's in on fit.

449
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Mother, I said it. That's right. I said it in here. They can say whatever they want to, but if you sit and you keep saying, How could someone be so mean I'm such a good mom. They don't care a flying on fit mother about that they want that baby right there.

450
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.030
Lyndsey Lorett: They don't want him.

451
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.580
Lyndsey Lorett: God, that's all they have left. He's a distraction to them from their own grieving.

452
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.890
Lyndsey Lorett: onto him like he's Clint, and he's not

453
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not your that is their grief to go through and it has got you in the middle, just like those tangled a little guts of yours outside your body that's how it feels. I bet.

454
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You can opt out. And it's risky and I know it's your escape, but look what's at stake. You are about to go crazy for them.

455
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: For what they're not grieving, they're not being honest with themselves. It's doing you crazy making it's not bringing you know BRINGING YOUR DAUGHTER AND YOUR SON. Now let's look at it again. Here I am, the judge and I'm scratching my head like this. I'm like, Tom.

456
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And Laura. I don't quite understand what are you doing to mitigate the rupture in the bonding relationship between these two siblings.

457
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.100
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, they'll, they'll blame it on my parents.

458
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Papa, and he need

459
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.400
Lyndsey Lorett: What they will

460
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:19.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Allow Sophie to come spend time with us, but they won't let all the Virgo spend time with them. They're both stubborn stubborn stubborn grandparents.

461
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:21.450
Okay.

462
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:23.760
Lyndsey Lorett: And there's, it's

463
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:31.770
Lyndsey Lorett: There's not an immediate solution to that and there are just certain boxes that I would like to check

464
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: On here. You and I heard it. I want to be employed, you want to really have your footing in here that. Yeah, I get it, I get the logic behind it. What I just did was try to give just some other perspectives, so that you can see that you your see i wanted i want to check those boxes.

465
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that you're helpless to. But if you want to be on purpose with this escape route. Yeah, you know, okay, I'm on board with you on on board with you but you be a basket case, would you question your reality. I'm not on board.

466
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:06.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

467
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: To do that you decide to wait this out on your terms you're going to sit with live with crazy around you, doesn't mean you go crazy.

468
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, because it's in the service of I need another month

469
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of your. How do I survive this craziness. I'll help you. Plenty of people are still living with crazy and trying to stay sane and they're coming in here. They go to group and they hear honesty.

470
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: They hear about self growth. They hear about the soul to hear about authenticity and it feels good. They're like, okay, I remember who I am again. Okay.

471
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, keep off that ugliness ready to face another week okay I'm amen

472
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Amen. Okay.

473
00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:47.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay. All right.

474
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna I'm gonna pace with you. I just wanted to see, for sure.

475
00:49:53.160 --> 00:50:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What you were imagining a judge would see wanted to know what one sides argument might be over another. Maybe they have something against you, that maybe it would come up. If we had done this little antic but I didn't hear anything.

476
00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:10.260
Lyndsey Lorett: No, they have no valid valid complaint for a judge to hear

477
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:17.010
Lyndsey Lorett: He's been her way more in their care than he's never been hurt in my care. So

478
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, and nobody else is probably going to say this to you. So I'll do it.

479
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You might want to keep track of that.

480
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:28.740
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, I

481
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.780
Lyndsey Lorett: We have doctors stuff. Yeah.

482
00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:32.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

483
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I hate because you like to see the goodness and people. How can someone be mean because we're afraid we're mean

484
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:40.500
And rang.

485
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.040
Lyndsey Lorett: Ugly. It doesn't have to be agree.

486
00:50:44.460 --> 00:51:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And believe me, I would if you told me meet with Lori and Tom and they were willing to do family therapy on your gal show up there and all battle it out with 1010 people I'll go in there. I'm not afraid I might be small but I'm strong okay i'm not i'm not daunted

487
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, okay.

488
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Got to be able to sit down, or at least get on a zoom in or somewhere in some room and be able to talk. I can do whatever you want. I'm on your side.

489
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: always will be.

490
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.110
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, okay.

491
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that other stuff was just, I'm just teasing. Some things out just to see if we're in irrational fear mode. If you're, you still have access to logic, just wanted to check in, because I couldn't see it. I was like, I don't know, is there some ensure enough. There's just this piece around

492
00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Both sets are being kind of stubborn, you really don't want to shine the light on that. It sounds like

493
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.620
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I mean,

494
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:47.670
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, no, look, it's an argument that won't be resolved.

495
00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they'll, they'll end up continuing

496
00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: moving it forward. Instead of saying, Okay, let's just let's all find a way to work together, they'll find more reasons to

497
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Get angry at each other and that's unfortunate. Okay, well you know you know your audience. That's good.

498
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

499
00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Waiting for the order to be lifted.

500
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.900
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, unless it hasn't happened in a year and a half, but maybe it'll become

501
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Like twisted or something in there and I'll need emergency surgery.

502
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Much. Okay.

503
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.140
Lyndsey Lorett: Who hopes for that. That's

504
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Only you

505
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So it feels good for you to come in here feels good to go into group.

506
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does it feel like to be around Ali, you're on.

507
00:52:53.100 --> 00:53:01.860
Lyndsey Lorett: I just, I'm not that I wasn't before but I just enjoy every moment with him. He's not a cranky, baby.

508
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:07.260
Lyndsey Lorett: It's he's just the best just the best. Yeah.

509
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what about these other pieces of sometimes you'll remind me, and you'll say, you know, there are other things I need to work on, there are these other things.

510
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to touch on what those other things are one of those other things.

511
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:39.750
Lyndsey Lorett: I think one of the the sexual abuse in my life is just

512
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:41.880
Lyndsey Lorett: Insane.

513
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness.

514
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:44.730
And

515
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice it comes up.

516
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Like at least the feeling of it.

517
00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot. A few times a

518
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Week, how often

519
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:06.360
Lyndsey Lorett: I'll have dreams I have dreams about it or

520
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:21.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Because it happened for so long and my childhood when my children do something that I did. I remember it, and am thankful. They are not going through it, you know.

521
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go into

522
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Your psychosocial and see what you told me back then.

523
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure we are actually have it.

524
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like you may have mentioned it, but ever so briefly.

525
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I don't even know if I came right out and said it.

526
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

527
00:54:51.300 --> 00:55:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes people just say it. And then I say, okay, was it reported and then we move on and I say whether also, are you a sexual survivor of a rape and assault and I move on, it doesn't, you don't stay long.

528
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:13.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Will that so the hard part for me was this the sexual abuse for my older brothers started at age six and it didn't end until I was 13

529
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:27.330
Lyndsey Lorett: And it took that long for me to stand up and say, no, I literally slam the door, and I said, I'm your sister. You cannot do this to me anymore and I slammed the door unlocked it

530
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.480
Lyndsey Lorett: And it took a lot for me to do that.

531
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:33.780
Lyndsey Lorett: Just two years later.

532
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:42.930
Lyndsey Lorett: I was babysitting for a family in our church and I'm the dad ended up raping me

533
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:49.500
Lyndsey Lorett: In and then he tried to make me think he was in love with me. So I wouldn't tell

534
00:55:52.020 --> 00:56:02.250
Lyndsey Lorett: And then he slipped through the cracks of the prison system when he got out, he should have been deported. And then we had to relive the whole thing all over

535
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That does sound familiar and I just saw a little, a little something here. What did I write

536
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Patient reported discipline appropriately would ground her hit her with go once in your life ran away with younger brother now it's coming to me.

537
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, younger brother to keep keep him safe and was gone for hours. Parents were worried I was AJ are there was around five patient described significant

538
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the way it's written it's pre formatted the significant part of to know what's older brother often okay described being bullied in school.

539
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Teeth every go six to 13 by older brother. He's a bully scared me and younger brother, if we said anything. We were afraid he would kill us. There it is.

540
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: My younger brother was made to watch parents didn't know until

541
00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Age 15 sexual abuse by a friend that's that church member babysitting. Right. That's the one. Okay. All right.

542
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

543
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And it's in dreams. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.

544
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.550
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

545
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Put together a plan around that, then

546
00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You

547
00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So where

548
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We could start with dream. We won't get into it today because I want a whole hour on it, treat it very gently.

549
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:33.540
Lyndsey Lorett: I appreciate that.

550
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to start something we can't fully go through all the way through. So

551
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to just sort of talk about it so that there's this sort of desensitization to it. This is the plan. Okay, I already know. I know what to expect. And I can say no to it. I can adjust it. You can modify

552
00:57:50.790 --> 00:58:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So a lot of times. And yes, we can do all these other techniques. This is just one thing we could do. One of them is we can do some dream work.

553
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It can take the actual dream.

554
00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:04.470
Okay.

555
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I can see I still haven't developed an anchor room with you, which we could actually start doing today.

556
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That can be really useful in the dream work. So what do you know about analyzing dreams like when you think well what are dreams for and what do you do with them. And what's the purpose of them.

557
00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:31.200
Lyndsey Lorett: I feel like it's a God gives us dreams, but I also think that Satan gives us dreams. So

558
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:36.450
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't really relate it to anything other than that.

559
00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: How much more important. Can it be gone insane. I mean,

560
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, yes.

561
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:51.510
Lyndsey Lorett: But when you hear, I had a nightmare. And I think Satan was behind it. People are like, Oh, okay.

562
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if

563
00:58:57.330 --> 00:59:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not troubled by the word. It doesn't get in the way of my continuing to have a conversation. It doesn't doesn't get in the way for me.

564
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what I do with is, I'm assuming, what you're saying is evil bad and hate.

565
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Ugly dark shadow like it's all the stuff that's the yuck.

566
00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So that's what I do with it. I'm like okay well I I live with that. Like, that's, that's my world I'm dealing with that all the time. Okay. Got you. So okay, so I'm not daunted by that either.

567
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously, it's not coming from, like, you'd say it's not coming from love.

568
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Guy okay so

569
00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think, I think we'll be okay. Even with a little, little departure on some of the messages. Um, can I share a split might be a slightly different perspective on dreams with you.

570
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, because that would be great.

571
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

572
01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it's a coincidence that it happens to be. These are the types of dreams and you have this history for so many years, or do you think it's a message from either God or Satan, like it's a message like they're trying to say something gets you to do something.

573
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:30.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, but I don't know if it's God saying you did not deal with this properly, it's time to deal with it or Satan saying, I'm gonna just

574
01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Rip you in your sleep.

575
01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.350
Lyndsey Lorett: So you wake up angry and aren't in a good place.

576
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah and there's no logic behind evil. It just, it feels itself like to be mean and spiteful is enough for itself. There's no logic behind cruelty. It's just to rip you is enough just to

577
01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: See you suffer to have you be angry.

578
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's a win for Satan. Yeah. Yep. I got it.

579
01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, and you're trying to understand or you'd like to know.

580
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's the messenger. What's, what's the message, what, what's the deal here. So my part is I don't normally language it in terms of God and Satan, because I'm more of a, like a tissue chemistry like flesh.

581
01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a more psycho biology. Right. I'm like this is the vessel. I'm working with right here.

582
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.720
Yeah.

583
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the rest of it is belief in other and I'm like, I love the connection with the spirituality. I love that. But I want to talk about. But this since the dream is happening in here. And if God be God made this

584
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, assuming we both agree. God made this vessel and yours.

585
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, not Satan

586
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That Satan Michael So about that. So I'm made out of goodness and love and light.

587
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: intentions are good. Okay. My intentions are good and it is self healing vessel, it knows how to heal itself white blood cells and the whole deal and knows it's a homeostatic

588
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Entity if there's a little lever here. Why didn't this one registers. It has its little sympathetic and parasympathetic and knows how to heal itself and regulate itself.

589
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.980
Yeah.

590
01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

591
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we both have buy in on that both agree on that. Well,

592
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it maybe unconscious is that dream, because if you were conscious of it, wouldn't you say I don't want to think about that. What about what I

593
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so maybe there is a buy in on conscious like right now you're conscious right you're awake.

594
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Week. I know it.

595
01:02:55.890 --> 01:03:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's up time we might turn that is unconscious

596
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:01.200
Right.

597
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the purpose of the unconscious

598
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.690
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know. You're supposed to be resting

599
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, why do we have to rush. Why don't we just stand up like cows and horses and just get to our Susan longer standing

600
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.680
Lyndsey Lorett: At all, we need that deep sleep.

601
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:29.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Why, because it is so it's just as important as the food you put in your body.

602
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you know we do all our healing when we're sleeping.

603
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We're our cells are regenerating we're healing while we're sleeping because look how busy. Our body is a tuning to

604
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We're all look how much work it takes like to do all of this and to be thinking it actually it's a huge muscle to be thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, I'm using my eyes look at me using my mouth, and now I'm digesting well wait a minute, all of that.

605
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: My heart rate slows down. I'm not taking in new stimulation from my eyes from my ears from my mouth from my skin.

606
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm processing honest, I'm right doing systems check. I'm checking on everything I'm healing regenerating I have to have fast.

607
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: to refuel I have to

608
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, yeah.

609
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So part of it is going on, conscious. Why don't we sleep when we're still conscious. Why can't we sleep when we're still conscious

610
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Because you're still thinking you're still using your ray

611
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, up to what's it doing back there. Now if we if we both agree that up here in this noggin, although it feels spiritual like a thought. Doesn't it feel like

612
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:53.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Does

613
01:04:54.180 --> 01:05:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Something, but for a moment, if we just say okay I buy in that these are just it's tissue in this blob of grey goo.

614
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And if there's little chemistry things going on to these apathy around this. And, oh, I, I can't read Chinese because I never learned Chinese

615
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But, uh, wait a minute, how, what's the meaning of that character. Now I see that. Okay, so I can learn. I even as an adult, right, I can look at something I learned something neural plasticity of the brain changes. Okay. So if I'm asleep, and I'm unconscious is healing something

616
01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what's

617
01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, no. That makes perfect sense.

618
01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

619
01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's trying to heal itself. What if it's trying to reconcile something that you know there's different parts of the brain. They literally you don't do all your thinking.

620
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: In the amygdala, right, I mean they literally just they're different parts of the brain. It's not actually one big blob.

621
01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. No. And they do. Yeah. Different things happen or

622
01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So what if

623
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a part that got stuck. And it's not integrated into the rest. And it's kind of lost off and it's off here off to the side all by itself.

624
01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But a body wants sin tonic. It wants to be homeostatic with itself. It doesn't want an alien part in its own vessel, does it

625
01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, it wants. What do I do. What's that, what's, what's that, what's this, why is this over here. Just connect with this disconnected to this one. What's that, and so maybe the unconscious says

626
01:06:40.950 --> 01:07:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that okay oh has all of this attached sort of a middle attachment to it. That's that anger. That's all of those feelings and then once again. All we have is that emotional experience of this blob of memory you wake up to it, you're like even more pushing away.

627
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

628
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. No. Push your wing

629
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It was yucky, then it's yucky. Now, now it's anger. I don't, I don't want it. So even more just reinforces pushing it away. And that's where the therapist, the cheerful spunky therapist comes in.

630
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And says,

631
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:25.770
Lyndsey Lorett: True. Yes.

632
01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing wrong with you. There's nothing broken. There is no evil.

633
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:34.710
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

634
01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no evil in you. Okay, you're pushing away really really confusing. There's this thing that happened. That makes no sense to a six year old. It has no way to put a language and story. It has no summary.

635
01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Sits there.

636
01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that there's no landing. There's no. What is that right, so it has no proper timestamp. It's kind of this nebulous thing. So what therapy can do

637
01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get it in the past, we can desensitized to it. We can reprocess. And when I say reprocess because that's a weird word disciple. What exactly does reprocess mean. It means you have a different relationship to that.

638
01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, that would be so great.

639
01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you think

640
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:33.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, yes, it's the box that has the lock on it when it's the box that is not open

641
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:34.440
And

642
01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:38.130
Lyndsey Lorett: I guess it depends on who I'm talking to, but

643
01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:46.560
Lyndsey Lorett: Because I've answered. So many questions about it. I can talk about it and and not trigger things

644
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So you really do have it locked

645
01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.000
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, I really do have it locked

646
01:08:51.150 --> 01:08:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, that might be cool. I don't know. Let's see. I don't know if it's intruding

647
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Into your dreams because it wants to be felt, meaning it grieved, meaning I need to feel it. Someone else need to see

648
01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not alone. And right here, you're here with your therapist. We're going to bring it up. We're going to feel that emotionally and be okay. Oh, hey, it's not happening now, it was back then it

649
01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Was yeah

650
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So that's what that would be. But we don't do it quite like that. I like to do it a little like through a little bit more imagery kind of thing. We use the imagery of whatever's coming up. And one way we can incorporate this anchor room.

651
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:46.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

652
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, this safe space. What would kind of like to do some preparation with that with you. I know we only have nine minutes. But I can get started with you a little bit

653
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.670
Lyndsey Lorett: Sure.

654
01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wonder why day the little boxes didn't make it into this note with all those boxes you had that so bizarre on the shelf. I gotta check your notes and see where they are the land, but let's start. Let's start this

655
01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Since you said you don't get emotionally activated around looking at the Lockbox and understanding what's in it.

656
01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I get it is set my sexual abuse history. That's the dilemma. Right.

657
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.420
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, and I think that I don't get triggered with it because

658
01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:50.070
Lyndsey Lorett: I never really processed or dealt with it. Um, and so I refuse to allow myself to feel something.

659
01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Or react to it.

660
01:10:55.050 --> 01:11:02.130
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean a six year old doesn't know how to process that. And a 15 year old still doesn't know how to process that.

661
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: No. And let me clarify even more around that typically the

662
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Other way say this

663
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You're probably solving the dilemma that confusion.

664
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a six year old.

665
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that seems really weird. But when the problem happened when the trauma. When the assault when the violation happened. You had a six year old brain development and you came up with this year old solution, which was shush.

666
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Be afraid.

667
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And intimidated and it took quite a bit for you to stop using a six year old solution, a lot. And finally there something snapped, something happened where this 13 year old was finally able to come up with a more to slam the door and say no.

668
01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:00.750
Yeah.

669
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:13.620
Lyndsey Lorett: And actually, when I talk about slamming the door that does bring up. I remember, like, I feel what I felt when I slam the door.

670
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So would you say the dilemma. When you say my sexual abuse history is the problem, like here today is the problem. I never dealt with it.

671
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something like

672
01:12:44.190 --> 01:13:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I've never had an orgasm, or I'm disgusted by men or or you see it could be anything. I have no idea what the dilemma is in and of itself, it's three words sexual abuse history doesn't have any like, but some imagery comes up for you that's like, I don't know what the real is it

673
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: was watching you. Now is it your fear about the future. Is it that

674
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: These images of things that he did keep coming in intruding into your unconscious. I can't quite tell, is it the past is it present triggers is a fear of the future.

675
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:27.660
Lyndsey Lorett: I think I think it might be a little bit of of some of that I think

676
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:29.460
Lyndsey Lorett: I

677
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:43.110
Lyndsey Lorett: Intentionally have chosen not to be in a relationship or sexual relationship where I can explore because I am uncomfortable.

678
01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.120
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

679
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.040
Yeah.

680
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, well, we're going to leave it right there.

681
01:13:51.330 --> 01:14:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Not a lot. And what we'll do is next time. What I'd like to do is all kind of explain to you what developing a and it's a safe space is what an anchor room is it's going to be this room where you have everything that you need that you want. Okay.

682
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay that's got a happy ending.

683
01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know that's what we have to look forward to, not something negative, but rather, we're first going to cultivate this really great experience.

684
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:24.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, and what are we doing the same time next week.

685
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To keeping me on task.

686
01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:30.930
Lyndsey Lorett: I

687
01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Wanted to get it before you go.

688
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:40.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, and I did have another question.

689
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.190
Lyndsey Lorett: I have a

690
01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:49.410
Lyndsey Lorett: Couple like Dr. Questions for Dr. Gabriel, but we don't have one on ones in group.

691
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:54.000
Lyndsey Lorett: Do you get a one on one with Dr. Gabriel after the first time.

692
01:14:56.490 --> 01:15:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You can schedule a meeting with her. We don't want it to be on the same day as a group or individual with me. You can either email her. You can go through the virtual clinic and say, hey, can you schedule something they know her schedule. They can plug you in

693
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, if it's brief, you can say, hey, I'd like to speak with you alone right at the end and then you can meet with her there. If it's a little

694
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.120
Lyndsey Lorett: Thing what what's considered brief like a five minute thing.

695
01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Or, guess what, you know, else

696
01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you can see on your screen. But there's a thing called I'm gonna see if I can invite you to do one. See where it says breakout room.

697
01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I just invited you to a breakout room, I think.
