Talyssa: My hands like shaking. Oh my god, it's all sweaty and I started talking loud, I'm sorry if I'm yelling. Um, but yeah, I noticed when during the panic attacks that I've always I've always known that I just

25
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.830
Talyssa: I'm glad I had those

66
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.500
Talyssa: That was covered wanna

67
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:33.150
Mary Kastner: Do you want me to give you a benzodiazepine just to take when you're really anxious or do you want to take something routinely like so loft.

68
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.870
Talyssa: Either one is fine. I don't really know.

69
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.730
Mary Kastner: Much about whether or not

70
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:51.180
Mary Kastner: You know together Penton you can take as you need it. So we might want to try this all off. It's used for anxiety as well as depression. It's a middle of the road kind of serotonin real take inhibitor

71
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.590
Mary Kastner: So,

72
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.600
Mary Kastner: You have to do daily

73
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.930
Talyssa: That I could do that, um, does it help her like in the moment of panic attacks.

74
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.370
Mary Kastner: No.

75
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.680
Talyssa: Great, now

76
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.990

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.610
Talyssa: Okay.

78
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.460
Mary Kastner: Okay, so which do you prefer.

79
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.450
Talyssa: Either whatever you think is, is better. I'm trying not to cry. Sorry. Keep trying not to look at you.

80
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.740
I'm

81
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.260
Mary Kastner: Sure you can make you a little sleepy.

82
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.070
Mary Kastner: It is addicting. There is a danger.

83
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.340
Mary Kastner: For a long period of time with the you've been working because

84
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:53.370
Mary Kastner: You know buprenorphine is fairly safe. However, the known deaths that they have had with it are people that are using a lot of benzodiazepines, which is what this is.

85
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:06.630
Mary Kastner: But I do have, I want to tell you probably have more people in my case load on the box on with the band. So right now, just because of what's going on in the world and people are so anxious

86
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.070
Talyssa: That's another thing I'm like snapping at people and like yelling at people.

87
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.210
Mary Kastner: I noticed

88
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:21.390
Talyssa: I like did it this was last week. That's why I wanted, I tried to get an appointment. I was like, Okay, maybe I do, obviously this is nothing new. But, um,

89
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.720
Talyssa: I don't know, maybe because we are home 24 seven. Um, but it's more like I get riled up not not really like a degree, but it's

90
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:40.350
Talyssa: It is like you know when you have two kids and they're like this and you're like, trying to like even see straight like I see blurry. Like, I'm going to pass out or something.

91
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.780

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.450
Alex: How can I do this like the expedited version, um,

183
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:24.540
Alex: I always knew there was something different, like, I mean, I remember a being eight years old and just and being so fucking frustrated, to the point where I was just like,

184
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:40.170
Alex: Like sobbing hysterically because I knew in my mind that there is no fucking way in hell that anybody else around me is experiencing or feeling what I'm feeling in my head. Otherwise, a day would be going fucking crazy.

185
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:51.270
Alex: So I knew that there was something there was something wrong, but everybody around me. My parents are both private school headmaster's and so growing up, I always went to one of my mother's schools that she was the head of

186
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.010
Alex: To that, you know, can only imagine the amount of bullying that went along with that.

187
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:07.950
Alex: So they for a very long time, just you know 10 years old, I think, was the first time I told my mother. I want to step in front of a car, she said. She said, don't they still say things you don't mean like I was like, Mom, like

188
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:18.810
Alex: But I'm not like I'm not lying, I'm not trying to get attention like I really, I really like like everything and he wants me to jump in front of that car, and she smacked me across the face that she said, and

189
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:26.070
Alex: read verbatim we ever say those fucking words again, especially in public around other people swear to god like

190
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.730
Alex: didn't finish the sentence, but

191
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:41.190
Alex: I'm my mom was the good one to the to the bottom. I don't get me wrong. My parents were amazing. But they just went through their own versions of hell. Growing up, so their

192
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:52.890
Alex: Concept of love was making sure I had every opportunity and every financial freedom and like, and all the and by no means are we, Richard and everything, but like, you know,

193
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.070
Alex: I don't know if you know much about

194
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.680
Alex: Like Liberia and

195
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.080
Alex: Diamond wars and the genocide.

196
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.280
Alex: I hate asking this because it's so Hollywood. Have you seen the movie blood diamonds

197
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.240
Mary Kastner: Yes.

198
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.370
Alex: So my father was one of the children shot up with heroin taken from a village in Liberia.

199
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.820
Alex: Given an AK 47 and forced to slaughter hundreds of people

200
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.380
Alex: At like 12 years old and you know it took me a very long time. It wasn't till I was an

201
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.910
Alex: Adult I understood that once you see that kind of darkness in the world. You can't ever really

202
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.350
Alex: Truly be happy again.

203
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.250
Mary Kastner: But

204
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:36.060
Alex: My mom completely different story comes from Jersey but like your, your classic like

205
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.600
Drove

206
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.820
Alex: The father comes home.

207
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.520
Alex: To beat everybody like it just

208
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:50.190
Alex: Like your job to the t you know whatever was 70s, 80s, just so they all went through their own versions of hell. And because of that didn't

209
00:14:50.640 --> 00:15:02.100
Alex: Know how to provide any level of intimacy were and and then here's me on the flip side of, like, the only thing in the world that I need right now is like intimacy and affection and

210
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:12.570
Alex: I know I remember growing up like one of my favorite things ever was, like, if they would scratch my back, like all I ever want every one of the news to scratch their back and touch me.

211
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:18.870
Alex: Like I did everything I want to apply all the stories I didn't, you know, pretty good. All of them all that but

212
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:30.660
Alex: One night 12 years old, my dad decided that he was gonna do it anymore and it like it really, really, really upset me and like I kind of, I even noticed

213
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.950
Alex: How upset. I got because in my head. I was thinking like, I don't, I don't want it like

214
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:43.800
Alex: The same kind of thoughts that maybe you want to jump from them for in front of a car in the first place. You know, like, I don't want to live like. But then, you know, after a couple hours. I kind of

215
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:52.260
Alex: I kind of like and analyze the way that I react in a realize that, wait, that's not rational. But I really felt that in the moment.

216
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.410
Alex: Meanwhile, I'm 12 years old right now so I'm confused as shit as to just everything that's going on, you know,

217
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:15.870
Alex: Literally, the next day in class, we're reading the curious into the dog in the nighttime. And my teacher asked some questions and I just put my hand up and call me and I'm and I say, so if we're all born alone right and

218
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:24.540
Alex: Supposedly, we have X amount of time to live. And then we are going to die alone and at any point in that given time something tragic can happen like a car accident.

219
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:31.470
Alex: And and that's it. It's just over. You don't even get to like, what's the, what's the point of it all really and

220
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.830
Alex: I got sent to the principal's office, which was my mother and I can, same, same.

221
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:50.280
Alex: They just really didn't they really just thought I was seeking attention for a very long time until the first suicide attempt. And then they started like kind of cash on. Sorry, I'm telling you, probably way more than you need some, like, I'm sorry.

222
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.010
Mary Kastner: No, you're fine. You're fine.

223
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.510
Alex: What information are you looking for, that's probably going to be more help normal

224
00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.940
Mary Kastner: Just keep going, keep going.

225
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.000
Mary Kastner: So you're 12. And then what happened.

226
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.020
Alex: I just I blocked so so so much of all that out.

227
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.380
Mary Kastner: To join High School.

228
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:40.290
Alex: Um, well, my parents sent me away to boarding schools because I got into really good schools and they thought that that would be a great option. I got kicked out of the first two barely graduated from the third one. And my dad worked there, which is the reason why I graduated and

229
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.640
Mary Kastner: Why did you wait to get kicked out.

230
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.810
Alex: First time I tried marijuana and we didn't even call it a second time.

231
00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:00.720
Alex: There was MDA my system. I'm like a random drug test or something. And the other one.

232
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:16.590
Alex: I was on the US national team when I was in high school, I went to prep schools in New England. So I don't know if you like know how it would work. Very often, but sometimes she will do what's called a post grad year which was like a second senior year.

233
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.730
Alex: Basically get better at sports to get a better scholarship, so

234
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.970
Alex: I had signed a contract with you. The North Northeastern University that if I did a post grad year

235
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:40.350
Alex: And worked worked with the local, you know, local, national team and Connecticut, then I could go on and row at Northeastern meanwhile I hated growing and was just a ticket to something I was really good at it.

236
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:49.470
Alex: And we're already nationals and I leave my bag right next to my buddies carcass. They told me to pick it up and apparently he ended up you know

237
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:59.190
Alex: dilly dallying around it, somebody found the bag and thought it looked curious and opened it and all of my prescriptions were in it. All of my prescriptions.

238
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.110
Alex: Like all in my name, all, all like it but like

239
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:14.640
Alex: Everything was in it. And the reason for that was we lived in New York and this day school that we went to was in Connecticut. So I was so used to having to transport my stuff back and forth.

240
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.510
Alex: Because that morning I had come from the studio and I was going to get on slate and we're building but Connor was going to bring it back the

241
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.930
Alex: My God, I haven't lived just

242
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:38.730
Alex: Fucking Connor was going to hold onto onto it for me for like seven days until I got back, and I mean you had, I had what

243
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.710
Alex: Like I had everything in there. I mean, I have my soul often them are identical in their head.

244
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:54.330
Alex: Out or extended release Adderall. I had regular Adderall. I had Xanax in there and to anybody. I mean, they were all in my name, and all the dates showed that like they were

245
00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:05.940
Alex: You know, like it not, there were no discrepancies about anything but they still like they still just freaked out, because no one's ever seen that amount of authentication before and so

246
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.740
Alex: What whatever I got in trouble. We were best friends with the

247
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.840
Alex: Lifelong family friends with the headmaster of that school so

248
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.080
Alex: Anyway,

249
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.130
Alex: I don't know that the relevancy to that really I don't really know what it is.

250
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.520
Mary Kastner: But so you started taking those kind of prescription medicines when you were how what

251
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.210
Alex: What do you mean when you said what do you mean when you say, I'm sorry.

252
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.880
Mary Kastner: So alive Sonics add around. How old were you when you started those medicine.

253
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:49.350
Alex: So, I mean, they started me on Ritalin. When I was like 12 and then they moved to concert. A and then they move on to

254
00:20:49.770 --> 00:21:02.580
Alex: Our all 10 milligram. And then eventually moved chatter all 2020 milligram, and then they try the X ours. I never liked the X ours, because they just they made me feel free to like tweaked out and it's just never worked for me.

255
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.610
Alex: And I already have ADHD and I have crazy anxiety as well.

256
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.760
Mary Kastner: Why did difficult

257
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:23.580
Alex: So the, the Depakote. It would be three, three times 500. I mean, the

258
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.220
Alex: I mean, it's a it's an anti seizure right is

259
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.590
Mary Kastner: Yes. So mood stabilizer.

260
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.550
Alex: Exactly. But he said, but doesn't have like mu stabilizing effects.

261
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.130
Alex: Yeah, so that's for the

262
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.150
Alex: Rapid cycling bipolar.

263
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:43.710
Alex: With

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.210
Alex: Yeah, rapid cycling.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.480
Alex: With borderline tendencies.

267
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.320
Mary Kastner: Okay, induce carry that diagnosis today.

268
00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.110
Mary Kastner: Do I what do you still feel like you have that diagnosis.

269
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:12.330
Alex: Ya know, like it was like one once they finally got it right because they put me on so many different things. It was like well for me at first when somebody actually told me that there is something wrong. It was like it was

270
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.470
Alex: There was like

271
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:23.070
Alex: It, it was like, hallelujah, because I just I just felt there like the biggest cosmic cosmic mistake ever for the first 15 years of my life.

272
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.300
Alex: Uh huh. Yeah. And yeah, so

273
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.100
Mary Kastner: Okay, and

274
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.850
Mary Kastner: Xanax was for the anxiety of the deadline.

275
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.660
Alex: Yeah, I know. I like I get like very severe panic attacks as well.

276
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.010
Mary Kastner: Okay, okay.

277
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.410
Mary Kastner: Do you still get those

278
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.750
Alex: It there it's situational

279
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.680
Honestly,

280
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:56.460
Alex: So I've been. I've been a going into like a like a a tough time recently, I'm doing really well, but like, but it's

281
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.530
Mary Kastner: So right now, you're doing well.

282
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.600
Alex: I'm doing pretty well, but two nights ago I was on the kitchen floor with a knife to my neck like

283
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:18.510
Alex: Because, but that but like that hasn't happened in so long. But I think what I've realized, what's happening is because I was always on medications for so long that

284
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:26.250
Alex: Were numbing me in one way or another. And then, even though I stopped taking those I was then using something that was still numbing me one way or another.

285
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.090
So,

286
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.900
Mary Kastner: Are you do you have the national suicide hotline number

287
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.310
Mary Kastner: Yeah. And what what stopped you two nights ago from

288
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:40.230
Mary Kastner: SAP

289
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.620
Alex: Um, I would never do it. I haven't adopted younger brother.

290
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.140
Alex: And that wasn't with the intention of killing myself. Honestly, it's just like a

291
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.050
Mary Kastner: It's a younger brother keeps you going

292
00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:06.150
Alex: Yeah, July 27 2013 we adopted my younger brother from Thailand technically he's my leg second cousins, but he's like I like raise that kid. He's my he's like my reason he's like my reason for everything.

293
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:12.420
Mary Kastner: Yeah, super, where are you living right now besides to live city. What are you going by yourself with your

294
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:17.640
Alex: Family. So my parents and I both live in Walnut Creek, but I do live in my own apartment by myself.

295
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.030
Mary Kastner: Okay.

296

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.200
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okay, so how much Suboxone or you one.

593
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.560

594
00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:42.210
Mary Kastner: Okay, one strip a day and you're going to groups. Okay, keep going. So what can I do for you.

595
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:51.900
mitchell umansky: So I'm having trouble with my insurance. Uh, so they covered the first week. Right. And it's very strange because they've covered me before for this program.

596
00:48:53.280 --> 00:49:01.020
mitchell umansky: And what they're saying is, and I went through so many doctors that came in the facility to try to help me with this manner, but

597
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:06.000
mitchell umansky: I don't know, I feel like they weren't doing it correctly because they were just doing it on a piece of paper and it wasn't

598
00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:18.060
mitchell umansky: Verifiable. At least that's what they said. So pretty much, they denied me right and I'm trying to appeal because I you know I have no choice. I have to do 90 days in a rehab, but

599
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:24.420
mitchell umansky: I'm trying to get at least if I can't get 90 in this rehab maybe at least 30 and then I'll jump to another place, if I have to.

600
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:37.590
mitchell umansky: But it doesn't make sense if they don't cover this why they would they cover the other. But anyways, I'm trying to get a psychiatric evaluation, right, pretty much a recommendation for treatment. They called it a psychiatric evaluation.

601
00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.990

823
01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.310

824
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:10.140
Mary Kastner: You know, the, the hyperthyroidism can contribute to the anxiety.

825
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:18.810
Mary Kastner: And of course the impending legal issues can contribute. So it could be, you know, an adjustment disorder.

826
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.720
Mary Kastner: With with anxious mood.

mitchell umansky: I guess I could try another program, but it's like it's

833
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:13.290
mitchell umansky: Hard for me to find programs that allow me to continue my bright heart health, you know, my Suboxone treatment as well.

Hi.

905
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:01.620
Mary Kastner: Long time no see.

906
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.200
Galaxy A50: Long time quarantined.

907
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.950
Mary Kastner: I know you thought you knew about that. What

908
01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:15.540
Galaxy A50: They said she stuck on a boat I because I'm upon these things sounds like that's the only boat that stuck anywhere.

909
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:31.860
Mary Kastner: I felt so guilty because I had a ton of patients, you know that had been waiting, you know, and I was going to be so busy seeing. And then I was like in this tiny room.

910
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:43.530
Mary Kastner: On the ship and you know I'm I couldn't get on the line, even with my iPad, because it you know confidentiality and other people in the room with me so

911
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:45.030
Mary Kastner: I

912
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.830
Mary Kastner: Gave

913
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:53.610
Mary Kastner: In and I said, You know, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But you can have to reschedule. You know, all these patients.

914
01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:02.340
Galaxy A50: I'm sorry, somebody started calling me and it muted you. So

915
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:03.660
Galaxy A50: part again.

916
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:06.930
Galaxy A50: You said it out and then what

917
01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:15.420
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I just waited until Sunday to, you know, let the front desk know you know that I just couldn't

918
01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:36.060
Mary Kastner: See you see those patients on the Monday that I had them scheduled and I was so apologetic. But anyway, I mean quarantine. And since there's not much I can do, you know, I said, Just fill me up with patients. So I've been seeing patients last week in this week and I'm bringing

919
01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:38.910
Mary Kastner: Pardon me.

920
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:40.620
Galaxy A50: Are you still on the boat.

921
01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.700
Mary Kastner: No worries. Travis Air Force Base in quarantine.

922
01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:45.660
And

923
01:14:47.760 --> 01:15:02.070
Mary Kastner: Tomorrow will be released, we will have done our duty to God and country because we will get the free and clear from CDC that we completed our quarantine of 14 days so

924
01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:10.200
Mary Kastner: Oh my god, that's what I said, Oh my God, yeah. Yeah, it was a pain in the

925
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.710
Mary Kastner: Butt. What can I say yes.

926
01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:20.310
Mary Kastner: So what's going on for you. Did you get your child back yourself, son.

927
01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:21.750
Galaxy A50: The whole

928
01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:35.010
Galaxy A50: Hell no, it got even it got worse now. Now, what kind of mom would ask his son. I mean, the judge for the sun to be returned into this coronavirus mess.

929
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:37.050
Mary Kastner: Oh yeah, that's true.

930
01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:45.300
Galaxy A50: 11 cases over here alone in San Diego, we have two to 30 they have 11 in the entire state.

931
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:48.270
Mary Kastner: Where is he now what state.

932
01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.010
Galaxy A50: But fuck Idaho.

933
01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:53.910
Mary Kastner: Oh yeah. Well, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah.

934
01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:59.700
Galaxy A50: Yeah, because nobody freakin visits and nobody wants to even coronavirus doesn't want to go there.

935
01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:07.950
Mary Kastner: And what's going on with you legally as far as working everything

936
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:14.370
Galaxy A50: Well, I don't remember the last time we saw each other. Do you have that written down somewhere.

937
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:16.860
Mary Kastner: Not with me. I do at home but

938
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:18.810
Mary Kastner: I would say

939
01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:23.340
Galaxy A50: That nothing new.

940
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:34.530
Galaxy A50: on the 19th of February is when we had our last of court hearing, the judge was very impressed with me.

941
01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:44.430
Galaxy A50: I mean, it was obvious because he was looking at me. And the thing is, unkind. I think what he took as lack of anxiety.

942
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.820
Galaxy A50: Was actually that two things. There was a little less anxiety because I finally realized that, well, I realized that I finally have a good attorney.

943
01:16:54.630 --> 01:17:01.590
Galaxy A50: And that's never been the case. So as soon as she started speaking I realized I didn't have to do anybody's job for them.

944
01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:11.880
Galaxy A50: So that made me feel a lot better. But also, in a way, I was so beaten down that I didn't even have the energy to be anxious anymore.

945
01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:31.020
Galaxy A50: I was just like, I'm at this guy's mercy. But whatever reason he was in a very good mood. He even like joked, a little bit. And he was really annoyed at my ex husband, which was beautiful. So he functions as one of San Diego smokes like

946
01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:53.070
Galaxy A50: Cherished drug court judges, so unfortunately deal. Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it, so he's very anti supposedly drug alcohol, blah, blah, blah. I mean, why I'm being frickin hounded over marijuana but still

947
01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:09.480
Galaxy A50: He didn't know about your program and for him to not know about a program. It's almost like like the way other other side was portraying it was. It's a program. You don't even know about judge. That's how like insignificant to this.

948
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.080
Galaxy A50: And luckily he wasn't buying into the bullshit.

949
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:19.230
Galaxy A50: And us like I just want to know more about bright heart. My next hearing us April.

950
01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:26.100
Galaxy A50: 14 if we all live by April 14 supposedly I might be able to see him.

951
01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:38.550
Galaxy A50: But courts are not scheduled to open until April six, and they closed like about march 20 so we don't actually know if they're going to start going from

952
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:52.650
Galaxy A50: Like if they were to open on the sixth if they're going to go from six on and then incorporate other cases, or if they're going to start from the day they stopped and then grow could go chronologically.

953
01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.450
Mary Kastner: So, okay, well,

954
01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:04.920
Mary Kastner: If he has some time in maybe since the courts closed. He can actually look up right heart on the computer and

955
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:06.360
Galaxy A50: He is. Uh huh.

956
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:20.910
Mary Kastner: Because, you know, Dr. Khan is on there. He is the nation's expertise, our medical director and he testified in front of Congress on our website. So we are growing exponentially. We get putting

957
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:27.480
Mary Kastner: A new practitioners and even the President has encouraged the country to start using Telehealth.

958
01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:29.970
Mary Kastner: Well, right.

959
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.530
Galaxy A50: Now I'm better off than anybody else because you can only see people virtually know

960
01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:53.820
Mary Kastner: That. Exactly. I had to see my providers virtually this week so because when you know I had three very hard to get specialist appointments while I'm in quarantine is I don't believe this. So anyway, so how June without the marijuana

961
01:19:54.540 --> 01:20:17.550
Galaxy A50: Well, uh, not bad, because my god life. I don't know what it is. I'm like drama magnet. But let me just finish one more thing. So unfortunately there was up a conference like a like a family mediation meeting and my ex husband appear telephonically, of course.

962
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.570
Galaxy A50: And I don't know what it was. I don't feel like did well.

963
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:38.760
Galaxy A50: My attorney wasn't there, which made me feel a little naked and then my assessment instantly started saying mean shit and I have to be able to control myself I'm doing fine without now wanna I am more

964
01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.990
Galaxy A50: Not doing well because of nothing to do

965
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:51.900
Galaxy A50: And I don't know if you know with this le to remember you prescribed me latitude and you said, I'm leaving on my trip on Friday.

966
01:20:52.260 --> 01:21:07.440
Galaxy A50: Right before so I only actually was able to get it last week and I started on Wednesday. And I don't know, I guess I'm fine. So I don't really. I don't have any side effects or anything. So I'm going to assume it's working. Okay.

967
01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:09.390
Galaxy A50: But

968
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.040
Mary Kastner: My insurance.

969
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:13.680
Galaxy A50: For those longest

970
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:31.350
Galaxy A50: Time, something about lead to death, that there was no generic and there was no copay or no coverage. So for the first three weeks or so whatever that Friday was that was your last day from the day before then until last Wednesday, they were

971
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.690
Galaxy A50: Trying to charge me 1700 dollars.

972
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:34.260
Oh,

973
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.880
Galaxy A50: Yeah.

974
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:46.290
Galaxy A50: Yeah, but then my insurance. All of a sudden, because the pharmacy made a request on my behalf and my insurance said yes, you can have it.

975
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:56.820
Galaxy A50: Edited would have been hundred and $45 copay but then I found some sort of greed coupon, which is another way that the pharmacy helped me I need to write them a Yelp review.

976
01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:07.140
Galaxy A50: So they found me a coupon. And so it ended up being $15 and I was able to afford it. No problem. You show. I'm good.

977
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:13.950
Galaxy A50: I I have similar things happen, but I felt very uplifted karma was on my side.

978
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:21.240
Galaxy A50: Some people took advantage of me but karma. That's some pretty good. So, um, yeah.

979
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:23.640
Mary Kastner: Okay.

980
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.040
Galaxy A50: I am now a self employed.

981
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:27.510
Mary Kastner: Oh,

982
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:31.500
Galaxy A50: Yeah, I got fired, right after. Will you

983
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.530
Mary Kastner: When did you yeah yeah I knew about that. Yeah.

984
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:37.200
Galaxy A50: Yes. Okay, so I went ahead and open my own

985
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:54.600
Galaxy A50: But during that time. Oh, so if you know about that, then you know how the wife got. I don't know if you remember, so I don't know what the hell happened, but my boss's wife, for some reason, apparently had a huge problem with me, which I had no idea.

986
01:22:55.650 --> 01:23:08.370
Galaxy A50: My boss, of course, tried to play into His family situation, got rid of me and through a bunch of money into promoting her business. And then I'm in her

987
01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:26.310
Galaxy A50: In her Yelp, add it actually list services that we can provide no problem. So why the hell. She is the only one doing it, you know, because if we're doing it, then it's spawn money. But if it's PR doing it. He doesn't have to share with anybody.

988
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:37.080
Galaxy A50: I got really upset when I saw that and I contacted every single one of my clients, even

989
01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:38.880
Mary Kastner: Close a case.

990
01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.270
Mary Kastner: Yeah, you told me that. Yeah, yeah.

991
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.790
Galaxy A50: No I didn't, because it just started happening.

992
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:47.160
Mary Kastner: Oh, so what were you seeing

993
01:23:48.000 --> 01:24:03.780
Galaxy A50: Oh, I opened my own so right. I think I was telling you that they're reaching out to me and I'm not responding. But after that, not only did I respond to everybody. I also just went ahead and contacted every single one in every way possible.

994
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:14.310
Galaxy A50: Even those that have discontinued, for whatever reason, like let's say they moved away. I was like, hey, if you come back just to remember I'm not there. Go over here.

995
01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:34.770
Galaxy A50: I got a really cute place with a very nice landlord. I only got to see five clients before everything went to a screeching halt. But I'm very optimistic also because up since what happened. I guess I'm better off than most people. Because I'm getting unemployment as well.

996
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:36.180
Mary Kastner: Oh, good.

997
01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.030
Galaxy A50: I'm so glad he fired me he

998
01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:50.490
Galaxy A50: One of the clients asked me, she's like my next payment schedule because I guess her payment is supposed to be skipped for November of

999
01:24:51.030 --> 01:25:05.040
Galaxy A50: April. She's like my next payment is scheduled for like may 17 do you think he'll open by them and I said, from what I know about him if he's not opened by May 17 he's not opening

1000
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:13.290
Galaxy A50: Hmm. The way I see it, he, he was so hanging by a thread and for him to try and cut off the arm that he didn't

1001
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:23.970
Galaxy A50: He, he's paying for it dearly. So yeah, to answer your question without marijuana. I am a basking in a little bit of evil glory but

1002
01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.730
Mary Kastner: So I would say your mood is not depressed.

1003
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:32.790
Galaxy A50: No, but I never get depressed.

1004
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:35.520
Mary Kastner: And anxious. How would you rate.

1005
01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:40.440
Galaxy A50: A DAD go dad goes back and forth.

1006
01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:42.210
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

1007
01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.300
Galaxy A50: Not like like this kind of anxious

1008
01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:47.730
Galaxy A50: Like

1009
01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:52.560
Galaxy A50: I think I've been good, I think.

1010
01:25:53.130 --> 01:26:00.840
Galaxy A50: Okay, anxious, was I guess when I saw one of my clients, was it last week.

1011
01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:14.070
Galaxy A50: It was like early last no yeah like early last week, I want to say like Monday or two. Oh yeah, it was like Monday, I don't know what it was, but I just felt really uneasy.

1012
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:20.850
Galaxy A50: I'm also, you know, do a good service and get used to the surroundings and stuff.

1013
01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:22.530
Galaxy A50: At the new place.

1014
01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:34.860
Galaxy A50: Last Tuesday I got. But see I don't consider that depressed to me. Depression is more like a general like a blah, like, you know, in those commercials when they hold that little on smiley face.

1015
01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:50.040
Galaxy A50: Mm hmm. I get sad, sad is different to me because sad, I feel like it has no atrophy. It's more aware of so left. I was trying to explain this to Shawn. So I have two sets of emotions last Tuesday and last Thursday.

1016
01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:56.310
Galaxy A50: On Tuesday, I got really sad because I woke up I it's like the way I wake up.

1017
01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:07.470
Galaxy A50: I woke up with this really sad feeling that this entire time, all I was making was $16 an hour. There's servers to make more money than me.

1018
01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:27.120
Galaxy A50: And I just, I was like, I cannot believe this men for two over two years now thought that $16 an hour is all that I'm worth and have the nerve to tell me that he's actually going to be, I'm going to be making less, but I'm going to have way more duties now.

1019
01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:28.530
Mary Kastner: What

1020
01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:44.670
Galaxy A50: Kind of person and then by Thursday, like I was trying to explain this to Sean. She didn't get it at first by Thursday I had the same exact thought but a different point of view, I was like, I can't believe that motherfucker thought I was gonna keep working for him.

1021
01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:54.690
Galaxy A50: So I wasn't. But it's the same thing. It's just, I don't know how my brain does it

1022
01:27:54.930 --> 01:27:59.400
Galaxy A50: I didn't do it on purpose. I just somehow was looking at it from a different window.

1023
01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:02.190
Mary Kastner: Yeah. And are you sleeping. Okay.

1024
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:11.550
Galaxy A50: Um, yes. I hate this not doing shit thing because then I wake up whenever and I go to bed, whenever

1025
01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:29.670
Galaxy A50: But yeah, I've been so so here's the thing. The reason why I did really kind of bad at the mediation was because it was kind of far because that back then I used to live there. It's like 45 minutes away. And, you know, oh my phone is, I'm sorry.

1026
01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:32.490
Galaxy A50: Can you hear me.

1027
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.290

Galaxy A50: So I didn't sleep well at all. And I had a very strange dream and I usually don't remember my dreams unless they're like oh Minish I guess so. I woke up in this mood. Like, not even moved. I was just like, I mean, things were going to not go well.

1034
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:21.600

Galaxy A50: I'm not good with downers but it's okay.

1106

1154
01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:40.590
Brock Goldberg: When, when I was so I had a I had a good conversation with the doctor last time, and it was

1155
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:50.790
Brock Goldberg: After my father passed away when I was 17 years old times are hard. It was really hard for me to just, you know, deal with it. So what did I do

1156
01:39:51.270 --> 01:40:04.050
Brock Goldberg: I partied, you know, and maybe I partied a little bit harder than most people. Um, but I was just trying to hide everything that was going on inside and that lasted for a few years.

1157
01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:12.390
Brock Goldberg: But now, for the past decade, my whole life's been completely different and especially

1158
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:14.160
Brock Goldberg: Now that I know that

1159
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:36.660
Brock Goldberg: What my pain comes from and being able to you know control it and just kind of live a life. So it's more of a story than just, you know, I, I took a lot of drugs to do this together and everyone has a story. Um, but it was a short window of time for me that I was just masking my feelings.

1160
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:37.650
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1161
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:41.760
Brock Goldberg: I didn't realize also that I had fibromyalgia, so

1162
01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:45.090
Brock Goldberg: It was definitely a challenge, back then, but

1163
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.920
