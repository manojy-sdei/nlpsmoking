00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in your office you want that door open back there.

2
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.530
couldn't help it.

3
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, sure, have been thinking about Jeff hoping that you're

4
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being kind to yourself, you know, just mostly just just sending out this sort of gentle vibe of

5
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

6
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Kindness.

7
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Try

8
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.600
Nick: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. It's like I'm

9
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:13.980
Nick: Ben fine Saturday was like, well, you know, I was like, a bit like bread that a lot of times, people who are in therapy like like digging up memories and stuff like that.

10
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.620
Nick: Yeah, kind of shitty sometimes after

11
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.100
Nick: I was like it was a certain point where is like 10 minutes afternoon. I was like, wait, just something happened and I'm going to like always feel this way my entire life is like.

12
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.770
Nick: It's like, oh, no, it's just like that bodies and like a stress response kind of thing.

13
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It is in a stress response. So we need to continue to work in desensitize a gnat and integrating some positive neural networks around it so

14
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really glad you're here so that we can do that. It is, and I try to sort of give a warning that

15
00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll feel like someone like took a pound of flesh from you. I mean, it was you did very hard work and what it what we found out is there was pieces and I'm guessing there's other pieces in there that have been blocked off. Cut off for self preservation

16
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And the mind knows exactly how to self preserve and keep you sane.

17
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice that it finds its way in intrusive self esteem, it finds its way in there to be known, so that we can completely change it because there's no there's no need for you to have any guilt.

18
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no need for you to have the shame and there's no need for you to have a deficiency in self esteem. But psychologically like it.

19
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes sense that you would have come to these these experiences.

20
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you didn't get this therapy, a long time ago because you didn't have right because when we do well what are, what are the resources for this, this young man, he has to go to nature. He hasn't go you know he doesn't go to people.

21
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's a lie. You have a lot of people that have just been on reliable and untrustworthy.

22
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And we got to change that we got to get those people into your life so you can trust them.

23
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And have these sort of therapeutic healing relationships for some people, Nick, it's in here. I might be the first person that they're like they're trying on what it feels like to trust someone

24
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, they'll, they'll try on a leave and they'll even get a little angry with me or they'll, they'll work through disappointment or discussed or and my job is just to not

25
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Disappear with it to hold that and contain it. So if those big feelings come up. Just don't abandon therapy.

26
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just know that I'm not ever. I'm never going to take it out on you. You may feel like it though. That's the tricky bit. You may feel abandoned you may feel like you're you're being hurt but I promise you.

27
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I schedule appointments sometimes and I have made the mistake and I did it this month I'll make him I'm human. So I sometimes I've accidentally double booked people are just now. I was late.

28
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I will make mistakes, but I promise you it's not intentional to hurt you. Your job is to hold on to yourself. And if you can bring them up to me.

29
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.360
Okay.

30
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So today.

31
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk a little bit about this concept of

32
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.870
Of guilt.

33
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you that rally around at all this weekend.

34
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.680
Nick: Um, you know, like

35
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.840
Nick: Not really. So what what actually was happening as

36
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.330
Nick: I kind of quickly got over like whatever was happening then

37
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.850
Nick: But it's kind of been like

38
00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:08.400
Nick: Really like melancholy. Like, I think, yeah, I think that I'm not like specifically in relation to that, like, I'm pretty sure like mostly like that's rationalized like that that memory, and for the most part, but I've really been thinking about other things like

39
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:19.740
Nick: Like for example, like my like my ex relationship and you know you said like, at one point, you know, it's, I won't respond in like anger, but I'll respond in like

40
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:30.450
Nick: A different way. And so I kind of like have been moving my head around that and like not being like so angry, but I just like makes me sad. You know, like thinking about it like feeling so

41
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.700
Nick: What I'm getting at is, I think, like,

42
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.070
Nick: In certain aspects. I'm like feeling things like

43
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.750
Well,

44
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe they match better. I mean, right.

45
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's a better match, maybe. Sad, really matches grief. I'm I lost an image of myself and have I was going to be a husband and then we'd have kids like we're grieving.

46
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is grief and sad is a very standard right response melancholy to coming to terms with. Here's my expectation and here's reality. Yeah. Oh, what a difference. Oh, they look so different. They look so different. Ah, so painful. I'm grieving this expectations image of myself.

47
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's what you the next step after that that becomes the problem if you now label as if you're not supposed to be grieving.

48
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not supposed to be sad. That's the one that gets risky. We're, we're supposed to feel sad. What kind of sociopath, would you be if you didn't grieve the loss of a of a branch or something like of course you are.

49
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.060
Nick: Yeah, right.

50
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the meaning you put on top of that is if you're not supposed to feel sad that matches.

51
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay

52
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're sad and I'm curious about the thoughts that are going on. Also,

53
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.820
Nick: Yeah, well,

54
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.460
Nick: I think it's okay.

55
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.240
Nick: Like the thoughts kind of

56
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.760
Nick: Surrounding that, you know, I guess.

57
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:21.480
Nick: You said, Have you felt guilt. Well, maybe not surrounding that one experience but weirdly like my sister. I was they came out with my sister, the other day, and

58
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.940
Nick: Her boyfriend like called her and he's like, kind of as a problem with like

59
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:36.240
Nick: Being controlling a little bit. Not like abusive, but like, kind of like always checking up on her a particular and I thought I heard me in that phone call.

60
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:46.710
Nick: And I was like holy shit. Like, no wonder. So I've definitely been experiencing like a sense of like

61
00:07:48.030 --> 00:08:00.660
Nick: No wonder this person did that, like, you know, so I probably turn that into like maybe unhealthy guilt or something. Okay, but just seeing like, hey, I need to change.

62
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now that's that's healthy

63
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.610
Yeah, that's more

64
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.070
Nick: Like of course you like I'm warning, like the past of like what happened there.

65
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:26.430
Nick: But like I definitely see an opportunity to be like, I don't want to be that guy on the phone, who's like so terrified like to lose someone who's like not even in any way like against him. You know, so are you ready. I know.

66
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So the neat thing is the power that you get is being able to label that

67
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And if if you say, oh, I need to change or look at that. My and security is what maybe this other guy was doing it. But look, I see his insecurity.

68
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I don't want to do that I'll end up pushing maybe pushing people away or irritating people or it's an unpleasant conversation on the phone that just could have been a nice little. Hey, how was your day is this whole like sparring match.

69
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Defensiveness and

70
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, almost like a parent child thing. It's like, wait, ripples here. And if you can just say, oh yeah, I'd like to do more of this and less of this then. Okay. But if your next thought is on the cause of the end of my marriage. I'm a shit. Well, then we're not at a healthy place.

71
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.260
Nick: Yeah.

72
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if that's where you're going with it.

73
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.050
Nick: That's the balance that I'm trying to find

74
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:37.830
Nick: I definitely am getting like parts of that, like, I mean, at what point is to help you to accept like second responsibility for things is the real question.

75
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.930
Nick: I think that I'm like

76
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:41.940
Probably

77
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.140
Nick: Responsible like and I don't know how to not feel that

78
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You can look for. You don't know. There's no way for us to know we

79
00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We wish we could so that we can have a perfect relationship in the future and always feel happy. And so we want to push into the future and predict it and control it.

80
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And we try to do that by we can analyze ourselves and say, well, if I make this change. Why then this will be then I'll then this horrible thing won't happen. Yeah.

81
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: All you have is right now. And as soon as you drift off into trying to control the future about something you've gone too far or you're going into the past.

82
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And beating yourself up and saying, See, see you can't do anything about that and you don't know. You don't know the real recipe. There's a whole other human being involved here a whole human being.

83
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That may have realizations, much like what you're going through. She may not have this realization for another five years or maybe next week. I don't know.

84
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But you you you don't know this whole other humans experience your it's not 100% your fault. Okay, but what you do have some sale or is how you meet

85
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.880
Your next moment.

86
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

87
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's this balance if you want, just for now. If you want to say, okay, well, what do I do with it. How do I manage accountability and not getting

88
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Into this shame cyclone right we just start going down. You're going to know it when you catch a label about yourself. You're going to know that the fastest. You say, Well, if I find

89
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm an asshole. I don't know what you call yourself or whatever, then that doesn't move. There's no growth. There's no solution in an asshole. But there is is

90
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is the part that I want to know.

91
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do more of, let's just start there. And then the next question is going to be, what do you want to do less of, let's just go into when you said I want to change something. So what is the thing you want to do more of

92
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.660
Nick: Probably

93
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:02.250
Nick: Regulating those like extreme emotions, it's probably a good one, like inhibited.

94
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

95
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just see if we already have a goal in here already written out for that one.

96
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we've got an action Rana tryna uh let's let's get real specific on that. How often, and we can add more emotional regulation skills, but why don't we just increased how how many times a day. Are you doing the box breathing.

97
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.710
Nick: Usually when feeling really probably two or three times a day.

98
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.580
Okay.

99
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you had remembered to do them a few more times. Can you picture, you might have

100
00:12:51.330 --> 00:13:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Had that that gap between stimulus like that irritation and aggravation and response that if you had access to emotional regulation, if you could regulate that you might have been able to create time patients and choice.

101
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You have that sense.

102
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.510
Nick: I think I'm

103
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:19.980
Nick: Thinking think that that's probably generally like an illusion to like anger and stuff like that.

104
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:26.760
Nick: Yeah, please. In my understanding, and I definitely have that like I've been really good with that, like, I haven't

105
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.690
Nick: irrationally angry except like one time in the past week.

106
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.410
Nick: But my real concern is like when it's like really sad and

107
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.990
Nick: Glass say like I was just like, pretty like said about stuff. And I kind of

108
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.920
Nick: Started to like breathe and then it

109
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.750
Nick: I mean, I'm trying to remember that outcome. Like, I don't think

110
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:59.640
Nick: I think it kind of didn't make me not sad, you know, I mean, like, obviously there. Yeah, you were on that.

111
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that right

112
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: As I want to do. I do want to do a little bit of the that em Dr around what you just talked about, about the sad, but a real quick. I want to finish what this part got started. Here we go.

113
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Eat. I want to emotionally regulate that's kind of your goal, right, you want to have a better. Okay, so let me just write that. Oops. Say it in your own words. So I can put it in quotes. I like to hear what people say.

114
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:34.770
Nick: Yeah, I think it was I think the word. We're going to better regularly extreme emotions.

115
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:35.730
There we go.

116
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.470
Okay.

117
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. So the objective. This is how we're going to get there. This is just one task among many, but this is one you're going to increase the frequency from three times a day to five.

118
00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just do that. Okay, now you already told me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. I can really see its utility around angry yeah yeah but sad tends to be sort of a more, let's say,

119
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And mobilizing emotion. Right. It's not fight. It's not a fleet, it's a it's down regulation, the heart rate is probably already low

120
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the breathing is probably already low. So then when I, you know, then I asked you to do this, breathing, you're like, well, but I'm in a relaxed body so you know what's not relaxed is your mind.

121
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where I really wonder. And that's why I want to do this, this work with you right now and is because I think you may be still having some of that labeling of yourself. I just really do think it might be going on. Can we can we, kind of, kind of get into some of the am Dr. Now,

122
00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, cool, cool, cool. Um, let me make sure I got messed up. We blue light handy, or is it

123
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think

124
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.080
We're going to do

125
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.900
Can you

126
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of get in touch with your, with your team of resources can kind of be present with that.

127
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Be in touch with sort of this spirit of the mountain and forest.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And

129
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I also wonder

130
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It and want to keep trying to carve out finding someone an actual person.

131
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's a great grandma or you saw it somewhere that really sort of embodies in a human, maybe even someone that you experienced a brief moment of it or you felt either wise, right.

132
00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise figure nurturing for your what we have my grandfather as as protected. We've got a real person on that one. It'd be nice to have nurturing figure

133
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And even if it's me because it has to be me. So be it will start there, because then you'll recognize what you see in me and then someone else later on. You may say, You know what, I recognize that quality and so on. So, to an auntie that I only saw once or so scan.

134
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.090

136
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So just sort of get in touch with her for a minute. Okay, just sort of picture her nurturing quality and I'm going to do and I'm

137
00:17:49.110 --> 00:18:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: really slow. If you were here in front of me, I would probably be having the the buzzers. Or maybe I would ask to be tapping tapping the outside of your, your knees. I would kind of be. But we got to work with what we got here.

138
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

139
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to kind of close your eyes for just a moment and really be with the crowd, the presence of the quality of Christiana, notice how you said, very much so.

145
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And have them interacting in some way. Sometimes they met a morph into some other being but just have them interacting in some way.

146
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring in this presence of a wise figure

147
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.210

Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me what thoughts or beliefs are coming up.

167
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.680
Nick: As its kind of tossing around the other different images and

168
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.610
Nick: Haven't really fully came up in terms of like thoughts but it's definitely like feeling like relaxation

169
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:17.940
Nick: And

170
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did you notice that in the body. Where do you know for sure. Your body will tell you if you're really

171
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Relaxed right like definitely like

172
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.360

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.520
Nick: Limbs

174
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.150
Tingling and limbs and things like that.

175
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:38.490
Like

176
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:42.930
Nick: Almost like

177
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.120
Nick: Chest is like

178
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.660
Nick: Full of water, almost like

179
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.420
Yeah.

180
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your emotion right now.

181
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.920
Nick: I'm really just like tranquil, I would say, okay,

182
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So this might be good timing to visit now bring up into your awareness, the recollection of sadness probably over the last few days.

183
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: THE WORST piece of that image.

184
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be whatever you want. Don't, don't get hung up on something you think I want to was the worst piece of that.

185
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst Picture. What are you picturing

186
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.210
Nick: I'm barely picturing like

187
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.760
Nick: As like what, yeah. It's like watching the show and like

188
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.540
Nick: Someone in like Florida South Carolina and so

189
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.450
Nick: To me that brought up like

190
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.590
Nick: Probably like memories of like

191
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.040
Nick: adventures with like my ex and like

192
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.050
Nick: Yeah, probably, like, a lot of really

193
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:10.020
Nick: You know, as I as like looking at the Spanish moss and I was like, oh wait, like I was like thinking how beautiful it was, but how like

194
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:22.020
Nick: There's probably at least in the foreseeable future. Not a chance that I could like visit the south east and be like happy with it, basically.

195
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay I can't be happy with the southeast.

196
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.860
Nick: Yeah, because of the memories of, like, I guess.

197
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:37.410
Nick: What we're great memories turn to what is now loss associated with it.

198
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the belief about yourself.

199
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.870
Nick: Probably surrounding that.

200
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.520
Nick: I would say the label that I that I put on myself is like

201
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.400
Nick: I'm abrasive

202
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're going to call that the negative belief the negative cognition, so I know I said I can't be happy with the SE because right those memories you you've now more emphasized them somehow.

203
00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: They were good, and now you're not allowed to have them be good.

204
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.830
Nick: Yeah, because they they were

205
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.200
Nick: Good, but

206
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:31.350
Nick: They were good, because of the person that was in them along with the experiences. But now that the person is gone. It's like

207
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.530
Nick: Kind of like

208
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.780
Nick: When you multiply a positive and a negative, it becomes negative, so

209
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:40.650
Nick: The fact that there's

210
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.840
Nick: Negative factor news. Well, is it

211
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Person's gone so the memory is different now.

212
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm afraid of you to kind of pull into your into your mind the worst piece about imagery. Okay, only you know what that is.

213
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And this negative con concept of abrasive

214
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And this iteration is going to be faster. The light is going to be faster. We'll do it for about 30 seconds, hold it into your mind, I'm abrasive and that most intense image and picture.

215
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: In together nice inhaling to the tummy.

216
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

217
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling letting it all go

218
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what comes up.

219
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.130
Nick: Just kind of

220
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:13.380
Nick: Thinking of like

221
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:25.590
Nick: Phone calls, similar to the one that I experienced like with my stepsister the other day and help people kind of like we can have that person sounded and how

222
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:27.690
Nick: That like

223
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.610
Nick: Scared little boy was like is me basically

224
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Go with that scared little boy is me pull up that image. Remember that one, you just have a little bit ago that Worst Picture scared little boys me hold those together your awareness.

225
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst Picture and scared little boys me on those types of phone calls.

226
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together nice belly breath.

227
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling it all out, letting it go

228
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Once again, noticing what comes up.

229
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.150
Well,

230
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.340
Part of it. Yeah.

231
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.920
Nick: Basically like

232
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.830
Nick: The Acts of

233
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.930
Nick: That I'm like not

234
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:24.840
Nick: Very

235
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.740
Nick: Proud of generally come from.

236
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.190
Nick: Places of like vulnerability

237
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When I'm vulnerable. I do things. I'm not proud of. Yeah.

238
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.430
Nick: Pretty much and I'm

239
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.390
Nick: Like I definitely like

240
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.630
Nick: You know, make makes me like understanding, like a little more like

241
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.660
Nick: where that's coming from

242
00:28:55.230 --> 00:29:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to go without okay hold on to that important piece when I'm vulnerable. I do things. I'm not proud of, and I understand it more

243
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And that negative bit

244
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: right with that. Worst Picture that you were trying on earlier hold that together with

245
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: When I'm vulnerable. I do things. I'm not proud of, and I, I understand.

246
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:20.340
More

247
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You only need to look at the light on either side. You don't have to watch it in the middle. I know it's hard and it's assessed.

248
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: May want to switch back a little bit. I don't know if that straining your eyes and wants you to get hurt.

249
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together. Inhale into the belly.

250
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale it out.

251
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Miss attunement to yourself via the visceral the body, the mind.

252
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: thoughts and beliefs.

253
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And do

254
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: don't edit yourself just let it just let it flow.

255
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:48.120
Nick: Yeah, so that person doing bad things.

256
00:30:49.470 --> 00:31:01.410
Nick: I don't think that they're like exonerated of responsibility for the things that you know the scared little boy, there'll be in me would do, but I think it

257
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.840
Nick: Can at least like rationalize it and

258
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.140
I think like

259
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.960
Nick: Understand the reason why

260
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.270
It's kind of like

261
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.850
Nick: Like if I were outside myself like looking at which I kind of just was like, it's kind of pitiful like

262
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.790
Nick: Seeing like a person likes it terrified to

263
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.570
Nick: Lose that

264
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.160
Nick: This person can even like

265
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.260
Steal

266
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.820
like normal, like emotions at all times. Like,

267
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.510
Nick: I can't really let live in because of all the fear.

268
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.450

Let's go.

274
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's a pretty powerful one. I can't let love in because of all the fear hold that WORST piece of that image that you had right those men. I think it was still about those memories or you know whatever that that image was

275
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well those together can't love can't let love in because here.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.300
Nick: Like the courage to be able to

282
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.970
Nick: Take things on without

283
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.010
deflecting

284
00:33:52.110 --> 00:34:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So remember, earlier you had a self concept a negative one of I'm abrasive. Now, what's the positive one. You want to be thinking about yourself. I want to help this self concept of I am what

285
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Courageous. Yeah.

286
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to do this next iteration, it'll be slower. Make sure you're, you're not too close your eyes to get strained and right now I want you to bring up your team can you bring them up into your mind really immerse yourself with them.

287
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with nurturing

288
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with protective quality and wisdom and give me a little nod and you're really in it. Not imagery

289
00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the mountain and for us to

290
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.430
Yeah.

291
00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: hold those team members in your mind's eye with I am courageous.

292
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Courageous.

293
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And with the quality of nurturing its protection and wisdom.

294
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it there. And for a brief moment invite that worst image that you had earlier. See if you can pull it up.

295
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You still surrounded by this team.

296
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And a belief in the self, I am courageous and let's open your eyes. This will be slower. Make sure you're not too, too close. So don't want to strain your eyes.

297
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold them in your awareness.

298
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice inhale into the mouse.

299
00:36:53.700 --> 00:37:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale quite deliberately letting it all go empty out that long really nice and flat let it all out.

300
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to what comes up.

301
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:19.710
Nick: It's kind of like

302
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.470
Nick: All of those qualities and

303
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.820
Nick: The protective, you know, the whatever they are.

304
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.220
Nick: They are, they kind of came together like images like

305
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:41.610
Nick: Like a white plasma like swirling like a like a dust devil or like a cyclone or something like that or a tornado.

306
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:44.460
And

307
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.650
Nick: Any thing that kind of came through.

308
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.100
Nick: Was just like shredded like any kind of like

309
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.430
Nick: Thing that was like sad or

310
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.890
Nick: Bad images of like

311
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.440
Nick: We're kind of like shredded in the

312
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Cyclone and the cyclone gets really got started. Yeah, maybe like a

313
00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.740
Nick: Like a raging hot Inferno like

314
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.340
Nick: Like a firestorm kind of thing. And it was kind of like

315
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.120
Nick: Like shut it up in that

316
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go with that. And she'll hold that imagery

317
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I am courageous and hold that negative image that you had earlier THE WORST piece of it.

318
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale.

319
00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale,

320
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just noticing what comes up.

321
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.130
Nick: That

322
00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.610
There's an opportunity to be able to take on

323
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.180
These sorts of things that are happening and

324
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:50.760
Kind of like

325
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.300
Nick: Yesterday I like have this

326
00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:13.950
Nick: Profound like well the Preface is like like my friend gave me like a little bit of a, like a weed cookie like a little tiny bit and I didn't think I ate enough to get really high and I ate like this little tiny bite, but he wound up being like really strong and so normally I panic.

327
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.100
Nick: And as this like

328
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.780
Nick: whirlwind of emotions was like coming around me. I was like,

329
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.590
Nick: Like steadfast and calm, because I

330
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.660
Nick: In my life like at least I'm doing something about it like

331
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.560
Like, although things are like

332
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.650
Kind of rocky, it could be some doing something

333
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: In terms of emotional healing and like trying to dressing. So I think I'm doing something about my emotional healing. Yeah.

334
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.100
Okay.

335
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A little extra something here. I want you to picture, whether it be maybe you're nurturing figure, you're protected figure or you're wise figure. See if there's something that one of them could do to help you.

336
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's a question to something you want to ask them to do for you.

337
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up with that invitation.

338
00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.140
Nick: It's pretty vague, but

339
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.350
Nick: I'm asking like the

340
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.040
Nick: Kind of like the spirit of, like, you know, the earth like

341
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.700
Nick: How to make sense of everything. Okay. Okay.

342
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go with that. I want you to really picture. Give yourself permission to ask your question.

343
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you, what's the question, can you help me make sense of

344
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I make sense of all of this. How do I make sense of all of this. Okay, so picture you're still with every your whole team but directed to this spirit earth he be with protection, the quality as well as nurse runs

345
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.420
Let's see what comes up. Okay.

346
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: How do we make sense of all this. Let's look at this light.

347
00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: interest not to to close.

348
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice just now.

349
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.610
answer would be.

350
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about the answer. A B.

351
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:36.990
Nick: And I think it was really like

352
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:41.130
You don't need to

353
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's go with that the answer from spirit. Earth is you don't need

354
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: To know how to make sense of all of this.

355
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Without censoring what are you noticing.

356
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.740
Nick: Like to be in a position to just

357
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:38.670
Nick: Experience and not

358
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:41.610
Kind of

359
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.940
See everything through this lens of

360
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.070
Nick: Mistrust or

361
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.020
Nick: Kind of like

362
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.690
Nick: Negative views or

363
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.910
Make any kind of like judgmental way to say it, just like

364
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Scan your resources, real quick, who has information. Is it planet, right, is it spirit earth cristiana your grandfather someone else that you can ask

365
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: About the maybe the lens, they use, how do they need the world without mistrust. How do they trust, but make it your own question. And what they go

366
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.210
Nick: Through practicing mindfulness

367
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.780
Nick: I've had glimpses of that being really effective before

368
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.810
Nick: Probably think if anyone were to say that

369
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go with that Nick. I've had glimpses of the value of mindfulness. Now I want you to pull up that worst image. Remember, long ago you were talking about those memories and

370
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The worst piece.

371
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I've had a glimpse of this practice of mindfulness

372
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And how to meet a world, how you meet the world.

373
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, in your awareness. I've had a glimpse, and it's practicing the mindfulness

374
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold that force negative image, only you know what that is.

375
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And attacks. Hello. That was nice and slow, and with intention. There you go.

376
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice cool gentle pace.

377
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: attuning to yourself in this moment without censoring

378
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.410
What's coming up, you're gonna

379
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.140
Always go back to the picture like

380
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.360
Just a river.

381
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:15.150
Nick: Like it's like a river, just like floating or like just like little just quickly but slowly like moving by and

382
00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:19.710
I think

383
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.520
Nick: The answer is something like that.

384
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.980
Nick: Feeling is like somewhere in like

385
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:34.500
This balance between being able to understand that.

386
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:43.410
Nick: That like at the end of the day, like nothing that happens is like a big enough to to like

387
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:45.420
Nick: Crush someone

388
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.240
Nick: But there's also

389
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.990
Nick: But you also need to give life enough like meaning to where you're not like a nihilist

390
00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:58.890
Nick: So I don't know. I think there's just some blend somewhere.

391
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: She tell me what emotion, you're feeling

392
00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You look confused.

393
00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.390
Nick: Yeah, I would. I would probably have a blend between like

394
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:22.770
Nick: tranquility, but also like trying to like

395
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.660
Nick: really figure out like yeah confusion.

396
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.070
Nick: Yeah.

397
00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So the body is the body tranquil

398
00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: The body is yeah and confused. Is this much like what a weekend is like for you, where you sit with the confusion. Am I supposed to be sad is the status forever is who I am is that

399
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a common familiar experience this confusion.

400
00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:55.590
Nick: Not really.

401
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.200
Decide. Yeah.

402
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This is this is new.

403
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.690
Nick: This is unfamiliar.

404
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:04.530
Okay.

405
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So once again, help me there was this sense of both there's this is it a balancing of understanding and something else. And what's the meaning of my life like that or what was it,

406
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:18.960
Nick: Like, I think.

407
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:29.220
Nick: I've gotten to the point where you know rationalized everything that ever happens in life, like, Oh, well, we're just a bunch of

408
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:45.570
Nick: Floating evolved like monkeys on a rock coursing through space and millions of billions of lives billions of died, nothing that we do really hold significant meaning like I've had that experience to try to rationalize things

409
00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.660
But there's also like

410
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like there needs to be a balance of, like, and there has to be meaning. That's the opposite of that. Isn't it

411
00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you got a good one, we're right at the top of the hour, but next. That's a really good when you're you're facing some existential stuff.

412
00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Got this imagery, you've given yourself this, this freedom to have forgiveness and acceptance, it's not that big a deal.

413
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. You can maybe picture yourself looking down at the planet. We're all just a bunch of like it's just a bunch of who cares kind of things. Right. And yet, how do I also give things, meaning

414
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Oh, you're on to some really important stuff.

415
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And since I don't have a lot of time. I want to schedule another appointment with you my next clients knocking on the door, but I want what I'm thinking is

416
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: In the short term,

417
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation instead of going to right. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know which you're you're asking a big existential question. We know we all are faced with this in our development all faced with that.

418
00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If it turns out, and I'm not trying to sell you on something.

419
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: In any kind of slick way. I'm just saying if until you find your own, you might want to play with it might end up being

420
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That love is really the only thing

421
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That what you give

422
00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you notice I this person showing me love in their own way, what you decide to focus on when it comes to love.

423
00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the only thing that's important. What you're doing is living in fear and you're acting out and you don't really like the way it went. You were treated with fear and ignorance and you hurt.

424
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The opposite of fear is love. When you're in love with yourself and others in a very broad way I'm saying it. There's no fear. They don't actually exist at the same time.

425
00:52:49.260 --> 00:53:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to play with something over this week, or days when we next each other just play with that a little bit. You can argue with me and say, No, that's not true sort of as a Socratic sort of discussion in this seeking of understanding and how to balance.

426
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: In my experience, and religion seems to offer lots of different approaches. Right. It ends up being love

427
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: People hurt us out of fear. Fear of scarcity fear. There's they're not enough, they don't have enough someone else has more. I need to keep my stuff. I'm going to fight for it. I'm going to hurt us. You don't take my stuff. There's only a little bit of stuff when we're in love.

428
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got it all to share. IT'S ALL I'M NOT AFRAID THERE'S ENOUGH. I don't live in scarcity.

429
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just play with it and see what comes up for you see where it see where it goes. When do you want to meet again.

430
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know you're watching your finances, you gotta pay attention to that. I understand.

431
00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:05.070
Nick: The weird thing is I got a claim for my insurance saying that they covered Braveheart like for one of their appointments so I'm like, trying to find filling and see, like, why is my insurance coverage.

432
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So go and I would say log into virtual clinic and and speak with I think it's Krista bending.

433
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm Krista bi n and i n g

434
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And asked because maybe it's just a matter of a particular filing some little thing needs to be done. That's a good sign.

435
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:32.160
Nick: Yeah, like I have no ideas from other people in ritual clinic.

436
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not trained for it. I'm telling you, say, hey, I understand. I'm going to go ahead and ask to speak with Krista Benning not I'm gonna have to speak with the owner. Okay, so just that's all nice and everybody's just kind of move your way up. Yeah. All right.

437
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to reach out to me with the next time.

438
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:53.130
Or

439
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.450
Nick: Are you doing Saturdays still

440
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's right. Now I am I seem to be able to be handling not okay. I'm really likes that early so either seven or eight o'clock.

441
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:11.310
Nick: Yeah, I think, eight or seven, I think.

442
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: 730

443
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.320
Nick: Yeah, I think 730 cents. Great.

444
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I can go on half hour because it's the weekend and then everybody else because I don't have any else anyone else booked and then it'll just be on the half hour at that point. So there we go, 730 we got that in place and I would jump right into virtual clinic right away you know

445
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:37.290
Nick: I'll let you know if that for some reason doesn't work. Like if buildings all messed up. So I will talk to Christina. Thank you.

446
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome. You did some hard work today.

447
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm proud of you. Thank you for your help. You bet. Because you deserve.

448
00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:58.860
Sean

449
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so we got a little bit of an elite moment, just because I was talking to someone. So let me open up the note for you.

450
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But while I'm opening up and know you can kind of fill me in a little bit about maybe how you been feeling maybe emotions and they've been up and down, or how you been doing

451
00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:31.230
Shaun w: I've been doing all right just working working a lot but

452
00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think about work and I'm always sort of hoping boy. I hope it stays interesting for Sean

453
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:37.800
Yeah.

454
00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what

455
00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.690
I remember saying

456
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.400
Shaun w: Yeah.

457
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still a challenge for you, right, because you're like the point. First, you really are doing a specialized task.

458
00:56:51.270 --> 00:57:01.050
Shaun w: Now just they assigned me a position my boss bought me dinner said that he appreciate my work that I worked really hard for him and he bought me dinner.

459
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

460
00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.370
Shaun w: That was pretty cool. Feels good. It's nice to be

461
00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.730
Shaun w: Isn't it yeah I was pretty cool them.

462
00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Now again, I'm still opening up a note here so I'm a little distracted.

463
00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Any, anything else, sort of, you know, in groups. I only have like 20 seconds to hear from people

464
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hardly a group, it's a it's really just a sort of a

465
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of a point of departure. You know, I bring up a topic. And this is really where we get to talk a little bit more about it did. Was there anything lingering that maybe you wanted to say. And there wasn't enough time.

466
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:42.690
Shaun w: No, I was I was fine.

467
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright. And let's see.

468
00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Just curious. The

469
00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Over this last month I've had a lot of success, doing the the EM Dr work in here through telemedicine.

470
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but I don't know if you feel enough trust here.

471
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: For us. Oh, y'all. You don't know what it is. I'll tell you.

472
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's your truly God today. I'm so sorry. I'll have to be doing that.

473
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.290
Shaun w: Weird

474
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:35.670
Shaun w: I know it looks weird.

475
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to get too distracted by it, you can always laugh at me, but

476
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, um,

477
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I movement.

478
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Desensitization and Reprocessing now the actual I movement isn't the absolute necessary part. It's the bilateral stimulation. So, for example,

479
00:58:57.330 --> 00:59:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You might have. If you are here with me, you would have

480
00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Two little buzzers. One would be in your in your left hand and one would be in your right and you would have this bilateral awareness and what it does. Now I can't do that with you.

481
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I can do is I have this light that can go from left to right in front of you, if you're on a laptop. If not, I do this adjusted approach.

482
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But the bottom line is the mechanism of change is that this bilateral movement.

483
00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It distracts the mind enough so that, let's say there's pieces you know how you've identified as having a post traumatic stress disorder, right, you've got some symptoms and some interesting stuff that might even be happening at night when you're sleeping.

484
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So what this work does is it allows you to reprocess that

485
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Even before that you get to be desensitized from it, which means it won't be as distressing. You know how you've described symptoms of

486
00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I've got one right in front of me. I've got have strong negative feelings, such as fear or anger guilt or shame like that was a high one. So the idea behind it would be

487
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To not have that kind of intensity anymore to be desensitized from it and the reprocessing is let's say there's a particular memory. You don't want to be

488
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want that unconscious sort of intruding on your life anymore. You want to have a different experience with it.

489
01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What can happen is, and I can't explain it all at once because some pretty complex phenomenon. But what we do is you bring you don't have to tell me the neat thing about this is if you ever say

490
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I don't want to have to tell you all my stories. I don't want to tell you all the gruesome details, that's okay. That's what's neat about this approach. It's not storytelling where you

491
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, everything you did. All you do is you hold it in your awareness, you pull it up from your memory you hold it there.

492
01:00:50.490 --> 01:01:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I do this bilateral stimulation, I might ask you to have a particular resources resourcing that's a positive installation. We also might do putting a positive cognition, because maybe you have a belief, I'm

493
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm incapable, you know, so some people have that one. That might be one. And what we do is we replace it. We want to replace it with it. I'm capable. So if there was an experience in one's life of helplessness. What's nice is

494
01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We can loosen up that network and we can bring in some positive cognition, because the basic premise Sean is that our brain right you know that it's not a spiritual thing. It's an Oregon.

495
01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

496
01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.710
Shaun w: In our brain and

497
01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There's little, little our thoughts are actually just these little

498
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Synaptic responses. It's like chemistry. It is our thoughts, our chemistry doesn't feel like that. Does it doesn't feel like there's a chemistry going on up and in our brain. It feels almost like feels almost spiritual doesn't it like so personal.

499
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:52.830
No.

500
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:54.600
Shaun w: No.

501
01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not real, try and explain it. How does it

502
01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:01.110
Shaun w: Turn Tony little older.

503
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point is, if there was an alien coming down to this plan. I won't dovetail off topic too far. But how would you explain a thought to something like a dude. I don't know. Right.

504
01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.040
Shaun w: Yeah. Is it something we don't know.

505
01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the best we have is to say, okay,

506
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What's happening is an Oregon has these these synaptic connections and they're firing you have over here somewhere. A whole network of, let's say, let's say you've had, which we've sort of established you've had some traumatic events.

507
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: They may be cut off from positive thoughts they might sit in isolation and might be difficult to get to in a volitional and an on purpose way.

508
01:02:52.200 --> 01:03:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What this em Dr work can allow us to do is to actually loosen them up so they're not this dissociated separate part of you that you have access to all of yourself.

509
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can start to have more positive empowering connections, they'll stop intruding into the unconscious. And the neat thing is let's say you know one of the huge symptoms for people that have this PTSD is their, their vigilant, like they they feel as if

510
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That historical event, the intensity is happening right now. You can feel that scary that enraging that helpless and what can happen through this process.

511
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

512
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's set in the past. Now there's a distance from it and it's not felt as if it's being relived so that now new moments you meet a new person. And oh, you know, normally, that guy, boy, he would have

513
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have just been tripping right i wouldn't really have this big reaction. And now I notice

514
01:03:53.970 --> 01:04:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's his issue. It's not mine. He's not a threat to me because there's a jerk and I don't need to talk to him. So that's kind of the goal. It's sort of just say the science behind it. The hippocampus is the one that holds all your, like all those memories.

515
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And what can happen with the, the amygdala is this rush of emotion. Typically, it's a

516
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: threat response can cut off the ability of the prefrontal cortex, including rational thinking and things like that. It can cut it off. So all you're left with are the emotions it and then it sends all this cortisol.

517
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Over to the hippocampus, which means that the memories are all screwed up. Okay.

518
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: They that timeframe can be off. It doesn't have the right timestamp. So what can be happening is you might be reliving it as if it was happening in the present, instead of in the past. So that's a lot of blah, blah, blah. I don't want to bore you but bottom line is it's amazing.

519
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I have not doing

520
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:55.950
It.

521
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.960
Shaun w: Oh, yeah.

522
01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me. You want to try it, or what

523
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.470
Shaun w: Do you want to. Okay.

524
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:05.670
Sorry, the years

525
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it looks ridiculous, but what are you going to do

526
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

527
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of preparation to it. So we'll probably spend the next couple sessions kind of preparing, but so here we go. We'll get this first question which has to do with technology right now are you using a phone.

528
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So when we actually do the bilateral stimulation. Let me show you what it is I'm going to do lots of educating on what to expect. I'm gonna share my screen with you.

529
01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to explain why I'm sharing this with you and I'm showing it because

530
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to have to have about a foot and a half, because you're only on a phone, right, notice how your eyes will only go about an inch or two apart. That's not enough to get a bilateral experience. So this is what we do.

531
01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We modify for my folks that only have a fun and they don't have like a lot a laptop.

532
01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:03.480
This is what I do.

533
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So then let's say you and I set up and I say, okay, Sean. Today we're going to actually do some iterations of the EM Dr.

534
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to have you have something and something about the same height and about about shoulder width apart and then look what will happen because they're about that distance. You can see my eyes. Yeah. Now I get the bilateral stimulation. Okay.

535
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm working with.

536
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.890
Shaun w: You all may go grab two water bottles.

537
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's go do it.

538
01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:36.480
Shaun w: Let's go see if we get that the technical. Be right back. Absolutely.

539
01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:57.270
Shaun w: It's

540
01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The same height because we want your eyes to be going horizontal. So try and get them about

541
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:04.920
Shaun w: A little taller.

542
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.090
Shaun w: They're pretty pretty

543
01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: On the outside, that's lovely. Put them on the outside of your fun so that if your eyes were moving, they would be moving something like this about a foot and a half apart. We don't want them strained.

544
01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:42.240
Shaun w: Lunch. You see it.

545
01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me show you again.

546
01:07:51.090 --> 01:08:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're almost there. I won't see the objects, you'll have it off to the side, sort of the same. I don't need to see the container only really, you need to you can set that yeah

547
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so here's

548
01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: A painter. If I had three hands. The other one would be about right here.

549
01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:08.730
Like this.

550
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.180
Shaun w: They're both for born

551
01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

552
01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is that container on the left is probably because I can see it, push it back a little bit so that those two containers are are right next to each other, but they're behind the phone, they're set back a little bit so that I'll show you.

553
01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.940
Shaun w: On the phone. Okay.

554
01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'll tell you why here in a second, because unfortunately because you're on a phone. I'm not going to be using the blue light. You're going to actually be watching my hand.

555
01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is how it will go. We're not starting. I'm just doing the technical part so that when we are ready, really easy setup, but I'll be asking you to do is I'll be you'll be following the rate

556
01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Of where I'm pointing. So you look at the top of the container over there and then you'll go to this one.

557
01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And this one, and out of the corner of your eye, you basically can tell because I'm in the middle. You don't have to stop talking me. It kind of can tell that this is about the rate

558
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not going to change the rate in the middle. So you can just assume it basically stays at that right can you be

559
01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.550
Shaun w: I guess I can see my peripheral

560
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:18.420
Shaun w: Slogan well

561
01:09:18.570 --> 01:09:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's exactly. Yep. And so I will be doing this. That's really nice. Now to me ask you. Is it straining your eyes.

562
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:28.560
Shaun w: Back a little That's beautiful.

563
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then the next thing you probably hear me say, as it will say, I'll say, Sean. And now let's inhale together and you'll inhale.

564
01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:37.230
And then

565
01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, and then you'll hear me say something like Sean what comes up for you without censoring it. What did you notice and that's an invitation to oh I noticed my stomach.

566
01:09:53.130 --> 01:10:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It relaxed or I noticed my mind went here and you tell me what that thought was, or you'll have a feeling and actual emotion. I don't have any preference of what it is I'm just interested in whatever comes up.

567
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you probably be a pretty short explanation, and then I'll make a decision about a direction to go. Sometimes it's about desensitization. And these iterations can go this fast these by lateral movements could be

568
01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're in a sort of a negative network and we're desensitized they'd be fast and when we're installing something positive.

569
01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so, um, you're doing great are is any of this just to cookie and to weird

570
01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.510
Shaun w: No, that's all right.

571
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, good. So let's keep going. Let's do the part we want to we got to really make sure you're safe. And so I want to do.

572
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: resourcing

573
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And that has the resourcing comes from establishing those three those three figures if I've done these with you and it didn't make it.

574
01:10:54.900 --> 01:11:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: copied into your notes, then just say, oh, we did that one already. And just remind me what they are, because they just didn't make it into the note. So my, my first one is identifying the, the three figures. I'm wanting you to get into your image into your creative mind someone that

575
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a protective figure. So think of someone in your mind that it can be real or imagined that is a protective figure

576
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone you feel safe around for some people they have so few in their life, they have to go imaginary they picture someone from a movie.

577
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:34.590
Shaun w: That was thing my grandma.

578
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Love it. We got grandma and and is it okay if I refer to her as grandma.

579
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:42.930
Shaun w: Or do you want to do growing

580
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. Okay, so she'll be the one for which is it protective

581
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.810
Shaun w: Nurturing or woman protecting

582
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:49.800
Little

583
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go one by one fruit first one right now who comes up his grandma.

584
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandma is definitely has that protective like you felt safe in her presence.

585
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so glad you have that imagery. A lot of people don't have that. Now I want you to picture and give us just go nice and slow, and make sure that we've got just what you need.

586
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When it comes to a nurturing figure. This is someone who wants for you all the growth all the development all your potential wants it for you, supports it.

587
01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Who comes to mind.

588
01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.400
My grandma.

589
01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. She is okay, Grandma. Again, beautiful, and then wise someone that has this sort of wisdom. This

590
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:43.830
Shaun w: ground up.

591
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:55.050
Shaun w: She's to talk to me about things all the time, right, so we've really got to go to here is going to be grandma, you've already got it consolidators so we got why speaker as well. His grandma. Excellent.

592
01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're just doing the setup right now. Okay.

593
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's do the

594
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Container I never know whether people are in the group when I develop these little

595
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Skills, but there might be times we're right at the end of a session because we only have an hour, really, we need about an hour and a half to do this really, really thoroughly but we work with what we got.

596
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you're still kind of in distress, and we want to put that that memory or maybe an emotion kind of away.

597
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: For a little while for a week, even until you and I on packet together and we can continue processing it safely. It's kind of nice to have a metaphor for putting your emotions, the negative ones in a container. Did you do remember developing an emotional container with me.

598
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.530
Shaun w: Know, okay.

599
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The instructions would have sounded like this and we can do it right now.

600
01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got to be big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff.

601
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So as soon as you think like my emotional life you know the maybe the anger or fear or maybe a band. And then I don't know what they are for you it's deeply personal for you. And we don't know what they are yet but just imagine that there's a container that it it can hold it all.

602
01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's strong enough and it has a lid and even a locking system and tell me what your creative mind comes up with

603
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:25.680
Shaun w: Like a, like a shipping container.

604
01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And okay, yes. That's a thick steel, isn't it. Yep. Okay. And is that that locking thing with the

605
01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:38.070
Shaun w: locks in terms

606
01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then certainly big enough certainly strong enough, I could see that in. Is there also a lock on it.

607
01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:46.770
Shaun w: Yeah.

608
01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you the only one with the key.

609
01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.350
Yep.

610
01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and let's see.

611
01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're going to leave it like that. That's beautifully done. I'm going to refer to it as a shipping container. There's a lock on it and you're the only one with the key. So you'll right away, you'll know that one. Let's do another another

612
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Preparation image.

613
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: There's also going to be times where it's not enough to just have it sitting in the container or might be a combination of not only the container. But now that ship is sailing away.

614
01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:22.890
Shaun w: With the container. Yeah.

615
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: See ya. So, all right. You can choose that particular distancing metaphor, you make

616
01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Another one, I'm going to give you some examples. And then you pick one that really resonates for you. So for some people.

617
01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's exactly that. It's I'm on. I'm on the dock and i'm i'm completely encased and immersed.

618
01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: In protection nurturing and wisdom and I stay here on the dock completely sort of embodying all of that.

619
01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Support right I stay here with that. And then what I see is, I see the ship and I can see it slowly getting smaller and smaller until I can't. It's not even a dot anymore. It's like gone

620
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's that some people, it's a spaceship. The distancing. Is it gets on spaceship and it's going into outer space for some people it's a helium balloon Sia or it's a train.

621
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller or it's a river and write this

622
01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Distressing concern or memory is on a log or a leaf and it just sort of floats down the river in your left once again on the riverbank

623
01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: With all of the resources of safety wisdom and protection that you need. And what's traveling further and further away. Is this sort of negative piece that gets further and further away for you what imagery really suits you.

624
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.840
Shaun w: Sit on the ocean watching a leave my ship. Okay.

625
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Our distancing metaphor is going to be

626
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The ship sailing away.

627
01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.250
Shaun w: Notion yeah

628
01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: In the ocean. Yeah, and how fast is it going, would you say

629
01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:18.270
Shaun w: Well, they

630
01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:19.530
Shaun w: Kind of

631
01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: They gotta go slow but you. I mean, it's a metaphor. You can have it go as fast or as slow as you want.

632
01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:28.260
Shaun w: We don't know. You wanna, you want to exact miles per hour.

633
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. No, I was just doing you'll do whatever you need. At the moment, that's just fine. Okay. For some people, there's a real strong sense of know I wanted to go faster. That's all. Because this is imagination. You can have whatever you want.

634
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. Okay, another one. And then we have done a an amazing job of preparation.

635
01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So this other one has to do with a safe space.

636
01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you. You know how some people say, Oh, I've got my happy place. I've got my safe space they can kind of go bring themselves to somewhere where they permit themselves to have a relaxed body and relaxed mind.

637
01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a real or imagined safe place.

638
01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.080
Shaun w: Know,

639
01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of all

640
01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:19.680
Shaun w: The we need want me to think of one.

641
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay. So in your real life. You can't even summon that up right it's not really

642
01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.040
Shaun w: A home and home safe.

643
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Safe at Home. Okay.

644
01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:41.070
Shaun w: No one knows where I live, or nothing okay so home.

645
01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, we'll go with home. I have my suspicion that might need it might need a little bit of development, but we'll go with that for now. Okay. And let me just check in on it. You said home in your home now. Right.

646
01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what emotion. Are you feeling right now.

647
01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:05.790
Shaun w: Oh enthused

648
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

649
01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.350
Shaun w: Yeah, I want to do this. Oh, yeah.

650
01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm excited to

651
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so that's that's a sign that this home image, you have

652
01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to be useful, and the fact that it's real. And you're actually in it is even, even better, because there might be times when

653
01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Your subjective unit of distress, you might be getting activated and there might say, Okay, let's go to this safe place. Why don't you look around the room and be present in your moment now.

654
01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: This other stuff is in history. Let's take a look around. Now, and be very present in this home okay so that might be something we'll do

655
01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.110
Okay.

656
01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check the time actually. We weren't doing pretty darn good. So what we can do is we can do some of the positive

657
01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Installation it's good. That sounds like it like robotic words but it's basically really getting

658
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Installed really really clearly I using the bilateral stimulation out of the very slow rate.

659
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: These support figures. These nurturing wise and protected for years. So you can get a first hand experience of it this morning we'll do a little bit of it nice and slow. It'll probably be at a pace like that and

660
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll get a first impression of it. So let me get set up just a little bit. You've got your two

661
01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:30.990
Shaun w: Containers or

662
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:32.220
Shaun w: 12 hours apart.

663
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

664
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:35.580
Shaun w: That's how far you want to go right

665
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that's about right. And the key is that your eyes.

666
01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Those objects need to be to the side because your eyes, need to be going left and right hemisphere, they need to go left and right. We don't want them sort of stopping here and only going left, WE WANT BILATERAL okay

667
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.460
Shaun w: You want me to get closer to the camera.

668
01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me do a little test your eyes should be a bit like what you see with mine not strained.

669
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can clearly see they're moving

670
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:09.120
Right.

671
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and and are you comfortable doing that.

672
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.080
Shaun w: Yeah.

673
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you think you'd also be able to see my my hands, setting the pace.

674
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.050
Shaun w: Then that's

675
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. So let's also do I can't, I need to stop sign. If you can then nothing will stop. And there's also

676
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, you've never done this before and I get it, but you might also have a sense of I want it to go a little longer. You can also give me a sign like continue the the bilateral stimulation for some people having this distraction.

677
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Back and forth is is a welcomed experience and they want it to continue a little longer, and maybe I'm I'm making them a little short, maybe you want. Maybe 40 seconds or something. I want you to know that you can say

678
01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much I want to stop. You can do that. You can also kind of have motion. Hey, keep going.

679
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's something almost coming into your consciousness and you want to sit with it a little bit longer. Well then that's what we'll do. Okay, you're a part of this. It's not just me running the show.

680
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: My role is really, I'm going to be sort of paying close attention to your, your statements that you when I do a check and I say what's coming up for you.

681
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be paying close attention to also how you're feeling how the body's doing what the thoughts are and whether the timing is to focus

682
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: On positive cognition or we need to be focusing on desensitisation. But today, we're just going to be focusing on positive right yeah yeah should be a really nice feeling

683
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.380
Okay.

684
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, Sean. We have grandma is just amazing. You have an actual person.

685
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.410
Shaun w: Well, she's dead now.

686
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just about to ask you that.

687
01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, but it's she still lives in that imagery

688
01:23:08.130 --> 01:23:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah body felt sense of feeling safe.

689
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:16.620
Shaun w: She took care of us. Yeah.

690
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: She took care of us. That's right. Okay, so we're going to do this together.

691
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:26.700
On this one.

692
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So first start with your eyes closed, the degree that you can tolerate it again. I'm just getting to know you and I don't know your tolerance for for closing eyes.

693
01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If you feel safe enough to close them all. I'm going to be asking you to do and I'll be doing it with you. So I'm not staring at you is I want you to really get in touch with the quality of grammar.

694
01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.920
Shaun w: Will close my eyes. Yeah.

695
01:23:56.310 --> 01:24:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And when we do the bilateral stimulation on I'll ask you to open and but for now I really want all of your intention, all of your focus to be on pulling up from the imagination and from memory.

696
01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The feeling in your body of knowing. Right, I'm safe with her.

697
01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm encouraged to grow and develop

698
01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And she is someone that is wise and be with that quality.

699
01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only in your imagination, but also pay attention to how your body responds

700
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: As your present with them.

701
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit with it. And once you really have that sense, just give me a little head nod.

702
01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: To there.

703
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.840
Shaun w: Okay.

704
01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So for a little while. I'd like you to open your eyes and you're going to follow the pace of my finger, hold, hold, ground in your awareness in that nurturing quality and just be present with it just left and right. Those tops of those two objects.

705
01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: At this nice slow pace.

706
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuing to hold that quality in your awareness.

707
01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And shine. Let's breathe in deep into the belly. Inhale, and then

708
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale takes a little bit longer.

709
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:57.540
And let it go.

710
01:25:59.970 --> 01:26:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's it like for you to be present with that imagery

711
01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:06.450
Shaun w: It's relaxed. Yeah, right.

712
01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice to be relaxed.

713
01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there let's go a little bit further, since that that happened quite easily for you, you were able to have a relaxed body and it sounds like your mind was also able to sort of be present with that.

714
01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to

715
01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I'm going to need to do what's called target mapping. I've got to kind of find out with you where to start.

716
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I get to it today, but maybe we will, but I've got to start to look

717
01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, their current life is so triggering that we end up saying, I'm going to make this stuff up. So this is not about you.

718
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: My cousin that's living with me. I want to

719
01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: rip his head off his neck.

720
01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the current. So you notice like I'm just triggered all the time trigger for some people it's this. So that's present day for some people it's

721
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I have so many nightmares and that I wake up, so I hook up crying.

722
01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And it lasts for three hours. And it's so hard to shake how my day starts and then I'm frustrated with everyone throughout the day. So you can see that a lot of it's this intrusion from history. It's creeping in. For some people it's this

723
01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I worry about the future. I'm so preoccupied with worrying about my future. I'm like, I'll never be okay well what are these people think, what would they think about me. And oh, what if this doesn't work. Notice how my all my preoccupation is about the future.

724
01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you just see which one seems

725
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one seems like that's kind of where your mind goes. Most often, past, present triggers or the future.

726
01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. Yep. Okay. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

727
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And is part of the appeal the enthusiasm, you were saying about this, this process that you won't have to tell me those gory details. Is that part of what is kind of appealing about the end or

728
01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.540
Shaun w: No, no.

729
01:28:23.190 --> 01:28:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that may be there'll be some relief from the intensity of the emotions.

730
01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.610
Shaun w: Well, I guess I just

731
01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:33.630
Shaun w: Wanted to do this little testing, I guess.

732
01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's treatment.

733
01:28:36.690 --> 01:28:37.470
No testing.

734
01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's. And just so you know, I like to reassure people. There's no way for you to do it wrong. You never have to wonder, Am I doing this right. You don't have to do that, you

735
01:28:48.630 --> 01:29:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Your work is only to catch the uncensored response as quick as you can because if you're censoring. You know how in group, you were saying, well, sometimes I can placate

736
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll miss out on the healing if for even a fraction of a second, because we can get in the habit of saying what we think this. This person wants to hear but we rob ourselves of healing.

737
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Who cares what one of your things. This is your healing. Okay. This is about you getting the most out of this moment. So when I say okay so inhale exhale. And now, what did you notice

738
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the uncensored stuff, it might be, oh, I noticed I oh my throat just got constricted. I'm going to want to hear about that awareness or maybe then the next thing is my jaw. I just started grinding my teeth or you might say, I feel nauseous. Or you might say, I'm I feel rage.

739
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Or terror or my heart is beating out of my chest. I don't care what it is, but let it be your uncensored truth, because otherwise you're wasting your time right and this is your time. You can never get it back. Don't waste it.

740
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:00.570
Shaun w: Wasted enough

741
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Come on now. All right, but so that's my spiel. I'm not going to get that feel, again, that one. So when I say uncensored unedited, that's what I mean every

742
01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm trying to give you. I'm educating along

743
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's not normal talk therapy.

744
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to feel kind of different. It's not gonna be back and forth, back and forth. It's going to be you're going to share this little comment.

745
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to say go with that. And then there's going to be another iteration. And that's the bilateral and then you'll share. And I'll say, go with that. And there'll be another. So it's not the normal Socratic dialogue that most therapists are doing okay.

746
01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now let's see. Let me do a little bit of target mapping

747
01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: They said something about the past. You also said, No, I'm not worried about telling you the gory details when

748
01:30:47.640 --> 01:31:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So how much you share with me is completely up to you. Just know that you can always you can hold it in your imagination. It's your choice whether you share it or not. So when you think of this past do you kind of know what it is that

749
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the most disturbing.

750
01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:12.660
Shaun w: Oh yeah, I almost lost my life for somebody to do

751
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, that's the one that I bet and AND HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU ALMOST LOST YOUR LIFE OR SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO

752
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:22.350
Shaun w: I was 19

753
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So young

754
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.170
Yeah.

755
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is where I'm doing the target mapping. Okay, so I kind of have this and you probably have this picture in your mind right now, right, an unpleasant one. I'm assuming

756
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the emotion that goes with that that imagery. What's the emotion.

757
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:51.210
Confusion

758
01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything else, any other emotions, combined with the

759
01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.220
Shaun w: Mad

760
01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Mad at age 19 YOU ALMOST LOST YOUR LIFE OUT mad and confused.

761
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.150
Shaun w: No control.

762
01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.400
Shaun w: Hopeless.

763
01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:27.540
Shaun w: Nothing like helplessness, to really bring up those intense feelings. All I had was the whole point. Yes.

764
01:32:29.370 --> 01:32:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You do recognize some hope.

765
01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.620
Shaun w: Yeah yeah okay some hope.

766
01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: helplessness mad confusion.

767
01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And

768
01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's a little harder to get to, so be patient with it. Okay. Just, just again, this is the uncensored let that free association stuff kind of flow and we'll get there.

769
01:32:53.970 --> 01:33:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So just be present with I felt some confusion I felt mad helpless. There was, there was some hope but I almost

770
01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:05.640
Shaun w: Hope is what kept me going.

771
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Help kept yep yep yep

772
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And your age 19 and just, just for a moment. I want you to picture just a piece of that that memory.

773
01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the hard part to go to. So, be gentle okay because they may not may not may not know what it is right away. These are harder to get to. So here we go.

774
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're picturing this and you're feeling confusion mad helpless with some hope. What belief about yourself, did you have, what was the meaning that you were making about who you are. During that time.

775
01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.530
Shaun w: A walk with my head, I

776
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I walk with my head. Hi.

777
01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:55.170
Shaun w: I didn't do nothing. So I'm gonna, I'm not gonna walk with my head down.

778
01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can finish this sentence.

779
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe I am

780
01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.810
Shaun w: A good person. Yeah.

781
01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:08.580
Yeah.

782
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And from this is a scale that won't always be the scale from one to seven seven is it's absolutely true. I am a good person seven is it's absolutely true, or you

783
01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a seven.

784
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And and age 19 would you say seven as well.

785
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:41.310
Shaun w: No, okay, 19 years

786
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:45.480
Shaun w: $19 pretty wild.

787
01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:49.290
Shaun w: Violent

788
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I was wild and violent. Okay.

789
01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

790
01:34:58.530 --> 01:35:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of picturing I almost lost my life right you've got your imagery. I don't know what it is that's yours, you're picturing it I was wild and violent feeling confusion mad helpless. I'm, I'm almost lost my life for something I didn't do

791
01:35:17.610 --> 01:35:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the predominant belief about yourself, then

792
01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.600
Shaun w: Were dominant belief about myself.

793
01:35:31.710 --> 01:35:33.540
Shaun w: That I was going to make it through this

794
01:35:36.450 --> 01:35:38.070
Shaun w: Because I kept thinking about just giving up.

795
01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: For a person like you. You say, I will make it through this

796
01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're almost there.

797
01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what you have to believe about yourself. At that time, you'll find it with the I Am.

798
01:35:58.110 --> 01:35:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to get to just be patient with it.

799
01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I am. Do you think that was back then I am

800
01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:05.640
Strong

801
01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And how true is that from one to seven seven is just yes

802
01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And and it's even true back then as well. I'm strong.

803
01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:22.590
Shaun w: Yeah.

804
01:36:26.130 --> 01:36:33.390
Shaun w: I can't even explain to you what I went through it. It's crazy. Like it was all over the news every day and then everybody was to get killed these kids and they

805
01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.190
Shaun w: They took me straight from the streets not convicted of nothing in the house me on get throw

806
01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:45.270
Shaun w: Us for safekeeping. They said, so I was wondering how they put me in prison. I've ever been convicted of nothing. They told me that steep in house me on death row.

807
01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:55.800
Shaun w: Yeah, me and my ME AND MY CO defendant and he's my best friend. Now he's on the streets to and they how's the weather at the same place. I did four years, he got out in 18 months.

808
01:36:57.930 --> 01:37:01.920
Shaun w: But everybody was round was on death row homes and those the death penalty back then and misty

809
01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.230
Shaun w: Yeah, and

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:10.800
Shaun w: The people would be banging on my walls. I couldn't sleep to call me a baby killer and all kinds of crazy shit.

811
01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.810
Shaun w: So it was pretty bad.

812
01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.010
Shaun w: This year was everywhere I went to this, you're wanting to do things to me they're drawn. I forgot me

813
01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:25.050
Shaun w: My first week, they're checking my phone got mad to eat off the floor.

814
01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned earlier, this sensation right this feeling of confusion. Can you share about what that was about confusion.

815
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:53.310
Shaun w: I just didn't understand how they were they were getting me on something right now, please. I've never even been. I was wondering are there rest mental place I've never even been to this place and I'm Jane and I couldn't understand it and I couldn't understand how the arresting

816
01:37:55.590 --> 01:38:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay and the helplessness. Where do you think that was the, is that the same

817
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:07.860
Shaun w: Yeah, no control. They just didn't know what was going on. I don't control. I didn't even know what was going on.

818
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.220
Shaun w: I mean, the main of this gear that a homicide case thought I shot up his house.

819
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:21.360
Shaun w: He was a gang unit and people were telling that I shot up his house. And so he, he, like, really went after me really bad.

820
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This one I don't know what's going on.

821
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a really central. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

822
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.600
Shaun w: Okay, yeah. No clue. It's

823
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Contributed to confusion to help

824
01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, and the mad, we check in on that one. Tell me where that feeling of mad, maybe came in.

825
01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:58.980
Shaun w: The personnel falsely convinced on me. I was really mad at him. He came forward. Years later admitted that he lied, but I was does. That's where the magic comes in.

826
01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: so mad at that all sick user

827
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And your hope this is what kept you going

828
01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think that hope came from.

829
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:30.120
Shaun w: I don't know, I just for some reason I knew, everything's gonna be all right in my mind. I kept the guy kept like convincing myself. Everything's gonna be alright. Is it is gonna it's gonna the tool is going to come out or do the mirror is like convincing myself.

830
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Over and over, right, there's sort of an opposition to hopeless. So when it started to give up, you would do this cognitive part and you'd say, no, don't give up.

831
01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:51.900
Shaun w: Yeah, it came down a couple times where I was just going to give up like that. The like then I just didn't do it.

832
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you talking about taking your own life.

833
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.240
Shaun w: Yeah, okay.

834
01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, see if you can catch. It's a different scale. This is one will use quite a bit is from zero

835
01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To 100 right now how distressed. Are you from zero to 100. See if you can catch I how stressed, you are right now.

836
01:40:23.610 --> 01:40:24.900
Shaun w: Right now the second

837
01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.840
Shaun w: Oh mom always stressed out. I don't know why has

838
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: No judgment about it. Just want to, I don't want to learn, you

839
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:37.260
Shaun w: At I always get worried. I don't get locked up for no reason.

840
01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:43.140
Shaun w: My pure comes around my heart starts pounding away. It's like a mess with me something.

841
01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:47.400
Shaun w: I don't know, I just get worried that something's gonna go wrong every day for a reason.

842
01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get it. So notice

843
01:40:52.260 --> 01:41:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a judgment about it, but I want to take care of that pounding heart. I want to make sure that with the work that we're doing. I don't want you in so much distress, what will happen is the

844
01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The prefrontal cortex won't be adding any new language. We won't be getting language and new story.

845
01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be flooded and will be reached. Very traumatizing. I don't want that. What I want is all of the parts of the brain, continuing to communicate with each other, so I'm checking in, just now with

846
01:41:22.530 --> 01:41:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Just talking about history how activating it is for you. And I don't know yet whether you can tolerate at or if I have to make sure right to take care of you that were down at 60

847
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: At z 50 before we start doing some work. So it's going to take a little bit of time, but this is the first one I had to check in and see what is an ad for you for some people. They're like, No, I'm fine.

848
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:52.800
Shaun w: I'm fine. I'm all right is right.

849
01:41:53.190 --> 01:41:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You well you're used to being

850
01:41:56.190 --> 01:41:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

851
01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, worried. Yeah.

852
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:08.490
Shaun w: But I worry a lot as my family told me like my sister and brother good, don't tell Sean, because then I'll start stressing a little crazy for nothing.

853
01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you know, remember I was telling you earlier how some people look to the future worry is is a future oriented.

854
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:20.850
Shaun w: Things like what's going to go on and then you start believing in what you think.

855
01:42:21.630 --> 01:42:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. So my guess is this extended period. These years of helplessness. During that time, we're going to drift away and then we'll start to sort of bring this session to a close, but you did amazing today. Okay.

856
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What was happening in your body. And my concern for you is that you're still doing it. And so right away. I wanna, I want to address this, this stress response. You've got kicking all the time.

857
01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you're releasing cortisol all the time. And what's that doing to your hippocampus. What's that doing to so many organs in your body.

858
01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not not healthy.

859
01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: not healthy. So this medicine that we're doing this talk therapy, the social medicine is going to help your physical body, okay to be

860
01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: At rest to be a piece with itself.

861
01:43:25.410 --> 01:43:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This cortisol can literally it, it can erode the hippocampus, it messes with it and then it's harder to learn things it's harder to focus

862
01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You just can't. Why can't I remember, I mean this guy just talked to me yesterday. How am I forgetting. So I would love to be able to do this work with you so

863
01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a decreased intensity of what you're describing is worry

864
01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: In your everyday life. Okay.

865
01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I think we, I think we're getting somewhere. So there's this this experience in prison.

866
01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's set in motion. Right now this vigilance, that's like is pervasive you're constantly vigilant hearts racing. What if this happens again this, what is this thing that happened happens again. I can't let this happen again. Can't right is that I was

867
01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:18.750
Shaun w: Okay.

868
01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it may be

869
01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we start, but it also might be, and it'll only know by sort of dipping into it with you. It may be that this this piece here where you mentioned, I was wild and violent. There might be some information there that might go even deeper

870
01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be

871
01:44:46.230 --> 01:44:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: An area that we we may want to explore as well. Okay. Because the older and the younger that we can identify

872
01:44:55.470 --> 01:45:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The more effective it is at changing all of those other networks. If we can get at what's called a core negative cognition, we can get it. That guy effects, who just this whole chain reaction of the other pieces. Okay, so let's do a little, a little check in together.

873
01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually

874
01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this a few minutes ago, you were saying about it in the ad that was an approximation will we kept talking. Are you at a lower number now of distress or not. What number would you say right now.

875
01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.600
Shaun w: Well, placed in

876
01:45:34.230 --> 01:45:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: About 80 okay so let's do this. Let's do some diet dramatic reading together. Okay, let's

877
01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I taught you this already, right.

878
01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Oh.

879
01:45:47.490 --> 01:45:54.600
Shaun w: Yeah you did. When we first started the breathing thing. We first started. Yeah. The first we did with the group. Didn't you know

880
01:45:56.070 --> 01:46:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's okay. Remember I told you about the stress cortisol messes with the memory, it messes with it. It corrupts it it's like corrosion

881
01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If a campus is covered with these cortisol receptors. We can't have it continuing to flood it messes with our ability to learn and remember, doesn't matter. Let's go right here. Let's take care of you.

882
01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to do it with you and I will teach this as many times as you need. So, don't, don't be shy about. Can you go over that again. Happy to do it.

883
01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So the basic instructions are you and I are going to breathe in through our nose paying attention to everything we feel as we're breathing it in if it's cool. If it's warm

884
01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is the part that's critical that you breathe in and you don't just breathe short up here. But indeed, you're

885
01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing down in the lower part of long. That's what makes the difference. So if you need to sit up straight and kind of, you can even do what I call the lazy boy pose this if you're

886
01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Lazy Boy or the or the Superman pose where your, your, your arms on his whatever it is, or even tuck in your hands under your thighs. That's fine.

887
01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But the key is, and it can feel quite awkward is on the inhale and let's just try it together. You're going to inhale and you're going to expand.

888
01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Your belly out. And the way to do that is to put air in the bottom of that long. It can be really awkward when you're not used to doing it. So try that a couple times just to see if you can even do it. So you just don't even worry about the timing.

889
01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:32.400
Shaun w: Yeah, do it.

890
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, and you would know because if your hands right here.

891
01:47:37.170 --> 01:47:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, goes like this and you'll know you'll know because you won't you won't be doing this.

892
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So shoulders won't be moving, you'll know you're getting a belly breath when

893
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Your shoulders barely move at all. So that focus is very intentional and it's supposed to take a lot of focus. Okay, that's, that's also working

894
01:48:00.090 --> 01:48:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain and it's using this distraction technique. So we're going to be inhaling for four seconds breathing in through the nose and expanding that belly. Then we're going to hold it for four count. Then we're going to exhale for four out of the mouth, but really intentionally

895
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling it. It's important that you'd be feeling it to may seem ridiculous, but I can explain it later.

896
01:48:24.570 --> 01:48:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: On you want to feel it. So that's a completely out of the lungs, then you'll hold for for so it's right in Hill for four hold for four exhale for four hold for for not a natural breath. Nobody reads like this.

897
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's amazing for emotional regulation. So let's, let's do this together. Ready, and let's inhale.

898
01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale out.

899
01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale through the nose. They barely

900
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:04.680
Hold 321 exhaling out

901
01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your head in your mouth right there and hold 321 inhale.

902
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale feel every bit of that air coming outs nice flat bellies.

903
01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 inhale.

904
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale

905
01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale.

906
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale

907
01:49:54.810 --> 01:49:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it on your own count. Nice and quiet.

908
01:49:59.850 --> 01:50:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: On your own rhythm.

909
01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: One more time on your own count where you're managing this on your own.

910
01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah now shine. Tell me your subjective unit of distress zero to

911
01:50:44.730 --> 01:50:48.180
Shaun w: 150 and fully like

912
01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:49.290
Like

913
01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Know 5050 okay

914
01:50:54.060 --> 01:51:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel relaxed. So for you because your distress level and you're, you're still like a 50 and finding yourself, relax. There's still more to go. Now for some people, that's like, well, what

915
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But you still have some additional relaxation. That's possible, right, all the way down to zero, where they relaxed body heart is

916
01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of doing its own thing and what we just did is called a bagel break. We just activated the parasympathetic nervous system, your body naturally knows what to do. It has to have an opposite

917
01:51:31.170 --> 01:51:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it activates in order to protect you with fight or flight, it knows to protect you. But it also has an opposite system. And that's using the Vegas nerve.

918
01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What you just did, which you activated the Vegas nerve by bringing that air down and smashing those organs below with a an expanded a diaphragm.

919
01:51:51.180 --> 01:52:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you expanded your lungs. You smashed on all those organs down low, send a message up to the brain in contradiction to an, oh my gosh, what's going to happen to me in the future you send a message from

920
01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The viscera. We're. Oh, okay.

921
01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no actual danger.

922
01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's actually no danger.

923
01:52:14.130 --> 01:52:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You gave this permission to this body of yours to be relaxed to bring its guard down and you contradicted the worry thought. Now a couple other things happened.

924
01:52:26.250 --> 01:52:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them was, this is actually a difficult thing to do this breathing technique takes a lot of concentration. So it did a couple of things. Yes, it did. The diet for matic bagel break

925
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But it also, it takes concentration. So if you were worried about what's going to happen, what's gonna happen. What if this breath. The mind only wants to do one thing at a time. And because this takes effort and concentration, your mind got distracted.

926
01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So it got out of that huge neural network of the, oh my goodness worry about future

927
01:52:59.730 --> 01:53:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And it got into the here and now.

928
01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were able to experience at least a 30 degree reduction.

929
01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This, I highly recommend you do when you wake up five or six times a day. And before you go to sleep. So that becomes so habitual for you that it's part of whatever if you do any kind of spiritual Mantra Meditation or you just like to maybe even think about grandma by getting the imagery

930
01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And including this breath work as soon as I woke up right doing things that feel good to the body and feel restful to the mind. Let's do them as much as we can. I mean, that is what's going to bring relief to all of this worry, worry, worry, worry
