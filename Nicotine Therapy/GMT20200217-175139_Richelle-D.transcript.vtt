00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.520
Richelle Direny: Um, I mean, that's a good place to start but like what's

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.930

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.810
Crystal Gatwood: The boyfriend. I was talking about.

19
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:33.270
Crystal Gatwood: He wouldn't leave. I think that's right. I remember me telling you that like I just want things to be simple and mutually go our own ways, but he wasn't having that and

20
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:45.870
Crystal Gatwood: So I had to. I had to call him the authorities, but I'm actually after our counseling. I'm going to go up a restraining order so that he can come back here.

21
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.290
Richelle Direny: Was he physically abusive.

22
00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.030
Crystal Gatwood: No, he started a threat and but wasn't really, you know, not physically but emotionally is just as bad or worse to me.

23
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.190
Crystal Gatwood: And he doesn't help at all.

24
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.640
Richelle Direny: This is your, what is it you have a son, right, or daughter.

25
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.640
Richelle Direny: IT WAS YOUR SON'S FATHER.

26
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.590
Crystal Gatwood: Okay.

27
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.230
Richelle Direny: So how i mean it's it's I'm sure it's a long and hard road for you to get to that point.

28
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.650
Richelle Direny: For him to leave. So how was that for you.

29
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.810
Crystal Gatwood: I've been asking him to leave for about six months.

30
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.180
Crystal Gatwood: So,

31
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:52.440
Crystal Gatwood: It's been hard and it's really hard when we are you in front of my son. I absolutely hate it. I tell him I hate it. Just stop, drop it, you know, or, you know, if you have something to say like that text me. Don't say in front of you know

32
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.320
Crystal Gatwood: This is not necessary.

33
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:07.440
Crystal Gatwood: So actually it was like such a relief such a burden off of me when he left like I was smiling grow. I feel fantastic

34
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.860
Richelle Direny: That's good.

35
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.450
Crystal Gatwood: And

36
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.640
Richelle Direny: How long have you guys been together.

37
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.470
Crystal Gatwood: Nine years

38
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.320
Richelle Direny: That's a long time, though, yes.

39
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.500
Crystal Gatwood: And I dealt with a lot

40
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.660
Richelle Direny: And for the nine years. You guys were together. He wasn't really happening.

41
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.960
Crystal Gatwood: He wasn't one

42
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.020
Richelle Direny: He wasn't helping you during that time.

43
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.010
No.

44
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.990
Crystal Gatwood: No.

45
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.900
Richelle Direny: Why like

46
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.200
Crystal Gatwood: His mom passed away a few years ago. And after that.

47
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:54.870
Crystal Gatwood: Because when he changed to where like, like he used to work every day. I couldn't get him to take a day off and now it's like I can't get him to work for shit.

48
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.770
Crystal Gatwood: Is not helping me and now I'm supporting you to, you know, it's like, I can't do it.

49
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.910
Richelle Direny: So where is he now you don't know

50
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.520
Crystal Gatwood: And he's in jail right now.

51
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.880
Richelle Direny: So after you call the authorities. They took him to jail. No.

52
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.170
Richelle Direny: It was x series that he's the one was the one. Did he get up.

53
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:31.260
Crystal Gatwood: We'll see what happened was he wouldn't leave and I knew that he had a, like a little petty on so I called them.

54
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.700
Richelle Direny: So they picked him up from for the warm

55
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.040
Richelle Direny: So given that he knows that you did that. So given when he got

56
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.520
Up.

57
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.970
Crystal Gatwood: I actually like I live in our little town.

58
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:56.220
Crystal Gatwood: That has like a Facebook page and I know the police officers very well. I live like right beside police station. But, um, so I was messaging them on messenger

59
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:09.660
Crystal Gatwood: Like, hey, I can't call, but I need some help. This is what's going on, you know, when an officer gets on duty. Can you send him up here just grabbing them a warning. And that way, he doesn't think I called or, you know, I mean,

60
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.800
Crystal Gatwood: It worked out well without incident, so

61
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.950
Richelle Direny: My god, that's a really small town if you can message a police officer. Yes.

62
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.820
Crystal Gatwood: It is

63
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.030
Richelle Direny: A mighty small town.

64
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.470
Crystal Gatwood: blessed to be able to do that.

65
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.190
Richelle Direny: So how I mean, have you thought about, like, what's going to happen when you get to the start or when he gets released

66
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:46.980
Crystal Gatwood: That's what I'm going to go after my counseling with you. I'm going to go to the local sheriff department and put an order to where he cannot come close to me or my home.

67
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.410
Richelle Direny: But how are you going to work it out with him seeing your son.

68
00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:01.560
Crystal Gatwood: Um, whenever he can get civil one up and get on his feet. That's fine. But until then, he doesn't need to

69
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.950
Richelle Direny: See her family.

70
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.350
Crystal Gatwood: Not really.

71
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.590
Crystal Gatwood: And I think that's why he wouldn't leave this because you know you have nowhere to go. Really, but that's not my responsibility anymore.

72
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.480
Crystal Gatwood: Now,

73
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.260
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's a hard situation.

74
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.600
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, it is really is.

75
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.600
Richelle Direny: And he doesn't know he can come back here, Wendy.

76
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.150
Crystal Gatwood: I think they will.

77
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.090
Crystal Gatwood: serve him in jail paper NGO

78
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.710
Richelle Direny: Pretty hard situation.

79
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:58.020
Crystal Gatwood: It is, but I mean, I feel so much better. You know, I'm not walking around in my house on eggshells anymore. And I got to worry about, you know,

80
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.540
Crystal Gatwood: supporting him anymore. Now I can focus on me and my son.

81
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.780
Crystal Gatwood: And getting on my feet.

82
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.720
Richelle Direny: Well, you said that you start. So he's the only person that you've kind of

83
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.340
Richelle Direny: Given

84
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.170
Richelle Direny: The exit the notice to making

85
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.490
Yeah.

86
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.140
Richelle Direny: So right now, who is helping you.

87
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.350
Crystal Gatwood: With what

88
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.200
Richelle Direny: With your son things that you need to get help.

89
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.390
Richelle Direny: With anything.

90
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:47.280
Crystal Gatwood: I don't get a lot of help with anything really making these things on my own, but I always seem to figure out a way

91
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.980
Crystal Gatwood: I would seem to get it done.

92
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.450
Crystal Gatwood: I'm not saying struggle but

93
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.610
Crystal Gatwood: Get it done.

94
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.410
Richelle Direny: Get through it.

95
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.960
Richelle Direny: I know your parents or your parents, um, any help at all.

96
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.460
Richelle Direny: You're not really you don't have a good relationship with your

97
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.030
Richelle Direny: Mom, right.

98
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:26.700
Crystal Gatwood: No, no, um, but my dad we've kind of gotten closer over the years and he has no problem and helping me when I need it. If I'm not with Justin. So when I was adjusting he would not tell me

99
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.070
Richelle Direny: He didn't care for him.

100
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:30.840
Crystal Gatwood: Right.

101
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.800
Richelle Direny: Okay, so now he's a little bit more helpful.

102
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.700
Richelle Direny: Okay, and what about your sister.

103
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.830
Crystal Gatwood: My sister. I haven't really heard from her in a while.

104
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.450
Richelle Direny: So,

105
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:05.910
Richelle Direny: So kind of where are you at now like emotionally and mentally with everything with the internet being involved and just kind of everything is going on now.

106
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:15.600
Crystal Gatwood: I'm as of right now. I feel pretty good emotionally. I feel great. I know that I still have a lot to do.

107
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:28.470
Crystal Gatwood: To get on my feet, but to me it's just I gotta take one thing at a time, and I can't stress over the things that I have no control over this is not going to do me any good. So I put that

108
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:40.260
Crystal Gatwood: Stuff in God's hands. I was laying handle that. But I just I do what I can. And I try my best. But as of right now. I feel so much better.

109
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.360
Richelle Direny: Hey, listen, nothing beats a failure.

110
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:54.930
Richelle Direny: Was it nothing beats a tribe and a failure or something like that. But I mean, all you do is try your best. You think it one day at a time, one step at a time.

111
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:01.470
Richelle Direny: And like, do what you can. Don't stress the rest. If you can't do it why stress because you can't do

112
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.680
Crystal Gatwood: Right, it's me a long time to learn that

113
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.480
Crystal Gatwood: But

114
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.620
Crystal Gatwood: I'm working on the vehicle right now.

115
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.310
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, um, because you don't really go much places, right, or do you go you were

116
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.390
Crystal Gatwood: I I lost my job when I lost my car.

117
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:35.880
Crystal Gatwood: You know, yeah, so I'm working on a vehicle right now through a friend of mine, and he's gonna sell it to me, cheap like $200

118
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:49.650
Crystal Gatwood: But it needed a like the person that had it put aftermarket rooms on the vehicle and they didn't fit. So I bought like adapters are spaces is what their home for the wheels so that they fit.

119
00:10:50.220 --> 00:11:01.980
Crystal Gatwood: And those parts come in tomorrow, so hopefully I can get them on one and we wrote up a contract and agreement to where you know I can use the vehicle, but he keeps the title until I get it paid off.

120
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.310
Richelle Direny: Okay.

121
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.140
Richelle Direny: I know

122
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.500
Crystal Gatwood: That'll give me the car now. You know what I mean.

123
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.110
Richelle Direny: And then you can start actively

124
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.780
Crystal Gatwood: Yes.

125
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:25.950
Richelle Direny: And you don't have. I mean, there's not jobs where you are. There's not really jobs where you can work from home.

126
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.080
Crystal Gatwood: I wish.

127
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.070
Crystal Gatwood: I wish that I'm probably about 20 miles away from

128
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.340
Crystal Gatwood: The good you know at least tango where I can at least arrive.

129
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.660
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

130
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:54.510
Richelle Direny: I mean, it sounds like you know you're actively doing what you need to do in terms of getting yourself on your feet and your son is about five years old.

131
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.730
Richelle Direny: And he goes to school, he's in kindergarten are freaking

132
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.260
I can every

133
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:07.410
Richelle Direny: OK, OK. And so how does he get to school at the school bus fixing up and takes him to school.

134
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:14.340
Crystal Gatwood: Actually no, he's considered a walker because we live. I'm going to say fairly close to the school.

135
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.460
Crystal Gatwood: And I even called the bus garage. A couple weeks ago and said, you know,

136
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:28.260
Crystal Gatwood: I don't have a car right now. Is there any way of us because three buses pass us on our way to school.

137
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:42.990
Crystal Gatwood: And I said, Is there any way. One of them lessons can stop and pick up my boy, you know, just for a short period of time until I get a car because it's starting to get really cold in the mornings and they said they couldn't. It couldn't do it.

138
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.240
Crystal Gatwood: I was like,

139
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.070
Richelle Direny: walking to school.

140
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.420
Yes.

141
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.220
Crystal Gatwood: And Nicole and Nicole rain. Oh.

142
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.170
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

143
00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:01.890
Richelle Direny: Is it because you're not. I know here in Florida. It's, you have to be like you have to live like two miles away from the school.

144
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.050
Crystal Gatwood: That's what it is. Two miles.

145
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.440
Richelle Direny: And because you're inside of the two miles, he has to

146
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.820
Crystal Gatwood: Work. Yes.

147
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.720
Well,

148
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.850
Crystal Gatwood: They expect him to walk.

149
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:18.270
Crystal Gatwood: I'm like, first of all, my son would never make it to school. If I let them walk to school, you know,

150
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.760
Crystal Gatwood: That's just ridiculous to me.

151
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.130
Richelle Direny: But when his dad was there, his dad would come up and drop them off.

152
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.530
Crystal Gatwood: No, I did it.

153
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.920
Crystal Gatwood: He slept a lot

154
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:43.350
Crystal Gatwood: And I couldn't stand it. Sometimes I was just like kicking him away like get up, do some

155
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.040
Richelle Direny: So what is

156
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:59.820
Richelle Direny: What are you so in that time. Look what were you doing to help you to because just in that situation. It's a great recipe to be pressed

157
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.550
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah I did get depressed. Yeah.

158
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.280
Richelle Direny: So what words. One thing that he

159
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:15.720
Crystal Gatwood: And I started seeing doctor lives like I live right in town. So it's, I can walk there and

160
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:39.540
Crystal Gatwood: I actually like him. He's a great doctor and I've been on medication for years for bipolar depression, you know, and he actually did a what's called a gene site test and he used my DNA actually like nice while my cheap and sent it in and you get results back that gives you the best

161
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:46.620
Crystal Gatwood: Options of those type of medications that will work best with my DNA.

162
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.420
Richelle Direny: It was

163
00:14:49.050 --> 00:15:04.800
Crystal Gatwood: Like really, it was so cool. I've never seen it before, so he put me on like the very first one and I love it. It those medicines usually take two, three weeks just to even begin to see a difference. I felt the difference, the same day.

164
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.150
Crystal Gatwood: What

165
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.400
Richelle Direny: I'm what medication you put you on

166
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.200
Crystal Gatwood: It's called pristiq

167
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:11.550
Richelle Direny: Gotcha.

168
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:12.720
For them.

169
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:21.540
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah for depression. And then I also take a pillow fly at night and both of them together.

170
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:34.350
Crystal Gatwood: Help with my like mood stabilization. My bipolar and stuff. But, um, and then he's winning me off the Xanax, which has been really, really hard so hard.

171
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.380
Richelle Direny: You have anxiety.

172
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.850
Bad

173
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.630
Crystal Gatwood: And things like that. And with my PTSD and just just general anxiety. I mean,

174
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.300
Richelle Direny: So you were diagnosed with generalized anxiety.

175
00:15:52.290 --> 00:16:07.230
Crystal Gatwood: Oh yeah, long time ago. And then with my Bipolar I was diagnosed bipolar and generalized anxiety at the same time. Oh, yeah. Years later, the PTSD got added on.

176
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.060
Richelle Direny: And

177
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.850
Richelle Direny: Like what, when is the most. Have you ever had an anxiety attack.

178
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.920
Crystal Gatwood: Oh yeah, funny.

179
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:25.290
Crystal Gatwood: Funny. Yeah. And like without was him weaning me down and they're starting to come back more

180
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.420
Crystal Gatwood: So,

181
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.390
Crystal Gatwood: I've been buying journals writing, same as that would help.

182
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:42.900
Crystal Gatwood: I bought books about anxiety and things you can do to cope without medication and reading those

183
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:52.110
Richelle Direny: I mean exactly medication will just come down the effects of it, but you have to identify the source off. What's causing time

184
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.300
Crystal Gatwood: Right, I read

185
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.990
Richelle Direny: But what what do you think the source is

186
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.150
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, it can be anything that sets me off really it's just

187
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.780
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry.

188
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.720
Richelle Direny: Are you will worry ward like you were you

189
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.020
Were

190
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.000
Crystal Gatwood: Very much so.

191
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.890
Crystal Gatwood: And like

192
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:19.740
Crystal Gatwood: I can't do a lot of people or closed in or

193
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:31.290
Crystal Gatwood: Just and then my PTSD. Like sometimes if I do see somebody that resembles that person sets me all smells set me off.

194
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.030
Crystal Gatwood: What is your you're

195
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.600
Wrong.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.340
Richelle Direny: Like you're you're you're related to whatever the trauma, it's

198
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:50.670
Crystal Gatwood: Some of it is, yes, it's from my childhood I was sexually molested by my step dad for like four years.

199
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.940
Richelle Direny: For four years. So the now. Prior to that, did you have

200
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.240
Richelle Direny: Were you did you suffer with any kind of anxiety.

201
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.980
Crystal Gatwood: I was so little. I didn't really know

202
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.830
Crystal Gatwood: On I started when I was like three on this for cause like seven

203
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.320
Richelle Direny: Okay. And is he still in your life.

204
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.040
Crystal Gatwood: No, my mom separated from him when I was eight.

205
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.410
I've never

206
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.760
Richelle Direny: Put in the time that it was occurring. She wasn't aware of it.

207
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.690
Crystal Gatwood: No, honestly, I don't know, she's aware of it now.

208
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.630
Richelle Direny: So you're saying

209
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.370
Richelle Direny: And you live in a small town, he said. Right. Yeah.

210
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.630
Richelle Direny: Did he ever get arrested. Do you ever go to jail.

211
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.580
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know.

212
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.710
Crystal Gatwood: Like I said, I don't

213
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.850
Crystal Gatwood: I've never seen him again after that and

214
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.400
Crystal Gatwood: I don't even want to

215
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.210
Crystal Gatwood: Try to look him up or anything like I don't know what I would do if I seen him again.

216
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.530
Do you have

217
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:19.020
Richelle Direny: Some of your anxiety because of the fact that you don't know where he is, you don't really know me. So, kind of in your mind and in your world. He somewhat like fell off the face of the earth.

218
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.360
Crystal Gatwood: Yes, so

219
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.090
Richelle Direny: Is some of the anxiety as to why

220
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.000
Richelle Direny: You so much stay isolated.

221
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.790
Richelle Direny: From the worst of the worst is fear of running into him, or seeing him or him repairing

222
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.250
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, I would say a small fraction me but

223
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:45.810
Crystal Gatwood: I feel like I haven't seen him in this long. What's the odds of me running into them now, but

224
00:19:47.550 --> 00:20:06.780
Crystal Gatwood: Um, it all started like my PTSD KICK THEM BECAUSE I DID I you know I put it back in my mind. I forgot about it all those years I'm 27 years and my flashbacks and everything started actually on my daughter's third birthday. That night I had like a night care.

225
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.280
Crystal Gatwood: And I started having flashbacks again and like

226
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.850
Crystal Gatwood: And I started going to the psychiatry, because I didn't know what the hell is going on, you know, I didn't know

227
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.250
Richelle Direny: When your daughter was three. Yeah.

228
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.000
Richelle Direny: And when you started getting on. When did he start

229
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.470
Crystal Gatwood: When I was three.

230
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.220
Crystal Gatwood: As my counselor said that that was very common to

231
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.790
Crystal Gatwood: set me off. You know, like

232
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:45.870
Crystal Gatwood: My mind just brought everything back because my daughter is a just a reflection of me. She looks just like me.

233
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.960
Crystal Gatwood: And I know this is

234
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.940
Crystal Gatwood: Probably sounds

235
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.940
Crystal Gatwood: Wrong to say but I mean

236
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.880
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry.

237
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.860
Crystal Gatwood: Even looking at my daughter can send me

238
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.060
Crystal Gatwood: Just looking at her sometime just triggers me

239
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.490
Crystal Gatwood: Because she looks so much like me and I remember how I felt.

240
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.320
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know.

241
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.620
Richelle Direny: How old is your daughter now.

242
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.530
Crystal Gatwood: She's she'll be 12 ma

243
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:38.970
Richelle Direny: And

244
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.750
Richelle Direny: So for something that you suppressed happen over 20 years ago.

245
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.130
Yeah.

246
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.780
Richelle Direny: All you did want to like put it down.

247
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.880
Richelle Direny: back a few months.

248
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.220
Crystal Gatwood: But then you had a baby.

249
00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.690
Crystal Gatwood: Girl Yeah, baby girl looks just like you. Yeah.

250
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.310
Richelle Direny: Baby girl turn three

251
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.340
Richelle Direny: Yeah. What you suppress woke up.

252
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:17.910
Richelle Direny: And so in meeting with that therapist, did you work through just kind of like the stages was the trauma and the grief and all of that.

253
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.790
Richelle Direny: After she turned three and we're having those nightmares and those flashbacks of what happened.

254
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:37.260
Crystal Gatwood: Well, the counselor. I was seeing at that time, like just was too pushy for me. And, you know, was like my first visit

255
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:45.390
Crystal Gatwood: I remember leaving. And she said, I'm on our next visitation. Be prepared to give me details.

256
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.630
Crystal Gatwood: And I said, I'm not doing that right now.

257
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.480
Crystal Gatwood: So I never went back to the account.

258
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.150
Crystal Gatwood: It took me probably about

259
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.020
Crystal Gatwood: Five, seven years to find a good counselor.

260
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.390
Richelle Direny: And when

261
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.530
Crystal Gatwood: When my my drug abuse started

262
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.090
Crystal Gatwood: You know,

263
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:16.980
Richelle Direny: Because then you were forced to it wasn't. I shouldn't use the word force but you kind of came head to head to deal with the past. Yeah, and

264
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.380
Richelle Direny: In order to

265
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:23.910
Richelle Direny: It meant

266
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.060
Richelle Direny: This associating

267
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:29.070
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

268
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:38.790
Richelle Direny: And did you feel that the drug, the introduction of the drug use helps me helps you with this associating from reality.

269
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.680
Crystal Gatwood: Yes, I'm numbed it

270
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.500
Crystal Gatwood: So it makes sense.

271
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.840
Richelle Direny: That's exactly what that means.

272
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.150
Richelle Direny: Kind of like an out of body experience. I don't want to feel it. I don't want to

273
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.550
Richelle Direny: And so happy. The third at the counselor, then how did they help you to processing.

274
00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.150
Crystal Gatwood: When I finally found a good counselor and

275
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:18.360
Crystal Gatwood: Like she put me and also did like anger management classes because I had a lot of anger, but it was valid, you know,

276
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:28.020
Crystal Gatwood: So that helped do and she wasn't pushy. She didn't ask for anything she let me tell her.

277
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.700
Crystal Gatwood: You know,

278
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.350
Crystal Gatwood: She

279
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:44.040
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know. She just have certain ways to get things out of me. That was not the slightest pushy or rushing or

280
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.890
Crystal Gatwood: She's a very, very good counselor.

281
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:50.880
Richelle Direny: And

282
00:24:50.970 --> 00:25:00.630
Crystal Gatwood: Tell me, where are ways to cope like she's the one who told me like to write, you know, write him a letter telling him how much he is

283
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:12.000
Crystal Gatwood: You know how much you hate him way did you will. So I wrote this letter and everything. I take it to work. And she says, Now I want you to go home. I want you to burn it.

284
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:21.270
Crystal Gatwood: And I did it just just watching it burn just made me feel better. I don't know. But it did help

285
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.450
Crystal Gatwood: Just things like that she has helped me cope with me.

286
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:36.630
Richelle Direny: She allowed you writing it down. It allowed it to for you to take it from out of your mind. I will have to take it out.

287
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:38.910
Richelle Direny: Mary

288
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.700
Crystal Gatwood: I used to read a lot. And I'm starting to pick it up again. But it did help

289
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:47.970
Richelle Direny: Was

290
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.790
Richelle Direny: Have you ever

291
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.170
Richelle Direny: Process any of how it felt with your daughter.

292
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.570
Richelle Direny: And how

293
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.800
Crystal Gatwood: That's what I needed to do. I think

294
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:14.880
Crystal Gatwood: Because even like some of my night terrors weren't about me like one. I kept having repeated was

295
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.520
Crystal Gatwood: A dream where I could see myself sleeping.

296
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.620
Crystal Gatwood: And waking up because I heard my daughter giggling in the middle of night.

297
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:46.440
Crystal Gatwood: So in my dream. I get up and I'm walking down the hallway and I'm like, baby. What are you doing you know it's it's two o'clock in the morning and I turn a corner to her bedroom and he's there with her sitting on the floor plane and he just looks at me and smiled and I wake up screen.

298
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.600
Richelle Direny: Now,

299
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.000
The question is,

300
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:12.900
Richelle Direny: How much of when you wrote that letter in Burton, how much of it did you, I mean it's not uncommon for you will have memories of the past and the things that was traumatic and traumatizing and bringing back to that moment of everything that went on.

301
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.130
With it.

302
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.740
Richelle Direny: But how much

303
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.660
Richelle Direny: Did you

304
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:26.700
Richelle Direny: When you think about okay you wrote the letter you went over it with your counselor and you burn it. Yeah.

305
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.490
Richelle Direny: Did you feel like you released everything or there were parts of

306
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.750
Richelle Direny: Events in the memories and everything that you held on to

307
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:45.120
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, I tried to get everything else on that piece of paper. But, I mean, there's still some things that come to me.

308
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.170
Crystal Gatwood: That new it new every day. You know what I mean, like,

309
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:57.030
Crystal Gatwood: I'm might remember something that I didn't remember by seeing or smelling something

310
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.610
Crystal Gatwood: And suck. Well, there's no cure for trauma.

311
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:20.040
Richelle Direny: If there's no cure for trauma. Yes. Um, because it's a mess. It's thing. Their, their memories of what you went through.

312
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.770
Richelle Direny: You said there is

313
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.820
Richelle Direny: You will smell someone or someone will resemble

314
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.340
Richelle Direny: That you know just became this monster in your life.

315
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.360
Now,

316
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:56.910
Richelle Direny: I'm still felt unprotected as this, you know, while you were going through it. You were unprotected you felt like no one is there. So then you tend to somewhat overcompensate for your daughter in wanting to be there and protect her from all that you went through.

317
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Does she live with you.

318
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.830
Crystal Gatwood: When I moved here to this little place.

319
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:17.520
Crystal Gatwood: There just wasn't really enough room so she decided to stay with her dad and what he's a great dad, I trust him fully I know she's care for. I know she's protected.

320
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:31.620
Crystal Gatwood: And I didn't want to yank her out of school and switch schools because when I was young, you know, I moved around a lot, a lot, a lot. I just, I didn't want to. And she didn't want to

321
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.040
Crystal Gatwood: So to me, I felt it was okay.

322
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:44.040
Crystal Gatwood: And my weekends. Were you know breaks from school.

323
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.320
Crystal Gatwood: Things like that.

324
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.650
Richelle Direny: Now in some of it.

325
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.600
Did you

326
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.860
Richelle Direny: Ever for ever forgive

327
00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.670
Richelle Direny: Him or your mom for anything.

328
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:08.760
Crystal Gatwood: I never blamed my mom, not once I felt because how I happened like he

329
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:24.720
Crystal Gatwood: manipulated me to where you know I thought that's what I was supposed to do to be a good girl, or you know that's what my mom needed me to do while she was at work. You know, I know that sounds so done. But

330
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.480
Crystal Gatwood: I was young, I was three.

331
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.730
Richelle Direny: Years three

332
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.230
Richelle Direny: You're going to convince yourself of any and then you don't know better.

333
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.040
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, so I never resented my mom for it. No.

334
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.770
Crystal Gatwood: But as for forgiving him. I just can't.

335
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.370
Crystal Gatwood: Like my counselor said, you know, the

336
00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:18.210
Crystal Gatwood: There are some things, even though that happened to me. There are some positive things and positive traits that makes me who I am today. You know, like the fact that i don't i don't give up. I'm determined I'm independent and what I have these traits and that didn't happen to me.

337
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.680
Crystal Gatwood: You know,

338
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.640
Crystal Gatwood: So I can't say I mean I think

339
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:30.420
Crystal Gatwood: Going through that I learned a lot, but it's made me who I am today.

340
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:34.350
Richelle Direny: It has and forgiving him is not for him. It's for you.

341
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.220
Crystal Gatwood: Right, I know I've heard that, but

342
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:38.760
Really

343
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.730
Richelle Direny: It's because it, you know, not to say and this is not always the case.

344
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.400
Richelle Direny: Not to say

345
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:57.870
Richelle Direny: This is the case for everyone that has gone through some degree trauma or

346
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:03.210
Richelle Direny: Abuse or whatever their abuse is that they went through.

347
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:04.350
The whole

348
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.150
Richelle Direny: Thing is

349
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:15.750
Richelle Direny: Fair for you to go have gone through what you've gone through by no means is it was it right for you to experience what you did.

350
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.880
Richelle Direny: But we all

351
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:23.880
Richelle Direny: Each and every person has gone through something something others.

352
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.860
Crystal Gatwood: Right. We all have a story.

353
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.930
Richelle Direny: We all have a story and your story can either

354
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:45.450
Richelle Direny: Make you build you up to be a strong person or we can break you or that circumstance and situation can control and govern your life to the point where it cripples you because you're holding on to the hurt and the pain and everything.

355
00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:47.610
Crystal Gatwood: But forgive

356
00:32:48.030 --> 00:33:06.150
Richelle Direny: Part of it is you're forgiving that person for whatever it is that they did to you and you are not allowing what they did you hurt you and to continue at least hurt you or to continue to keep you down.

357
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.190
Crystal Gatwood: Right, like he

358
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.690
Crystal Gatwood: Still has control over me or something. Exactly.

359
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:22.320
Richelle Direny: Exactly. And you're not allowing that individual to continue to have over your emotions, your money.

360
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.190
Richelle Direny: Not having

361
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:39.270
Richelle Direny: Not allowing that because it's a piece of that situation that a whole some degree of emotional and mental clue froze so forgiving. It's kind of like when you hold on lack of forgiveness, sometimes can be

362
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:40.980
suffocate.

363
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.760
Crystal Gatwood: Almost like you can't grieve.

364
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.270
Richelle Direny: But when you release that person to their own

365
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.840
Richelle Direny: Cognition you release them to

366
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.690
Crystal Gatwood: Themselves, you're

367
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.790
Richelle Direny: eating them from having that degree of control over you, it doesn't

368
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:17.490
Richelle Direny: Take away the memories. It doesn't take away the trauma. It doesn't remove any of that. You're just no longer allowing that person to have any control over you for your life and how you think and how you feel you understand. Yeah.

369
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:24.360
Richelle Direny: And I think once you work through that and you learn that piece of it, I think.

370
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:36.180
Richelle Direny: It gives you the ability to start working fully authentically on you to be able to be there for your daughter wholeheartedly.

371
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:48.600
Richelle Direny: The way you need to be there for her without looking at your mirror image and having flashbacks of your past because when you. It's almost like when you're looking at her.

372
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.070
Crystal Gatwood: What can you

373
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:56.370
Crystal Gatwood: Know,

374
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:58.710
Crystal Gatwood: Hey,

375
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.400
Crystal Gatwood: This is my counselor, but he

376
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.390
Richelle Direny: Was making my mom.

377
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.770
Crystal Gatwood: Okay, we will talk about that just the middle. Okay, okay. I love you.

378
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.200
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry.

379
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.780
Richelle Direny: How's your sexy was

380
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:26.160
Crystal Gatwood: Inspired aside.

381
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.130
Richelle Direny: My four year old probably have done the same thing.

382
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.680
Richelle Direny: For making you cry but

383
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.010
Richelle Direny: That it was too cute. That was classic just now.

384
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:52.890
Richelle Direny: So, um, it's just, it's just overall it's not when you look at your daughter. Maybe there's a part of you that in your mind you, someone

385
00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:00.960
Crystal Gatwood: Creates like it takes me back to when I was, I don't know.

386
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.910
Richelle Direny: Exactly. It's almost like you're in your eyes, you're envisioning

387
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.000
Richelle Direny: If you were him looking at her. What did you see it's like you're creating this whole

388
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:24.870
Richelle Direny: Scenario situation of I'm looking at meet my young self and this is him looking at my young self. What is it that he is seeing what why is it that he's hurting

389
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:41.220
Richelle Direny: This young me and it's slowly but surely without realizing it, we create these things in our mind and it ends up taking full control of us and we don't even know it. And we're trying to understand why is this why am I doing this myself.

390
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:45.180
Crystal Gatwood: Crazy like my mind is my own enemy like

391
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:47.520
Crystal Gatwood: It's crazy.

392
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:56.730
Richelle Direny: You know what, you're all of our minds are can be our own enemy, but we have to identify that

393
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:00.540
Richelle Direny: So,

394
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.440
Richelle Direny: We've all had

395
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.910
Richelle Direny: That scary faces to say he's scaring

396
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.670
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, I put on a mask.

397
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.460
Richelle Direny: That's your little protector. Okay.

398
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.390
Crystal Gatwood: That's what he wants.

399
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:39.240
Richelle Direny: In return, you are your little protector. Um, it's so it's it's thinking of like when we got when we start going into like that tunnel that deep tunnel of depression, it's because of our thoughts.

400
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:47.910
Richelle Direny: And when we start having these thoughts. We're slowly taking control of those or owning those negative emotions.

401
00:37:48.420 --> 00:38:03.210
Richelle Direny: Those emotions, that's going to keep us putting deeper. So then you start having these negative thoughts and these negative thoughts bring forth or bring about these emotions and those emotions become so overwhelming to the point where we've lost our, our control.

402
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:12.210
Richelle Direny: Right and so come to these negative emotions. That's taking full control before you know if you get into the slum of

403
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:30.120
Richelle Direny: I don't want to be around. Anybody. I don't want to talk to anybody. I don't even want to be around myself and then you just you just want to stay in bed because what these thoughts in these emotions have totally captivated us and we can't pull ourselves from it well.

404
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.470
Crystal Gatwood: That's how I was when I first started getting the flashbacks and stuff.

405
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:42.930
Crystal Gatwood: And like it's, I don't know. It's hard for me even good for me to even go to a crowded grocery store.

406
00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:51.150
Richelle Direny: What it, what is, what is it about the crowded grocery store that brings on the inside.

407
00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:52.950
Crystal Gatwood: I'm not sure.

408
00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.810
Crystal Gatwood: Like, I will literally I went to Walmart at midnight, because there was hardly any writer literature, some

409
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.310
Crystal Gatwood: Um, if I walk in and it's too busy. I will walk right back out.

410
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.940
Crystal Gatwood: I'm not sure what it is.

411
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:18.390
Richelle Direny: Is there anything from your past that, you know, being a part of crowds that was a little bit scary or that created

412
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.900
Crystal Gatwood: And not that I know of.

413
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.840
Crystal Gatwood: I mean,

414
00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:30.630
Crystal Gatwood: I don't like going to bears or carnivals, or because of the crowd.

415
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.930
Crystal Gatwood: This is something I've always

416
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:40.980
Crystal Gatwood: Not like seeing all the different faces are they start to blur and then I have an anxiety attack.

417
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.670
Richelle Direny: Did you use to go to these things when you were younger.

418
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:45.720
Yeah.

419
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.600
Richelle Direny: Did you use the going

420
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.730
Crystal Gatwood: Like

421
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.190
Crystal Gatwood: My mommy's it won't

422
00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:08.880
Crystal Gatwood: Allow me to take us as our dad used to take us to like kings Island, things like that. When he got us you know to do something fun with us. And when I was younger, I could do it. But as I got older, it's like

423
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:21.150
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, maybe it's the fear of running into him. I don't know.

424
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.500
Crystal Gatwood: What

425
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.060
Richelle Direny: I'm going to ask you a hypothetical

426
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:32.370
Richelle Direny: If he was arrested and was incarcerated and you knew exactly where he was

427
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.300
You think your fears will still be the same.

428
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.850
Crystal Gatwood: If I knew that he was incarcerated.

429
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:51.810
Richelle Direny: Redo new. This is where he what he is, I know he's incarcerated. I know you've been punished. Do you think there's a part of you.

430
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:58.260
Crystal Gatwood: I think I would still do that. I think I would still wait for the grocery store to be empty.

431
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.720
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know, maybe that's a whole nother thing of my anxiety that I just don't like crowds.

432
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:12.660
Richelle Direny: When you're identifying the crowd always been like born

433
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:20.850
Crystal Gatwood: I'm pretty much yeah like I remember being younger and my mom, going to the store, but I would sit in the car. It was too busy.

434
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.230
Crystal Gatwood: With school shopping was hard.

435
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:34.530
Crystal Gatwood: Because there was always a lot of people getting ready for school. You know, trying to get all their things together and it was always crowded.

436
00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:42.450
Richelle Direny: Do you think that being a part of a crowd and being around people, they look at you a certain way and they kind of

437
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:53.370
Richelle Direny: Maybe have an inkling of They Know what happens to you. And so for you. You feel like you're being judged and you're being ridiculed and that's why you don't like crowds.

438
00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:01.440
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, I've never felt that way on the person that only fuck what you think. Let me

439
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:03.600
A

440
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:08.550
Crystal Gatwood: Mirror.

441
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:13.620
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

442
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.630
Crystal Gatwood: Oh,

443
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.280
Crystal Gatwood: Okay.

444
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:25.080
Crystal Gatwood: I'm almost done. Okay, hurt. It's red.

445
00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.570
Crystal Gatwood: It's okay.

446
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.970
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry, didn't have school today presidents day

447
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.740
Richelle Direny: Oh lot schools, though.

448
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.680
Richelle Direny: Are you doing well. Not all schools are upset.

449
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.870
Richelle Direny: Oh really, yeah.

450
00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:58.800
Richelle Direny: So, um, but, yeah. So you see how you just said that you're the type of person. We really don't care what people think.

451
00:42:59.610 --> 00:42:59.970
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

452
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:03.540
Richelle Direny: What about that degree of

453
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:13.080
Richelle Direny: Strength and and like how you just say, Look, I really don't care what you think, or what you're going to say. So why can't you take you back and I'm trying, you

454
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.420
Crystal Gatwood: Know,

455
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.120
Richelle Direny: I'm out and about and i want i

456
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:26.580
Crystal Gatwood: Want right, you would think I would being that type of person you know but i don't i don't know

457
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.870
Crystal Gatwood: I have not figured out why. Yeah.

458
00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:38.700
Richelle Direny: Maybe one day when you are when you're putting the place. So how is it, how do you handle like if your son has an event at school.

459
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.310
Richelle Direny: Do you go to those events.

460
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:48.450
Crystal Gatwood: Um, yeah, they have a thing called family night.

461
00:43:49.500 --> 00:44:01.560
Crystal Gatwood: And it's with his after school program. So there's not there's only certain amount of people there and it's usually either outside or in a big gymnasium.

462
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:16.380
Crystal Gatwood: You know, and so it's not too bad for me. But there has been one time where I started to get my chest starts to tighten up and I went outside and just got the fresh air, and then it went back in, but

463
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:19.920
Crystal Gatwood: So far, I haven't had a problem with that.

464
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:32.370
Crystal Gatwood: And we're small town. So our, you know, our school system and stuff like that ain't very big

465
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:33.690
Richelle Direny: Very big.

466
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:34.800
Right.

467
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:48.810
Richelle Direny: I mean, I guess, through. Only time can tell where you'll be able to find and identify what specifically are, what can you associate with when when you go in a crowd.

468
00:44:50.310 --> 00:45:01.500
Richelle Direny: What is it that you're looking at seeing smelling feeling hearing just kind of utilize your senses. What does it, touch, smell, seeing, hearing, all of that.

469
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:13.320
Richelle Direny: Identify the five senses and if you're feeling anxiety coming on trying to identify which one of the seven senses came heightened that brought on this degree of anxiety.

470
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.080
Richelle Direny: And what can you pinpoint it to

471
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:18.270
Richelle Direny: Because

472
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:33.300
Richelle Direny: You know you, only you can tell what that could be what that can be associated with, is it some direct relation to our formulations your past trauma.

473
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:41.220
Richelle Direny: That's why all of this is occurring because like you said you were three when all of this happened. So prior to two, three years old.

474
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:55.950
Richelle Direny: There was not a whole lot of things that you can remember. And there's a whole lot of things. Well, you know, I remember this. And I remember life was really happy until where you associate but then you're saying that the trauma happened from three to seven but

475
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:13.410
Richelle Direny: You kind of laid it to you buried it in the in your subconscious for over 20 something years until you had your child. And when you had your child, it kind of brought up everything. And because your child looks so much like you know

476
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.170
Richelle Direny: What, what you're saying is that

477
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:24.720
Richelle Direny: Or at least what I'm hearing you say is that had your trial not look good. Not beer a mirror reflection of yourself.

478
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.410
Richelle Direny: The impact wouldn't have been so great.

479
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.620
Crystal Gatwood: I don't think so. Probably not.

480
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.680
Richelle Direny: The other thing is like

481
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:36.540
Crystal Gatwood: What do you know

482
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:44.640
Crystal Gatwood: When my, I don't have any problem like that with my son. You know, I don't know if it's because it's he's a male

483
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.520
Crystal Gatwood: You know what I mean. But it's just my daughter loves so much like me.

484
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:59.010
Crystal Gatwood: Even through baby pictures you know just growing up just literally our reflection.

485
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.220
Richelle Direny: Back. There's a part of you.

486
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:09.750
Richelle Direny: That

487
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.910
Richelle Direny: You look at your daughter through his lens.

488
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:19.890
Crystal Gatwood: There's a piece

489
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:25.680
Richelle Direny: Of that that you're still carry with you, which is the part where it says forgiving him his release.

490
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.830
Crystal Gatwood: Right. He is

491
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:36.630
Richelle Direny: Not it's not for him. It's for you. It's so that you can stop looking at the world through his lens.

492
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:37.950
Okay.

493
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.300
Richelle Direny: And sometimes, and sometimes what makes it

494
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.310
Richelle Direny: I don't want to say it makes it Europe, but it doesn't

495
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:54.240
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes you you often have you ever heard of like generational things

496
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:55.530
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

497
00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.440
Richelle Direny: Kind of like what happened to you.

498
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:09.810
Richelle Direny: You end up doing the same thing to someone else, even though that you would never hurt someone that way but you end up doing it and it be

499
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:20.550
Richelle Direny: Some sense of power and control. That's what a computer in your mind. It's essential power and control and then carries on. So, you know, it could be

500
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:30.960
Richelle Direny: That maybe that's something similar happened to him. And so this is what how he transpired. This is what he ended up doing.

501
00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:38.070
Crystal Gatwood: Right, like I've read that I'm children that are, you know,

502
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:46.290
Crystal Gatwood: sexually molested or things like that tend to actually grow up and do the same thing.

503
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.930
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes, and

504
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.290
Crystal Gatwood: I think how low you know how you felt

505
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.940
Crystal Gatwood: You know,

506
00:48:54.390 --> 00:49:04.770
Richelle Direny: It's about the control. It's about because it's a sense of power and control. I now have power. It's a false sense of power and control.

507
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:05.130
Or

508
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:11.040
Richelle Direny: False sense but that's where you are you the one who says the

509
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:30.720
Richelle Direny: Our mind can be our own enemy. Well, and that's it's really truly a false sense of really truly a false sense of power control you think that you have power and control over this person because you're still hurting on the inside. You all of these unresolved emotions.

510
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:31.530
Crystal Gatwood: So,

511
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:41.430
Richelle Direny: I said you are looking at the world through his lunch justify your own feelings and what

512
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.540
Richelle Direny: Went On With you, you're trying to justify you're trying to rationalize it

513
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.530
Crystal Gatwood: And don't

514
00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:53.460
Richelle Direny: Give you this false sense of a way to justify and rationalize it so it all gets computed to

515
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.100
Richelle Direny: I have control and power over you. And so you feel

516
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.840
Richelle Direny: somewhat satisfied, but it's a false sense of satisfaction.

517
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:10.110
Richelle Direny: Satisfied, you think, Okay, you know what I have control. But you really don't

518
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:11.580
Crystal Gatwood: Have a

519
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:17.490
Richelle Direny: sense of satisfaction is a sauce a false sense of our control. It isn't

520
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.200
Richelle Direny: It is just

521
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.170
Crystal Gatwood: When I read that, I was like, there's no way like I could never do that too.

522
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.930
Crystal Gatwood: That's crazy to me.

523
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:40.620
Crystal Gatwood: But, you know, like now in comparison to like my personal relationship like with my spouse or any other you know relationship that I've had. And

524
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:47.670
Crystal Gatwood: You know, I'm the type of person that if you think your girl control me you got nothing coming

525
00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.560
Richelle Direny: We'll see. But you're a grown person.

526
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:53.280
Richelle Direny: And abuser doesn't abuse.

527
00:50:54.630 --> 00:51:01.830
Richelle Direny: A person who was abused doesn't someone there saying, eight and go abuse them because guess what I can't control you.

528
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:02.910
Know,

529
00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.100
Richelle Direny: You're gonna be like you, you will not want that to me, that's what. But guess what I

530
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:13.950
Richelle Direny: What you're going to go to an innocent person was so much weaker.

531
00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:15.600
Crystal Gatwood: Oh my God, yeah.

532
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.780
Richelle Direny: You understand they're going to go to something so much weaker.

533
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.510
Crystal Gatwood: But I don't understand it. Just a dime. Like it's crazy.

534
00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:38.190
Richelle Direny: And that the party you understand it, but you don't understand it because with your the wisdom and the understanding that you have right now, you're, you're kind of fighting was. Well, that makes no sense.

535
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.430
Crystal Gatwood: But it is. Yeah.

536
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:46.050
Richelle Direny: It is what it is. It's, it's a false sense of power and control.

537
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.010
Richelle Direny: Now you know what I feel like now I understand because listen, the reality of it is

538
00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:04.890
Richelle Direny: We don't really listen to each other. We don't really, if I'm telling you to do this or I'm saying to do that. Or I'm trying to guide you and you're giving you all this resistance.

539
00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:20.880
Richelle Direny: Now, that's all sense of power and control now overtakes me and now this is how I'm going to show you that I'm in control. I'm going to take dominion over and I'm going to tell you what to and you're going to listen to what I'm saying to you understand

540
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:32.850
Richelle Direny: When oftentimes you'll hear that person say maybe that's how that person felt when they did it with me. So now I'm going to do it with you. It's all a work week and thinking

541
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:39.180
Crystal Gatwood: Is like might you my parenting isn't even like that.

542
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:50.220
Crystal Gatwood: I'll try to fix it when I'm done I have like maybe 10 minutes okay but I can try.

543
00:52:51.720 --> 00:53:03.630
Crystal Gatwood: I'll try. Okay, I have 10 minutes left. Yeah, I'll try to glue it. All right, thank you. So, like, even with my parenting skills like you know i'm not

544
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:21.270
Crystal Gatwood: overbearing or, you know, because I know I have control of my kids. It's not like I'm not even like that, you know, I set my kids down and I explain and just like a tone of voice, just like this. I don't raise my voice. I hate that shit but

545
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:30.030
Crystal Gatwood: I just don't understand i is a twisted work were thinking and I'm so glad I don't think like that.

546
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.160
Richelle Direny: It is a sick, twisted way of thinking that it's the same time.

547
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:40.950
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes, what I've seen is a lot of times, the people who

548
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.340
Richelle Direny: Like I said, you and I both can both experienced the same exact things

549
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:48.660
Right.

550
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.290
Richelle Direny: But we're two completely different individuals.

551
00:53:53.520 --> 00:54:09.450
Richelle Direny: We, we have different personalities I my personality is one that just kind of held on to I refuse to talk to me. I refuse to release it. I refuse to process it. So then it's what's

552
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:17.340
Richelle Direny: In my mind to do is just make keep going over and over and over. And then I start creating all kinds of thoughts and whatever.

553
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:36.330
Richelle Direny: Now, the situation has governed my life you on the other end went through the same exact thing. But then you come to realize like, I don't want this to continue to control me so I'm going to at least make an attempt to go through the process, the healing process, learn how

554
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.680
Richelle Direny: And in doing so, I'm not going to

555
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:48.240
Richelle Direny: allow myself to repeat the cycle. So if you decide I'm going to stop the line.

556
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:55.980
Crystal Gatwood: I'm more like very, very, I wouldn't say strict with my daughter, but um

557
00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:09.540
Crystal Gatwood: You know, so like dresses. She loves dresses, but they have to be a certain length. And if they are, then she has to wear a pair of shorts underneath them and that type of overbearing and

558
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:13.470
Crystal Gatwood: Will be the first time she had a male teacher

559
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:20.580
Crystal Gatwood: I flipped out like I did a background check owning I call the school.

560
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:32.730
Crystal Gatwood: I did I call the school and I was like, you know, I need to meet him, because I might want her to switch to a female teacher and I met him and

561
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:42.360
Crystal Gatwood: He seemed like a very nice person. Nothing came up with a background check, by the way. Um, and, you know, I always tell my daughter that the secrets are dangerous.

562
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:50.370
Crystal Gatwood: Secrets are dangerous and favor ability may not be something that she thinks it is, you know, and

563
00:55:50.880 --> 00:56:04.680
Crystal Gatwood: Like she come home from school was like, you know, I got a piece of bubble gum today because I was good. I was like, did was it just you, or did everybody get his logo. You know, like it. I'm very worried type, you know, and

564
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.320
Richelle Direny: Just like the therapy.

565
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.880
Richelle Direny: Wall because of what you went through. You see life through a different lens.

566
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:19.980
Richelle Direny: Was battling with what you went through. But you see life through a different lens and you don't look at everything as, in a sense.

567
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:21.270
Crystal Gatwood: Well, as you know,

568
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:31.140
Richelle Direny: So, but then remember the same way because of what you went through with a male you somewhat look at all males, the same way.

569
00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:42.540
Richelle Direny: If it was a female who did it to you, you would look at females through a different lens. But we, the reality of life is because of what you went through. You kind of have to open it up.

570
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:53.400
Richelle Direny: Everyone because anybody can violate you anyone can do what they do. It's all about like you're teaching your daughter to be minus, like you said, Don't keep secrets.

571
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.260
Richelle Direny: Be open

572
00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:10.350
Richelle Direny: And but what you because of what you went through. You're empowered in a different way than someone who never went through what you went through. You see life in a different way. It gives you a different type of strength now.

573
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:17.550
Crystal Gatwood: What you know what happened to me or anything. You know, I've never told her that yet but you know she knows that.

574
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:35.070
Crystal Gatwood: You know, people aren't always what you look what you seen you know and and there's people out there that like little girls and they will take them you know and and so I've always been overbearing and that type of way.

575
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:38.130
Crystal Gatwood: And it's not that

576
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:40.590
Richelle Direny: No.

577
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:50.130
Richelle Direny: No, it is not a bad thing because it's not just about again you see the world just because of what you went through, but the reality of it is like you said.

578
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:56.040
Richelle Direny: What you're saying is true. Everyone is not as they present

579
00:57:56.430 --> 00:58:00.840
Richelle Direny: Themselves everyone cannot be trusted. The way you want to trust them.

580
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:19.620
Richelle Direny: Know the same concept that you have for your daughter. You can apply it to your son as well because you know what both of like can do put harm to both sexes, doesn't matter. But for you. It's unique to you and how you look at it, it's because of what you went through.

581
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:30.990
Richelle Direny: Maybe at some point in life or at some point when you feel comfortable and you think that she can handle it. Maybe it's having a session where you you share that with her. You haven't

582
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.840
Crystal Gatwood: Seen some point I will

583
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:38.580
Richelle Direny: Yes. At some point you have that conversation with her, so she can understand

584
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.600
Crystal Gatwood: Where you're

585
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:47.700
Richelle Direny: Coming from because the greatest life lesson is to teach from where you came from. And the reason it's kind of like

586
00:58:48.570 --> 00:59:03.180
Richelle Direny: I always say, I don't you know sometimes like when I get real passionate about something I said I'm not saying it because I'm giving you an opinion. I'm seeing it because I know exactly what I'm talking about experience. I'm, what I'm saying, and

587
00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.040
Crystal Gatwood: Trying to protect so you

588
00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.810
Richelle Direny: Don't have to go through that what

589
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:15.300
Richelle Direny: You're not to trust anyone. I'm just saying, be mindful of how you do that.

590
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:20.040
Richelle Direny: Um, but, uh, you know, it sounds like you've come a long way. I think, you know,

591
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.880
Richelle Direny: I would say like with the insight, you said that you're not seeing a psychiatrist now right

592
00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:28.620
Crystal Gatwood: No.

593
00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:35.100
Richelle Direny: So maybe seeing a psychiatry like for antidepressants like

594
00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:46.170
Richelle Direny: To take meds for antidepressants will definitely be helpful. I think when it's all said and done when it's medication. I will never tell someone not to do medication, but what I will say this is this

595
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.890
Richelle Direny: doesn't resolve your problem, it just

596
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:56.940
Richelle Direny: Allows you to be a little bit more emotionally level. So you can process and work through those issues.

597
00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.260
Crystal Gatwood: The Council that helps me really

598
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:09.360
Crystal Gatwood: Just like the Boston. You know, so often in oil mean either the counseling that does the most

599
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.000
Richelle Direny: That it's the counseling that does the most and it's

600
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:18.480
Richelle Direny: Bringing your authentic truth to it to process.

601
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.930
All

602
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:32.520
Richelle Direny: To share it, say the reason why you're struggling to share it. If you feel like it's being you're being pushed or it's putting you in emotional distress verbalizing that

603
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:33.870
Crystal Gatwood: Uh huh.

604
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.370
Crystal Gatwood: Because just like when you go to a

605
01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:44.610
Richelle Direny: Doctor, and you say, Hey Doc, I feel sick. But then he's like, Okay. Well, give me a little bit more information like Dr. Ain't no God. He can't just

606
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.650
Richelle Direny: tell you what's wrong with you, you got to give them a little something.

607
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:50.790
Richelle Direny: So,

608
01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.600
Richelle Direny: The same way in counseling. I truly believe

609
01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:58.110
Richelle Direny: You are your own counselor, the

610
01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.160
Crystal Gatwood: Counselor is only

611
01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:06.930
Richelle Direny: there to hear it and repeat it back to you and to guide you through it. But we are our own counselors, because when you

612
01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:08.670
Richelle Direny: When you, when you say it.

613
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.080
You're possible

614
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:11.940
Crystal Gatwood: Right.

615
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:13.590
Crystal Gatwood: And yeah, that makes them.

616
01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:15.570
Richelle Direny: You are ready.

617
01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:23.190
Richelle Direny: You're taking it out. You're hearing it back, you're processing and you're like, oh wait, hold on, I think I just figured that once

618
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:25.440
Richelle Direny: You understand

619
01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:33.570
Richelle Direny: Wall counters only there to kind of guide you and to help you restructure your give you, or give you a different perspective of how to look at it.

620
01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.420
Richelle Direny: Okay.

621
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:37.560
Well,

622
01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:43.230
Richelle Direny: Let's see how when when we met last time. How often did we say we're going

623
01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:48.360
Crystal Gatwood: I think it was a first weekly because I have so much going on.

624
01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:54.870
Crystal Gatwood: Now,

625
01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.030
Richelle Direny: What days are best for you.

626
01:01:59.520 --> 01:01:59.940
Crystal Gatwood: Like

627
01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:15.540
Crystal Gatwood: Mainly, like when he's at school. So like, Monday through Friday from I'd say 930 ish to about three. Can I do like somewhere in between there.

628
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.420
Richelle Direny: And let's see.

629
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:33.060
Richelle Direny: Do you do you do groups on when Thursday's

630
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:35.910
Crystal Gatwood: Yes. Yep. Thursdays at one

Richelle Direny: We can't, we can't do 30 days because of your group.

Christine Campbell: Right.

652
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.790
Richelle Direny: But the other thing.

653
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.210
Is

654
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.120
Richelle Direny: There was something else.

655
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.330

657
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:37.110
Christine Campbell: All right. Did you sent me on a couple hours, though. So I'm only doing like maybe 15 hours a week, just like Friday, Saturday, Sunday for now. Anyway, then

658
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:41.550
Christine Campbell: You're trying to me for a shift later. So it'll

659
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:46.950
Christine Campbell: I don't know when that they'll get the 30 like 35 hours after

660
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:54.600
Christine Campbell: A while. So it's annoying. They're not getting the hours, but I really like it. And it's really close. So I want to stick it out.

731
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.040
Christine Campbell: I don't know why it's so hard for me to do sometimes.

732
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:18.600
Richelle Direny: Anxiety etc and all that difference

733
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:23.400

Richelle Direny: To turn well

746
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:20.910

762
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:26.850
Richelle Direny: Well hey you know what if you make a start and you do what you have to do, and you see the changes, then he sees the changes, then you kind of will fall in line to the same

763
01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:31.950
Richelle Direny: Do you agree.

764
01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:33.840

Richelle Direny: 15 hours.

782
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.200
Richelle Direny: And the 15 hours are stretched out.

783
01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:25.530
Or

784
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.120
Christine Campbell: Yeah, I do enjoy that.

785
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.220
Christine Campbell: Like I like getting out, um, you know, don't go anywhere. So that's one place I go

786
01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:37.500
Christine Campbell: I like it.

787
01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.930
Richelle Direny: So for the days that you don't work. You can see that up.

788
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:45.060
Christine Campbell: And running

789
01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:47.040
Richelle Direny: And it's only once.

790
01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.990
Christine Campbell: I've always been that way about all doctors are just like, and I want to go in

791
01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:11.790

792
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:16.770
Christine Campbell: You know, I'm sure they're gonna find some cancer, whatever.

793
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:21.390
Christine Campbell: You know, that's, that's great. I was really surprised happily.

802
01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.250
A psychiatrist.

807
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:53.220
Christine Campbell: I just don't really care about doing anything, anything that's like something I don't even care.

814
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:31.440
Christine Campbell: does sound like that for sure. I know I was thinking about that as I go. I mean, I've been feeling okay but I still want to do anything.

815
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.310
Christine Campbell: So yeah, I guess.

816
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:38.040
Richelle Direny: Well, when you look around you.

817
01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.000

Christine Campbell: Oh well, honestly, like I wouldn't like that. I really like fix my house a little bit or something courses, money is always a problem, but it's still a couple things, whatever. But if I it all breaks down their bills.

824
01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:21.600
Christine Campbell: I see no point in cleaning something that somebody else is going to dirty and I have to keep cleaning up after like their children.

825
01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:29.220
Christine Campbell: So I'm going to do it. And I'm going to point to having that nice because it won't stay nice

826
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.110
Christine Campbell: But that's for that.

Christine Campbell: There ain't no point

829
01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:49.800

Christine Campbell: So,

850
01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.560
Christine Campbell: I'll read something or watch something on TV and you asked me what it was.

Christine Campbell: Yeah, I mean I didn't do nothing. I'll feel exhausted.

859
01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:22.380
Christine Campbell: Mentally, I guess, it has to be because I ain't physical

860
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.540
Christine Campbell: Cuz I didn't do anything.

861
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.330

Christine Campbell: Right. There you go. Yeah, that's good way to play.

867
01:22:55.620 --> 01:23:02.790
Richelle Direny: You like the motivation to do things right. Don't go anywhere. You don't go to any kind of

879
01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.050
Christine Campbell: Instead of like I won't force myself to do anything. I don't have to do

880
01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.570
Christine Campbell: I'll just say no, I can't afford I could do some to make myself do it but it won't enjoy it. You know, I just want to enjoy some

881
01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:03.900
Christine Campbell: Okay, what

882
01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.450
Richelle Direny: Is another goal could be to identify something

883
01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:15.300
Richelle Direny: By the time. Our next session is identifying something that

884
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:17.730
Richelle Direny: Activities that you like.

885
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.230
Richelle Direny: Something that you would like to

Christine Campbell: London.

887
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:28.140
Richelle Direny: In terms of income. It's you don't have any income right it's just whatever now that

888
01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:28.470
Christine Campbell: You have

889
01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:36.030
Christine Campbell: Barely bringing anything. Well, I got one Chagos small

890
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.340
Christine Campbell: There's like $90 but my kids been helping

891
01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:47.340
Richelle Direny: So do you lose you lack motivation.

892
01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:49.680
Christine Campbell: You feel discouraged because

893
01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:57.390
Richelle Direny: Of part of your discouragement and the AIDS in your depression is not because you don't have any income on your own.

894
01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.000
Christine Campbell: Yeah, that's so lot

895
01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:09.780
Christine Campbell: To yeah you know it takes money to walk outside, you know, just getting your cousins.

896
01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.080
Richelle Direny: A part of your depression is that because you don't have money to do anything. You feel discouraged.

897
01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:28.080
Christine Campbell: Well, yeah, yeah. You don't soon takes money do everything you know you're going somewhere you need gas you know it. Eat what money we do get we eat.

898
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:33.120
Christine Campbell: Now get food stamps believing that last week.

899
01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.070
Richelle Direny: You said that you actually

900
01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:39.810
Christine Campbell: Oh, yeah.

901
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.260
Christine Campbell: A week and a half tops and I still got MEET. LEFT. But that is it.

902
01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.890
Christine Campbell: Like that forever. Ain't no big deal.

903
01:25:54.210 --> 01:25:55.230
Christine Campbell: Always get by.

904
01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:01.590
Richelle Direny: Because of this feeling of, you're always just getting by.

905
01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:05.550
Christine Campbell: Maybe

906
01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.800
Christine Campbell: I've always been like that. So, I mean, I never been ahead of the game.

907
01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:22.050
Christine Campbell: I mean, I've been places where I was comfortable before you stop good credit and all that ruin that that would be a great thing where you know what yeah that would make me feel really good. I got my credit back on track.

908
01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:27.480
Christine Campbell: And I probably could do that, you know, just by sending them 20 bucks in

909
01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:33.120
Christine Campbell: Beginning that would make me feel great.

910
01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:34.680
You're in a lot of dentists.

911
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:41.970
Christine Campbell: And I knew, like, you know, wasn't totally broke or whatever, you know, always had a credit card or something.

912
01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.150
Christine Campbell: You're in a lot of debt and it's

913
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:52.560
Christine Campbell: Just credit card, not like a massive amount

914
01:26:53.580 --> 01:27:08.430
Christine Campbell: Like under 10,000 so I couldn't even have to me. I've tried to get like lenders or nurse and it ain't enough debt. For me, it's not that nobody will give me any credit, but not enough to get out of it makes no sense.

915
01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.190
Christine Campbell: Not makes no sense.

916
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:14.100
Richelle Direny: Hey, by the way of the world.

917
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:25.050
Christine Campbell: And then my husband being on the SS is like I could only work so much. I can't strive to be better because if I do, they'll take it out of his check

918
01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.140
Christine Campbell: Think that's something stupid.

919
01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:34.890
Christine Campbell: So they're holding me down to that makes no sense.

920
01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.300
You have this feeling of

921
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:41.670
Christine Campbell: Know, I've only been so much and I can't get better.

922
01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:46.740
Christine Campbell: You know, I can't ever manage that place because I'll make too much.

923
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:51.450
Richelle Direny: But what is

924
01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.260
Christine Campbell: What are some of your

925
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:59.040
Christine Campbell: Job. It's all any means, you know, I will never be rich off it just like that. It's stupid to me.

926
01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.200
Christine Campbell: So I don't believe over willing

927
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:19.560
Christine Campbell: To make over 1200 dollars a month, which I probably won't. So, you know, if I had the chance to have to say no because I'd be working for free, pretty much.

928
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.580
Christine Campbell: Oh,

929
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.710
Richelle Direny: Look at your financial situation.

930
01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.210
Richelle Direny: It seems great

931
01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.160
Richelle Direny: Because you're you're somewhat helpless.

932
01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:32.130
Christine Campbell: Yeah.

933
01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.330
Richelle Direny: So with your fight so you're somewhat helps us

934
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:37.140
Christine Campbell: You can

935
01:28:37.170 --> 01:28:38.610
Richelle Direny: Help your son yourself.

936
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:41.610
Richelle Direny: Can't be there for your children. You have to be

937
01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:43.800
Richelle Direny: somewhat dependent on your

938
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.610
Richelle Direny: On your

939
01:28:46.170 --> 01:28:47.460
Christine Campbell: You would like to do, right.

940
01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:48.960
You're doing

941
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:50.970
Richelle Direny: So the way

942
01:28:52.080 --> 01:29:01.350
Christine Campbell: Her fitness checks and not you know you know work more because I just started you know like we shouldn't need their help anymore.

943
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:06.000
Christine Campbell: Which would be good because I feel bad.

944
01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:09.990
Christine Campbell: But also feel grateful.

945
01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:12.330
Christine Campbell: That I've kids like that.

946
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:18.090
Richelle Direny: You feel grateful that you have feedback.

947
01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:21.450

01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:30.660
Richelle Direny: Know,

950
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:32.250
Richelle Direny: So,

951
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:35.070
Richelle Direny: The one goal that will send

952
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:39.030
Richelle Direny: You but identifying

953
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:50.340
Christine Campbell: That

954
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.170
Richelle Direny: You said that you like painting.

955
01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:55.530

Christine Campbell: When things really nice things.

958
01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:03.900

Richelle Direny: You said you used to paint really

960
01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:14.550
Christine Campbell: Nothing. Oh yeah, very nice. When I was told I could sell them, but I get

Christine Campbell: But I like it, I love it, love it.

963

Christine Campbell: Gotta move because my husband felt the need to come in the room and make some the

964
01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:28.890
Christine Campbell: Anger.

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:38.100
Richelle Direny: Is you're not the happiest in your current relationships.

966
01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.720
Christine Campbell: No, no, but I don't want another one that's for sure.

967
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:45.570
Christine Campbell: Never

968
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.590
Richelle Direny: Have you guys ever gone

969
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.260
Christine Campbell: Oh, no.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:56.400
Richelle Direny: No.

971
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:58.530
Christine Campbell: You wouldn't agree to it.

972
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.910
Christine Campbell: No.

973
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:05.820
Christine Campbell: What do you do

Part of any organization.

Christine Campbell: No.

978
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.170
Richelle Direny: Tell me a little bit about

01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:25.500
Richelle Direny: Before

01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:30.240
Richelle Direny: You before

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.530
Richelle Direny: Tell me a little bit about yourself.

983
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.400
Richelle Direny: Where you are right now in terms of

984
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.240
Christine Campbell: feeling depressed,

985
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.950
Christine Campbell: feeling quite was

986
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.110
Richelle Direny: Not able to

987
01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:47.790
Christine Campbell: Support yourself or

988
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:49.500
Richelle Direny: Any kind of worried you want

989
01:31:53.790 --> 01:32:03.000
Christine Campbell: I think, actually, and I think about it. Probably a lot does have to do with money, because I know when I was secure with money.

990
01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:04.740
Christine Campbell: You know,

991
01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.540
Christine Campbell: I just felt better.

992
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:16.140
Christine Campbell: More, More free to do whatever you know do whatever I wanted.

993
01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:19.350
Christine Campbell: Not whatever I wanted. They

994
01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:28.050
Christine Campbell: Don't let anybody hold me back from something I wanted to do.

995
01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:32.730
Christine Campbell: Happiness.

996
01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:34.470
Christine Campbell: Like a meat.

997
01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.200
Richelle Direny: So having limited income makes you feel

998
01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:43.290
Richelle Direny: Like you feel

999
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.270
Christine Campbell: Like you're not able to do anything.

1000
01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:49.500
Christine Campbell: Yeah, well, yeah, and

1001
01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.780
Christine Campbell: I don't have a car.

1002
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:53.280
Christine Campbell: You know,

1003
01:32:55.830 --> 01:33:04.260
Christine Campbell: I go on need for sure is get my license back and just got suspended for driving without insurance and then it was under suspension it

1004
01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:09.630
Christine Campbell: Add a renewal, which I couldn't. So now I gotta take those stupid test again.

1005
01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:15.720
Christine Campbell: I still drive, though I drove for years without a license.

1006
01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:21.090
Christine Campbell: Often on many years 1.11 stroke 10 years without one.

1007
01:33:22.650 --> 01:33:32.700
Christine Campbell: But I mean, it's never a good thing to do. Don't go over and go the grocery store, whatever. And that's it. You know, don't go enjoy riding or nothing like that. But it's not a good idea.

1008
01:33:35.130 --> 01:33:37.770
Christine Campbell: Because when you do get conscious ends up being a ton of money.

1009
01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:44.370
Christine Campbell: But yeah I that I definitely plan on doing that soon.

1010
01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:47.220
Christine Campbell: Just

1011
01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:48.180
Nice.

1012
01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:50.130
Christine Campbell: Yeah.

1013
01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:54.390
Richelle Direny: And it's fine to work on trying to

1014
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:55.470
Get back your license.

1015
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:58.260
Richelle Direny: That, like you said,

1016
01:33:58.410 --> 01:33:59.970
Richelle Direny: Comes with money all

1017
01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:02.940
Richelle Direny: With the job that you have, are you able to increase

1018
01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.690
Richelle Direny: The amount of power.

1019
01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.770
Christine Campbell: Yeah, will soon as

1020
01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.840
Christine Campbell: I'm done training, which I know how they should give me more hours training.

1021
01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:15.660
Christine Campbell: You know, it's kind of backwards to me.

1022
01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:29.520
Christine Campbell: Because they're training me to be the shift manager or something like that, some kind of leader, whatever, which needs 35 hours a week or more. And the ones that do work there. Get that and they get more than that, actually.

1023
01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.530
Christine Campbell: Better understand why you know there are 12 and 15 years like

1024
01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:41.940
Christine Campbell: Any other time, I would say, forget it. You know, but

1025
01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:56.640
Christine Campbell: I like it. And it's so close. I'm just going to stick with it. And the fact that I can't make too much anyway. So just stay there anyway. See what happens. They all said, for sure. I'll get more hours.

1026
01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.630
Christine Campbell: That they wanted me to take it out or take this

1027
01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:08.520
Christine Campbell: Like it's testing online, you know, then when we do it at home. All right, no complaints me for that.

1028
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.970
Christine Campbell: Because it's against the law. Number one,

1029
01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:18.000
Christine Campbell: You know the labor was, whatever. Yeah, told him that so

1030
01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.340
Christine Campbell: I started taking it at work.

1031
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:29.130
Christine Campbell: It's going to like two hours on this and there were guys gonna be doing that for nothing. Our mind, we may only get 12 hours week. No.

1032
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:38.160
Christine Campbell: feelings on that everybody else that are like Lego. Yeah, you got to get paid for that.

1033
01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.620
Christine Campbell: That's wrong.

1034
01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:44.190
Christine Campbell: So don't think they realize they do now.

1035
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:46.320

1098
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.380
Richelle Direny: It's looking at it from a

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:31.740

1119
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:39.210
Christine Campbell: I really started

1120
01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:40.470
Richelle Direny: About a year ago.

1121
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.800
Christine Campbell: I've had jobs or just lost a really quick because

1122
01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:47.040
Christine Campbell: dependency on things.

1123
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:49.290
Richelle Direny: Well,

1124
01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:55.140
Richelle Direny: To think about because of your dependency or your means to cope

1125
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.880

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.970
Richelle Direny: Your financial

1127
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:01.140
Richelle Direny: Pressures and kind of your

1128
01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:02.190
Christine Campbell: Limitations.

1129
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.650

1143
01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:43.920
Richelle Direny: And that's

1144
01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.340
Christine Campbell: Because of your dependency. When you love her. Yeah.

1145
01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:50.700
Christine Campbell: Definitely yes it was because of

1146

Christine Campbell: Nothing to reach for

1154
01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:31.350
Christine Campbell: That is a habit. I've had all my life.

1155
01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:39.600

Christine Campbell: Do you have

1171
01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:07.800

Richelle Direny: In terms

1177
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:33.300
Richelle Direny: Of

1178
01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:34.800
The work.

1179
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:41.340

01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:48.780
Christine Campbell: Yeah. What did week. Yes.

1182
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.650
Richelle Direny: Was that give you a little bit more of more motivation and I

1183
01:44:52.650 --> 01:44:54.330
Christine Campbell: Think a lot of it is

1184
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:56.970
Richelle Direny: For lack of motivation. It's

1185
01:44:57.300 --> 01:45:06.150
Richelle Direny: Not everything based on what you've said, not everything will be associated with money like even when you said like just starting in their house. Sometimes

1186
01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:06.840
Christine Campbell: When you look at

1187
01:45:07.770 --> 01:45:08.880
Christine Campbell: Things or do things.

1188
01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:11.700
Richelle Direny: That doesn't require money that just

1189
01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.050
Richelle Direny: Retired your

1190
01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.160
Christine Campbell: Willingness to

1191
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.330
Richelle Direny: Do the things around the

1192
01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:15.780
House.

1193
01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:17.340
Richelle Direny: I think

1194
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:18.930
Christine Campbell: Based on what your car.

1195
01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:21.690
Christine Campbell: You're not working.

1196
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.930
Richelle Direny: Don't have any money. You have no motivation.

1197
01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.260
Christine Campbell: Around the house just doing your homework.

1198
01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:31.830
Richelle Direny: It's just

1199
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:32.790
Richelle Direny: You being

1200
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:33.720
Christine Campbell: You know you

1201
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:34.650
Richelle Direny: Are just sinking.

1202
01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:38.010
Richelle Direny: Your interest because you associate

1203
01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:38.610
Everything.
