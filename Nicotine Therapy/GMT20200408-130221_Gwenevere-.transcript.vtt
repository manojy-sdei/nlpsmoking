00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.629
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicholas Graham.

2
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's do a sound check and video. Make sure they're all in sync sound and video moving along sync all sunk.

3
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Video. Oh, let me hear you. Can you hear me. Right. Yes. There we go. Cool. Good morning. How are you, I'm good.

4
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. So you've got a sense of humor. That's a good start. Yeah, yeah.

5
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're here. You haven't completely disappeared on Dr. Every I was asking about you yesterday and I said, he is still tethered

6
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you must have been going through something yeah and and curious to see kind of what your story is with that and maybe we can spend a little time with it.

7
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I can't hear you. What just happened. I lost all audio. Let's check on it. First, something happened. I lost it completely.

8
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Did you do you know what changed. I have no idea. It's sitting here and I'm 10 feet from my house.

9
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird to come in from my phone, but okay.

10
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, we're good. I'll just, I'll just let you know. Okay, so, so, something, something happened, or maybe. Well, let me just show should listen

11
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.200
Nick Graham: Yeah, I like I like watched

12
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.990
Nick Graham: Sydney like cut a risk.

13
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:45.960
Nick Graham: And I had to like take her into the ER to like stay the night and that's pretty pretty not

14
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.360
fun to watch.

15
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.060
You know, to, like, so like started out with some

16
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.490
Nick Graham: Episode. And she was like,

17
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:06.960
Nick Graham: I don't know if it was like it, obviously, anyone who cuts areas like does it for a bad reason, you know, and so it was because I like saw that she was like

18
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.740
Nick Graham: Talking to some guy. And basically what I'm determining is like that's do all the tile for me.

19
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. And then I went on like a downward

20
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.690
Slope and

21
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.590
Nick Graham: Then I like the drugs like

22
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.570
Twice.

23
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.310
Nick Graham: In the last week like like last week.

24
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.480
And

25
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I went in the woods. So nothing crazy. Nothing too crazy. Okay, what, what would crazy have been

26
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.300
Nick Graham: I think crazy would have been like

27
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.660
That's probably pretty crazy, I guess.

28
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know most people aren't expecting anyone to really listen to what they're saying. But I do

29
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Very bad. Okay. Alright, so, so we're going to backpedal from the minimization, and we're going to say pretty bad. Okay. So, yeah, yeah.

30
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

31
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see so we I what I'm hearing was this. This is an isolated event. Is that how you view it. It's just this pocket. I would I would believe so. Yeah.

32
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if you and I might disagree on that point.

33
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And this will be a right, wrong, it might be just

34
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm an outsider looking in. I tend to see things as more progressive than the person that's sort of in it.

35
00:07:49.350 --> 00:08:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So like, if I were to pull up notes and look at marijuana use Xanax use self medication. I wonder if we would see

36
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: self medicating behavior. Yeah, and that's why I'm trying to say yellow think it's just came out of the blue. I don't even know what hit me.

37
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm looking, and I'm saying, well, it's a lot slicker than that we're saying yes to it and cracking open the door months in advance. We're getting ourselves ready for making a reservation for a relapse and

38
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

39
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.940
Nick Graham: I definitely like knew what like I was doing, you know, it's not like you just

40
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:47.430
Nick Graham: sleepwalk and then suddenly you know you possess drugs like it was definitely like a targeted thing that happened and

41
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.190
So yeah, I mean I think like

42
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:59.820
It could be isolated if you if I would like use the right you know stress management tactics and

43
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so let's just go backwards because I'm noticing that what I said I don't. Not sure if I've communicated well

44
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.730
Nick Graham: No, I think you're right. I think I understand what you're saying. There was a trend, leading to

45
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened. Yeah, so this word reservation. It's not just for dinner.

46
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You can set it up a year or two or three. I know it seems amazing how patient and addict voice can be how patient, it can be a little way.

47
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait for you to get shame or get overwhelmed or right

48
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Leave that little window for, you know, I have sometimes I'll have these these group meetings. And I'll say, what's the one thing that you're going to give yourself a good excuse for for using again and everybody has one of course it's if they have children, it's

49
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Something happens to my child. Right. Well, then I have to

50
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you'd have to live through it and it would be awful.

51
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That just that's a reservation and no one wants to hear that I know and so I don't have that group very often.

52
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And make new friends there.

53
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But, so that's the extreme now coming back. Right. So I've been watching. And I've been sort of, you know, sort of storing that okay so

54
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Using other substances little things here and there, putting yourself in an environment where people are drinking. Right. It's not this cold black and white. I cannot be around it. I can't. I've got it, I've got to have all positive influences people that support this notion

55
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Of health literally of health, like it's just like, why would you be like, they would look at you like, why are you drinking. Why would you drive. I don't get it. There's so many what you know like are you around those people. I bet you've met them.

56
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

57
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're still with these other folks.

58
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now I'm not trying to minimize this event. I just wanted to say.

59
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it was more seductive than that. And I know not everybody likes that word, but I do because it gets. Yeah. And you don't even know you're you're getting, like, come here and slowly you're moving closer and closer to it.

60
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can we can definitely talk about that event, but with the time that you have, what would feel the most productive. What do you want out of today, you want to share something. Do you want to just

61
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: bypass all that do EMT or do you want to get into because you have right now. Your check has moved also into joy, you've added a movement, you have an additional one. Yes.

62
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

63
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.950
Nick Graham: So I'm trying to think.

64
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.300
Nick Graham: What I think would be most productive. So I've been on

65
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.980
Nick Graham: This like tangent, like this little thought pattern.

66
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

67
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.390
Nick Graham: The past few days. So I went out into nature and I

68
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:19.350
Nick Graham: Started to like really sit down and like think about different things and why

69
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.920
Nick Graham: I guess like respond like the way I do and things. And I've been like practicing like mindfulness and

70
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.000
Nick Graham: I was like,

71
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:38.790
Nick Graham: My roommate. So that's why, like I disagree with you surround like because you're not like like here so you can kind of only like see like what like patterns like you would probably see from your end

72
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:46.950
Nick Graham: That people like in my house, like maybe they'll have a beer like every week or so. And there's this one guy that lives with me.

73
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.740
Nick Graham: name's Josh and he's he's really cool. He's like one of those people that you look at, and you're like, Well, that's a Zen person.

74
00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:04.440
Nick Graham: You know, like there's like that Christian that you look at, and they're like, wow, like what's what's going on with that person. Like, why are they so like calm and like he's like that way. But, like, just like Zen, you know, and so

75
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.650
Nick Graham: Kind of like speaking like with him about

76
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:17.190
Nick Graham: Like mindfulness and how, like, why is it that I can go to the pecker the pickles wilderness, just like the place that I go

77
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:25.590
Nick Graham: Why is it that I can just go there and then I can solve like problems like why can't I bring that with me.

78
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.130
Nick Graham: You know, like why can't see.

79
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.730
Nick Graham: That like live inside me like that.

80
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.310
Nick Graham: And so I mean going towards that and going towards like

81
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:47.730
Nick Graham: Fighting actively like like I know that we've talked in the past. And I always knew like I like taking a passive approach like

82
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:49.680
But

83
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.370
Nick Graham: I think like I need to be

84
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: angry about this and like okay

85
00:13:59.070 --> 00:13:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

86
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Notice the irony of it and I I recognize. I have a note about Josh chill and now I've got an event I recognize them right here. It was really in contrast with this other really intensely almost fall Intel ADHD like so kind of keeping car trying to get to know

87
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we were going along.

88
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Invited client to investigate personal thoughts, emotions that felt since around when you're around, Josh. Look at that. I invited client to investigate personal thoughts, emotions felt sense the body's response when around. JOSH, WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER THAT invitation or not he did it.

89
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.110
Nick Graham: Yeah definitely didn't remember that, but yeah.

90
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it was like

91
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: The watch the irony, how you. The last thing you just said was, I think I need to be angry.

92
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been more passive. So how do we go

93
00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I bring and I'm going to call it really spirituality. Now, your, your definition of pay goes in nature. I have been watching it, it is your

94
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Greater than the self piece and that in my terminology right it's it's a connection right if it's that like standing here feeling your feet, imagining

95
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The gravity pulling you to the center of the Earth like it's amazing, it's consistent is reliable, it is there every time so cool so powerful. And when you decide to be present with that right then. It's this vast expanse of strength.

96
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But you do have to be on purpose about it.

97
00:15:41.850 --> 00:16:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the how, how do we take this chill vibe. This spirituality and anger the juice that comes from anger, which helps protect something. So let's take, let's take this spirituality here this vitality. This sense of efficacy confidence. You're grounded right when you're in Picos

98
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I right, you feel grounded. You feel connected not alone. Alone, but not lonely, maybe. Yeah.

99
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you come back to people and we're a mess.

100
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

101
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, why did you say I've been passive and now I need to be angry, where it where it. What is that because I have an idea. But I'd like to see how you say it. Well, I think that it probably comes from

102
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.750
Previous conversations

103
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.000
Nick Graham: That we have had

104
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.570
Nick Graham: And just the fact that I get angry about like the wrong things.

105
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.160
And

106
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.840
I'm trying to think.

107
00:16:53.430 --> 00:17:01.830
Nick Graham: I feel like I should be mostly like I should be in, like, I don't know if, like, maybe like I feel like anger.

108
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.250
Nick Graham: Like by like in its root is not a good emotions and maybe like

109
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:16.140
The word that I would use it, be like, like maybe find a way to like harness that energy and use it towards something positive, or

110
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So the goal. Yeah. Well, I like to. I like to

111
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: neutralize your, your negative opinion about anger. I'm a big fan. And so maybe we'll just just keeping it from

112
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe find a word that you don't have associated with rage breaking things hurting people damaging relationships like I'm guessing you have your aunt, you're looking at what anger has done.

113
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe, maybe we can play with a little word game so that you're not having to have that ambivalence, or that resistance around the word I'm a fan. But I also have this best terminology of it and

114
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what it's like when people don't have it, and how depressed. They get without it. So like I have this like I care for it, just as much as I do all the other ones. But I know what I suspect, you're thinking. So let's think of a word that has a sense of harnessed

115
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me I'll throw some out and I'll say what I've witnessed is when people can harness it they have vitality

116
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: They have confidence they have conviction and determination, where the person that finds it unacceptable and they've grown up with the it's not acceptable to be angry.

117
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: They only know they've only got to turn it in, and then they get really depressed. It just goes in here and wipe them out. But if it's okay that that emotion is there to protect

118
00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And so now if I finish that sense. And this is where you come in. First let's pick another word, and then we're going to say what it

119
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What is purposes. What is protecting what it is safe guarding. So what's a word that works for you instead of anger, it could still be an energized mobility.

120
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.060
I'm trying to

121
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.670
Nick Graham: Think of that. Like, I guess, like I would probably like to put in a sense of like

122
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.600
Flames or

123
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you got some symbolism, let's let's play with that.

124
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now I put so harness anger. We've got imagery of flames.

125
00:19:47.790 --> 00:20:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, we're back to some elements for back to nature. Again, or we're back to it. We can't deny it just can't. It's just relevant for your, for your sense of identity and where you deeply connect in the meeting you make and I don't know much about elements.

126
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to be a little naive in here, but I think there's this whole field of like understanding what the flame is and like your astrological sign and things like that. There's this whole world. I think you could probably check out where there'd be some neat terms.

127
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's let's see if we can just play linguistically with us.

128
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So words that I think of are assertive.

129
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's kind of a low flame word, isn't it.

130
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

131
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can find some words somewhere in between. Maybe so rages way, hot, hot, hot, hot big flame assertive and kind of low like an

132
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Ember, maybe. So let's think of something that might might capture in between here maybe see if you can see, see it in another sometimes it's easier for us to we're good at labeling other people. Sometimes it's harder to turn it on ourselves.

133
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We could start with Josh

134
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What does he do to protect his convictions.

135
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:33.450
Whoa, like the way that I'm like discuss like

136
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:41.610
Nick Graham: Well, I can't. I could not see that that character and like in any in any form of like

137
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.310
Anger or

138
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.570
Focused or like happiness or

139
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

140
00:21:54.450 --> 00:22:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, try this word assertive on with him just as a point of departure. You can't quite see the anger on a Josh, can you see assertive member of my question was,

141
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What does he do to protect his convictions. Now, that's my question. And you went to seeing anger on him. You tried that outfit on that little costume didn't fit. Let's try something else. What does Josh do to protect his convictions.

142
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.080
Nick Graham: You like walk barefoot through people's yards.

143
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

144
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so he is. It is that a defiance of social norms. What do you think is in tension with that as well.

145
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.420
Nick Graham: I think it comes from, like, like getting into like mindfulness

146
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:50.100
Nick Graham: I think the reason that it's so possible to feel connected into nature is because there's not like associations to like society or to man or two.

147
00:22:50.850 --> 00:23:03.180
Nick Graham: Things and so like I think like the idea of like property as a as an idea property is just an idea. It's a boundary drawn by a man, you know, and so like I'm

148
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Totally with it. It's kind of like a way to

149
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:10.890
Like it's

150
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:21.870
Nick Graham: Just like be like, I mean I think like the way that he described it was like a deer. Like sometimes like like I was walking you know barefoot at night like

151
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:32.520
Nick Graham: Like through the neighborhood, and I just like walk through people's yards and I like felt like a deer, you know. And for me that was like the most like primitive feeling like the most

152
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah word

153
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's got some real energy to it that primitive or doesn't it all of a sudden I got like there's a lot in that one. Okay.

154
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

155
00:23:49.560 --> 00:24:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, primal. It's not, that's not a low vibe. That's not down here and that sad little sort of thing that's like somewhere in between, isn't it, that's a. Okay, so we're getting somewhere. I think we

156
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we found it. Okay, you found it.

157
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Primal primitive right okay but coming deeply FROM YOUR NATURAL animal. Yes, happens to be human.

158
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Body shared it, you do share it with other animals other forces. Okay. All right. So some things I played with as you were talking, we're I'm

159
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Josh

160
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Behaves

161
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside

162
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Of man's arbitrary

163
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundaries. Yeah. Now their profit gaining boundaries. If I say this is mine. I can demand money and barter with that commodity money, etc.

164
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But he's not. He doesn't want to play. He wants to go off grid a bit. He wants to not he wants to opt out. It sounds like want to opt out of that I want to stay more in touch with some other truths some more primal truths.

165
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And you see some common grounds. Like, that's where you guys can really mesh in your mindset. Yeah.

166
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.840
Nick Graham: I think so, like, well, I think.

167
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.940
Nick Graham: I want to be able to like Chuck off those like

168
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.440
Nick Graham: Constructs, you know, like, because I think that's what a lot of like my

169
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.250
Nick Graham: stress and worry and anxiety. I think it comes from

170
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: giving meaning to things that don't have inherent meaning. Okay.

171
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so first I would invite you to explore. I don't know if you have the ability to take a note, I may have said it before, continue to have personal experience in and

172
00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Listening to her and reading about Pema children. She's

173
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Not sure if you have been

174
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.620
Nick Graham: With that, if at all, so I think of it, put it in writing.

175
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm gonna pull it out or Scott's a little loud. So I think on her name. So I'm gonna get the right

176
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Spelling for you.

177
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see.

178
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she got to allows she's like one's not enough good golly,

179
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Go girl.

180
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Let's see what we got here. Here's comma she's just a lovely, lovely human. Um, so this is just so you can get the spelling of her. This is her Pema and showed her and CH O, you know. Laughs on top D like David are a little notes and

181
00:26:50.670 --> 00:27:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Follow us something, say, one more time, like Pauly Nepalese or something like that. She's a Buddhist I believe MCC

182
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Dallas I'm forgetting, which I get that, too. I just once, I see an overlap in in any kind of thinking I

183
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not. I'm funny. Well, I can't explain it. I see what's in common. My mind goes to what's in common with a thing instead of pulling them apart. I just, it's just the way my brain has it was hard to

184
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: distinguish different theorists and in graduate school. I kept going to say, Yeah, but this is just a different word for the same phenomenon. I don't understand why this theorist is trying to read a book about the same damn thing.

185
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: My teacher was not happy with me. But, okay, so I had to knock that off to take that test. Anyway, so she's amazing.

186
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but she's a mom, right. So she had a teacher that teacher had a teacher this these are pieces of truth that have come by trying true experience by many people. And he know what is interesting. I HADN'T LISTENED TO HER this old tape.

187
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Tape, you know,

188
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: and stuck it in my internal speaker my house because it's the only tape recorder.

189
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Around anymore and turn it on. It was going through the house and there it was. Things I continue to say in my work and I had long since forgotten where I got it in there. It was that word mindfulness, which

190
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, because I've been saying it for so much I'm I feel a little nauseous to my stomach. Every time I say it because it's like

191
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: People don't like it's losing its meaning. Now you're just kind of dipping into it. So it's not that, and I'll be careful with it.

192
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm here was I know it's like you really, you're gonna say Michael this but she's but hers is like I've been listening to this now for a long time. And so her main piece for me.

193
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because I've had to meet a lot of different sort of those those some the things that I go over in therapy. I have met them myself. I don't talk about anything that I don't know personally

194
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I do. I typically announce it, I say, well, this is one. I don't really know much about, but it is statistically reliable and let's give it a shot. So with her. It was this

195
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not saying start off with this one with the one that really was the hardest to sit with was groundless

196
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you mean restlessness. I'm trying to get grounded everything about what a therapist does right everything I tell you is, what did I just say, feel your feet on the earth and feel grounded, you are

197
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Next level from that this stuff that gets you like

198
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: These ideas that we can attach to something

199
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And let it go.

200
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You can enjoy it and let it go. It's this

201
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I have to have it. That's the one that we get hung up on so you take a job she takes

202
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know him, but it can go too far too. It can be

203
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: inconvenient for him or others if it's so far outside

204
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Of how our society works, then if you're not going to fit in a tribe anymore.

205
00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And you see it. Yeah, and that's up to him, that's up to however he navigates that but anything we take too far.

206
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it adaptive for you. Is it maladaptive that's kind of the register, so I will get fancy will learn all these fancy things. And we'll come back to some basics and will say, is this working for me.

207
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So now we come back we went out. We talked about some philosophy and we come back and we say what you've been doing these years. Is it is it healing a deep wound is it moving you forward into the growth and development, you want for yourself.

208
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. You tell me.

209
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:08.220
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think definitely not like the the way I've been dealing with things currently for the past

210
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.080
I guess I started using substances.

211
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:19.230
Nick Graham: When I was like 12 or 13 so I think no, I don't think it's

212
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:26.220
Nick Graham: Helpful. I think every life problem I've ever had is rooted in substance use. I mean,

213
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:38.790
Nick Graham: Like, you know. And so no, it's not. And that's kind of like where that that search is coming in like there's something more like that. I don't think most people find it like I don't I don't think they do. I think

214
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.640
And I can't be like

215
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.680
Nick Graham: inundated by like buying things and

216
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: filling gaps that way. But that's the solution you drug was a solution material pretty shiny things as a solution. And so his religion.

217
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The bit that I'm bringing up is next level, you can go get one and you are you're searching. Now another solution, something that gives you what is healthy, instead of a drug. Maybe it's here, but it's still busy solving a problem.

218
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: A is there really a problem. Maybe we're talking about it. Once you and I are working on those things maybe eventually it'll just say

219
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not wounded.

220
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, I don't know.

221
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are searching and you're just starting to see there might be another solution. Another way to address my distress inside that's exciting.

222
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you'll get that far. And you'll stop and you'll be happy.

223
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Mission accomplished.

224
00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If that isn't enough. Right. And you still lean forward, we still look at the Joshua's and you still say

225
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to detach further I want to opt out further, you can already see that there are people that would go further off the grid and say no.

226
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Even more, but you may find your own balance between holding on. I like I want to have money. I want to buy a house. I'm not hung up by the side. I do want to, I kind of want to house. I want to film. I'm going to go with this until I don't

227
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

228
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But if it turns out that the big existential question. Is your right to choose.

229
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be pretty heavy. When you really get it because that's that's the big one. You have a choice.

230
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And we think, oh, we want all that freedom. Don't tell me what I can and can't do, but it's a burden to have that much choice.

231
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you do. It's there, whether you want to be conscious of it. The people that grab on to a religion.

232
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Grab onto will if I make enough money. If I have the right house, the number of children in the right things by then my dad will be just right, and it'll be a good person will go to heaven, and everything will be fine. And I'll be happy.

233
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That if they can hold on to it, really. And it works for them. They're happy.

234
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But for the person outside of all of that they have tried those things. It can be very confusing because it doesn't feel that great. Like that's still empty.

235
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what I just want you to know that there's room there's still room out there, philosophy, certain spiritual things religions, they give that space for that additional growth spurt. If you decide, hey, I've tried out these things right now you're starting to consider.

236
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What we were I would call this pre contemplation phase, you know, kind of letting go of this other solution substance and you're starting to look at maybe some spiritual connection as a solution.

237
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

238
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so if the goal is, how did you word it you say

239
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Number, which you said started to write it goal harness anger and then we had imagery of flame. So if the goal today is how to harness it

240
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to know it's in its TO DO IN FOR what purpose. What's it going to do for you if we harness it what it in the service of what

241
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:31.920
I think

242
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:37.350
To

243
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:48.360
Nick Graham: I guess I've always like thought that, let's say, people who believe in God or people who

244
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.570
Practice, whatever.

245
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:59.100
Nick Graham: It isn't these like things don't just like come naturally. Like, you don't just wake up one day and you're like a

246
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:06.690
Nick Graham: believer in God or so like it like takes practice. And so, like, I think, like, in order to

247
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:17.100
Nick Graham: It requires like a concerted effort. And so that's what I mean by like harness anger, like in like turn it into like being able to focus on like

248
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:33.780
Nick Graham: Hey, like I'm feeling weird today, like I'm feeling like I can't quite grasp. Like what's hurting me and i think i think i would like to, instead of just letting that burden like stay on me. I'd like to be able to stop and address that.

249
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.280
Okay.

250
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

251
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how

252
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Will your solution before for burden and distress was a drug something else don't know rage or whatever acting out maybe even a depression or I don't want to live right, those were on your list of opt outs. Right.

253
00:36:54.330 --> 00:37:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to never include the death one. But the truth of the matter is, it's my choice to that's the truth and the ugly truth, but it is. There it is. Okay, so I don't really want those high on the list.

254
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And. But what I didn't hear you say is, well, when I'm burdened, what am I going to do, I'm going to focus where

255
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to harness this energy and effort and focus to what, what are we going to do, what are you going to do, what are you going to focus on

256
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, don't, don't have a religious

257
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing right at this point.

258
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:45.690
Nick Graham: Well I, I do like I am. I know like I know God and I'm like known seemed felt God I'm still trying to like figure out what it is like, it's like

259
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.330
Nick Graham: Like the God that I know is like

260
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.260
Nick Graham: The Jesus of the Bible, like, and I don't

261
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.860
Nick Graham: Only that not like the judgmental people

262
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Were like the dude who would like give a shirt off his

263
00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.980
Nick Graham: Back to someone

264
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.170
Or the dude who is like

265
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, nice and friendly and healing. So like

266
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:10.290
Nick Graham: That's like that that like the God that I know is like New Testament. Jesus like

267
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:16.980
Nick Graham: You didn't who never said anything about homosexuals. You never said anything about like that. That's who I know

268
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.080
Nick Graham: And I felt it.

269
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.490
But

270
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.410
Nick Graham: It's like a weird cross that doesn't quite fit with like

271
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.560
Christianity like and

272
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.160
Ironically, in some weird ways because

273
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But there is one and I'm forgetting it right now.

274
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The heck is it call here is I mean I'm can't really tell if what you're saying is I wouldn't mind going literally on a regular basis to a structure where other people of like mind.

275
00:38:50.670 --> 00:39:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm taking in a sermon. Yeah. Yeah, me too. That feels good. Feels good. And now I have community of I have a group of people that share this and when I'm in a burdened moment. I know I can go there and I can end I on the can have this mindfulness slash prayer.

276
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in nature and I can do all of those things intentionally purposefully when I'm feeling burden.

277
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not words escaping lol I'll remember it as soon as we hang up today. And then we'll send you a link or something. But there are there are

278
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There are beliefs out there, they kind of get what you're talking about the kind of just sort of hold on to this and they have a deeper the language things about nature and more responsibility and accountability and that way it is out there.

279
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I'm forgetting the word right now.

280
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's, let's do this. Let's talk a little bit about how you can already sort of resonate with that.

281
00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you share in common with

282
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some neat words like beneficence unconditional love, because that's what he has. It's not conditional. It's not based on

283
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Gender skin actions or inactions it's just one thing. It's just, he's gonna he presents consistently with one presentation over and over, love, love, love every single time with every single one.

284
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have in common with him.

285
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.090
Nick Graham: Yeah, I've been

286
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:43.230
Trying to think that that was one of my conclusions I came to over the weekend like like love is the answer, but

287
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: In theory, you know, it's like, no, it's not a fear and yo. It is a hard practice and you wake up to consciousness. It's hard. Every time and you do it anyway. Yeah.

288
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:09.360
Nick Graham: Well, I like I was like, all right, I'm gonna be like loving to these people and like you know something like treating Pete, some people in my life that are like so and so.

289
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:16.800
Nick Graham: Go to Sydney and be like, hey, like I forgive you. And I was like, hey, you're stupid bitch and you

290
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:22.230
Nick Graham: said hi you or like sorry for the language like that's

291
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but

292
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.000
Nick Graham: That's basically what happened you

293
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.240
Know,

294
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.770
Nick Graham: What I'm, what I'm getting at is, it was like

295
00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.080
Nick Graham: What I decided is like

296
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.570
Nick Graham: That's why like

297
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.540
Nick Graham: Anger, I think, is

298
00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:56.160
Nick Graham: In some ways, like, okay, because it exists in like I have to like live in harmony with like that. I guess it's like when it turns destructive maybe when it becomes a bad thing. And so that's what I was kind of trying to

299
00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:00.000
touch on a little bit earlier like

300
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

301
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, here's my perspective on that.

302
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You

303
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Were threatened by her behavior.

304
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't sit with will just take one little quote. This is just a random one right just, I just pulled this green out. Listen to what she says.

305
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The most fundamental aggression to ourselves. The most fundamental harm, we can do to ourselves, is to remain ignorant by not having the courage and the respect to look at ourselves, honestly.

306
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And gently.

307
00:42:54.210 --> 00:43:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Random pulled it out. That's one quote that's one random thing internet just looking at the spelling of her name, but I want you to see how you disrespected you how you were angry, how you were threatened how you did not sit with the fact that someone

308
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrongs you wronged you. In the socially informative ways and you were offended and so she's, of course, so she's a bit trite.

309
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But you could have opted out

310
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And then loving and kind and not threatened right

311
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: By others that we have to do it in here at the same time. In fact, first rehearse that

312
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to go forgive someone else you're not going to be very good at it until you know how to do it for yourself.

313
00:43:50.550 --> 00:44:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't even think right even beyond the forgiveness part, I'm not a huge fan. I'll say that word, but really what I'm thinking is, there's nothing to forgive and I want to do this early work with you so that you see. Not a bad boy.

314
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You are forced to be in a situation that has deeply transformed your interpretation of the world and and I want you to have relief I want relief for you. You're not a bad boy.

315
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a good person.

316
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and I want that healing for you. And so I find the relapse inconvenient because I'm in a rush.

317
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get to the healing, but I gotta be patient. I've got to meet you where you're at. And so we'll spend time doing this, um, because this isn't my work. This is yours.

318
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, I want to meet with you again, I want to, you know, okay, well now when now when right because I've got my little plan. But so what I've got to meet you where you're at.

319
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you said this Jesus stuff that's all good in theory that lovey W. Yeah, yeah, yeah, easier said than done.

320
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: No true or thing has been said, why do you think Jesus so so special. It's frickin hard

321
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do it. I get pissed off all this time, like, oh, and then I come back and I repair it as quick as I can.

322
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: As quick as I can. That's the best I can do in this human form. Can't do i can't i can't do any better than how I'm doing

323
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Good Person took something personally good person. Use this old filter. Okay. All right, come back. What can I do, fix it, fix it, fix it, fix it.

324
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to feel good.

325
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't go to a drunk.

326
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If the problem is interpersonal well then I'm going to solve it into personally

327
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't solve a spiritual problem with a chemical solution. We can't do it. It won't work.

328
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've tried that and you may do it another 10 times. I don't know how many times you'll do it just because you really want to really be clear.

329
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:17.940
Nick Graham: I'm going to try to sign in over here.

330
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, let me let me. I'm gonna let you in over on the other.

331
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha there. You want me to take you out to the other room. Oh, you did already. Okay. So you like in this room. Can we hear, I haven't heard you yet waiting for audio.

332
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.210
Nick: Right, I should be able to hear you hear me.

333
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, says has

334
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:47.850
Nick: Cool. Got it.

335
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.210
Nick: So,

336
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.420
Nick: Yeah, I

337
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.180
Nick: Agree like

338
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.730
Nick: I think that it is like, it's like practice and I think

339
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.190
Nick: Like I've practiced it like I've gotten close to that conclusion before but

340
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.450
Nick: It's hard to like stay on to that. And I don't know what it's rooted in like I read like basic like

341
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.890
Nick: Buddhist like texting. When I was in boot camp one time and

342
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.960
Nick: It was talking about.

343
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:33.120
Nick: How a lot of, I guess, like ability to be like enlightened is like from detachment and like depravity and like, like I do not feel attached to this like

344
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:43.260
Nick: I don't like maybe like the reason that I can't practice. Love is because I have like my personal ego invested into this little thing and

345
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:50.610
Nick: That's the harmful. Part of it is when you let it affect you personally and so I guess like the real thing is how to

346
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.070
Nick: Get through that like to where I can be like, it's fine, like that.

347
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.770
Nick: Yeah, I don't know.

348
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep remember we get it complicated with all our words you just go to super, super simple, simple words, there's been a word that's been moving throughout today's session and has to do with attachment

349
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, maybe there's a different word for you. But now I use the word groundless and you saw my hands do this.

350
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: This and let go.

351
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Sydney

352
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Went out on me. Oh my God says about me. I'm not valuable enough to be boiled ouch up. I like go that isn't what to see someone else's behavior doesn't determine me and I've let go.

353
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: cutting herself.

354
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How could she do that if she knew what that was doing to me will kind of a friend of mine, I should be enough for her. I'm holding on. Oh, it hurts. This is awful lot of weight.

355
00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: On her behavior. This is her journey. It's not mine.

356
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can love her. I know this kind. You know what that is not let that giving up that last ditch effort for somebody saved me.

357
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm giving up maybe some of the. See how desperate. Somebody, somebody, somebody see my desperation, you could have gone to me right and you probably did at some point right empathy I relate to this sorrow to this hopelessness.

358
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

359
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's not the same as meeting her to be different so that you feel okay with yourself.

360
00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This I'm giving you a visual because this will going to do it naturally because we're conditioned we grew up in very similar cultures.

361
00:49:52.290 --> 00:50:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So, probably because you're in a car he wearing a cute jackets, you got your hair all styled up right we're in the same similar kind of culture North American right

362
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to get you.

363
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The best we can probably do unless you want to take it. Next level, you know, okay, maybe, great. You're gonna grab it all. You can just check just to

364
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let go of expectation. How am I feeling. How can I love myself, How can I love more in this moment.

365
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I see I am in perceived threat right now I must be look at me holding on to something. What am I holding on to an image of myself that is so far outdated.

366
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even recognize it anymore. I'm holding on for holding on.

367
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even like this person.

368
00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know her, get to know her. I'll open my heart and I'll get to know her because she's another

369
00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Good to know her. She's deserves to be no, because I have an agenda to be like that, that, that all these other levels. This is another human in the human struggle.

370
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: When she's in my circle.

371
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you can come at it from all kinds of different ways.

372
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't completely detach but I realized this stuff gets stolen and in my things get stolen.

373
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I've had things last don't have to look at it. Look at it really right.

374
00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: These are hard things to do.

375
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: In the moment neck.

376
00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Love has an action plan. It isn't nebulous. It isn't very

377
00:51:52.380 --> 00:52:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: How will you show it to yourself and next time you make contact with another human. What will you do

378
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:07.350
Nick: What, what if you had to describe that action plan.

379
00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.930
Nick: Yeah, like like put it like I guess in in something that's like can be practiced and likely

380
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.010
What do you

381
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Two things.

382
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to the breath. I know, roll your eyes get it over with.

383
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.740
Nick: So you break it.

384
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You read it.

385
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I look around.

386
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not in danger. I'm in perceived threat.

387
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What is being threatened.

388
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The image of myself, I bet. Oh, I don't like being treated

389
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: About me. Oh, I don't even like with my own behaviors and remembering what I did, I don't know, like myself,

390
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: No one even has to be around.

391
00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing because then you remember this, am I in danger, or am I in perceived threat what's being threatened, just stay there. Stay there. Stay there.

392
00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you practice unconditional love, that's Jesus then you body it, guess what, then you're doing it now. There's no threat. Now your hearts open the people around me, like, hey, did

393
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can give love get love flows.

394
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Free

395
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there really is dangerous brains going to perceive something what it does.

396
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to us or really any danger.

397
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I

398
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't really allow don't act out stay there. Few more beats, even if it's a little ornery a little longer. What am I trying to run away from. Why is it so uncomfortable to be me what's wrong with me something wrong with me.

399
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lovable done some shitty things I'll probably do some shitty things and all

400
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I want to feel good going to be in love, and I want to love others.

401
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Brief remember look around and really check what you're proceeding dangerous.

402
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.670
Nick: Yeah, that's, that's the hard part like like

403
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:34.590
Nick: And I guess like I've like that's what I did like the other day, and like, that was really helpful like

404
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.000
Nick: Just

405
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.860
Nick: Sometimes there's easily things that feel

406
00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:46.620
Nick: Dangerous that you can't even like articulate and that's like that's like the hardest thing like this like

407
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:55.110
Nick: Something that like sits like it feels like it sits like right here in my brain and like something just like

408
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:56.700
I know

409
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but that's the one I want to desensitize re relate. I want a reprocessing of it because my guess is notice in your language. It was no fun to watch. I remember something else that was no fun to watch. Yeah.

410
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever everybody phrases things the way you just raised them.

411
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you went and use drugs.

412
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm listening as best I can and I want to get it this

413
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is still part of you.

414
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to change that relationship. So with that sense of our thinking brain of our spiritual because we kind of when we think we think that's where our life is our spiritual side or my thinking brain.

415
00:55:47.280 --> 00:56:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So that without history and how would that relationship be how do I get to be more comfortable in my body love myself be free. And then I can give that to others. And so for me, I've got a little plan. I got a little plan. I'm just like, you know, let's do it. Let's do it.

416
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know, it's got to be when you're ready.

417
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.400
Nick: Yes, that's like

418
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:18.930
Nick: The like I'm kind of changed by like chain to this like it like things that have come up

419
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:27.690
Nick: I guess it's kind of the idea behind it like that. I'm gathering from you. And so desensitized yourself to it like

420
00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:29.820
Nick: Basically helps you like

421
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:39.330
Nick: Navigate it like and instead of it being like this little block that I can't access it, or like be something that that you can like like navigate

422
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say that this, this is the thing. This is the neural network here this will call it trauma and it sits in isolation, with very let's say few on neuro transmitters connect to do it. Let's just a few of them there in isolation.

423
00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But there are a few connections and so they will come up whenever they feel like it whenever they are connected to

424
00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A reminder of it and they come up intrusively and they come up in your limbic system. They don't come up through words through logic.

425
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably didn't have access to that. In other words, the brain was cut off the our amygdala floods us with these

426
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever we don't have all the connections going on when the memory imprint happens. So it's in isolation, just sort of floating there and it comes up randomly feels random and intensely

427
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The work that I've started with you, has to do with putting more connections positive ones where your words you have positive experiences you

428
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Have the

429
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Strength and we get to put it in the past, we know that it's in the past it's it's real. It happened.

430
00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm in charge and my relationship to it. I am not afraid of it. I can visit it when I want to. It's not going to come up whenever it feels like it out of the blue, and I'm not going to get wiped out by it. So basically you're changing your

431
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationship with this.

432
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Descending desensitize changing the relations.

433
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So it does two things, and all the

434
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Again don't have you already kind of told me some of the pieces that we, you don't have to retell it. That's what's neat about this CMDR work, you won't have to retell it if you don't want to. If you want to witness to if you want to hear.

435
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Still true these words, I'm saying like this. I'm happy to just listen.

436
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But this thing you did with your hand that it's still sitting there makes me think it's detached way. So let's, let's turn toward it.

437
00:58:50.640 --> 00:59:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's face it directly the burden of the moment, let's let's change the relationship with it's not dis tonic. It's not something separate from the self, it's, it's part of your history.

438
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:09.270
Nick: And so, so you think like revisiting like the same stuff or like, like is there. I guess like

439
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:17.730
Nick: Is there an agenda like like behind that. So like obviously like it makes weird shit come up. So is that something that that you like.

440
00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:25.710
Nick: As a, you know, as a, I guess like someone like trained in that is that like what you're kind of doing like starting out with mild things and then like

441
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:36.570
Nick: Like why do I go from talking about something small to like some like childhood trauma. Like, is that an edge. Are you steering that like are you like

442
00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason I'm staring at the reason I've said it, and maybe it was fun. And in general, the theory behind it is if you this is complicated by whether my client, whether I kind of assess and we assess your ability to not completely D compensate

443
00:59:56.850 --> 01:00:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Or dissociate, or you know i i it's a constant read. I'M READING READING READING.

444
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But you haven't been able to do. You've been able to sit with a narrow piece of the network. It's not going anywhere. I don't want to go everywhere. I just want

445
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to just work with this one piece right here and see how you right here. And yes, there's a part of me that wants to, and it is clinically indicated training is to find the earliest experience of it or the most intense they happen to be the same thing, right.

446
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That one we desensitize that one and reprocess that one, the neural connections, they're connected to

447
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Other lesser events, you're probably going to be like

448
01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not such a big deal anymore.

449
01:00:52.590 --> 01:01:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, it's efficient now for some people, because there's a dysregulation piece we can do a piece we can just work our way back. If you want to

450
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Write but I'm one of these people. That's like, well, that's he's got the strength. I've seen it. He's got the ego strength to do it. Maybe I misread, I don't know, and, and I think you can. Um, and then it's efficient.

451
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:20.100
Nick: Last

452
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:34.050
Nick: Week. Yeah, perfectly into it I i want i want an hour and a half, which that appointment that that was the ideal one like last week, you know, obviously, that things change. But, um, yeah.

453
01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.070
Nick: Yeah, I can't do it an hour. I can't, I can't, like,

454
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Okay, listen, new day New Day new plan, let's plan. Okay. Um, I am if you want to. I'll just offer some things

455
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I am. See, I haven't seen pretty consistently people on Saturday. Have someone at nine in the morning, so you can

456
01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Either before that, or after that I want to keep it all sort of I'm working in a kind of congeal timeframe, you're welcome to pick a time either eight or 10 then moving forward. You want it during the week, hour and a half hard because nothing. I always see people on the hour.

457
01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And

458
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The way to create hour and a half of you early like you know 530 in the morning or if for some reason. The reason I don't choose the afternoon. A you typically work and be I'm not, that's not my best IQ time either. I tend to want

459
01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I want morning I'm at best IQ emotional intelligence. I'm at my best for my clients in the first part of the day. So I'm not as good a clinician, I don't think

460
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:56.010
Nick: Yes, I agree. I think morning would would would be ideal as well. So then

461
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:03.270
Nick: Yeah, so then you think that the time that you'd be able to do a

462
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.080
Nick: An hour and a half 530

463
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could go April 11 at 10 to 11

464
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:14.940
Let's see.

465
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Or call it early.

466
01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:21.000
And yes,

467
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.250
D right

468
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:25.290
Yeah.

469
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.590
Nick: So you said the time jack. Can you rename those times one more time because

470
01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, April 11 at 7am because that will give us an hour and a half my next clients at nine. Yeah. And then, or after that client which be would be 10 to 1130

471
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:48.630
Nick: I heard it, I would like to 730

472
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:49.320
Oh,

473
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay right down or nope April 11 7:30am Mountain Standard

474
01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there any chance you can create an environment where I mean the cars, fine. We can make it work. Adaptive

475
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:05.970
Nick: Yeah, it can be

476
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we could have you in a space.

477
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, or something that would be ideal, but I'll make work whatever you've got. Okay.

478
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.120
Nick: Yeah, I can do that.

479
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. My next clients here tapping her fingers in the waiting room.

480
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.680
Nick: Freezer. Okay. Well, thank you. And should I talk to a virtual clinic about refill I'm

481
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, let me go to. I'll just send a message, your doctors, Dr. Raphael right

482
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.850
Nick: Yes, me over there.

483
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She's probably going to ask when you're going to go to a group. Do you want me to do you have a tentative plan.

484
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:51.420
Nick: Maybe next week or so. Well, or well with two appointments in a week, maybe if possible. The week after

485
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.020
Nick: If it's possible.

486
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.600
Nick: Okay, you want to be mindful of Prescription refills because I bet copay version. Sure.

487
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to write down what you just said to me like

488
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing. I don't do two things very well at once. So I heard you say we're going to meet. So we'll meet on April 11 that means we've got lots of sort of services going on this week. So you don't want to meet April 13 through 17

489
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're thinking of moving like two weeks forward as in sometime April 20 the 24th.

490
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, I'm adding also not know if you're interested. I really need people in this group, they need to build it.

491
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: 12 o'clock on a Tuesday.

492
01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:49.740
Nick: My work days. That's right. Good smack dab in the middle. Now,

493
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to go to what you want to go to

494
01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:56.970
Nick: 20 something 21

495
01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Time you want

496
01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Your next group will be April 21 at 7am I'll just plug Nick expected

497
01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:10.470
Nick: Okay, cool. Thank you. Thank you.

498
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see you this weekend.

499
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.220
Nick: Okay, awesome. All right. Thank you.
