13
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.160
Chris Alliman MD: Can you tell me kind of your story on Suboxone what's going on, why you want to get on it.

14
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.420
What's the background.

15
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.880
Joel Talbot: Uh, yeah. Hold on just one second. I'm changing my little girls diaper real quick.

16
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.950
Chris Alliman MD: Oh yeah, no, take care of that for sure.

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.580
Yeah.

18
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.430
Joel Talbot: There you go. I'm just about done.

19
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.290
Joel Talbot: Okay, well, I used to be a heroin addict for quite a long time and

20
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.160
Joel Talbot: I quit with using Suboxone and stuff and

21
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.030
Joel Talbot: But I was never like on a program or anything. You know, so I would just buy it off this off my friends and stuff.

22
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:49.530
Joel Talbot: And then I ended up getting on probation and I still using Suboxone and and it does curb with the cravings and everything. You know, I take it, whenever I have cravings and all that all that it just kinda

23
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.090
Joel Talbot: Kind of stops stops me from wanting to grow us

24
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.920
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

25
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.290
Joel Talbot: And and also my probation officer wants me to get on it too, so I don't get in trouble.

26
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.590
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. You know, we hear that quite a bit, you know, people get medication as they can because they're motivated to get it to get off stuff.

27
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.610
Joel Talbot: Yeah.

28
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.230
Chris Alliman MD: But it's hard to find a program that's open to get into, you know, everybody's swamped.

29
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.340
Joel Talbot: Yeah.

30
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.590

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.710

Okay.

135
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:47.370

Joel Talbot: Stuff. Yeah. And, but

141
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:10.350
Joel Talbot: It's it but that does kind of curb the craving for everything. You know what I mean, if you get a craving for one thing you can kind of yeah kick it with with something else. So

Joel Talbot: Um, yeah, I'm doing counseling once a week. I have groups and individuals once a week. Okay.

199
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.360
Chris Alliman MD: What do you know about our program so far.

200
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.880
Joel Talbot: Not much. I will get my my probation officer told me to.

201
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:59.160
Joel Talbot: To get on Suboxone programming. And I told him I'd find one. And I just found one and then kind of went with it. So, okay.

202
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.210
Chris Alliman MD: How did you find this

203
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.310
Joel Talbot: On the internet. Okay.

204
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:09.240
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm sure as you found out, it's really hard to get into Suboxone programs in New Mexico because there aren't

205
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.070
Chris Alliman MD: Many of them. I would encourage you to let your probation officer know about our program.

206
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:14.730
Joel Talbot: Okay.

207
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.860
Chris Alliman MD: So they can help direct people here.

208
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.850
Chris Alliman MD: Just how, how long did it take you to get into our program.

209
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.770
Joel Talbot: Um, since Friday.

210
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.020
Chris Alliman MD: Friday. Okay, three days.

211
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.960
Joel Talbot: Not bad. Good.

212
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:34.950
Chris Alliman MD: Alright so what our program consists of his weekly group appointments, where we refill medication.

213
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.340
Chris Alliman MD: Okay so weekly individual therapy sessions.

214
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.150
Joel Talbot: Okay.

215
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:50.760
Chris Alliman MD: The way it happens for the first month is that there's two prescriptions, a week for the Suboxone it goes from group to therapy and then from therapy back to group and group therapy.

216
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.570
Joel Talbot: Okay.

217
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.450
Chris Alliman MD: It's a little bit time consuming and a little bit

218
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.410
Chris Alliman MD: Irritating.

219
00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:01.440
Chris Alliman MD: But the reason for that is that we've noticed that people don't go to therapy if we don't do it that way.

220
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.540
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Once a person shows commitment and investment and they understand the

221
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.740
Joel Talbot: Benefits of therapy.

222
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.860
Chris Alliman MD: Then we space that out and that's usually around like a month.

223
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.670
Joel Talbot: Okay.

224
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.170
Chris Alliman MD: So that's kind of how it works. Now, I hear what you're saying you're doing group and you're doing therapy.

225
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.630
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, I'll be able to talk through that with the

226
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.920
Chris Alliman MD: Therapist that you meet with

227
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:20.760
Joel Talbot: Yeah.

228
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.000
Chris Alliman MD: And just see what we how we work things out for you.

229
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.340
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, sounds like an okay blend

230
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.200
Joel Talbot: It does. Yeah, excellent.

231
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.730
Chris Alliman MD: Something that I need to let you know.

232
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.980
Chris Alliman MD: Is that the

233
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.140
Chris Alliman MD: Because of your daughter. Yeah.

234
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.620
Chris Alliman MD: The Suboxone film and the residue.

235
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.160
Chris Alliman MD: That gets that's in the little papers, the resident gets on

236
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.290
Chris Alliman MD: Your hand the residue and round your mouth is enough to kill a little kid.

237
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.430
Joel Talbot: Oh, man.

238
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.050
Joel Talbot: Okay, okay.

239
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.360
Chris Alliman MD: So what I'm telling you is when you have the Suboxone put them where she can't get into them.

240
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.850
Chris Alliman MD: She's getting stuff when you're using it. Wash your hands soap and water rinse out your mouth.

241
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.660
Joel Talbot: Okay.

242
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.440
Chris Alliman MD: And then the rapper gets thrown out outside in the trash.

243
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.120
Chris Alliman MD: Oh no, where she can get into it.

244
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.320
Joel Talbot: Of course,

245
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.570
Chris Alliman MD: The other part is that I'm going to send in a prescription for Narcan the nasal spray

246
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.560
Joel Talbot: Okay.

247
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:24.540
Chris Alliman MD: Have that in the house where you and your partner know where it is. God forbid something happens you'll have it available to us. Okay.

248
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.830
Joel Talbot: Okay, good.

249
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.600
Chris Alliman MD: I just want to keep everybody safe.

250
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:28.740
Joel Talbot: Yeah, of course.

251
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:35.460
Chris Alliman MD: All right. Any psychiatric illnesses for you, depression, anxiety, bipolar anything

252
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.500
Joel Talbot: No, nothing good.

253
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.090
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Alright, so I got a bunch of yes or no questions to kind of work through with you here.

254
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:51.540
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so we're thinking back to when you were using heroin. Basically, or the oxycodone

255
00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.620
Chris Alliman MD: That's already thinking

256
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:59.280
Chris Alliman MD: If you don't understand these I can repeat them or I can rephrase them that's totally fine, but they're just kind of

257
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.900
Joel Talbot: Yes or no. Okay.

258
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.250

Okay.

368
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.970

369
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:07.530
Joel Talbot: Good.

370
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.170
