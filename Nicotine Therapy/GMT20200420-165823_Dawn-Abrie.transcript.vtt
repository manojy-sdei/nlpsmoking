Dawn Abriel: When did you start drinking

50
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.900
Melissa Harrison: I mean I guess I had my first drink when I was gonna say like 13

51
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.260
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And when did it start becoming a problem.

52
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.060
Melissa Harrison: Um, well.

53
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.780
Melissa Harrison: I've been told. Most recently, not really, like, I didn't really like drinking that much.

54
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.210
Melissa Harrison: I started

55
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.190
Melissa Harrison: Finding like wines that I really liked and so then that's when I started drinking a little bit more because I actually liked the taste of it.

56
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:34.980
Melissa Harrison: And it was mainly just like I wouldn't drink very often, and I didn't have alcohol sit in my fridge for days and I wouldn't even like think about it like I wouldn't have an urge to drink.

57
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:43.950
Melissa Harrison: It mainly just be like, when there was like someone's birthday or something, then it was like, oh yeah, we're like gonna have fun. And then I would just be like, go over the top, every time.

58
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.140
Dawn Abriel: Right.

59
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.190
Dawn Abriel: Did you ever have a blackout.

60
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.530
Melissa Harrison: I've only had one blackout ever. And it was actually the night of my rack.

61
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.140
Uh huh. Yes.

62
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:17.790
Dawn Abriel: So many people have ended up saying to me that getting arrested was the best thing that happened to them it put the brakes on that path right I

63
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:27.330
Melissa Harrison: agree with that. I mean, I was, um, it was my friend have just come back into town. She'd been gone for years. So we're all like medicine. We're having fun.

64
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.880
Melissa Harrison: And I was drinking a lot of wine, which I shouldn't have been and

65
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:41.040
Melissa Harrison: I guess I got mad about something. I don't know. I blacked out before anything happened. And so I went to go home and I was like a block away from my house.

66
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:48.000
Melissa Harrison: And I like took a turn to sharply and like kind of like the wheels wouldn't straighten out, I guess.

67
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:58.410
Melissa Harrison: Because I kind of saw where it happened, and like I went up into someone's yard and just like hit the track a little bit. It didn't cause back really any damage my car was way messed up. But like

68
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:12.420
Melissa Harrison: I was going super slow, too. So it was weird. I don't know, but I don't remember any of it and I came back to it like being able to remember things and it was like four in the morning and I was in a jail cell.

69
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.400
Melissa Harrison: Was trying to figure out what was going on. So, I mean, that was a huge wake up call to me because that was frightening. Yeah.

70
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:28.950
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, I did not have a person that wants to go to jail. So that was like, No, I was crying and my mug shot. I was freaking out.

71
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.910
Melissa Harrison: So no, yeah, it's really to know if you wake up call.

72
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.260
Dawn Abriel: And so by recently, do you mean that it just started gradually increasing this last year, last two years.

73
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:58.770
Melissa Harrison: Probably just yeah like the last year, I think I started drinking more like last year around May. So pretty much, I mean, I guess the wreck happened in January, so it wouldn't have been the same, but yeah.

74
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.510
Dawn Abriel: Right.

75
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.220

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.430
No.

78
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:23.100
Dawn Abriel: This is great. We can you can get some understanding about this before it starts

79
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.970

204
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:24.480
Melissa Harrison: For the good like month after I got out of jail, pretty much like my nose is calmed a little bit. But anyhow, I was like in a car.

205
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:35.970

Melissa Harrison: Okay.

304
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.890
Dawn Abriel: Now prop the camera. The phone backup.

305
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.960
Dawn Abriel: Want you to

306
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:59.820
Dawn Abriel: Look into your fingers. Good. No pain or discomfort when you do that. Good. Then tap your thumb against your finger their thumb. Good. Alright, so that's what I call a physical exam.

307
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:01.560
Melissa Harrison: All right.

308
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.610
And

309
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.640
Dawn Abriel: Did you already go get 'em.

310
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.090
Dawn Abriel: You haven't gotten any blood drawn yet.

311
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:26.820
Melissa Harrison: No, and they told me to talk to you about that because we only have one hospital here unless almost and I don't feel comfortable going to the hospital and getting lab work done right now. During coronavirus

312
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:39.090
Dawn Abriel: Well, I'm their lab has a protocol. So I want you to call and ask them how they keep people safe that that you have been

313
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.970
Dawn Abriel: I assume you've been keeping yourself safe you wear a mask you wear

314
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:45.480
Dawn Abriel: Goggles

315
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.180
Melissa Harrison: Your gloves. Oh, yeah.

316
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:56.850
Dawn Abriel: Right. Okay. So I really do need to see that you that your liver is okay, is

317
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.910
Dawn Abriel: It just too important. I can't. I can't. It's like trying to practice medicine with one hand tied behind my back. I need to see the labs. Okay.

318
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.960
Dawn Abriel: Just one time.

319
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.100
Dawn Abriel: And then

320
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:20.730
Dawn Abriel: Let's see if I can turn this off for a minute recording on so we haven't recorded. Should you relapse on the record, you know, while you're with us and

321
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.960
Dawn Abriel: I will put you on a monthly shot of vivid trawl it takes the craving away for alcohol.

322
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:43.020
Dawn Abriel: So if, if you get another DUI or you get, you know, you get in trouble. Without the hall, then that would be what we would do I would arrange for a doctor to give you a shot in your butt once a month to take away

323
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.430
Melissa Harrison: I don't feel comfortable with that.

324
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.420
Dawn Abriel: Well, the court will require

325
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.830
Shots.

326
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:51.660
Dawn Abriel: Well,

327
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.210
Dawn Abriel: Do you want to go to jail.

328
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.410
Dawn Abriel: No. Okay, so don't drink. Don't do it well.

329
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.120
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, obviously I have

330
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:06.780
Dawn Abriel: Okay, okay. But that's what will happen. I'm just telling you that the judge will order it so

331
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:22.260
Dawn Abriel: I just like to make people aware that you know we don't we don't have a lot that we can. I mean, we write a report every week that goes to the courts that says yes she participated. She's doing great. She's taken on the therapy right

332
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:30.960
Dawn Abriel: And so they they get feedback about because they're paying for this, the courts pain for you to be in the program.

333
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.930
Dawn Abriel: You don't have to

334
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.960
Melissa Harrison: Well, I got a call center today. They asked me for my credit card.

335
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.600
Dawn Abriel: That's just a formality.

336
00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.350
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

337
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.940
Dawn Abriel: That's a formality to court.

338
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.420
Melissa Harrison: Part, they said, We're going to charge like 200 bucks.

339
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.820
Dawn Abriel: And Mike

340
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.980
Dawn Abriel: Thank you for telling me. I'll miss I because

341
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.280
Dawn Abriel: I 90% positive that

342
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.040
Melissa Harrison: Last, last, last Friday. They asked me for it.

343
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.700
Melissa Harrison: Too, but I wasn't sure I didn't question, though, I guess.

344
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:06.990
Yeah.

345
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.210
Dawn Abriel: That's the contract. The Court has with bright heart health.

346
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.500
Okay.

347
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.780
Dawn Abriel: Just, just be sure and tell them they should we

348
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:28.020
Dawn Abriel: Have we've grown so much. Many of the clinics around the country have closed so we have had to absorb many more people. So we had to

349
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:38.460
Dawn Abriel: hire more people and they're not always up to speed. For instance, you are only the third person. We've done through the court so

350
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.460
Dawn Abriel: Exception that people don't

351
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.180
Melissa Harrison: Do

352
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.290
Dawn Abriel: You're not, that's not a regular thing. So they need to be told. And I will

353
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.550
Dawn Abriel: Okay, number

354
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.950
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and

355
00:31:51.300 --> 00:32:01.770
Dawn Abriel: After we're done. You need to go back to the virtual clinic and do two things I want you to ask them how to do the BAM. The brief addiction monitor

356
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:14.670
Dawn Abriel: And I wanted to one more survey the ACE adverse childhood experiences that gives us an idea of the kinds of trauma, you might have had in your early years.

357
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:24.540
Dawn Abriel: Only it's only one time and then you'll be done. I'm going to be sending you an email. How often do you check the email that you get

358
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:37.590
Dawn Abriel: Them. Okay, great, because that's a great way to communicate with you know virtual clinic will solve your problems. If you have a particular medicine problem which you shouldn't because I'm not

359
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.230
Melissa Harrison: Prescribing any medicines for you, but

360
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:53.220
Dawn Abriel: You could get back to me. But what it will have on it is the therapist name and phone number and this phone takes text messages, but you're going to meet with us tomorrow at noon.

361
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.240
Melissa Harrison: Tuesday and yeah hopefully I have to talk to my boss when I go to work in the morning.

362
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.620
Melissa Harrison: To make sure I can

363
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.550
Melissa Harrison: Because I don't like it's just really short notice, the day before.

364
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:12.120
Melissa Harrison: Like if I'm saying for like next week, you know, he would be like, oh yeah, for sure, but I need to ask him when I get there, right.

365
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.730
Melissa Harrison: And see if that's even possible for tomorrow, have a

366
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:15.960
Melissa Harrison: Very short notice.

367
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:20.490
Dawn Abriel: If you can't be sure and go to the virtual clinic and let us know.

368
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.480
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

369
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:30.480
Dawn Abriel: Because if we don't get notification, then you end up getting a letter written to your probation officer and you don't want that to happen before keep us

370
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:32.730
Dawn Abriel: Right.

371
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.390
Dawn Abriel: So when's your group.

372
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.830
Melissa Harrison: tomorrow at noon. Hopefully,

373
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.120
Dawn Abriel: What are you going to do after you get off with me.

374
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.800
Melissa Harrison: I'm going to call back and do. Bam. Right.

375
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:50.850
Dawn Abriel: And and

376
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:58.140
Dawn Abriel: Say, yeah. So it's, I know it looks like a phone number, but it says zoom room number right

377
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:58.980
Melissa Harrison: Okay, yeah.

378
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.940
Dawn Abriel: Wait, the zoom. Okay, just because some people try they try dialing

379
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.910
Dawn Abriel: In they're frustrated and I

380
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.070
Dawn Abriel: Don't want that to happen to you.

381
00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.320
Dawn Abriel: Do you have any questions for me.

382
00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:11.550
No.

383
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:13.140
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

384
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.680
Dawn Abriel: So the I'm putting two things. Three things down here.

385
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.830
Dawn Abriel: Alcohol abuse.

386
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.900
Dawn Abriel: Nicotine

387
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.830
Dawn Abriel: Dependence and

388
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:37.560
Dawn Abriel: Marijuana dependence. So those are the three diagnoses. I'm putting just I like patients to know what what's being said about them.

389
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:39.240
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

390
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.930
Dawn Abriel: All right, well, I

391
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:53.100
Dawn Abriel: Was a pleasure meeting you. And this group. I'm the doctor and the therapist is actually my daughter so

392
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.710
Dawn Abriel: I'm a little biased.

393
00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:04.440
Dawn Abriel: You can tell me if I'm wrong. She was horrible. I hate her. So just so you know, have you been therapy before

394
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.300
Dawn Abriel: No. Okay.

395
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:16.410
Dawn Abriel: This is an intimate relationship and you've gotten haircuts before even though it's really long, I assume, right.

396
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.340
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, if

397
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.620
Dawn Abriel: someone gives you a bad haircut. Do you go give up on hairdressers

398
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:30.120
Dawn Abriel: Though well you call around to your friends and you say, I got a shitty haircut. What can I do, I need a better

399
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:48.150
Dawn Abriel: hairdresser, you get a referral. The same thing is true with a therapist if you don't really click after three or four visits, you have to say to her, if this isn't something's not working between us, because we have other

400
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:57.210
Dawn Abriel: therapists and we, you know, not everyone likes me. I have a particular personality and I rub people the wrong way.

401
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:15.810
Dawn Abriel: And some people asked to go have a different doctor, we don't take it personally. This is a professional situation, we don't take it personally. If a patient needs. Now if you change therapists four times we get a little suspicious there, you just don't want to be in therapy.

402
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.960
Dawn Abriel: To get but you get my idea.

403
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.070
Melissa Harrison: Real yeah

404
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:25.290
Dawn Abriel: won't stay with the therapist, just because that's you were assigned to her.

405
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:37.200
Dawn Abriel: Okay, make sure it's working. You have to be able to trust her in order to dig deep and bring up those issues that need to be polished off and understood

406
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.340
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

407
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.740
Dawn Abriel: All right, so

408
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.870
Dawn Abriel: If that is all I will let you go. And hopefully we'll see you tomorrow. Is there any way you can call your boss today.

409
00:36:53.130 --> 00:37:01.770
Melissa Harrison: I can see it just depends on his days off. He doesn't answer and the only gets one day off a week, I'm pretty sure it was today, but I have to check. Once I get off and look at the schedule.

410
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.410
Dawn Abriel: Okay, okay, okay. Real good. Well,

411
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.930
Dawn Abriel: Okay, tomorrow, have a good Monday.

412
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.910
Melissa Harrison: Thank you. Yeah.

413
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:17.400
Dawn Abriel: I'm not sure there were even any bubbles here to fill in. She was a pretty straightforward.

414
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.290
Dawn Abriel: Intake

415
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.230
Dawn Abriel: And now I have to open the zoom room for group.
