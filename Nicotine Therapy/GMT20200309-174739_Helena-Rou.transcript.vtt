22
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.870

26
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:12.960
Helena Rouhe: It can sometimes contribute to service issues if your mic is working hard on your phone, working hard. So hopefully we won't have any further issues.

Jennifer G: Yes, everything wrong right when I got divorced my car's engine blew up so I and without a car to on top of that, you know, ever since I left him and everything. So it's been awful. So this is really going to help me get back to Philly normal

67
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:39.300
Helena Rouhe: So we're going to go back into time a little bit and talk a little bit about what you brought you to bright heart, since we didn't have the opportunity to go over that when you first join

68
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:47.940
Helena Rouhe: Just because I need to dot the i's and cross the t's over here. And now I have puppies. It's all turned around. Sorry, fix that really quickly.

69
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.570
Helena Rouhe: So what originally brought you to us.

70
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.210
Galaxy S7: I

71
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:07.950
Galaxy S7: Wasn't rehab up three years ago in February, so it's been about three years and I'm at that time it was for hills is taking pain pills.

72
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:08.730
Galaxy S7: Okay.

73
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:20.970
Galaxy S7: And abusing stuff and then I never went back to those I I honestly, they're not on the streets anymore. You can't buy them, but I just that getting sick off that all the time. It was awful and

74
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.300
Galaxy S7: I've stayed off of those. But I started

75
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:39.810
Galaxy S7: When I had moved into one of the when I got divorced I rented a room and they were all doing heroin and I started doing that. And then I got hooked right away.

76
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.780
Galaxy S7: That I needed it. I'd be sick, so I was

77
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:46.920
Hurt.

78
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:56.160
Galaxy S7: I said three months and I just got into this program, but to keep me off of it and that you know

79
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:06.870
Galaxy S7: Because I never I got myself of it by myself. So I felt like I needed more help. And I, when I finally she wasn't speaking to me for a while.

80
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:17.580
Galaxy S7: Because of my addiction. So when I moved into my mom is where I live now, and she said she wants me to be going to meetings or something like that. So that's when I looked for this program.

81
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:31.050
Galaxy S7: Okay. And actually it was a nurse. When I did go to the hospital because I was so sick. And I heard that they give out. They have a program where they do Suboxone so I went there and she referred me here.

82
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.100
Okay.

83
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.390
Helena Rouhe: Sorry, of course, everybody's in quiet and settled until now.

84
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:54.990
Helena Rouhe: So, okay. So then, and we've been kind of talking and I think it took you a little while to get settled in. There was a lot of kind of family stuff going on and just helping you kind of continue to find your priorities and self care and what

85
00:23:55.590 --> 00:24:14.220
Helena Rouhe: To do to adjust and we've been talking to about going to more support meetings and you talked about that last week in group how that continued to go are you doing with attending 12 steps that are going to church or, all that good stuff.

86
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.540
Thank you.

87
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.860
Helena Rouhe: Hello. Hello.

88
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:25.800
Jennifer G: Hey there.

89
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:26.910
Yep.

90
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.600
Helena Rouhe: We're gonna get through this eventually

91
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:41.400
Jennifer G: It keeps getting out like it. Well, not cutting out. It keeps freezing and then then it dies. It's weird. That's never happened before with you guys ever

92
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:52.080
Helena Rouhe: If you have week service. And that's, that's what's going to happen. So we might have to have you stop your video, just so I can say connected to audit totally

93
00:26:52.920 --> 00:27:02.130
Jennifer G: So, okay, okay. Just yeah I don't want it to keep cutting out like that because, yeah, let me turn my my phone all the way off. And then I have to turn it on again. So it's like, oh my god.

94
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:14.100
Helena Rouhe: Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and stop your or yeah if you want to go ahead and stop your video or I can do it for you. And then we'll see if the audio will stay connected

95
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.460
Helena Rouhe: Okay. All right, we'll see how this goes.

96
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:26.310
Helena Rouhe: Okay. Okay, so, um, how are you doing with your support group. Are you still able to attend. What's going on with that right now.

97
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:35.880
Jennifer G: Yeah, it's them every day and I just didn't know yet my schedule is going to be with work. So I'm not sure. Yeah, I just going to make sure to

98
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:45.150
Jennifer G: Because I know they have them every day but not know if they have different times. Like if I'm getting. I don't even know if I'm going to be working in the evenings. They said sometimes

99
00:27:45.150 --> 00:28:03.090
Jennifer G: I will be in the evenings, though, I just got to make sure to. I know there's another group, though, because that was like a religious planet called safe, non so I know there's other places. If that doesn't work out with the work schedule and I still

100
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:12.600
Jennifer G: I was thinking about that if I have to find another place. Maybe if the meetings are in conflict with work. So, um,

101
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:20.580
Jennifer G: But yeah, they're they're real little groups and very little people go, but it's still, you know, it's the same

102
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.780
Jennifer G: You know, you get the encouragement.

103
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.810
Jennifer G: Yeah, you know that I needed.

104
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.680
Jennifer G: Yeah. So yeah, I really do. I like them. I good

105
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:44.610
Helena Rouhe: And maybe you can go ahead, while you're waiting for the work schedule to come together, maybe you can go ahead and start researching what your options are so that way you don't have to try and figure that out later. You just have everything

106
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.560
Helena Rouhe: Printed out, ready to go. See, you know what you're you know what you can do on any given day.

107
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.110
Jennifer G: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

108
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:53.520
Jennifer G: Good.

109
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.320
Helena Rouhe: So,

110
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:15.180
Helena Rouhe: Kind of, tell me a little bit more about your history with usage. So you three years ago you were in residential treatment program to to abuse of pills and prior to that. Had you had any other kind of treatment or any other history with using

111
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:26.580
Jennifer G: I'm not with any treatments. Before that I had never I had always said I would never do that. Never go into any kind of program, but before that.

112
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:37.020
Jennifer G: No, I, I wasn't even I always thought I was allergic to, like, like it in and stuff. Because when I was 18 I had a root canal and I

113
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:56.580
Jennifer G: It made me throw up. So I was actually scared to use them all these years. So before that I did, and I was quite a week and a lot but not I didn't have issues with anything else. Until then, and that was a big seven year six year

114
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.770
Jennifer G: Time of my life. I was like, just non stop with that.

115
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.900
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so six or seven years of using before you went into treatment.

116
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:14.010
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, okay. And have you gone back or have you been using marijuana since then.

117
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:20.820
Jennifer G: I have here in there, not not daily and I like I don't even have like

118
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:43.080
Jennifer G: I said, like a collection of pipes and all that. I don't even like I don't own that I'm like one of them I don't own a pipe or anything. And I'm like, the last time I did it was because I was offered it and like in a bad commercial and so I you know took one hit. But like I

119
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:55.200
Jennifer G: At Simon, the same as before, like it was just me like 24 hours a day, and that was and I basically was doing that because at the time. My husband was like

120
00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:06.900
Jennifer G: Like it was like, well, you can do this, you know, this is OK to do instead of, you know, the pills. So that was like my constellation price for a while then here's how I look at it.

121
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:15.540
Helena Rouhe: And how has it been going with the methamphetamine can find me all day he was kind of struggling with that a little bit.

122
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:25.920
Jennifer G: Yeah yeah that was because I was seeing someone that and this sells it and that was I, I got him out of my life to

123
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.400
Jennifer G: Call him.

124
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:45.990
Jennifer G: Um, it's been about a week and a half, and he won't leave me alone and all that stuff, you know, calls and calls. So I blocked him and he just shows up and stuff like that. So I'm like, right now I'm visiting family and to get away.

125
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:54.000
Jennifer G: For him, so I get the hint that I told them you know I can't be around anything like that. And he's the same way, but with

126
00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:05.460
Jennifer G: Like with marijuana but with and then better me like you're okay to do that. Like this is okay. You know, like, just don't. Do you know the other one. And I'm like,

127
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.960
Jennifer G: I don't want to be around anyone that's like it's okay to do any of that, you know,

128
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:10.350
Why

129
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.300
Jennifer G: And I just, it bothers me that that they're like, well, you can do this. So he would actually just look when I told him I was draining this program.

130
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:30.060
Jennifer G: Oh, here you go. You know, like this, you can have this. So yeah, that's why I was messing around with that, but I don't have any right now, or I'm haven't been around it.

131
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:38.940
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so you currently don't have any mess in the house and you don't have any any access to it at this time. Is that correct,

132
00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:41.130
Helena Rouhe: And

133
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:51.960
Helena Rouhe: Have you thought about kind of going into maybe a sober living situation or something. Is he kind of added support or do you feel like you're not at that point right now.

134
00:32:53.460 --> 00:33:04.440
Jennifer G: I'm I think I'm doing okay is now that I am with you guys and I, you know, have to make appointment. Keep appointments and like group and stuff. I am

135
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:14.940
Jennifer G: And and we are tested. I think that that's what I needed right now like to just completely or be able to say, like, no, I have to answer these people

136
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:28.890
Jennifer G: Are you know what I mean, like, I wanna, I don't want to fail kind of name like I can't do this. I can't be involved with that right now I have to answer. So I do. I like that. And it's, it's, you know, it's been going good so far, like

137
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:40.920
Jennifer G: I haven't smoked in a while, either. And I know it stays in the system long and it came up the doctor told me, but um yeah I haven't

138
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:55.830
Jennifer G: Been around and when I'm around it. Of course, yeah. It's like a temptation. Just because just because of its. They're like, oh, you know. So yeah, it's been obviously not around is way better way better.

139
00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:04.740
Jennifer G: So right now I like this is a lot. Honestly, to have the answer to, and I i think it's it's good.

140
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:12.510
Jennifer G: Because when I went to treatment. They just strip so much away where I like I wouldn't be able to work and all that.

141
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:29.460
Jennifer G: And that's been one of my goals for a long time, is to get a job and and you know, meet my goals of getting a car and getting back at my feet and not feeling like something while so i i right now. I think this is what I needed. And if I was like

142
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:38.040
Jennifer G: If I I know when I when I feel like when I know like I need to go somewhere, I need to be, you know,

143
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.420
Helena Rouhe: Like this. What does that look like when do you know that you need a higher level here.

144
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:43.680
And

145
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:52.920
Jennifer G: When I'm spending all my money on it and like lying to myself and still using, you know, and

146
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.750
Jennifer G: Like the ring.

147
00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:01.980
Helena Rouhe: And I'll be there anything before that. So before you're all in. Is there any kind of indicators that you're sliding

148
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:11.940
Jennifer G: And when I when my way is struggling as when I just can't stop thinking about it, or like I'm just trying hard to

149
00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:19.680
Jennifer G: Get ahold of anything. And like right now that's like that the craving was just like unbearable. Like it's 24 seven

150
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:37.650
Jennifer G: You know, can I get anything, can I call somebody. What can I do, and like, That's not my thinking right now like that Griffin soon me from the minute I woke up until I went back to sleep. Like, can I get anything. And I wonder, you know, you know, and like that's not on my brain right now.

151
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.340
Jennifer G: And it hasn't been like that for a while helping God

152
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.500
Jennifer G: God, you like that.

153
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.360
Helena Rouhe: Great. Okay.

154
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.090
Helena Rouhe: So as far as

155
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:58.620
Helena Rouhe: Well before I go there, did you, you mentioned the Tuesday in the bike it in response when you're 18. Have you had any kind of chronic pain issues or no.

156
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.240
Jennifer G: Yeah, that was

157
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.430
Jennifer G: An issue I

158
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:13.980
Jennifer G: I have problems with my feet. I have really bad finance on both my my feet. And so I did have a surgery, I want to say four years ago.

159
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:24.810
Jennifer G: Somewhere when I was already using and they of course started giving me all the prescriptions and all that. And so it you know it was

160
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:33.810
Jennifer G: The first time I ever used when again if I can was at the hospital and they gave it to me because they might notice was broken.

161
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:44.280
Jennifer G: And that's what started the whole I liked it. You know, he felt good and you feel like you can get stuff done. And I did have pain then and then when I

162
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:52.260
Jennifer G: Started getting in trouble with my feet. Is this think, oh, you know, those, those helps so much. They're like magic. Oh yeah, that's

163
00:36:52.680 --> 00:37:01.710
Jennifer G: And that's, I still have to have a surgery on my foot. And I won't do it because I don't even want to deal with that issue. I don't want to have to worry about that or you know

164
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.020
Jennifer G: Have to worry about getting off of those again. So I don't even want to

165
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.290
Jennifer G: Deal with that surgery is it's painful. The first one was agony.

166
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.430
Yeah.

167
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.170
Jennifer G: Okay.

168
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:31.440
Helena Rouhe: And then in regard to mental health. Have you ever had any therapy services and to kind of manage all these different stressors has ever been part of a support group or mental health group or individual sessions.

169
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.130
Helena Rouhe: Outside of the residential treatment. No. Okay.

170
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:40.110
Jennifer G: Now I have it in that. Yeah. Not at all. I've always been told, you know, you should

171
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.490
Jennifer G: Find some lenders and I never did it. Okay.

172
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.500
Helena Rouhe: Have you ever had any thoughts of

173
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.490
Helena Rouhe: hurting yourself or somebody else or any kind of self harm behavior.

174
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.800
Now, okay.

175
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:06.240
Helena Rouhe: And so, prior to the drama with your, with your husband. What was your family like growing up. What kind of childhood experiences. Do you feel like you had overall

176
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.820
Jennifer G: Oh, it was them. It was dysfunctional really bad.

177
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.940
Jennifer G: I, my mom.

178
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:24.930
Jennifer G: Left. My dad when she was pregnant with me and then they got married to, we, we were in Colorado. That's where I should have been born and raised and

179
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:35.820
Jennifer G: She left there to escape my dad and marry this guy from where I'm at now Victorville, California. And it was very dysfunctional and

180
00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:50.760
Jennifer G: Growing up in that house. And the only thing I was told about my dad was that he was an alcoholic and he died when I was 20 he was 42 so I never met him and

181
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:58.350
Jennifer G: That is a big part of my life that I still deal with. And, you know, not being able to meet him or not ever meeting him.

182
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.210
Jennifer G: And

183
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.900
Jennifer G: Feeling like my mom like, did that purposely

184
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.030
Jennifer G: So that was the

185
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:15.330
Jennifer G: That was hard. Growing up because they my mom married him and had to my sisters are younger than me and they would they, Daddy, you know,

186
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:23.820
Jennifer G: They would have their family and I just felt like the outcast like I wasn't, I didn't fit in. And because I couldn't. I called him by his first name my whole life.

187
00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:33.960
Jennifer G: So that was I always thought, why can't we be normal, like even looking around the house like it was. He's like a pack rat, so everything was just really like you know

188
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:44.610
Jennifer G: Just shit everywhere. And then you go to your friend's house and their houses normal like how I like my house just, you know, everything's in its place no clutter and that's how I like

189
00:39:45.510 --> 00:40:03.810
Jennifer G: My house to be because I grew up in such cluttered mess. And just like hoarding basically. So yeah, I just, I, I, I didn't like him. Growing up, I didn't ever feel like a part of a family with with them. All right, like I fit in with them.

190
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.190
Helena Rouhe: Do you have any connection to your sisters now.

191
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:15.720
Jennifer G: No, not right now. Not at all. We live in the same city with just add and we don't speak.

192
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.930
Helena Rouhe: When was the last time you guys had it either. I should

193
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.710
Jennifer G: Probably about a year I spent about a year.

194
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:28.680
Jennifer G: And

195
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.850
Helena Rouhe: See what happened a year ago that you guys stop talking.

196
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:42.930
Jennifer G: It was it was right when I was going to make the decision to mainly leave my husband.

197
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:50.550
Jennifer G: And move to my mom's and they didn't want me there with my mom, even though she lives alone in their own house. She's had for years.

198
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:59.100
Jennifer G: And there's like four bedrooms there and they just had a big problem with me moving there. They didn't want me to even though they don't live there. It's, you know, they have their own lives.

199
00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:05.670
Jennifer G: And so we got into an argument over that and I ended up not moving there and then not speaking to them again. So

200
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:14.460
Jennifer G: It's a big mess. There they were really against it, but like right now. My mom knew that like I needed somewhere to go and I'm not

201
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.080
Jennifer G: Like it took a lot for my own to trust me again because she knew she knows my issues.

202
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:26.970
Jennifer G: With addiction. So for me to be there. Now it's like I'm real because I thought she'd never let me step foot in her house again.

203
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:39.720
Jennifer G: So she sees you know and she's even commented that I she she sees that I'm doing way better. And, you know, with everything now. So she she's slowly starting to see

204
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.900
Jennifer G: That she can trust me and all that. So I'm glad.

205
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.070
Jennifer G: I wasn't speaking either. So that was hard.

206
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:54.480
Jennifer G: Yeah, so I don't know the repair with them were just so different. Yeah.

207
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:55.650
Jennifer G: Well, I don't know.

208
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.940
Helena Rouhe: There's a lot of things you need to take care of first before you start learning about them.

209
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.620
Jennifer G: Mm hmm. Yeah.

210
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:09.180
Helena Rouhe: So in terms of long term relationships were you in any other kind of long term relationships prior to your cousin.

211
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:15.600
Jennifer G: Not long term like this. Now, I mean I had when

212
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:26.340
Jennifer G: When I was about 18 for about three years. Two years, but it wasn't. I mean, I guess as long, but it was just

213
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:38.730
Jennifer G: We were just both partying and drinking and just fighting on stuff. So I got him out of my life. It was a bad situation. It wasn't no good. So yeah, that's about it. And then I met him, and we

214
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:48.660
Jennifer G: See it was 19 years total we were together. So three before we got married and you know so that was the longest. Yeah.

215
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.450
Helena Rouhe: And how many children do you have with us.

216
00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.680
Jennifer G: We have twins and they're about to be 14 so that

217
00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.430
Helena Rouhe: And all the turmoil with the custody and all of that. Correct.

218
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:09.330
Helena Rouhe: But if you are you experiencing kind of some turmoil with the custody and being able to see down and

219
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:15.510
Jennifer G: All of that. Yeah. Yeah. That's a big issue right now and they

220
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.410
Jennifer G: Because of their age 13 they

221
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:33.180
Jennifer G: Died. And I got, like, I call it brainwashed by what he, my husband was saying to them about me and he was using my addiction against even though, like he knows I haven't

222
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:46.770
Jennifer G: You know, I don't know, I, I've been doing my better and them. So use that against me. It is so unfair. So they, you know, and then he basically live with me live with me. And so that's what they

223
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:54.330
Jennifer G: Said they want to do. And even though the quarter says they're supposed to live with me and they right now. Don't they live over there with him.

224
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.220
Helena Rouhe: And when, how often do you get a chance to see them or how

225
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:16.140
Jennifer G: Am I, I've been seeing them. Let's see Saturday's about three days a week and staying with them and seeing what St overnight with them. So it's been okay and we're slowly rebuilding to because they were

226
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:23.640
Jennifer G: Having they had a hard time with it. The worst period they. It was awful. They hated it. They are mad. They're upset.

227
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:30.060
Jennifer G: And I've never been through that. I don't know how am I know I can't imagine you know what they went through. So

228
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:39.450
Jennifer G: I'm slowly rebuilding with them right now to barely because they would hardly text me back or even when I go anywhere, do anything but now

229
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:47.280
Jennifer G: You know they act more like themselves again with me. Like, I think they didn't want to like let him down that the poor guy that got

230
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:54.660
Jennifer G: You know the monster that ruined his life was me is how they saw me during the divorce and they even said things like

231
00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:04.590
Jennifer G: You know you are never abused you know you're just you're you pretend to be a victim to try to put that in jail. And I know that's what they were told, because I never

232
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:13.230
Jennifer G: Talk about that with them. And so they told me that. And so that's how they see things that I was the monster who ruined everything in the marriage.

233
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:23.340
Jennifer G: So I don't even like bringing that up. Like, let's just go forward, but I just hate that they pretty much think they grew up seeing that go down and

234
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:37.950
Jennifer G: fistfights and shit with for a long time, they grew up with it site. I'm worried like, they're obviously going to think that way to fight with your husband or wife, whatever. And I worry about that a lot. They think

235
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.910
Jennifer G: You know, they think that that's okay. That's the way it's

236
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.120
Jennifer G: It happens so

237
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.370
Helena Rouhe: Do you guys have any so you're staying with them with your ex husband on the weekend.

238
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:54.000
Jennifer G: No, no, no, they stay with me at

239
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.110
Helena Rouhe: My mom. Okay, good. Yeah, yeah. At first, they would go

240
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.710
Jennifer G: Yeah, they wouldn't go. Um, but now they're like, okay.

241
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.390
Helena Rouhe: You know, we make it fun for them.

242
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:23.160
Jennifer G: And stuff. And yeah, so finally efforts. Now, I wasn't even seeing them. I'm just talking on the phone or yeah so much better now. It's slowly coming back together. Good. It just bothers me to death that they don't live with me. Yeah, yeah, understandable.

243
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:31.710
Helena Rouhe: So, legally, everything is closed out. Do you have any open legal cases or anything open or pending in the course.

244
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:45.390
Jennifer G: Yeah, no, it's all done and we filed in May. So it was final the end of December, THE DIVORCE IS FINAL and in that it was all the spousal support and all that.

245
00:46:45.960 --> 00:47:04.170
Jennifer G: And then I get, and he does pay me every week he gets paid so he pays me every week and whether we're hating each other or were cold. He has paid me since day one. And I wasn't sure how that was going to go you know if he was going to actually do it, but he does do that so

246
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.120
Jennifer G: Yeah, so that's okay if that's been going smoothly.

247
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.420
Helena Rouhe: So that unable to pay your bills but

248
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.100
Helena Rouhe: Getting a dog will definitely make

249
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.840
Jennifer G: Oh, yeah.

250
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.250
Jennifer G: My mom and

251
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.950
Jennifer G: Yeah, my mom's friend is for me. It's basically takes up all the money and he gives me

252
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:32.730
Jennifer G: And so it's been tough. Like, I still like like right now. Like, I was like, if I was using I'd be so broke. Like I have like 60 bucks in my wallet and that's rare, though.

253
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:43.710
Jennifer G: Like I'm saying it's a little, little, you know, here and there, but I can't. If I start working. I'll be able to like get a card and pay for insurance and stuff. I want to start saving. But that's impossible.

254
00:47:44.130 --> 00:48:01.440
Jennifer G: With the rent and how little I get paid. So, but, yeah, it'll start coming together like I'll feel more normal and just them back on my feet. I just can't stand. I feel like a kid living at home like because she's very strict my mom drives me crazy.

255
00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.810
Jennifer G: Like she watches over me like I my kids still and it just drives me insane like

256
00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:25.050
Jennifer G: And I know she worries about me using but I'm like I'm not like I am trying to prove that to her and I am I know she's but she's just like that she has always been like that like real strict and so it's just it's just hard to live with it but I manage I deal with it.

257
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.330
Helena Rouhe: Um, how far did you get in school.

258
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:36.720
Jennifer G: I graduated in 93 and I started college but I quit.

259
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:48.810
Jennifer G: I had my daughter went right out of high school, a year after I graduated I got pregnant. So I had her when I was 21 so yeah that I didn't. I never went back to school.

260
00:48:49.710 --> 00:49:01.530
Helena Rouhe: Oh, it's not for everybody. I think it's great schools are getting specific certification makes more sense these days anyway. Do you have kind of big picture plans as far as their people thinking about

261
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:07.260
Helena Rouhe: Once you get through the census job. Is there something else you'd like to start working on are working towards

262
00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.320
Jennifer G: Yeah, I am.

263
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:16.530
Jennifer G: I have two fields. I'm really interested in, and if not, like, at least get my foot in the door and

264
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:32.520
Jennifer G: That's, I was thinking about to like this job is temporary. I gotta keep reminding myself that it is only temporary. And that I still have to you know this. This is a bit. I have to find something else. And I, I have two different fields. I'm interested in, like, I love the law field like

265
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.470
Jennifer G: When I was little, I wanted to be a lawyer. That's what I my dream was I just look

266
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:48.030
Jennifer G: At all of that. And I was like, Well, maybe I can start applying or finding I've already like, there's men out there right now. Like, just as a receptionist. Maybe the law office.

267
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:57.630
Jennifer G: Just to get my foot in the door and maybe start going to classes or something. And then I also love doing hair, makeup, all that stuff. So I'm like, cosmetics,

268
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:08.580
Jennifer G: Something that you know and so I wanted to look into both those because yeah now that I'm older already but I you know i i don't want to work at Target the rest of my life and make minimum wage.

269
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.740
Helena Rouhe: To target while you're working on other stuff to work towards something

270
00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:18.990
Helena Rouhe: Good forever. I have kind of short term and long term goals. So that was thinking about kind of next them.

271
00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:31.740
Jennifer G: Right yeah yeah yeah cuz i mean i the longest job I had was that a bang and I work there 10 years and I did. I like that a lot. But they were turning into more of a sales like

272
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:38.580
Jennifer G: I felt like I was a salesman and not working at the bank and other than that, I love the job, you know, you just

273
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:46.530
Jennifer G: It's cool. You work with all the money if cashback it. I'd love to, but the sale. Like if you didn't get four sales a day they pressure you and

274
00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:58.560
Jennifer G: And say, you're going to get fired. If you don't, you know, open more taking a Kansas like people are broke. They can open accounts. What do you want me to do. And there's no foot traffic. So it was really stressful working is so stressful. So

275
00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:06.690
Jennifer G: I can't work at a bank again like for forever because of the sales thing. I don't want to be a salesman, but I do like working with the public and

276
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:23.280
Jennifer G: I've always worked with before that. When I was younger I worked at cashier job so I'm I know how to do it. I know you know and I don't mind it. I like it. So I, I would love to work in the like as the receptionist or start there at the law firm or something.

277
00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:24.600
Jennifer G: That'd be really cool.

278
00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:33.240
Jennifer G: So yeah, that's my what the two things I like to do and what I want to pursue but

279
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.650
Helena Rouhe: In the long run over some

280
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.320
Helena Rouhe: Things we need to check up on his life goes on here.

281
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:41.160
Helena Rouhe: So we're going to be following up on your support groups. We're going to be

282
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.280
Helena Rouhe: Following up on how things are going with the job and

283
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:54.210
Helena Rouhe: I think they're kind of just going in day to day life and how you're doing. If you how you're managing kind of the daily stressors, what comes thank you doing to take care of yourself.

284
00:51:54.900 --> 00:52:00.270
Helena Rouhe: Maybe what are some things that you're engaging in that, you know, maybe it's not the most helpful. So that's kind of stuff will keep

285
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.280
Jennifer G: Following up on. Yeah.

286
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.230
And then

287
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:10.410
Helena Rouhe: You're currently living with your mom is anybody else in the household with you or is it just you and your mom.

288
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.620
Jennifer G: Now just me and her. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

289
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:20.910
Helena Rouhe: So the only other two other things I wanted to go over with you. Do you have a union gospel mission in your area buying chance

290
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.230
Jennifer G: You

291
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:28.020
Helena Rouhe: Order them union gospel mission you g m is kind of the big sizing.

292
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:32.460
Jennifer G: Nothing. I remember, but I can

293
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:41.010
Helena Rouhe: Look it, so I, I'd like you to look because they specialize in working with people who struggle with domestic violence situations or, you know,

294
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:42.990
Helena Rouhe: The

295
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:46.740
Helena Rouhe: Kind of, you know, unhealthy family environments with the very least.

296
00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:52.290
Helena Rouhe: Right. I think that if you can find a support group with them, that that would be something that would be. Additionally,

297
00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:53.880
Jennifer G: Supportive for you. So maybe

298
00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:02.310
Helena Rouhe: Take some time, and I'd like for you to see what you can find out there in terms of that because be nice for you to have that as well. You're

299
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.300
Jennifer G: Okay, you're

300
00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.490
Helena Rouhe: Okay, this environment and then

301
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:12.630
Helena Rouhe: And then the other thing I'd like to talk to you about. I sent out an email earlier, but I know you've been kind of tooling around visiting people

302
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:26.910
Helena Rouhe: The Thursday group. Dr. PACHTER is going to be taking that over, but he's not going to be available to actually attend the group until April like mid April. So we're going to move you guys over to Monday at seven.

303
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.560
Jennifer G: Oh, starting next

304
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:34.770
Helena Rouhe: Week for sure, but next week I'm meeting with you and I'm meeting with one other person in group and so

305
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:49.290
Helena Rouhe: It may be that we don't need to meet this week for group. So I wanted to see what your thoughts were, if we don't have group. This week, you have, I think you mentioned last week that you have a support group that you could attend instead on Thursdays at seven. Is that correct,

306
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.580
Jennifer G: Yes, yes I can.

307
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.560
Jennifer G: Okay. Okay, so

308
00:53:52.830 --> 00:54:03.900
Helena Rouhe: If you can look at your emails and kind of keep track of that I will let you guys know if we're going to actually have group this Thursday. But if you have other ways to get support and because we've had this session.

309
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:10.350
Helena Rouhe: Maybe what we'll do is not meet the Thursday. And I'll just plan on seeing you in group next Monday at seven o'clock.

310
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.360
