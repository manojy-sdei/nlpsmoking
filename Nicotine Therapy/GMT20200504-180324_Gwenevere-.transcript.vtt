Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Does your

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have already told me this is your daughter already know about what buprenorphine can do to mitigate the withdrawal symptoms that if she didn't want to

47
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: taper it as okay

48
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.410
You know,

49
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.920
Debbie Barker: She's not got a proper ID.

50
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.600

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And she where you're not sure if she misplaced or birth certificate. I think there was something about that. Right.

52
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.220
Debbie Barker: Robin, she didn't

53
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.430
Debbie Barker: I'm kinda hanging on to things like that.

54
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.820
Debbie Barker: So get her license and then show she loses everything

55
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

56
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So today I want to touch a little bit on what I call a treatment plan review just make a little statement about each one of your goals. When we first

57
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked K, you know, what do you want to do with the substance use and then I also asked, What do you want to do as far as what's your goal around the psychological the emotional

58
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The behavioral health peace, especially folks that have a history of depression, anxiety and some trauma and you I think have had all of that.

59
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What you mentioned when we first met a goal of yours was, I would like to feel better.

60
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I put in parentheses. I thought you meant your body, but I could be wrong.

61
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.340
I do

62
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just make a little statement about how your body is doing these days.

63
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.210
Debbie Barker: Sucks today.

64
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah what hurts.

65
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.600
Debbie Barker: Oh, my back hurts really bad headache.

66
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that that often go along with when you have course link to those tend to kind of follow each other. The back activates the

67
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.640
Heavier

68
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.260
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

69
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.420
Debbie Barker: My allergies to

70
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.350
Debbie Barker: Take three times a week for my apologies.

71
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we see something. I don't see

72
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So it looks like. For some reason, I don't have a me see if it's up somewhere else.

73
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I only have that as your goal.

74
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think it might be important to define one today. This has more applicability to some of the topics you and I have talked about, like, You're early. You're early childhood.

75
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The developmental trauma. Some of the trauma history, maybe even around sleep. It can be anything having to do with sort of that mental health space.

76
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: In your own words, what would you like more of, or what would you like less than when you think about your mental health, let's say,

77
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.880
Debbie Barker: More time to myself. Okay, be glad when this pen didn't win this Corona stuff slows down.

78
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.340
Debbie Barker: Yep. Why, I don't know, it's going to take a long time for, like, get back to normal.

79
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want more time to myself.

80
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now if Cassie wasn't there is that the primary issue, or is it really

81
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be. I want time to myself to go to the market when I want to to go to the hairdresser when I want to. Is that what you mean by time by myself is one thing could change and have the most impact, what would that one thing be

82
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.420
Debbie Barker: To be able to spend time by myself, like you said, go to the beauty shop.

83
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.230
Debbie Barker: Okay, and go stomping, and that sort of thing.

84
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You enjoyed that being able to sort of be your own Woman Do your own thing.

85
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:06.330
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

86
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now it's just a screeching halt.

87
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.080
Debbie Barker: You know,

88
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.330
Debbie Barker: I'm just stand at home like everybody else's

89
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.680
Debbie Barker: Tommy goes and does most of our running around.

90
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.380
Debbie Barker: We've only got 10 cases here in town. So that's not too bad.

91
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.280
No.

92
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at. I want more time for myself.

93
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can figure out a small step that you could create where there's time for yourself while you're on this sort of isolation quarantine status.

94
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So just

95
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.540
Debbie Barker: Like to go to the link

96
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.510
Debbie Barker: To the lake. Yeah, they've opened the State Park soon here in New Mexico.

97
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. And you want to go with with Tommy or by yourself.

98
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.710
Debbie Barker: were telling me.

99
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.060
Debbie Barker: Okay.

100
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you already talked to him about the ideas on

101
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.190
Debbie Barker: Oh, yeah.

102
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.500
Debbie Barker: What's good and get her.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.950
Debbie Barker: License. Okay, so we can fish to

104
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.120
Debbie Barker: Ramp and everything else out there.

105
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the plan at this point to go get that done.

106
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:39.600
Debbie Barker: Well hopefully here in the next week or so. I'm still waiting for my stimulus check to come in. I'm going to get my fishing life, that kind of thing, think it'd be good from the war two, the light

107
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.410
Debbie Barker: You to beautiful State Park.

108
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How far away is it

109
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.270
Debbie Barker: What's only about 15 miles.

110
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.660
Debbie Barker: It's not hard at all.

111
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Fisher in there. What do you, what do you catch

112
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.360

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh. Is it similar to to that.

119
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To to a trout or more like an orange roughy or cod. What would you say

120
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.850
Debbie Barker: It for him, probably more like a cod, but it's more tasteful and it caught is

121
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.760
Debbie Barker: Oh, they're delicious.

122
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I never knew that

123
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.060
Well,

124
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.020

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.180
Debbie Barker: Yeah, my uncle lived in Washington state for years.

127
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.160
Debbie Barker: Flies or bad in this room today.

128
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.670
Debbie Barker: This is my for my spare room.

129
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the

130
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.520

131
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We all have those

132
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:08.520
Debbie Barker: You know,

133
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.780
We've got

134
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.960
Debbie Barker: A big four bedroom trainer.

135
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.990
Debbie Barker: We've got plenty of room.

136
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's talk a little bit about how else you can create this sense of time for yourself, just think about how you could find it even in your own home.

137
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And how could you create where maybe it doesn't feel like you're having time to the self, you could create it, even if it's for an hour. So how do you think you might be able to create that time.

138
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.990
Debbie Barker: Pardon my spare room.

139
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.720
Debbie Barker: Back here maybe movie or something.

140
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever do that.

141
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.310
Debbie Barker: Every now and then I do yo

142
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.370
Debbie Barker: My sister's on and off.

143
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Now when you're over at your sisters, is she just like up in your business and you really don't get that quiet mental space of alone time or are you able to young, you guys have good boundaries with each other.

144
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:21.990
Debbie Barker: Oh, yo, yo, okay, they're just me and her left in our family.

145
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.430
Debbie Barker: I lost my parents in their early 50s.

146
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.330
Debbie Barker: And then my brother was hit

147
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.210
Debbie Barker: And killed on the freeway.

148
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Walking. I remember that you had mentioned that he he doesn't know how to read very well that was something

149
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

150
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:47.370
Debbie Barker: Gear the height. So he was walking on the bottom of the freeway, but he was also drinking to

151
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.050
Debbie Barker: Was after we lost her parents, and he was just pretty much lost

152
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just was too much for him.

Yo,

164
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just checking in on that. What would you say your self esteem is these days.

175
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a miracle or by works as well as it does, I figure one of these things goes wrong. I just gotta roll with it.

213
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What was going on back then.

214

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that'd be nice to

219
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.880
Get a procedure.

220
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.260
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

221
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.620

Gwenevere Abriel: 15 years ago.

223
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.210
Debbie Barker: No, just gradually got pretty bad over the last 10 years

224
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Any changes in family members, people that maybe had passed away or discord arguments or big fights with people during that time.

225
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.790
Debbie Barker: No, no.

226
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:38.070
Debbie Barker: I have a pretty loving family, we're all really close a little bit. We have left here anyway.

229
00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:00.720
Debbie Barker: At least I know to be taken care of. She starting to forget a lot

230
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: She's still recognizes your voice when you talk to her.

231
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:06.960
Oh, yeah.

232
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:26.550

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Some numbers out of here.

241
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And make them clear it out to more seconds 1234567 and eight. Okay.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to kind of get a little you know you're talking about disrupted sleep. I just want to check in a little bit on some stuff okay um

244
00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're doing here is

245
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a list of

246
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: statements or questions.

247
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is a like art scale, which means if you tell me it's a zero. That means it's not true for you at all.

248
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: A list of problems that people sometimes have in response to a very stressful experience.

249
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So just read each one will all read them with you and then you want to write either a zero, which is not at all a one is a little bit or moderately sorta yeah i to i continue to moderately have this go on are quite a bit with me.

250
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.690
Debbie Barker: You'll have to read them because I can barely seen them.

251
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to read them all absolutely read them. I'll do both. I will

252
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll keep it up here and I will also read. So we'll do the first one. So again, it's zero. Not at all, one a little bit too is moderately three is quite a bit. And four is extremely

253
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay if I make them too big, the formatting will change.

254
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:03.510
Right.

255
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So here comes the first one. So you just kind of want to think about it, you know, over this last 30 days, whether they are not at all, or all the way to extremely. So the first one is, have you

256
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Had repeated disturbing and unwanted memories of the stressful experience.

257
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.100
Debbie Barker: Zero.

258
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: A repeated disturbing dreams of a stressful experience and stressful. It can be trauma or it could be something else. But that's kind of what this stressful is

259
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.120
Debbie Barker: That would be one, but just been weird dreams that I've been been things that really happened is just

260
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.380
Debbie Barker: Even weird

261
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:50.760
Debbie Barker: You know,

262
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:51.930

263
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.610
Debbie Barker: That I wake up, think, oh, I don't want to go back to sleep and dream that again.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.600
Okay.

265
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And then suddenly feeling or acting as if the stressful experience were actually happening again as if you were actually back there reliving it

266
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: 300 I'm feeling very upset when something reminded you of the stressful experience.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Having

299
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.170
Debbie Barker: Having that one. I don't

300
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.220
Debbie Barker: Sleep a whole lot

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Night. Yeah.

Debbie Barker: On one

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Trouble falling or staying asleep.

306
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.020
Debbie Barker: Probably

307
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:01.080
Debbie Barker: Too.

308
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So just to review these you had choices of not at all, which of course was the zero a little bit wasn't one moderately was a to quite a bit was three and extremely was for

309
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay. Was there ever a time when any of these were extremely

310
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.460
Debbie Barker: Maybe the sleeping problem.

311
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and at its worst

312
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: When was that

313
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.810
Debbie Barker: Maybe a couple of weeks ago.

314
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was going on at the time.

315
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.440
Debbie Barker: Me and Kathy were arguing

316
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:56.850
Yeah.

317
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.870
Debbie Barker: Okay, he got into were told me last week, pretty good too.

318
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.660
Debbie Barker: And he's not a nice

319
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.060
Debbie Barker: You didn't New Yorker.

320
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hope what a New Yorkers do when they're not nice.

321
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.070
Oh,

322
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.250
Debbie Barker: They have diarrhea of the mouth.

323
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.040
Debbie Barker: And not in a good way, either.

324
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.700
Debbie Barker: He's a true New York

325
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.200
Debbie Barker: Never thought I'd end up with the New Yorker.

326
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: There you are.

327
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:40.920
Debbie Barker: Yeah, sometime. He's got to be putting this place. And I'm pretty good about that. Do you listen to

328
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But there was a sense of

329
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Even worse, sleep, corruption, when there's this sort of dynamic going on.

330
00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When Tommy is got the diarrhea of the mouth or is in his New York sort of

331
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Moment.

332
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.060
Debbie Barker: Yes. Okay.

333
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you feel on an emotional level when he is being mean.

334
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.110
Debbie Barker: This is me on

335
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:22.830
Debbie Barker: Some time. There's no need to say mean things you can say things and another man or

336
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.560
Debbie Barker: Being me. Yeah.

337
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Danny, could you let me into your world a little bit so I can register, much like what we just did with the sleep.

338
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What a two is, I know what a zero is, I know what for is for you.

339
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm not going to go call them. But what sound. What a that sounded mean

340
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not, I can hear any number of f bombs and I know I look like a square but

341
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear anything.

342
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:57.900
Yeah.

343
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.080
Debbie Barker: Say that again. My mind just went blank.

344
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, interesting. Um, so I'm trying to sort of give you a reassurance that you don't have to censor or edit anything I try to reassure people I know I look like someone who would be offended by customers and whatever, but I'm not

345
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.840
Debbie Barker: It would be

346
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. So what was it that he said that it made you mad that he could have said in a nice way. But he didn't. What was the the main way he said it.

347
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.980
Debbie Barker: Some time with this just the tone of his voice and not being nice at all.

348
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.030
Debbie Barker: Fuck this are fucked out or this

349
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

350
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.700
Debbie Barker: You just get the net New York state of mind.

351
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

352
00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it Kathy had left dirty dishes in the sink and he said, Fuck this.

353
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it, what was this sort of sequence of events that led to this.

354
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:18.390
Debbie Barker: Statement probably dirty dishes or somebody coming to the door late at night or somebody rapping on the window, you know, waking him up. He hears that window open when that window opens. Believe me.

355
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that all that happens. That's pretty short statement.

356
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:27.180
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

357
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just that.

358
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.880
Yo,

359
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.890
Just

360
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:45.300
Debbie Barker: He just wants her to do something more thorough live and do a little bit around him, you know and and help us. It should all beyond just me and Tommy

361
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I agree with you. I do. I agree.

362
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.060
Debbie Barker: I get targeted cooking every night.

363
00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So do I understand that it looks like this. You got to correct me. I'm trying to have a window into what what your world is like

364
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: He sees something he walks into the kitchen. He just says that short phrase and then walks back out and says nothing else, or what really

365
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:18.030
Debbie Barker: What really happened. He just keeps it up until we run out of things to say.

366
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And who hears him, is it just you, is it you, and Kathy who all hear them.

367
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.380
Debbie Barker: Me and Kathy.

368
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.020
Debbie Barker: You don't usually act that way when somebody is around

369
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just just family kind of thing.

370
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.490
Debbie Barker: Yeah, okay.

371
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It runs out of things to say.

372
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: For five minutes for half hour. Like, what are we talking about here.

373
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.630
Debbie Barker: Fun that 10 minute

374
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.190
Oh,

375
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.170
Debbie Barker: I know

376
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And our, our dishes. Flying is spits coming out of his mouth and he breaking things. Is he hurting any

377
00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.710
Grabbing people

378
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.370
Debbie Barker: That know

379
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And the days.

380
00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And weeks leading up to this event was he completely quiet.

381
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.780
Debbie Barker: Most of the time, yo.

382
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this him being fed up.

383
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.530
Debbie Barker: Totally. Yes.

384
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: There's sometimes when you wish you could talk like that too.

385
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:28.470
Debbie Barker: No.

386
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: No, there's a nice you prefer to do it. Nice. Right.

387
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:33.930
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

388
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.240
Debbie Barker: I might say if you ever word

389
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:37.620
Debbie Barker: But I

390
00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:39.840
Debbie Barker: wouldn't go to that extreme.

391
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:40.920
Okay.

392
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there some truth telling and what he says.

393
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.740
Debbie Barker: Oh yeah, some

394
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of it.

395
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:57.330
Debbie Barker: And he just like mouth override this at some time.

396
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.690
Debbie Barker: But it

397
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:09.990
Debbie Barker: That's just the man I guess, I don't know, but he's very kind hearted, he's good to her. He just gets fed up with things.

398
00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And he did. He does he have adult children that have since

399
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Gone and

400
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:22.140
Debbie Barker: You don't have a relationship with his kids.

401
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:41.400
Debbie Barker: He's been eight years in prison over something that he done and his wife just didn't let him talk to the kids, one of his sons come out and spend a couple of weeks, but come to find out he was on the run, of course.

402
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

403
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.980
Debbie Barker: They've been will come out and garden, but I wish he did have a relationship with this kids.

404
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.460
Debbie Barker: I've always encouraged and to try

405
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:05.340
Debbie Barker: To talk to us x today on Facebook. So maybe those are beginning to where he can, you know, talk to his kids. I think that would be good for him.

406
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you think that might be good for them.

407
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.800
Debbie Barker: To get to know him.

408
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:17.070
Debbie Barker: Tell me more. He don't know anything about his kids party.

409
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:26.970
Debbie Barker: They just don't want to talk to him, I guess, I guess all the time he was in jail is X kind of bad mouth, you know,

410
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.130
Debbie Barker: They're dead to him.

411
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:41.670
Debbie Barker: Because somebody else stepped into place and and she remarried and I guess they look up to him as a father instead autonomy. Right.

412
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.090
Debbie Barker: We're trying to stand.

413
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It did he ever have any years where he was

414
00:36:53.190 --> 00:37:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: He got to be a father of children in his own home. Was he able to sort of be a parent for some time.

415
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.610
Debbie Barker: Yeah, he was

416
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.370
Debbie Barker: Oh for probably for about seven or eight years before he went to prison.

417
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did he have those kids so he's like he had an eight year old maybe when he went in.

418
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.090
Debbie Barker: He has three kids.

419
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.710
Debbie Barker: And they're similar to the agent. My kids are

420
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see him.

421
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can come up with another phrase I I don't know how else to use it. But the phrases you have used

422
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The being mean the New York mean

423
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That style of communication. When you see that

424
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he look like he knows how to parent

425
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:54.420
Debbie Barker: No.

426
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:55.650
Okay.

427
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I was just curious. You know what I mean, if he has

428
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.330
Debbie Barker: Not had enough experience with kids especially adult kids.

429
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think you've got that he doesn't have. What's that skill or a few of them.

430
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.890
Debbie Barker: That I've raised my kids, since they were born and

431
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:31.650
Debbie Barker: I just know both of my girls pretty well. I had the hand on hand relationship with them, where he didn't have

432
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's important. Right. You really, you know, the subtle preferences and and communication style and and that is hard earned you earned that by by raising them.

433
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.380
Debbie Barker: Yeah, by being there.

434
00:38:50.070 --> 00:39:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been there, you know, just thinking now about you know how a moment ago, I asked you, does Tommy know how does he have the skills to, let's say, be a parent and you were pretty sure you're like, Nope.

435
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.640
Debbie Barker: He's learning, he's, he

436
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.790
Debbie Barker: Just lacks the patient.

437
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: There we just found one that's a skill.

438
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just found one that so that's what I was bringing us back to this had to do with pain with the skill itself. So you have patients would you say

439
00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:27.960
Yeah.

440
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.630
Debbie Barker: No choice.

441
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So what else does it take

442
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.060
Debbie Barker: Dedication

443
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.020
Oh, yeah.

444
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.920
Debbie Barker: What is it understanding ending

445
00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you think about Kathy.

446
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your dedication to her as an adult child.

447
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:15.300
Debbie Barker: To always be there to try to talk things out and tried to figure out what we're gonna do next and

448
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.660
Debbie Barker: She did. She don't have very good self esteem.

449
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: She's

450
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:24.900
Debbie Barker: I think that

451
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.770
Debbie Barker: A lot of the drugs and the men that she has around her.

452
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:31.800
Debbie Barker: Her boyfriend talks down to

453
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.420
Debbie Barker: I wouldn't have anybody like that.

454
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.940
Debbie Barker: I wouldn't listen to

455
00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

456
00:40:54.570 --> 00:41:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you make a distinction when your daughter is in active addiction about how parenting will look different. When your daughter's in active addiction versus when she's not is there different skills needed

459
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.440
Debbie Barker: I tried to understand her, but that's not always easy.

460
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What about this word.

461
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a pretty common one in recovery around

462
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundaries. How do you think that might be a skill that can be useful with your adult daughter that's struggling with addiction. How could boundaries plan on check and see what you know about that word.

463
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:11.220
Debbie Barker: She know she can't go in and out all the time at night or or people come into cotton thinking window and things like that she can only push so far. And that's it.

464
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you and Tommy have the same boundaries for what you'll tolerate and what you want.

465
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.960
Debbie Barker: Sometimes they'll tolerate more than I will.

466
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.190
Okay.

467
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So when he was upset recently.

468
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Had he reached his limit.

469
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.360
Yeah.

470
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever gotten to the point where just sort of saying it is you know isn't enough. And you're going to have to

471
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Set a firmer

472
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And and and say, you know, you're gonna you're going to need to have, you're going to go

473
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:22.470
Debbie Barker: Yeah, I've kicked off quite a few times, many times. Okay.

474
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about a communication skill.

475
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That one where you communicate how you feel.

476
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how much is that played into your particular parenting style maybe Tommy's particular parenting style. It's not for everyone.

477
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But

478
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: They do it, how, how comfortable are you guys at communicating sort of the I feel statements in your relationship.

Debbie Barker: We can talk about things.

480
00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.930

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this new york way of being mean. Has it been directed at you in your marriage and your relationship with Tommy

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.590
Debbie Barker: Every now and then.

502
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:07.980

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

509
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:40.560

Debbie Barker: Now we know

511

Okay.

520
00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:32.160
Debbie Barker: Got it.

521
00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So one thing I want to mention

522
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

523
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to ask you.

524
00:47:50.130 --> 00:48:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like more of or less of in our work together. What would you like therapy. Little bit. Maybe if we had to tweak something changed something because I need to kind of see which direction to go. And I want to hear from you.

525
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.520
Debbie Barker: About that one.

526
00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay because you have had therapy before and

527
00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Since I have an extra challenge with the telehealth and sometimes you're a gala a few words.

528
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear from us direction to go because there's lots of different things we can do. I have

529
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Interventions that I can do that are around nightmares or there around trauma history or an identity or negative self talk

530
00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if you were presenting with a specific response anxiety response, but I just did an inventory and mostly. It sounds like

531
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't, we didn't rise to it. Even a to

532
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: on many levels. So it sounds like

533
00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wrong.

534
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Sound like you're under low stress throughout the day.

535
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.630
Debbie Barker: much weaker. So I'm been stretched film.

536
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so sometimes what happens is those numbers that we just did there.

537
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, they're all low because my client has a high pain tolerance, meaning psychological pain tolerance, they put up with a lot already.

538
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So they're not going to have that for so I didn't. I can't

539
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I don't know if that's what I'm looking at.

540
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you mentioned the other day about just now actually about, hey, I had a weird dream, maybe not want to go back to sleep.

541
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And wondering if maybe that's something you would want to explore with me further and maybe we could

542
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:50.850
Debbie Barker: Go in and

543
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.540
Debbie Barker: Having a lot of them were dreams lately.

544
00:49:54.990 --> 00:50:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that could be something. So why don't we do that we'll, we'll bring up these weird dreams and in the interim, if you want to

545
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have next to your bed side of journal and even little details about it was a was a, you know, specific things like

546
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it was so bizarre. It started like a car, and then it turned into my foot or blah blah blah blah is weird is it. Believe me, I know what dreams can be like this bizarre inner mix of reality.

547
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:25.590
And

548
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And fantasy or where are they coming from but what's kind of an interesting thing to do is sort of explore that through some dream work that we can do together.

549
00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:39.510
Debbie Barker: Okay. Sounds good.

550
00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Even a little, a little statement like it was two in the morning and I had this dream and you just wrote even one little, little sentence down would be great.

551
00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.970
Debbie Barker: I have to write them down because I forget him wrote easy

552
00:50:52.470 --> 00:51:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, especially that one where he didn't want to go back to sleep to it as my interest. I'm very curious about that and the symbols that we're in, and then I can kind of take a look at it with you and we'll do an exercise. All right.

553
00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna message your doc.

554
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, that you were here, Dr. Solomon right

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Cool. No, you need anything else besides

558
00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Some let him know that you are here.

559
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.450
Debbie Barker: No, just to let him know I was here.

560
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well, then I'll see you in in group.

561
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll see right, I'll see you on group and then of course I'll see you in individual therapy on Monday.
