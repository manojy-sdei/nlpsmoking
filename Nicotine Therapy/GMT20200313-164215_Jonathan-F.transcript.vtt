Christy Lamkin: No. Okay.

158
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:19.470
Dr. Figg: All right, so let's talk a little bit about Suboxone and a little bit about what we do with by heart. So Suboxone is an opiate medication.

159
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:29.340
Dr. Figg: Some little bit different than oxy codeine, if you think of the actions that opiates have in your brain. They're kind of like lights which is they either turn something on, or they turn something off.

160
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:47.910
Dr. Figg: And the things they turned on, they turn on a pleasure center in your brain. They turn off pain they turn off breathing. If you take enough and they turn off you being awake so they knock you out if you take enough. Right. And with medications like oxy codeine and methadone.

161
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.020
Dr. Figg: We call us for

162
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.930
Dr. Figg: agonist. And what that means is, as I give you more and more

163
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:58.620
Dr. Figg: That tradition, the effects they have are more and more and more. So that's why people can overdose on those medications.

164
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:05.370
Dr. Figg: Suboxone isn't okay that's a little bit different, is what we call a partial agonist and that means it doesn't flip those switches mobile way.

165
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:15.090
Dr. Figg: So it doesn't flip the pleasure switch all the way. So it doesn't tend to have the high that other opiates do so it has less abuse potential generally we think

166
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.050
Dr. Figg: It does turn off pain and in people who have been on opiates for a very long time.

167
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:28.200
Dr. Figg: One of the things we talked about there is when you try and mean down everything hurts even worse than it did at the beginning.

168
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:39.000
Dr. Figg: And that's because of something we call hyper allergies, which means extra sensitivity to pain and it's because we've turned off pain in your brain for so long. Your brains, not sure. So it looks for

169
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.480
Dr. Figg: Harder.

170
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.600
Dr. Figg: And when we take away the opiates everything firms.

171
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:55.230
Dr. Figg: Does that make sense so because buprenorphine Suboxone does not flip that switch in the same way and I shouldn't deuces the hyper allergies yet that's caused by being on other opiates for a long time. So we like it for that reason.

172
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:03.060
Dr. Figg: It does turn off pain, though, so it's a useful pain reliever and then it does not turn off you being awake.

173
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:13.860
Dr. Figg: And you you're breathing the same way. Other opiates. It has what we call a ceiling effect beyond a certain dose giving you more and more and more just has no more effects. So it tends to be safer.

174
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.890
Christy Lamkin: And have less potential to hurt people overdose on

175
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:29.910
Dr. Figg: I'm in a pain management aspect of things that we care about the most is one its safety profile. It's harder to overdose on and particularly with people who have had a long history of chronic pain.

176
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.680
Dr. Figg: We are concerned, not from

177
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.200
Dr. Figg: Them trying to abuse it, but from them trying to relieve their pain. We don't want to hurt them with medication. So

178
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:50.220
Dr. Figg: Um, and then because it reduces the hyper sensitivity to pain, it becomes useful as a rotation into a pain management schedule to try and reduce some of those long term side effects of opiates so

179
00:12:52.230 --> 00:13:01.500
Dr. Figg: What we do with bright heart. So we have a pain management program and we have an opioid addiction or dependence program and sometimes they're a little bit of overlap there.

180
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:13.260
Dr. Figg: With our pain management program we I think we're still starting in Washington. It's still fairly new. I don't know that we have a support group. But generally, what we try and do

181
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:21.900
Dr. Figg: Is put people into a weekly support group for chronic pain that is done over zoom just like we're having our conversation now.

182
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:29.040
Dr. Figg: With other patients who have chronic pain and that way they can support each other, they can share coping strategies, things like that.

183
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:41.070
Dr. Figg: Because it helps to know that you're not alone. Right. Um, those support groups are generally about an hour long they're led by a therapist who has a history of treatment for chronic pain.

184
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:50.970
Dr. Figg: And they start with the check in with the doctor so you get lots of contact with your doctor to make sure are you functional, are we using medications. Is there something that's overlooked.

185
00:13:51.420 --> 00:14:00.780
Dr. Figg: And that way we can stay on top of your treatment with the goal of making you as functional as we can with the lowest dose of medications available.

186
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:07.770
Dr. Figg: That are effective to make you functional so that we don't run into side effects of escalating doses. Does that all make

187
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.000
Christy Lamkin: Sense. Yeah.

188
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:24.660
Dr. Figg: Cool, um, like I said, I think we're still starting our program in Washington. So I don't know, I'll ask our program director, if we have any updates on that. But what we would do in the meantime is just individual sessions between you and me.

189
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.680
Christy Lamkin: Okay.

190
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.750
Dr. Figg: And then individual sessions potentially with a therapist or counselor. We have another

191
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:40.290
Dr. Figg: Doctor Who is a pain management certified doctor and she does mostly non medication based pain management strategies and she's got lots of

192
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:51.570
Dr. Figg: Excellent educational material and things like that. She goes through guided meditation, yoga and things like that for people chair yoga right things that thing.

193
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.480
Dr. Figg: About Yeah, things are useful for people

194
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.590
Dr. Figg: But OK so

195
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:09.930
Dr. Figg: That's, that's kind of the way Suboxone works. That's why we like Suboxone can be useful. It does. It does have the potential for side effects, just like any other medication can

196
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:22.050
Dr. Figg: Um, so Suboxone and obviously the side effects that we can see are opiate related. So, constipation, nausea, abdominal discomfort drowsiness, dry mouth dry eyes, things like that.

197
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:33.090
Dr. Figg: And so we want to find the dose that gets you functional that relieves your pain as well as we can with the understanding that sometimes

198
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:40.980
Dr. Figg: Life is a little bit uncomfortable, but if you're functional and you can go work. And you can do the things you want. That's really are measuring stick and then

199
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.620
Dr. Figg: Making sure that you don't have those side effects from that, um,

200
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.470
Dr. Figg: When you take the to sanity. That's Zana flex or

201
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.260
Dr. Figg: Or spasms. Do you think that's effective

202
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.800
Christy Lamkin: It kind of stops my legs from cramping up but

203
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.100
Dr. Figg: Well, that that is what. That's the goal.

204
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.520
Dr. Figg: Does it make you sleepy.

205
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.910
Christy Lamkin: Oh yeah, that's why I take it at night. Gotcha. Okay.

206
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:17.640
Dr. Figg: So when you take it at night and it relieves kind of the leg cramps, does it last.

207
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:19.830
Christy Lamkin: Okay.

208
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.490
Dr. Figg: Right, so there may be room for improvement on that. There's probably room for improvement on the deluxe team as well.

209
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:33.450
Dr. Figg: You're only 20 milligrams. Have you ever been trained on any other medications for your pain. No.

210
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.390
Christy Lamkin: I'm they tried me on like

211
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:44.370
Christy Lamkin: Cycle been supreme and stuff like that much carbon all but I'm all that I'm allergic to those the breaking out the big rash.

212
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.620
Dr. Figg: Let's talk. Okay, so

213
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.090
Dr. Figg: Both method carbon mall and cycle events.

214
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.120
Christy Lamkin: Over and Viking and I'm allergic divided in

215
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.830
Dr. Figg: What happens with Viking

216
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.200
Christy Lamkin: Start puking.

217
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.900
Dr. Figg: Okay, that's so that's an ad. It's not a true allergy, but it is an adverse effect. And we do care about that very much.

218
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.830
Dr. Figg: So that's, that's something that

219
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:25.770
Dr. Figg: Any opiate could cause if you have done this, they can make you that they so you have opioid receptors in your brain that control your breathing and pain and things like that yeah them in your gut to that's why

220
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:30.390
Dr. Figg: We can cause you to be constipated, and it can cause you to vomit and things like that.

221
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.340
Christy Lamkin: It makes me it

222
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.620
Dr. Figg: That's also a

223
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:52.140
Dr. Figg: It causes histamine, which is the chemical in your body that is released when like seasonal allergies happen. So, it causes a release of histamine. So it makes you flush an inch and things like that. It can at least for some people. So, so that's another

224
00:17:53.580 --> 00:18:01.980
Dr. Figg: Adverse Effect, but not necessarily a true allergy, right, not, not a know what could become a life threatening sense

225
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.100
Dr. Figg: Important. Okay.

226
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.690
Dr. Figg: All right. Um, do you have any other health conditions.

227
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.060
Christy Lamkin: I have

228
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:31.770
Christy Lamkin: arthritis in my left or right knee. Which one had surgery, my right knee and then I fibromyalgia with that comes with the MS.

229
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.830
And

230
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.910
Dr. Figg: knee arthritis. Correct.

231
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:48.720
Yeah.

232
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:59.100
Dr. Figg: Right. So what I think we should do is that since there's a goal of

233
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.450
Dr. Figg: Changing you over to

234
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.520
Dr. Figg: The box.

235
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:15.030
Dr. Figg: There is so you are on at one point you were on your 50 milligrams of oxygen code of four times a day.

236
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.820
Do a calculation.

237
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.260
Dr. Figg: Because we want to try to

238
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:32.820
Dr. Figg: Pick a dose of Suboxone that is likely to work.

239
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.310
Dr. Figg: Okay, okay, without

240
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:43.500
Dr. Figg: Too much manipulation, there may be some, like I said Suboxone works a little bit differently than other Opiates are sometimes there's a little bit

241
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:56.010
Dr. Figg: Trial and error on finding the dose, because it's not a perfect conversion, but we can get close to you're taking 15 or four times a day. There's 90. Okay, cool.

242
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:06.510
Dr. Figg: So what I would suggest would be that we start you Suboxone comes as a sublingual tablet or strip. Have you ever seen it before.

243
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:15.810
Dr. Figg: Okay, so the tablets look like any other tablets, the strips look like little breath strips. If you've ever seen those are you remember those

244
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:22.680
Dr. Figg: They're settling which means you put them under the side of your tongue and you let them dissolve. You don't chew them up. You don't swallow.

245
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:30.810
Dr. Figg: It's important to understand that there are two medications in Suboxone one is buprenorphine. That's the opioid pain reliever that we care about.

246
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:40.890
Dr. Figg: The other is the locks zone, which is an abuse deterrent medication. It's actually reverses opioids. So it's what we give to people if they overdose on things.

247
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:52.290
Dr. Figg: When you allow the medication. The film or the tablet to dissolve underneath your tongue you absorb the buprenorphine through the veins just below your tongue and you don't absorb the knowledge. So it goes right through.

248
00:20:53.730 --> 00:21:00.810
Dr. Figg: So you get the effect that we want. If you swallow the tablet or the film, neither of them gets absorbed. It's like taking out

249
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.400
Dr. Figg: And you won't you won't feel good.

250
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:11.790
Dr. Figg: When people do silly things like melt the strips or crush the tablets and then shoot it or smoking or snorted or something like that. They get a whole bunch of from the locks home.

251
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.530
Dr. Figg: Which puts them into withdrawal and makes them wish they had not abused the medication.

252
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:27.840
Dr. Figg: So I want you to understand the way this medication is formulated, it's got an abuse deterrent mechanism so that you take it in the right way so you don't have any problems with it. Okay, it's just important

253
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.610
Christy Lamkin: And it's not scared now.

254
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.270
Dr. Figg: That's okay. No. As long as you let it dissolve on your tongue. You don't do

255
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.660
Dr. Figg: Something

256
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.180
Dr. Figg: Else with it. It causes no problems.

257
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:47.850
Dr. Figg: Okay, but it's but I just want you to understand the way that the medication is made. And the reason they do that is because we use this not only for pain management, but also for people who have a history of opioid addiction.

258
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.510
Dr. Figg: Got some of us to turn mechanism in there for that.

259
00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:00.690
Dr. Figg: And so what I was just so it comes in, generally eight milligram tablets or strips.

260
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:09.660
Dr. Figg: And I would suggest we start you at one of those a day. This medication usually for most people, lasts, most of the day, sometimes more than a day.

261
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.370
Dr. Figg: So,

262
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.660
Dr. Figg: You're on. Okay, so you're on oxy cotton. When is the last time you took oxy cotton.

263
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.110
Christy Lamkin: Last night last night. Okay.

264
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:34.290
Dr. Figg: All right, so what I would suggest we do is probably to start you at half of a strip you can cut the strips and half with scissors. You can cut the tablet, or you can break the tablet. So score.

265
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.920
Dr. Figg: So to start with either half a tablet or half a stroke, depending on what form your insurance company wants to pay for basically

266
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.140
Dr. Figg: Twice a day.

267
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:58.860
Dr. Figg: Once in the morning, evening, and then if we need to. If you find that you're having withdrawal symptoms at any point so withdrawal from opioids is the opposite of everything they do. So opioids cause you to be constipated withdrawal makes you have diarrhea and bond.

268
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:11.070
Dr. Figg: Opioids puts you to sleep withdrawal wakes you up real bad anxiety can make people sweat it can make people fidgety and restless makes people feel like they have no energy, things like that. So once you understand

269
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:19.800
Dr. Figg: What that what the symptoms are because we're going to have to do some cross over from what you're taking to what you're going to take. Okay.

270
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:31.260
Dr. Figg: But the goal would be probably half a tablet twice a day, maybe going up to half a tablet three times a day, or one and a half to tablets in a day total

271
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:42.480
Dr. Figg: Depending on how well it works for you. Our goal, again, is that you are functional and you're able to go do the things on the lowest effective dose that we can find. So we avoid side effects.

272
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.450
Dr. Figg: One of the important things to understand about Suboxone about buprenorphine itself.

273
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:56.400
Dr. Figg: Is that when you take it and when it goes to the receptor in your brain where it acts, he grabs told her that receptor tighter.

274
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:05.880
Dr. Figg: Than other opiates do and what that means is it hasn't blocking effect. So if you're already taking buprenorphine Suboxone and you take something else it won't work.

275
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:14.310
Dr. Figg: Because the buprenorphine won't let go. And so the other stuff just cycle through your system. It never gets its action until you metabolize it out.

276
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:21.810
Dr. Figg: But if you're already on something else and you take up north in before the other stuff is out of your system. The buprenorphine will kick

277
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:31.980
Dr. Figg: The oxy codeine off the receptor and that can put you into what we call a precipitated withdrawal, which is like a much worse withdrawal temporary and we don't want that to happen.

278
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:39.960
Dr. Figg: So when we're transitioning someone from another medication to Suboxone we have to have a washout period. Okay.

279
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:46.650
Dr. Figg: That's usually for oxy codeine, which doesn't last very long. It's usually about 24 hours.

280
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:52.470
Dr. Figg: Okay, between the last dose of our code and the first steps of Suboxone okay

281
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:57.360
Dr. Figg: Okay. And that way we avoid that and that way you're going to be a little bit uncomfortable.

282
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:06.270
Dr. Figg: During that time period. And then when you take the Suboxone it will make you feel better, as opposed to making you feel much much worse, which is important there, right.

283
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:18.240
Dr. Figg: Okay. Um, so what I generally do for people is write them three prescriptions. One would be a prescription for the Suboxone with instructions on how they're going to start it.

284
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:31.950
Dr. Figg: The second one would be a prescription for a blood pressure medication called Clonidine, which we actually use to help decrease withdrawal effects. So you may have some withdrawal. You're not going to take the oxy codeine for a little while and your brains going to notice.

285
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.420
Christy Lamkin: Okay, if

286
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:46.410
Dr. Figg: If you feel things like getting sweaty are shaky or your nose running or, you know, a lot of tearing and yawning and things like that they're uncomfortable. That's what climate Amos useful for decreases the severity of those effects.

287
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:53.190
Dr. Figg: And then the last prescription would be for So Fran, which is an anti nausea medication, so that if you get nauseated.

288
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.140
Dr. Figg: During this crossover period, you have a medication that you can take to make that less

289
00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.820
Christy Lamkin: Okay, cool.

290
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:07.020
Dr. Figg: So that you can kind of stand to be a little bit uncomfortable for a little while and then start on the Suboxone does all that makes sense.

291
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:07.470
Christy Lamkin: Yep.

292
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:11.850
Christy Lamkin: Okay, good. Okay, why are you listening. Anyway, so she knows

293
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.750
Dr. Figg: That's great. That's great. It's just, this is a really important part of the conversation because it's we want to do that crossover right so that you don't have any problems.

294
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.970
Dr. Figg: Before you decide, are you out of oxy Cotto

295
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:35.220
Dr. Figg: Yeah, okay. So we'll do our best to try and make sure you can pick up your Suboxone today.

296
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:35.970
Okay.

297
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:45.990
Dr. Figg: So what what I suggest is all right you the scripts. I wanted to wait about an hour and then call the pharmacy.

298
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:55.920
Dr. Figg: And make sure that they were able to fill it. Sometimes there's issues like the pharmacy doesn't stop that medication may say, Oh, no, I've ordered or no we don't order or something like that.

299
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:10.350
Dr. Figg: Where they may say, Oh, your insurance company wants a form filled out by your doctor or something like that. We won't fill it until we get that and we don't know what issues we're going to run into and toggle they happen, unfortunately.

300
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.850
Christy Lamkin: Those things

301
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:24.810
Dr. Figg: So I want you to call the pharmacy and an hour and then say, hey, we're able to fill it. Was there any problem. If you run into any problems. The first call you should make is our virtual clinic, which is who you talk to, before me. Okay.

302
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:31.680
Christy Lamkin: Hold on. She's gonna get the number so she can do it because she does all the calls and all the prescription. Great. Okay.

303
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.200
Christy Lamkin: All right.

304
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:42.540
Dr. Figg: So sure if there's any problems, you know, should call the virtual clinic first and I don't have that number in front of me, but it's the number you call before me.

305
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.370
Christy Lamkin: Okay. Oh, yeah.

306
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:44.820
Dr. Figg: Yeah.

307
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.420
Christy Lamkin: Yes, that

308
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:54.720
Dr. Figg: I just don't have that number handy right now and that's like the front desk of a medical office. They can solve the overwhelming majority of things.

309
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.790
Dr. Figg: Okay, um,

310
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.070
Dr. Figg: And then

311
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:09.240
Dr. Figg: Like I said, the goal. We will start you on a half dose twice a day. And if you find that somewhere in that day, you're having

312
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:20.910
Dr. Figg: Withdrawal or you're having times where, whereas on for some feeling like that, then you could go up to one and a half. So, one half, three times a day. Does that make sense. Yeah.

313
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.650
Christy Lamkin: She does it all. So she's listening.

314
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.010
Dr. Figg: And then what we'll do is we will follow.

315
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.830
Christy Lamkin: The student work go three

316
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.840
Christy Lamkin: What's that

317
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.730
Christy Lamkin: I said if to doesn't work, go to three if

318
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.420
Dr. Figg: It doesn't work out, or three. That's right. And you can you can kind of

319
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.280
Dr. Figg: There's a little bit of liberty with how she takes it.

320
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.690
Christy Lamkin: If she wants to take

321
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.140
Dr. Figg: You know, a full strip in the morning and see if there are well it would be tonight, based on when she went to her last Dakota

322
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.890
Dr. Figg: And see if that last run through the next day.

323
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:04.890
Dr. Figg: Okay, if she wants to take half and half. It's, you know, there's, it's really variable, how long it lasts for various particularly

324
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.190
In the

325
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:12.990
Christy Lamkin: History of pain. Yeah. How long should she be ON TO HAVE ONE IN THE MORNING AND A HALF ONE AT NIGHT.

326
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:21.600
Dr. Figg: Well, we're using this to replace the oxy codeine, so are you saying how long should she tried that before she goes up to three.

327
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.230
Christy Lamkin: Yeah.

328
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.790
Dr. Figg: They are two at most.

329
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.450
Christy Lamkin: Okay.

330
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.760
Dr. Figg: It doesn't need to be a long time of her going like, I feel like crap and and all of every day.

331
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:36.030
Dr. Figg: Yeah lucky if we don't, yeah. My goal is that she's fun moment she her pain as well managed

332
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.110
Christy Lamkin: All right.

333
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.260
Dr. Figg: I am happy to

334
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.570
Dr. Figg: Also take over prescribing for your sanity and your do locks, a team.

335
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.350
Christy Lamkin: Okay.

336
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:52.260
Dr. Figg: Pain management program and that way we don't have more than one doctor moving things

337
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.860
Christy Lamkin: With them.

338
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.550
Dr. Figg: And that's not to take anything away from your primary care. That's true.

339
00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.360
Christy Lamkin: And that's fine because I just switched my primary

340
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.150
Christy Lamkin: So I would suggest that

341
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.220
Dr. Figg: Um, do you have to

342
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.970

344
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.620
Dr. Figg: And then just to make

345
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:16.950
Christy Lamkin: Sure.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:24.930
Dr. Figg: I do not have a pharmacy on file for you. That's not good. We should fix that.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:42.630
She doesn't

366
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.460
Dr. Figg: Days. The 13th. What I would suggest is that we go ahead and schedule on that the virtual clinic with next Friday.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.660
Excuse me.

381
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:53.820

382
00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:03.510
Dr. Figg: So osterhaus the box, so she'll be doing individual appointments, which is Washington and we don't have a group yet. Hopefully we fix that soon.
