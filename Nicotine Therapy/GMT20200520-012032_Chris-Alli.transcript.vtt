49
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.450
James Chavez: Um, I think it was after surgery and my son was living with us at the time and

50
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.920
James Chavez: I think that what I did was

51
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:41.400
James Chavez: I wasn't quite making it on my pills every month, you know, I was I was gobbling them down. I mean, I was in serious pain. I mean day night I couldn't sleep and

55
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.590
James Chavez: Quite some time with sequel 20 1314 2015 and probably quit for

56
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:13.080
James Chavez: Hosting or, you know, we'll see 2016 which for a year. I didn't methadone maintenance know job 150 milligrams, which was too much, honestly.

57
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.080
James Chavez: Okay, and then I don't even remember the circumstances, why

58
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.440
James Chavez: I got off a method on the first time.

59
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.090
James Chavez: I think what I did is I wanted to quit. Nothing don't

60
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.070
James Chavez: And

61
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.230
James Chavez: I don't know, I can't remember even why went back to heroin back then.

62
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.920
James Chavez: Sure. Okay. So I went back to methadone maintenance 2016 and did well.

63
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:51.450
James Chavez: From 20 1620 1720. No, I went methadone maintenance. I'm sorry, the first time in 2016

64
00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:02.700
James Chavez: And I started back on methadone maintenance in 2018 I think I did it for two years and I got off for a while and then

65
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.890
James Chavez: 2018 October 2018 I went back to methadone maintenance, but I just went to enough methadone, not to be sick.

66
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.080
James Chavez: Sick. So it's 80 milligrams and and then

67
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.320
James Chavez: What happened was,

68
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.110
James Chavez: I had been putting off this surgery for about three years and

69
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:36.630
James Chavez: This past November I had the surgery. My methadone maintenance would not let me um have enough take home.

70
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.720
James Chavez: I would have to have gone in for methadone, like two days after surgery.

71
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.210
James Chavez: It was impossible. Yeah, I mean for me to do that, you know, I talked to the surgeon. He knew everything that was going on.

72
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.520
James Chavez: And to be honest with the five milligram Moxie code on Mosaic Covenant now.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.780
Yeah, okay.

74
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.840
James Chavez: And see the deal with the left tip when he, when he did surgery and left it.

75
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:14.910

James Chavez: You know my face. I know what he's doing to my lungs, you know, and you know, I'm just, I didn't want to go back to methadone maintenance because you end up as a slave to having to go in there every day.

155
00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.730
James Chavez: Yeah, I just don't like it.

156
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.950
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

157
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.040
James Chavez: Methadone is just another addiction.

158
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:06.720
James Chavez: You know,

159
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.350
James Chavez: People don't see it that way, some people don't. But other people do and

160
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.530
James Chavez: It's well your approach to it so fair and it was hard.

161
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.880
James Chavez: It was hard to get off.

162
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.760
James Chavez: Method. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, it's real hard. I mean,

163
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:28.740
James Chavez: When you go down five milligrams 20 milligrams, you know, you're okay. But once you get, you know, 2030 milligrams 40 milligrams down you really feel it.

164
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:29.550
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

165
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.650
James Chavez: You know, so I've never tried Suboxone. I don't know if it works as good as methadone.

166
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.460
Chris Alliman MD: Mm hmm.

167
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.930
James Chavez: You know, or

168
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.030
Chris Alliman MD: Or what yeah so Suboxone is

169
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:58.290
Chris Alliman MD: A little bit different than methadone right methadone, you can keep going up on the dose and keep getting more of an effect Suboxone there's a leveling off. There's no, there's no effect over 24 milligrams. Once you get to 24 milligrams. That's the maximum

170
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.960
James Chavez: Is that 24 milligrams a day.

171
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.960
James Chavez: Yes, it's, it's an eight.

172
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.910
James Chavez: Eight to correct it's

173
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.030
James Chavez: Rigid beer enough and awesome. Yep.

174
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.680
Chris Alliman MD: buprenorphine in the lock. So, yeah.

175
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.800
James Chavez: North things radical. I was wondering how you say that

176
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.030
James Chavez: Yeah, okay.

177
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.260
Chris Alliman MD: Um, how much do you know about our program at this point.

178
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:26.280
James Chavez: You know, I've been briefed on by Anna about counseling.

179
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:34.500
James Chavez: And she said something that you know that I might have to do like a group therapy words. I don't like to you, but

180
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:44.550
James Chavez: Um, yeah, I pretty much stayed quiet. I've tried that locally, you know, and just wasn't my gig man, I just, I sat there quiet.

181
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:45.660
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

182
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.650
James Chavez: And I know

183
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.040
James Chavez: People have a lot of stories, but I don't have much of a story.

184
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:57.240
Chris Alliman MD: So the way it works out and we'll get more into this at the end. I've got a bunch more questions to ask you.

185
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:12.360
Chris Alliman MD: The way it works out is that there are two appointments each week for you to attend one is a group session with me and some other folks that are on Suboxone and the therapist and we'll figure out a time that works for you that way.

186
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.750
Chris Alliman MD: The other is individual therapy with the therapist.

187
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.010
Chris Alliman MD: Each of them are an hour.

188
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.750
Chris Alliman MD: So that's kind of

189
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.280
Chris Alliman MD: How

190
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.620
Chris Alliman MD: It all happens it all happens over zoom

191
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.610
Chris Alliman MD: Just like this.

192
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.710
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, yeah, that's a good

193
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.900

194
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.610
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, we all are right.

195
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.450
Yeah.

196
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:38.010
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Um, alright, going to run through just some yes and no questions here.

197
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.730
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, this is thinking, well, thinking about

198
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.600
Chris Alliman MD: The time

199
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.000
Chris Alliman MD: As you've been using heroin or when you were on pills.

200
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.940
Chris Alliman MD: So yeah, if you don't understand them. If I need to repeat them. I certainly can. That's no problem.

201
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.020
James Chavez: Okay.

202
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.580

James Chavez: Okay, yeah. I didn't know anything about that.

376

Chris Alliman MD: So the way you do it.

383
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:41.160
Chris Alliman MD: Is that you go into the bathroom and close the door because you can't be disturbed for like 510 minutes

384
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:48.930
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, rinse out your mouth. Put the film under your mouth and then sit there for five minutes and don't swallow.

385
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.810
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. The the

386
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.180
James Chavez: most vibrant all

387
00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.470
Chris Alliman MD: Right, the medication is opposed to absorb through the lining in your mouth.

388
00:24:59.250 --> 00:24:59.730
James Chavez: Okay.

389
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.440
Chris Alliman MD: If you swallow it, and it goes into your stomach. Stomach acid will inactivated.

390
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:10.350
James Chavez: And activate it. So how do I hold it in

391
00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.050
James Chavez: Without swallowing.

392
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.700
Chris Alliman MD: I mean, yeah.

393
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.050
James Chavez: That's kind of you.

394
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:26.700
Chris Alliman MD: Yes, so you know it's resist swallowing for as long as you can't you can't not swallow for five minutes. Right. I'm just saying, Do it for a long time, where you just hold the saliva.

395
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.330
Chris Alliman MD: To let things absorb. All right.

396
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:37.230
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, I did it will work fine. Regardless of how long you do it for just, just make sure you've got it in there for a good amount of time.

397
00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.310
Okay.

398
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.320
James Chavez: Mike, how many goes, I have to take a day. I mean,

399
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.690
James Chavez: Right, so we got to work this

400
00:25:45.690 --> 00:26:00.030
Chris Alliman MD: Out, we have to work this out a little bit. So let's talk some some more before we get there. The other part of this. I'm just finishing off with the kid issue is, I'm going to send in a nasal spray called nor can, you're probably familiar with it.

401
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:09.390
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so make sure you've got that at the house. Make sure other people know where it is. God forbid something happened with your grandson. People need to order.

402
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:22.530
James Chavez: There we have we have some on hand is my wife takes oxycodone. So my final exam or some so they give it to her with your prescription. But yeah, I'm getting

403
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.420
Chris Alliman MD: Good, good. And there'll be refills on it. Also, so if you use one just go get another one.

404
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.530
Okay.

405
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.120
Chris Alliman MD: So,

406
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:37.770
Chris Alliman MD: The difficulty with any of the replacement medications like methadone Suboxone any of them is that

407
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:46.290
Chris Alliman MD: If you take it too soon after using heroin or pills or anything, it can kick you into really bad with drugs.

408
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.150
Chris Alliman MD: Right, yeah.

409
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.140
Chris Alliman MD: So generally, we want to wait for you to take the Suboxone until you're in moderate withdrawals.

410
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.180
Chris Alliman MD: Moderate. Yeah.

411
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:04.020
James Chavez: What are we talking like 20 less than 24 hours. I mean, my withdrawals violence smoke start right away in one

412
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.000
James Chavez: Okay, no.

413
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:13.320
Chris Alliman MD: So that's when they start right but we don't want it when you started just started kicking into the bad withdrawals.

414
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.360
James Chavez: So you're saying

415
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.800
James Chavez: Your fight if I took Suboxone and smoke was going on, maybe sick.

416
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.580
Yeah.

417
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:30.390
Chris Alliman MD: I'm also saying that if you just smoked like within the last period of time depends on the person.

418
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.730
Chris Alliman MD: If you take Suboxone too soon after smoking. It'll make you sick.

419
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:45.750
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, alright. So, in general, we understand people to reach reach moderate withdrawals at 72 hours, three days.

420
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.900
James Chavez: That's more moderate from here me

421
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.890
Chris Alliman MD: On it. That's true, that's different for each person I just give

422
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.990
Chris Alliman MD: Me an average. And then we talk from there.

423
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.130
James Chavez: Okay.

424
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.840
James Chavez: So I go into

425
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.910
James Chavez: Severe within 12

426
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:00.900
James Chavez: Okay.

427
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.880
James Chavez: All right, I'm smoking a gram a day of the best sugar on so

428
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:12.900
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, I hear you, I hear you know we're talking like the goose bumps right we're talking maybe a little bit of sweating.

429
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.880

James Chavez: What happens with me is I start cramping.

433
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.460
Yeah.

434
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.040
James Chavez: You know, I start right

435
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.690
James Chavez: Doing this crashing uncontrollably. It's not like Rocky

436
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.540
James Chavez: But my body doesn't without me.

437
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.670
James Chavez: Wanting to do it.

438
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:40.050
James Chavez: Right, I'm saying it just does it starts this kind of weird shit and all the bones start hurting and stuff right away.

439
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:40.890
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

440
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.730
Chris Alliman MD: How long does it

441
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.920
Chris Alliman MD: Take after smoking. How long does that take see you smoke in the morning. How long does it take before you get to that point.

442
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.220
James Chavez: Um, I never get to that point.

443
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.590
James Chavez: I never want to go that far.

444
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:57.240
James Chavez: You know i mean i it's been it's been a while, you know,

445
00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:58.860
Chris Alliman MD: So,

446
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.660
James Chavez: I mean, I'm really afraid of that.

447
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.160
James Chavez: That's, yeah. That's why I smoke.

448
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.750
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, absolutely. I'm

449
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:09.060
Chris Alliman MD: Afraid many and many people are and I don't want you to that severe end of things I want to hit it.

450
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.540
Chris Alliman MD: Get it before that. But I also want to balance out we're

451
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.410
Chris Alliman MD: Not having the Suboxone throw you into bad withdrawals.

452
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:25.860
Chris Alliman MD: Because it'll go along with it, what it does is it competes with heroin for the receptors in the brain. And it kicks heroin off the receptors.

453
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.450
OK.

454
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.620
James Chavez: So my God alone.

455
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.390
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so it's

456
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.250
Chris Alliman MD: It's a bit of a challenge, but

457
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:40.830
James Chavez: It's really just creating a me is just beyond the

458
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:47.340
James Chavez: Beyond the physical part. It's a mental Part two. I mean, sitting here, smoking, it's a

459
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:53.250
James Chavez: Yeah, it's like a gambling habits like having to go play poker, you know,

460
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:53.970
Chris Alliman MD: Right.

461
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.430
James Chavez: Right, having moving your hand is like the ritual.

462
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.040
James Chavez: Yes, down to that.

463
00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:06.540
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah so Suboxone helps out with the physical part because that is an important part. But just like you're mentioning there's that mental part

464
00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:10.770
Chris Alliman MD: Which is why we have the therapy. That's why we have you do therapy because that is so important.

465
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.450
James Chavez: Yeah yeah

466
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.130
James Chavez: Yeah.

467
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.670
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so, um,

468
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.330
Chris Alliman MD: I want to talk through the prescription for Suboxone and how that's going to be written for you. Okay.

469
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.220
Chris Alliman MD: Where it's going to be a four day prescription to get started.
