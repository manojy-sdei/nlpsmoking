Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you got me. I

Gwenevere Abriel: Move over. Hey, it's February. Can you believe it. No. Yeah. Well, me neither.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, are we partially cast on caffeinated. Are y'all.

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.570
Cynthia We: Ah, I just Scott just one call God has

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the prior

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.330
Cynthia We: To getting there.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But oh my god

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.270
Cynthia We: Morning.

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning, please. Thank you. Okay, so we have kid management.

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We'd have caffeine, we have

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: A readiness to kind of feel something new around money and

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a little check in on what happened around what we started

17
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Last

18
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Time, like what has it been like with each other around money. Maybe I could hear from you. Scott what you've noticed

19
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.170
Cynthia We: What we've what's it been like in the past week.

20
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what, just maybe, you notice something a little smidge difference or not just curious.

21
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.360
Cynthia We: Well I yeah I've noticed, I mean, we're still really, we were just living tight. We're trying to get through, so

22
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.430
Cynthia We: You know, once I start working my real job again in Texas come in and everything will change, but I'm

23
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.200
Cynthia We: Pretty much in the same boat. We're living tight. Try not to spend anything

24
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.360
Cynthia We: So I don't know. We're still squabbling a little bit but not fighting

25
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.730
Cynthia We: That's the question we have

26
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the one

27
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.900
Cynthia We: We have really far squabbled it just feels like

28
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.090
Cynthia We: We're out there.

29
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.570
Cynthia We: Broke, and there's that

30
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.740
Cynthia We: Okay, we're beyond well beyond

31
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.710
Cynthia We: Is a freedom that comes when you're so broke. You know what I mean, it's just like

32
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.390
Cynthia We: Anything, even though the stress.

33
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.180
Cynthia We: Stress is still there, but

34
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.880
Cynthia We: It gets to a point where it's like, oh,

35
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.500
Cynthia We: I'm fine.

36
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, so here's what I heard.

37
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a huge change in the predictability of income coming in. There was some squabbling. But tell me, tell me, how did the squabbling differ, since there's this sort of

38
00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.790
Cynthia We: I have asked

39
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Only so much you can do. Right. How is it a little different. Did you notice any difference. The way the conversation went

40
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.830
Cynthia We: Um, I think maybe a tiny bit. I could say I noticed

41
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.330
Cynthia We: A little more constructive conversation a little more

42
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.850
Cynthia We: There were a couple conversations, maybe that we were seemingly trying to be on the same page. Okay, let me say

43
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So a little bit more constructive.

44
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you feeling like you're in the position of doing it on your own or do you feel like you had an ally in the decision making. During that squabble

45
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.050
Cynthia We: Well I, I didn't feel I had a little bit more of an ally, maybe just because

46
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.850
Cynthia We: The situation is pretty serious. So you know we can't be aloof to it, either one of us really

47
00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well there so that. So remember, because she's right next to you picture and actual squabble right

48
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to talk about this, this piece of money and I'm assuming it was like what's the priority because there's like all these competing priorities and there was probably a difference of opinion about how it should get spent. Is that what you're thinking of right now.

49
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:29.940
Cynthia We: Yeah, I mean it's general, it's not so specific. Right. I mean we we agreed on the couple of big things that we were trying to get our money for, um, but, uh, but they're still there. There was still the thing in the air with with me feeling like

50
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:42.540
Cynthia We: reminding her not to spend, you know whether I know that's could be right or wrong, but but but there's still that thing where I'm stressed out that I feel I need to say

51
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:55.170
Cynthia We: Don't spend anything or she's gone for two hours extra and I'm like, oh my god, that has to equate she's at she's spending some money has that's personally, so I'll, I'll, I'll call

52
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.730
Cynthia We: And that's not good, but I'm

53
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.060
Cynthia We: scared about it.

54
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.450
Cynthia We: So, so it's, I think I express that to her. I don't guess. I don't know how

55
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.650
Cynthia We: To thing. Let's not spending way too much money, money, and I'm scared, but she takes it more that I mad.

56
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's find out. Growing

57
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, I want you to, if you can tell him.

58
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Validate his fear. In other words,

59
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you saying you're afraid of dot dot dot that I'm going to go spend money.

60
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And explain to him how you can see the logic not agreeing remember with validation. We just say to another human being. You're not insane. I get the logic. So, look at him. You don't have to agree.

61
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can do it.

62
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not getting a lot of structure because I'm making assumptions that you know how do validation

63
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.810
Cynthia We: Take a breath I

64
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.530
Cynthia We: Forgot the damn word. Okay. Well, we know I suppose I

65
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me do some modeling for you guys remember I'm throwing at you quick because we've only got this little chunk of time so I'm Scott, if I'm hearing you correctly.

66
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And it makes sense to me that you would be afraid that I would be out these last couple hours maybe spending money on things we hadn't already talked about.

67
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I've done it in the past, and I've kind of like been a bit in my head in the sand.

68
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Not wanting to look and not wanting to see and feel how great our financial situation is, it makes sense that you'd be afraid we've kind of been here before. And maybe you're afraid it's happening again. Now, that's me.

69
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what it is for you. Sunday.

70
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.890
I

71
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.650
Cynthia We: That's that for me.

72
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but that doesn't help.

73
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.460
I

74
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.400
Cynthia We: Guess I totally see how you

75
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Would feel, make sure you

76
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch the one to us. He was, he used the the the big boy feeling were too.

77
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Scared. Yeah.

78
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.940
Cynthia We: Yeah, I, I

79
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:33.090
Cynthia We: I can see how he would feel afraid that I was spending money, um,

80
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.270
Cynthia We: Because I because I've done it in the past.

81
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So Scott, do you look at her.

82
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.440
Cynthia We: Do you really

83
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know. I make it seem like it's so easy. Right. But, well, actually.

84
00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There's actual feelings behind all this stuff, but that's that's the heavy handed question here is, when you look at her. She said it. Do you believe what she just said.

85
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.410
Cynthia We: Yeah, well yeah I

86
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.050
Cynthia We: I believe

87
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now turn that to her and we won't

88
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.440
Cynthia We: Agree or disagree. I just know I don't know that.

89
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.670
Cynthia We: The level of sincerity. I don't know.

90
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.580
Cynthia We: What you're saying, and how it relates to us but um

91
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.970
Cynthia We: I don't think that would ever be said to me.

92
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.760
Cynthia We: Without being in front of you.

93
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. So do that again. No. Right. That's what makes this a little easier as I'm a bit of a buffer right I miss this median I'm this space where

94
00:08:51.240 --> 00:09:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's either this convenient pressure or it's also, I'm kind of a buffer so so Scott. See if you can do one more time and this time. Just don't break away and look right outer and say something like

95
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know all exactly your truth, but it sounds like there's a mixture, like I want to believe you, but I'm having a hard time believing it because you didn't already say it earlier or see what your truth is

96
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can tell her directly see because remember, you've got to rely on your life, being able to handle the truth. Otherwise this. We've got to see her as a full capable human being capable of handling your truth.

97
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:54.090
Cynthia We: I don't, I like what you're saying. I like that. That shows you that shows me that you

98
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.410
Cynthia We: That you recognize exactly what my fear is with this, but um

99
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.530
Cynthia We: I, I believe it's

100
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.790
Cynthia We: I don't believe it's sincere because

101
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.120
Cynthia We: You probably never

102
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.790
Cynthia We: Said, so that wants to me. So that, that's why I believe

103
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, stay there. That's a lot. Try. Are you still with us.

104
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.210
Cynthia We: Are you still with us. Yes, I am.

105
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay then. See if you can, you can even just mirror that just see if you can say back what he said. Just don't even have to do the validation just see, let me see if I got this rights get Scott

106
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then mirror back

107
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.600
Cynthia We: Let me see if I have this right you

108
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.200
Cynthia We: And you

109
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.660
Cynthia We: Like that I

110
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:56.220
Cynthia We: Said, when I said, But you don't necessarily believe me, because you don't think that I would ever say that if one wasn't sitting here.

111
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.460
Cynthia We: Didn't get that right. I get that right. Yeah, I don't believe you ever have said that

112
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.990
Cynthia We: Yes. You don't believe I ever have said that or no. Okay, I believe it's

113
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.050
It's a

114
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.220
Cynthia We: It's pretty much always an angry reaction when I say some

115
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

116
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Agree. Okay, don't look but but then there'll be a time when you don't. That's why we

117
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.020
Cynthia We: With fidelity.

118
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the marriage.

119
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, and there's more Scott I typically I meet I meet this with with anger. Right. You know, so sure that

120
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.500
Cynthia We: Well, I, I'm

121
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:55.350
Cynthia We: Not sure exactly what I think I was trying to say that I met with anger. Yes, whenever I do that rather than met with what you just said.

122
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.560
You got it right.

123
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.350
Cynthia We: And so

124
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.280
Cynthia We: Yes, you're totally right now.

125
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't want

126
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:06.870
Cynthia We: To say that

127
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: No you're not. Because there'll be times when you don't agree and you won't be able to be available to him that that phrasing. Right. It won't serve right now. I know that that seems very rigid of me.

128
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.690
Cynthia We: No, I totally get it.

129
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, breath deep breath. Just look at me. Let's go sit for a second. Cindy, just stay with me for a second. Deep breath.

130
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Who

131
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:29.910
All right.

132
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So all you're doing is containing that's all we're doing. We're just showing this person.

133
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you, my own stuff my own fear my own truth is not getting in the way of my ability to hear. That's what you're doing. And it's a real gift what you're doing for your sweetheart right now. It's a gift. It's very generous of you. Okay.

134
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It means while you're doing that.

135
00:12:55.830 --> 00:13:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You, your perspective isn't being shared. But you're being very generous and very loving when you do this to understand just listening is a difficult thing to do when everything in US rails against it and we want to say what about

136
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. What about what I'm going through. And if you remember we do get there. We do get there, but first we have to be heard. This is efficient. I know it seems like it's slow down, but it is efficient so deep breath.

137
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Go inside and do I love this man enough

138
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To show him. I can listen, do I love myself enough, right, that I can, I can hear someone else and not fall apart, not abandon myself. I am right I'm strong enough to hear someone else's perspective. I am a good person.

139
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I am a good person. I can hear someone else's perspective.

140
00:13:59.370 --> 00:13:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you breathing.

141
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.260
Cynthia We: No.

142
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.520
Okay, thanks. So

144
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:19.830
Okay.

145
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring that air into the

146
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Belly push those hands out

147
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: With that error is it reaches the bottom of the long just be present with your own experience breath.

148
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That all is possible, the brain works so much better when it has blood flow to it.

149
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So here right now. Cindy, are you

150
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So activated that it's hard to do this activity, or do you think you could do it.

151
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.810
Cynthia We: I think I can do it. Okay.

152
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So turn toward him

153
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may have forgotten because I

154
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:15.870
Cynthia We: Forgot what

155
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna do we're gonna do

156
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to do it again, it's the key word was anger.

157
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Got so just let her know one piece. And remember, we can only hold in our working memory. Just a couple little sentences. We can't hold too much. And so it's a real short and brief something, you know, around your truth but use that word angry.

158
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing, Cindy. Read in your belly.

159
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:53.130
Cynthia We: Other side. I think I was saying that I run back to the beginning. Like, I thought I I like what you said. I like that. I don't lose completely sincere. Because really, most of the time in the past, almost all the time in the past, maybe

160
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:54.900
I'm

161
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.490
Cynthia We: Not met with that it's met with anger.

162
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.440
Right, so I'm

163
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.330
Hear you correctly.

164
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.260
You

165
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:23.670
Cynthia We: Like what I said, but you don't believe that it's necessarily sincere, because in the past it's been met with anger, I think.

166
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I get that right.

167
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:25.920
Like that. Right.

168
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay, hold on. Stay there. So you keep looking. Keep looking at each other side from the coffee intake.

169
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there more

170
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.290
Cynthia We: Oh, yes. Is there more

171
00:16:45.480 --> 00:17:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Just on that point, just on that about her really getting this mixed experience both liking it and being conflicted inside around just, ah, something. It's not sincere it's it's maybe just in here with one of your here and does she get it.

172
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.040
Cynthia We: I don't know. I

173
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.500
Cynthia We: I want you to know where

174
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.060
Cynthia We: My behaviors are coming from, even if they're not

175
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.150
Cynthia We: You know the right way to do it. I'm not supposed to

176
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.450
Cynthia We: I don't want to be controlling or anything like that.

177
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.010
Cynthia We: Um, well, I'm feel

178
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.900
Cynthia We: A little helpless. If I'm not

179
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.470
Cynthia We: On top of it.

180
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.550
Cynthia We: This type

181
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.130
Cynthia We: And I don't feel I can

182
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.580
Cynthia We: Like this example makes me feel

183
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.280
Cynthia We: Helpless I can't turn to you.

184
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.810
Cynthia We: You know, I feel

185
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.480
Cynthia We: My fear.

186
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.600
Cynthia We: And because it's met with anger and then we fight.

187
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.930
Cynthia We: It's been happening for a long time.

188
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a lot to take in. It's hard to remember that. Let's see how she does. You got a little bit left in you. Before I flip it around.

189
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your breathing.

190
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.010
Yeah.

191
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you heard him. Let him know.

192
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I took some notes in case you forget

193
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.780
Cynthia We: Good cuz I was thinking as you're talking, it should be writing this down.

194
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.370
Cynthia We: A

195
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.890
Cynthia We: E i think that you said that

196
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.460
Cynthia We: You

197
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.270
Cynthia We: feel helpless and

198
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.360
Cynthia We: Like, like if you're not on top of things when we're this tight.

199
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.080
You feel helpless.

200
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.030
Cynthia We: And

201
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:08.670
Cynthia We: You don't want to fight, but if you bring it up it's met with anger from me and it's been happening for a long time.

202
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.280
Cynthia We: I'm

203
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just listen. And I can't turn to you.

204
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.060
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, and I can't turn to you.

205
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get that right, so that was a lot

206
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.760
Cynthia We: We do need to get that right, but there was another thing that I can't. Sorry.

207
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, he doesn't want to be controlling you know

208
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.890
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's the helplessness and sort of his awareness around that. So see, so check, see, did I get that right.

210
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.880
Cynthia We: Did I get that right. Yeah. And for the future. I have my notebook.

211
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Look,

212
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:43.890
Cynthia We: Like that, again,

213
00:19:44.550 --> 00:20:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot and you know we can say can say I want to, I want to hear all of it. Let me, let me, let me just stop you there. And let me see if I can reflect back what I heard. We can stop each other and say, right, I'm activated. It's hard for me to remember as much chunks of information.

214
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do that in a conversation, especially in here, right, because it's kind of contrived.

215
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

216
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Powerful stuff right

217
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:16.620
Now,

218
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you would be able to hear her.

219
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.500
Cynthia We: Yes. Okay.

220
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's just flip it around a little bit and no we didn't go all the way through this and we certainly didn't get into solution malicious, let's just, we're doing a little temperature reading here so

221
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy when you're this tight.

222
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When he calls you see that call coming in and right you're being right. You know what that call is I'm being checked up on what am I a little girl or something. You got to check on me. I can't be trusted. I don't know if that's the truth, but whatever is coming up for you.

223
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can own it.

224
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't have to agree, but he can hear it. I'm here, I can help with that. Right. I'm good at that. So he's going to hear you.

225
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if you're saying things you don't even like that you're doing, Cindy. It's good to say to own it. Okay, maybe we'll like what you have to say.

226
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's let's see what's coming up for you. So, as you heard him talking about, you know,

227
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to be controlling I feel helpless, especially when it's this tight but I feel like have to be on top of you making those calls and I don't want to be controlling, but I do it, and I can't turn to you so deep breath in the belly. Nice. Indeed.

228
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is very brave.

229
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you structure we have, we can rely on structure, we can say, I feel, or I felt when you said data right and he's going to mirror back I'm right here.

230
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.680
Cynthia We: Um, well, I feel terrible.

231
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.380
Okay.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell tell will go. I can't. Let's get clear on the feeling

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, hey, listen, shame on an option.

234

236
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:48.870

243
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.520

Cynthia We: And it just happened.

261
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.610

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.490
Cynthia We: On the shade.

285
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I feel ashamed that I i did this to us want you to look at it. This is the tender. This is the stuffs got when you're asking about anger. That's our puff up

286
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Armor. This is the, this is the stuff she's protecting from that's what anger. Does she doesn't have to feel this. So I feel a shame. So, do it again. You can look at him. You can do it. I believe in you.

287
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.060
Cynthia We: Shame when

288
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:47.730
When

289
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.090
Cynthia We: When you call and I know that both because I

290
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:08.760
Cynthia We: Because I'm the meeting naked. My head is that I've created this problem and

291
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.340
Cynthia We: And it's my own fault and

292
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let him say it back to you. Hold on. That's big narrow that back let her know, You heard that I heard you what you said.

293
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.230
Cynthia We: It makes you feel a shame.

294
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:37.290
Cynthia We: And it makes you feel like you've created this like it's all your fault. You made them feel

295
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You sure don't let one word even be often you don't don't waste your time. Make sure you get it just right there were some things that were off.

296
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:57.690
Cynthia We: I have no idea. I can't. My brain isn't working anymore.

297
00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay then. Let's preach it. Well, that's because right you've got this threat going on this fear response.

298
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because shame. That's no, honey. That's because shame has no interest in accountability. It just wants to annihilate you okay it's no good. It's unproductive. It really is it that's not real. You are lovable. Do you know that honey you

299
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have a gambling, you know, you could be an addict.

300
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have a gambling addiction, you can do all kinds of things you're still lovable somehow along the line you have forgotten this deep truth and you do not come back to you do not come back to. I'm enough

301
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Are forgivable but you don't ever get to frame that out.

302
00:29:54.150 --> 00:30:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've kind of forgive you. What we do to get past this shame thing is we take responsibility. I know it seems ironic, but only a strong person can sit with the fact that I participated in this. It doesn't mean you did all of it.

303
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: He did a part to it was complicity.

304
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The strength that he will give you by owning a little bit. You don't attack the whole self, you're still a good person.

305
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I work with people. If I thought you guys were all bad. I think you're amazing people who did the best you could

306
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys did the best you could

307
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.810
Shame has no space here. It doesn't belong

308
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it differently. Look at this man and say,

309
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: For whatever reason, I did it. My coming to learn why I did it.

310
00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so uncomfortable to own this truth. Tell him that, what's the experience of sitting with your part, tell him about that.

311
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just sit in this shame. No, tell him how hard this is to take responsibility.

312
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:19.140
Cynthia We: Is very hard possibility for this is admitting that I

313
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.520
Cynthia We: Like your own sometimes

314
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Say it again.

315
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:27.840
Say it again.

316
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.030
Cynthia We: But then I might

317
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.590
Cynthia We: It's so hard for me to even to say this.

318
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.140
Cynthia We: Because I have been

319
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.010
Cynthia We: A little bit irresponsible, sometimes with money.

320
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:50.070
Cynthia We: And

321
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.700
Cynthia We: I haven't

322
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.640
Cynthia We: Made

323
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.520
Cynthia We: Saving for times like this a priority always

324
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.800
Cynthia We: And it's just very, very, very uncomfortable because

325
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.630
Because

326
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:18.900
Cynthia We: Think

327
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:20.790
Cynthia We: You

328
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:27.960
Cynthia We: Assume that I'm always like that. But I'm always being responsible and I'm always frivolous.

329
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:29.640
Cynthia We: And I'm

330
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.920
Cynthia We: Not always.

331
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.360
Cynthia We: Your. That's what I want to say.

332
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, that's fine. It's just really complicated. That's fine. So we'll go back to a really easy way to to mirror

333
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.280
Cynthia We: To record.

334
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It. So come back to it. Go back. Let's get it nice and clean.

335
00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever the truth is I'm filling in the blanks. But you got to do yours. I feel uncomfortable right and

336
00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame gets activated when I think about, I've been irresponsible sometimes. Now you look at him and tell him the truth.

337
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.480
Cynthia We: So we'll

338
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can look at him. I know.

339
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.960
Cynthia We: Well, in one second.

340
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

341
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.500
Cynthia We: All right, look at him. I

342
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:14.100
Feel

343
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:23.070
Cynthia We: really uncomfortable and I'm the same gets activated when

344
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:32.040
Cynthia We: I have to. When I think about my that I have an irresponsible, sometimes with money and

345
00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.260
That all is

346
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. Now stop right there you go with each other. Just look at each other for a second, just look just I know nobody's saying anything more. Just look and be with that giggle right

347
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:57.060
Cynthia We: Let's look. That was a sarcastic giggle. So I don't like is not a giggle funny giggle. I know that he's laughing because he does believe that I'm always irresponsible money.

348
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, that seed know that's that's a that's that is literally the reason why you can't sit with this discomfort. You have made up this story.

349
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.590
Cynthia We: I currently have a story in my head today.

350
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But Cindy that that's your internal

351
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So check it out. You ready. So you're going to check out your assumptions. So it'll be a sweetheart, or however, Scott.

352
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that I'm always here responsible. Now, that's one of yours version go inside and ask your question. This is choosing curiosity over being right.

353
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or choosing curiosity over being wrong right now. It happens to be choosing curiosity over shame activation. So choose it. It's a skill. He got to grab it. This is it used

354
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: For us.

355
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.450
Cynthia We: To think that I'm always irresponsible.

356
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Always it's unlikely. It's inhuman

357
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.170
Well,

358
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, Scott just looked at me and I'm like, it's unlikely.

359
00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:18.600
Cynthia We: Responsible with money 97.5% of the time.

360
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.940
Cynthia We: Oh no, I don't believe you're always responsible plan. Hopefully your

361
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Money 97%. Okay, what percent do you think she's made choices. You wouldn't have made.

362
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: 5% 94

363
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, come on.

364
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.490
It's just money.

365
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.690
Cynthia We: I would say, I don't know.

366
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.430
75 80% maybe

367
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you think is it as bad as you thought or worse than you.

368
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.870
Cynthia We: Know it's not as bad as I thought.

369
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you assess yourself as having made decisions that weren't thought through that were more about retail therapy or staying in denial, not wanting to visit the shame, not wanting to look at the meaning of money, not wanting to look at it in yourself. How did you assess

370
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.560
Cynthia We: 30% of the

371
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: 30% you're irresponsible, is that right yeah 33% response so there's there's a bit of a disconnect

372
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so then it makes sense.

373
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It does make sense that there would be this call.

374
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it's off by, you know, let's say it's 50 it's it's off by quite a bit tough, but what is the question that that's how much you

375
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.630
Cynthia We: Feel you are responsible for how much we disagree on this.

376
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:55.740
Cynthia We: How much I feel I've been irresponsible where I just not thinking about it, or you know, bought something

377
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: 30%

378
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.810
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, because I wanted or or didn't buy the cheapest item.

379
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and so it's off by about 50, let's say, just to make the madness, yours is about 80% of the time and if, but it's not 97.5 right. It's not that it's not as bad as you thought. But if you didn't think of money. As you know, we never did do this this activity together as if it was

380
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Who you are, you know,

381
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A status piece if it was more like sometimes we have a good job job doesn't define me. Sometimes we have more money than other times this time right now kind of sucks. It was just that benign, but I don't know what meaning it is for you to why haven't been able to find out.

382
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.640
Cynthia We: Are there.

383
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we're gonna stay focused here because we've done a lot to get to this point.

384
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because honestly, the it'll all unravel. You guys have done budgets before, but this is this 50% is huge. It keeps meaning to you, Cindy, that when he calls

385
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It saying to you. You don't trust me. And frankly, I kind of don't trust myself in some ways, right, and you never will. If that's the meaning that it has

386
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This is unlikely to flow any differently than has. But if you say to yourself, Well, just on one side. You guys didn't do this. You didn't ask for things you wanted. But let's say

387
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You do decide to, let's say, Cindy. You say, Well, I'm going to do my part. And I'm going to change the meaning that those calls have and

388
00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm going to do is I'm going to say I'm taking care of your fear, Scott. You are afraid I'm going to me to say it out loud.

389
00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming this call means you're kind of worried that I'm spending money that we hadn't already talked about.

390
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And as uncomfortable as it is to to explain myself. I'm going to tell you what I'm doing right now because I love you. And because you've told me you were afraid.

391
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And right we're off. I see myself as 30 you see my son see me as about 80% so I'm going to tell you, but I want you to also know I feel a little defensive

392
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But why can't that be the case, why can't that be the call for a while until it starts to change because it doesn't mean it's going to be like that forever. Instead of

393
00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever the blast of anger is, I don't know how how it goes. But I know what defensiveness is I'm familiar with that terrain, um,

394
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. Now let's do because here we are at this the top of this hour, a little bit of time left. Let's see if we can get some behavior request from each other. You ready

395
00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

396
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott start with you will take take the pressure off. You send you'd be thinking about what you want your behavior request.

397
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So Scott, um, it's unlikely that your assumption about her money management is likely to change miraculously after talking today, right.

398
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's probably going to be around 80% and what what behavior request. Would you ask of her

399
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do your due diligence and you're calling and checking on her. What would you want her to do a little differently.

400
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So that it doesn't turn into an argument or what would feel watch this reassuring to that fear from which it is resource that's why you're calling. What would bring the fear down. Could you hear her say when you're calling her that would de escalate your fear.

401
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What could you hear

402
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll have to believe it. Right. I mean, you'll have to believe it. Or maybe there's something you want to see.

403
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.820
Cynthia We: I don't know how if you could somehow

404
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.080
Cynthia We: Well, first of all, not assume

405
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.150
Cynthia We: That I'm angry or

406
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.620
Cynthia We: Meaning to be controlling

407
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, those are hard. Let's get this flip it around. It's, I know this sounds really crazy, but you won't be able to measure what she's not doing. We won't be able to measure her mind. But what we can do is we can hear tone. We can hear content, we can hear.

408
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just you know how we're talking now this nice sort of processing. It's this nice rhythm. It's not really loud and see my voice goes up, and it goes down. I'm sorry, like this.

409
00:41:47.040 --> 00:42:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's this what is prosody. Is this nice up and down flow of my voice and it's the volume isn't really high and the, the speed hasn't paste quickly or I haven't given you, you sort of the silent treatment gotten quiet so now

410
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to hear. There'll be an indication that your wife is not defensive. Right. What will you hear what we notice in the way that she is speaking to what we notice your job will be to notice that she's doing this behavior change. But what do you want

411
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But we'll be there in the call.

412
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.170
Cynthia We: I want you to stay, you're not at all.

413
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:32.490
Cynthia We: Kidding. You just say I I think just the tone. If it, if it

414
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.980
Cynthia We: wasn't an immediate

415
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.320
Cynthia We: Like need your

416
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.410
Cynthia We: Um,

417
00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.210
I'll catch it since last

418
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:51.420
Cynthia We: Angry, fast, fast know like an assuming, like so slow like quieter slower.

419
00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.010
Cynthia We: Um,

420
00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.980
Cynthia We: It's it's a it's a weird conundrum, because I don't want her to assume that I'm calling

421
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you are you

422
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're gonna have to own the fact that you're calling because you are suspicious.

423
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:16.830
Cynthia We: I guess. Yeah, I don't know why I call because I'm not going to solve anything. I'm only going

424
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.650
Cynthia We: To remind me. Yeah, I just, just a reminder. Yeah.

425
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.080
Cynthia We: I guess so. And that's annoying. I totally understand.

426
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But let me do my job. Let me do my job. Stick with me. Keep it simple.

427
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how I caught you. We can't do anything your intense going to be there. Like I said that 80% of going anywhere. We've already said it's there, you're going to make the call right now it's just for now. That's going to be the deal. So what you're asking for is

428
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: She says hi

429
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.500
And then what

430
00:43:54.690 --> 00:44:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she say first of all, she's gonna I we you know when it's not a defensive, blah, blah, blah. But we can have her not assume that you're calling to teach it, you are checking or so there's no shame in either one of you so

431
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:15.030
Cynthia We: I don't know.

432
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We're almost there. Scott, I won't

433
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.470
Cynthia We: Know that I'm calling out

434
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:21.480
Cynthia We: Here.

435
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. Now, we now. There we go. So, so watch

436
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what you're asking for is this Sydney

437
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you

438
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Just answer my direct question. So if I asked you, where are you just answer the content just content. Don't go process. We already know I'm going to be checking in out of fear, sometimes just answer process up answer content question, hey. Hey, Cindy. Where are you, which up to

439
00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.340
Cynthia We: I'm going to do, Max.

440
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

441
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we're going to get to the behavior question on the flip side, too. But for now.

442
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If what you're asking for Scott, if we're not playing games anymore. And there are going to be times when you're going to be checking right to see what she's doing.

443
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what I'm not sure.

444
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:34.470
Cynthia We: No, no, I'm just thinking, we've gotten on this call thing is that okay then that happens. But most of the time it's just like I enquire when we're at home and stuff like

445
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That

446
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:39.870
Cynthia We: I just thought of a call thing because I i did it once recently and

447
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.480
Cynthia We: And that sounds really controlling

448
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get distracted by that we already agreed, you have a disparity of let's get into that, let's let's see some change for a little while. Let's look

449
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: At a little later. So right now, let's see what happens if we if we both of you just rattle off.

450
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're not supposed to be this way. I'm not supposed to be this controlling guy, and I'm not supposed to be the spending person who gives a shit.

451
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what we've got. This is what we are, let's just let's shake it up a little bit. Okay. We don't need any of the shaman here unproductive. So, um,

452
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get clear. Okay, back in the house now it's good morning or high on em coming home from work and

453
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What is likely if no longer you're embarrassed or trying to hide the fact that you want to check

454
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: On your 80% concerned if you don't pretend like it's something else. If you know give yourself permission to be a be scared you are scared. So, don't, don't be afraid of that. And then you can say, hey,

455
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Will oh did you spend any extra money today.

456
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, right, if you're honest with yourself. What's the real question you want to ask when you see her.

457
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.730
How I'm doing

458
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want that, but

459
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're an 80% concern right

460
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:08.880
Cynthia We: On the same page.

461
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we saw, so you might see her. Are we still on the same page. Is that right,

462
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that something he might say,

463
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.490
Cynthia We: I would love that because there's a question.

464
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Relevant function.

465
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

466
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:31.200
Cynthia We: No.

467
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:50.850
Cynthia We: I, I believe you would take that question and make it doesn't matter what what you think I will. This is what usually happens if I make an effort to to ask question nicely about it, it doesn't really stop the shame or stuff.

468
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.970
Cynthia We: Right. Doesn't matter if you think you believe

469
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.280
Cynthia We: You believe you believe I'm being snide or sarcastic.

470
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Then why hide it in this diversity of are we on the same page. I mean, if that's what you guys want to do but but to me, if we've already said, Look at how different he said 80% he's he's worried a lot more than you are. And that's just real

471
00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: He's more worried about it, then you are okay. You have a lot more confidence about it. Then he does. That's real. It's not good. It's not bad it is. So why do we have to dance around it. Why do we have to be are we on the same page that's even a little fuzzy. How about

472
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you stick with the budget today.

473
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.630
Or was it whole.

474
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm just, I'm just saying.

475
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

476
00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it hot or or or maybe the give a shit level could be sorry about the language.

477
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.470
Cynthia We: Time the

478
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the give us boom give a string could be

479
00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The care part is with with sticking to the budget hard today we able to do it my fears coming up. I was thinking about these other bills came in. I saw him on the table and

480
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, I have this wave of it while while I was driving past, blah, blah, blah. See, Scott. That would be your truth. And that's not a dance. That's not a are we on the same page. That's exactly that's

481
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I had this thing happen when I saw Joe, I started to think about this. And then I went by the school and this happened and I started to to get my head about my fear.

482
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, were you able to stay in the budget. I just need some reassurance. Now, isn't that direct that seems like that's a direct communication, but do you have that ability to know yourself well enough Scott did

483
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That you could communicate that directly to her, not even whether that's something she wants to hear but

484
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:45.840
Cynthia We: I think

485
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:55.470
Cynthia We: I think I do. I think I communicate directly a lot about that. And I don't think it has a good consequences. Okay.

486
00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:07.230
Cynthia We: If I, if I say I mean I've done the whole gamut. I've done the soft and mushy thing. And I've done, I've done did. You did. Did we able to stick to the budget today.

487
00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.310
Cynthia We: But, but

488
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:08.610
It.

489
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So, so I saw something happened city so I'm talking really fast because I'm trying to make sure we get it all done there. Sure. So Cindy, no matter what he says, you're going to get activated. Has that been the past

490
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so once you let's flip it around. I'll come back to fine tuning. What he wants from you. How do you want it delivered so that we can move forward.

491
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, because he's trying to

492
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:41.670
Cynthia We: Know that I want it delivered in a certain way. It's that I want a

493
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:52.650
Cynthia We: A guy, a guy I, how am I supposed to stick to a budget that I don't have like i don't i don't know what the budget is it spend zero money.

494
00:50:54.060 --> 00:51:01.350
Cynthia We: Right now, like Spend your own money. And so, no. I never spoke to the budget because I can't spend zero money. Okay. All right.

495
00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, this is a is a funky time right now.

496
00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

497
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:06.780
Cynthia We: Worse than usual. Yeah.

498
00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:17.940
Cynthia We: My first thing I'm spend zero and yeah I it's impossible. But what that means is spend minimal

499
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:24.480
Cynthia We: Spend. I mean, yes, we need a budget. We've had budgets in the past, and we want to

500
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.850
Cynthia We: Really attack this new budget new way of thinking. Now again, but

501
00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:39.300
Cynthia We: You shoot you always say, What am I supposed to do. We don't have a budget. Well, you still kind of know the situation right so I

502
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:42.360
Cynthia We: I don't think it's fair to say

503
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.060
Cynthia We: How can I overspend when there's no budget.

504
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.070
Cynthia We: I think that's an excuse

505
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:51.540
Cynthia We: Oh,

506
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:58.350
Cynthia We: That, that, like, and you always point the finger at me to be the one that's supposed to make the budget.

507
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.990
Cynthia We: And since I did make a budget.

508
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:04.110
Cynthia We: Then you're, you're not responsible

509
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.000
Cynthia We: So it feels like

510
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, that's an important one. And remember we've got this finite amount of time, we still need to make this larger. There's no doubt, and I still got this this worksheet that I started here with you too.

511
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's the stick to it part. That's the one that we're addressing today. We've worked a little bit on the budget before now we're working on that. How are we going to stick with it are the emotions that are behind it. The

512
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning means to us how it affects our ego strength, you know, the shame activation and each of you has your own story about it.

513
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, magically, what do I wish you guys could do. I wish you guys could get this budget written because you don't need me for you've done these things before you write the budget and and Cindy, you don't abandon yourself and you stay in your truth.

514
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: He's right. You stay stay there with it.

515
00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you have a question.

516
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That you ask and Scott, of course, you, you no longer would have access to. I don't know how you respond, but it can't be shaming can't be blaming. We can't crank up anger or whatever. We've got to just say, Okay, we're just going to cold right out what's needed

517
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reality. Scott is you're going to have fear that she is spending more than what you have

518
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's not going to go anywhere, anytime soon. It may over time.

519
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But not right away and Cindy, you can acknowledge that and say,

520
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you kind of scared that I'm spending money.

521
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You could do you know that you could do that instead of being defensive. You could care. This is where the care that level of

522
00:53:52.290 --> 00:54:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, is this one of those moments, you're, you're concerned that I've been. I've been. I've been gone for a little while and I've been spending money and then Scott, you would say, Well, yeah.

523
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no shame. There's no defending against the truth because the truth is, you're not as preoccupied as he is with it. He just is thinking about it. About 50% more of the time. It's just the truth.

524
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys are looking at it differently.

525
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Not good, not bad, just is. So he's burdened with thinking about it more, well then how about we care and we say, yeah, you

526
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're thinking about it more than I do. I get that. And I don't want you to be in fear. So I'm not ashamed and I'm going to tell you

527
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm doing I'm using this technique that one of your taught me and I I put this pink sweater in front of me and I look at this

528
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: $35 and I think I need this $35 and I just put the stuff away or I drive past the market or whatever.

529
00:54:50.430 --> 00:55:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't defend against it. You're taking care of his feelings at that time. And what that's doing for you, Cindy is saying, I don't have anything to be ashamed of this nothing to defend. I don't think about it as often his. He does just, I just don't know. Bad for it.

530
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Mm hmm.

531
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see where we're at. I haven't heard what you want because you did go oh earlier with the are we on the same page in his, his delivery really that relevant is the way he delivers it really going to make the difference. No.

532
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:29.460
Okay.

533
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.120
Cynthia We: Because I'm always gonna know that

534
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: He does.

535
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:39.780
Cynthia We: Trying to

536
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:45.840
Cynthia We: Ask me about it in a sneaky way. What was your always told me

537
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:52.380
Cynthia We: You always told me, but you don't say it like that. You want to be such I know you said

538
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You do want it delivered a particular way.

539
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.190
Cynthia We: I do. Yeah, I guess I just don't know what that is.

540
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.470
Cynthia We: But, and I asked you how do you, how do you want me to say I even asked you how would a good husband say

541
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.650
Cynthia We: You know and i mean

542
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't you just try it my way. Why don't you take the heat off and just say, here's the new thing start you'll say, I'm feeling worried about money right now. Can I check in. If you spend any any extra money.

543
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's one of yours idea and then you get to hate on me when we meet again that sucked. One of your, your way made I got defensive and you want you can blame me for it. I don't have any

544
00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll go under the bus plenty of tread marks on this face. Okay, so what's it going to be so we thought if we go for this then. Then we're going to have it flip real quick so got just a tiny bit of time. It's not are you willing to say, you may want to write this down.

545
00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.340
Cynthia We: I've written it down for him well.

546
00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel, and it can be any of the cousins of fear, I feel nervous, anxious, afraid scared.

547
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Today right now. Can I ask you about

548
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Spending money. How much money you spent

549
00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And if he does that, Cindy. The commitment on your part is

550
00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Say to yourself.

551
00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:27.480
I am good enough.

552
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:29.700
And

553
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What you say out loud is, let me think.

554
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I spent money on coffee I put money. I put some gas and put about 10 bucks in car and picked up about 30 bucks and groceries its content that's content data. He's asking for data didn't say, how do you feel about my asking you.

555
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You're taking care of your own feelings by saying to yourself, I am good enough. I am worthy. I am capable of answering this question, I hold on to myself. Okay. This is the hard work. You've got to be able to be okay with the fact that

556
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He just he worries about it more than you go

557
00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.580
Cynthia We: Okay, this is good. This happened.

558
00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:28.560
Cynthia We: Yesterday,

559
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.550
Cynthia We: Um, let's welcome healthy groceries.

560
00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:37.470
And I asked.

561
00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.440
Cynthia We: Was like, Whoa, you went to Trader Joe's again.

562
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.420
Cynthia We: And I'm

563
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.780
Cynthia We: Casually Whoa, your changes again.

564
00:58:48.210 --> 00:59:00.450
Cynthia We: Because it's like you know you need to you. The main grocery trip. And then you do a couple supplementals here or there, and I'm always worried about the supplementals but uh, sorry, like, Oh, you went to take those again and again and

565
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.670
Cynthia We: And she said, well, I was I side or stressed and

566
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:11.280
Cynthia We: She said, Oh, I spent $25 I bought it at all like four things. I spent $25

567
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:14.010
Cynthia We: And that

568
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:16.860
Cynthia We: Was fine that was

569
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:21.420
Cynthia We: Fine. However, it was 33

570
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.220
Cynthia We: However,

571
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:28.290
Cynthia We: No, it was like 59 wasn't

572
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:44.340
Cynthia We: That was the last time I went so so do. Right. So either way, we don't have to school. I mean, we don't, we're not supposed to pull out her phone and look at how much you're spending now, right, because I because he was no no no.

573
00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:49.350
Cynthia We: I'm not okay. So it's three. But my point is, are you

574
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.220
Cynthia We: Okay. All right, then. Did you bend it

575
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.790
Cynthia We: To try and calm his nerves.

576
00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:57.930
I understand.

577
00:59:59.250 --> 00:59:59.700
Cynthia We: It's always

578
00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. He's responsible for his nerves, the same way. I'm asking you to run the belief system of us. I'm good enough to actually tell him. You don't have to question the fact that you you need, you do the shopping. Okay, so then you you picked up food that's the deal. That's the deal.

579
01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. That's how much was spent. That's a fact. You're hiding it. And in some way.

580
01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:21.450
Cynthia We: Yeah.

581
01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's some other mess later on.

582
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:25.020
Cynthia We: If

583
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're good enough.

584
01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Sandy, then it was $60 okay the budget part that's a conversation that still needs to happen is is mac and cheese on the menu where maybe when you guys were bringing in you know $7,000 a month mac and cheese wasn't on the menu. Maybe it is now.

585
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. This is stuff that that's budget stuff we're doing process things in here. So let's let's read, let's review real quick because I'm a little pressed for time I got someone knocking at the door. Listen here.

586
01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott are you willing to say, not this. Not that one. Not the passive, not the sneaky when you went to Trader Joe's. Again, not the sneaky sneaky now not this okay but maybe you were trying to be nice. Now we're both agreeing, it's going to be. I feel anxious. I'm thinking about money.

587
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you how much money did you spend today. What if it's just that. What if it's it's straight up.

588
01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: How much money just send it and then Cindy, you go, Okay, yeah, I've been I I kind of figured you'd be asking that, because we talked to, when you think about money. Hold up, I died. Okay. And I gotta break. Give me a second.

589
01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta collect yourself never

590
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I spent about 50 bucks.

591
01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's content, but you're not going to be able to get there, sending if you think you've got it placate him and try and keep his feelings keep him calm.

592
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Which we still need to do the budget, we do.

593
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see if I get this right.

594
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got her behavior request here now checking checking in with you, Cindy. If he does it this way. Do you think you could take it in as this is him speaking his truth. He's registering has 80% which is 50% more than what you kind of think about it.

595
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you want from him. Let's real quick at this one. What behavior request, you're going to do your part. Okay, um,

596
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, the other way around. What do you want her to do.

597
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott, you're going to say I feel kind of nervous and anxious about money on how much did you spend today. And now what behavior request you want from her. See if you can make it sustained notice it's an is not what's missing, what is, what do you want to hear her say and do real quick.

598
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.620
Cynthia We: Mood and tone or or be

599
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Standing there you're asking for content. You asked for a number

600
01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:13.890
Cynthia We: You want I want to, I want you to just to be honest with me not to bend the truth okay i and not to be honest, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this. I don't want you to go to shame thing and be frustrated with my question.

601
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Yeah, I want you to

602
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.650
Cynthia We: Have this without sending you the shame somehow

603
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to meet you here, right, because you're being correct you're courageous enough to say I feel nervous and anxious about money and you're directly communicating that maybe what you want from her is the same.

604
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll give an actual data response and maybe what you're asking for. And maybe this is what you could do, that's just equal is to say, and you could say, and I feel a little ashame activation

605
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: As I tell you now. I spent $65 and I spent about 15 more than I think we agreed on. And this is this is hard for me to talk about

606
01:03:59.010 --> 01:03:59.400
Right.

607
01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but

608
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.030
Cynthia We: That would probably I mean I'm you know

609
01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:16.560
Cynthia We: Is it still the overspending thing, but I think I would accept it differently than your defiance. I spent what I spent what we needed to kind of thing.

610
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

611
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:19.380
Cynthia We: Go would react differently.

612
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there's no getting around right now is a very unique time y'all. Right. It's just there's just this DVD resource. So I think we need to get into is

613
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you afford Trader Joes. Is this where you're shopping needs to be right now is this. This is where you guys are going to go. This is where it needs to be.

614
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:51.570
Cynthia We: I believe Trader Joe's is a she believes Trader Joe's is the most expensive grocery store. Yeah, well, I don't believe it's the most expensive. That would be whole foods are natural grocers, but

615
01:04:52.350 --> 01:05:00.990
Cynthia We: But I do believe that there are some I've met her. I mean, she's really taught me a lot about organic and eating better

616
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:17.340
Cynthia We: Yeah, spending wiser on uncertain stuff. And I do believe there's a way to economic be do some of that. But now all of it. I do believe that sometimes you have to sacrifice some of the special stuff. Some of the 699 stuff for tonight and stuff.

617
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:37.500
Cynthia We: That means more Smith more time comically shopping at Smiths. Yeah, I'm okay, that I think will survive that month of tightness without eating all that stuff. And I don't and I, it doesn't feel like she's willing to give him. It's not never going to go back to non organic

618
01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:39.540
Like

619
01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So notice how right it's really, it's thick. It's like, well, well, maybe the shopping trip, just for this month is going to look like this, it's going to be, what are we willing to compromise because there's an urgent, so we might sacrifice for a month, we might sacrifice, you know, the

620
01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:59.820
Cynthia We: Organic I sacrifice all organic. Last time I grocery shop.

621
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.230
Cynthia We: I didn't buy any organic unless it was only 30 cents more

622
01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.440
Cynthia We: I just a couple

623
01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

624
01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.920
Cynthia We: Literally I bought on organic eggs I bought an organic sour cream.

625
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:31.320
Cynthia We: Kind of cheese. Do you believe you. I know the answer this. But you believe like if I was shopping and I got everything on our list, the same list that would save some money.

626
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.010
Cynthia We: And how do you believe I would do that. I believe that you would spend the time to go to the grocery store.

627
01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:50.880
Cynthia We: So you leave us. Yes, I believe that you would use your coupons and you would be gone for three hours at Smiths and Trader Joe's. And wherever you needed to go to get the items cheapest

628
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you don't want to spend the time

629
01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:55.560
Cynthia We: I don't want to spend the time

630
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You went shopping this month.

631
01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:07.200
Cynthia We: I believe he should be shopping while he's on you know I don't when it when I'm off, off, off, which isn't now so I'm still working every day.

632
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:16.650
Cynthia We: When I'm off off. I don't mind doing that, but then I can actually enjoy doing it sometimes because it's probably more control.

633
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:24.090
Cynthia We: But what I want to totally not have to do that in order for us to stay in a budget.

634
01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.650
Cynthia We: I think what

635
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.020
Cynthia We: We'll get there. I just need a budget.

636
01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

637
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we do here.

638
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:41.940
Cynthia We: Because then it feels like when I started shopping all the time, it started to meld into this thing of, that was another controlling behavior or

639
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.630
Somehow

640
01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:54.660
Cynthia We: Use a little bit, but that's because I didn't feel that at all. I prefer to shop I rather not. Okay. But that includes making decisions.

641
01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know what's real. I don't know whether there really is this assumption, right, that thing that just got really lot of mind reading right in there. So she she's saying, I prefer you chop. Let's just take a small chunk licious. But you guys are in this really tight, tight bond.

642
01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, just, just for today. How do you want today to go. How much money is available, what's needed today. What do we got going on here because y'all are like rolling in, with little pieces of money. I thought you got $1,000 something came in and finally

643
01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:28.380
Cynthia We: It did. And then he didn't pay him this week.

644
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:34.500
Cynthia We: This guy's a bad, bad situation but um

645
01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you something. You guys are handling better than a lot of

646
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Crap.

647
01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:50.460
Cynthia We: Man, I think that they actually really pissed him off. It's upsetting to me because he's a friend of mine, so it never probably never should enter this anyway.

648
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:57.030
Cynthia We: But it's always been a nice casual thing to do when I'm off because I usually make a ton of money when I'm working. And then if I'm off for two months.

649
01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:07.770
Cynthia We: It's nice to do something and just have a little something coming in here, there, and it's not, it shouldn't be something we totally rely on. We don't want a personal position anymore. But now we're

650
01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:15.060
Cynthia We: Relying on it when we need every penny. So it matters if I get that little check from him every week and

651
01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: include that in the context right now. There's so many friends and oh, do we want to do this.

652
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's pretty dire straits. So now, you told me. Eventually, they are going to come through. So

653
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:41.490
Cynthia We: It may have. Okay, now here we are again. But if I believe that they're going to screw me in this state town. Well, then that would be different thing. But I've always believed. I know.

654
01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:51.960
Cynthia We: That you can know that it's going to come. They're going to payment and even if they screw up and they're jerks and they can be late. It's there. And in a warped way it's money in the bank.

655
01:09:52.800 --> 01:10:03.510
Cynthia We: Okay, but um and I also don't want to stand up and say, You guys, I'm done. Because I screwed that relationship, not only because it's a friendship, but also it's a nice thing to have.

656
01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to problem solving today. Yeah, and I feel the same reassurance. I felt from Cindy, they're going to pay you. So what are we doing for today. What do we got for today.

657
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there food in the house, plenty of food in the house. Okay, so no shopping need it just any money needs to be spent today.

658
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you spend it on

659
01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:30.270
Cynthia We: That we don't have dinner. We don't have dinner because I gross yourself up because

660
01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.110
Cynthia We: What's up, but we got chicken and

661
01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:35.640
Cynthia We: Pasta and okay

662
01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So chicken pasta some

663
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:44.520
Cynthia We: Chicken do the past two years ago. Let's have a chicken dinner. We have tons of sure Scott. That sounds delicious. Oh.

664
01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:45.810
Cynthia We: Well, I bought

682
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't, in and of itself doesn't have any meaning you are lovable and good enough. If you're eating pasta five days out of the week, you just are

687
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to play in here and what can we do not going to get hung up on how this looks. And materialistic and image and all of that.

Gwenevere Abriel: I want to check in on potential vulnerability. How many times has the thought crate crafted and has the voice of addiction come in and said you could go score.

801
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:35.850
Sugey’s iPhones: Um,

802
01:24:37.170 --> 01:24:49.500
Sugey’s iPhones: I will honestly and I not being honest. I think I'm past that point, I, I just look back at everything that it ruined and it just doesn't

803
01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:57.810
Sugey’s iPhones: I don't crave it. I don't care for it. I think it was just like something I I realized I got into

804
01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:16.260
Sugey’s iPhones: That was totally that wasn't me. I have never used drugs. I HAD NEVER ABUSED alcohol never not never done anything I've never smoked. So I think it was something that I, I don't think I would. I hope not. And I don't think I would go back to

805
01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:17.490
Sugey’s iPhones: So I hope

806
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:19.260
Sugey’s iPhones: That hasn't crossed my mind so far.

807
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got zero

808
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:25.050
Sugey’s iPhones: So forth zero okay and your yes

809
01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:27.510
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm sorry.

810
01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: How many milligrams

811
01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:30.660
Sugey’s iPhones: So 7.5

812
01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:40.680
Sugey’s iPhones: So before, though, like at the beginning of this when I was working with them for that. Um, I forgot. During

813
01:25:41.700 --> 01:26:03.720
Sugey’s iPhones: Um, what that used to happen like at the beginning where it was like, oh, you know, I sometimes I'd be like, so stressed or with everything that it cause I'm like, I could just work out if I go, you know, by some pills and I'll be all good. But now, no. Oh, now I think I've come to four. Okay.

814
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get stressed, what do you do instead

815
01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:21.060
Sugey’s iPhones: What I started taking a Toshi class, really. Yes. And that has helped me so much. Oh my god, at least for that hour and a half.

816
01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:31.770
Sugey’s iPhones: My mind is clear because I'm trying to learn this and and it's so awesome, because it feels so good so that

817
01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.820
Sugey’s iPhones: How many guys help

818
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing that.

819
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:35.820
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm doing that twice a week.

820
01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.920
Sugey’s iPhones: Twice a week. Yes, Mondays and Wednesdays and

821
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:48.510
Sugey’s iPhones: I've been doing that for a month. So this month that has helped me before that.

822
01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:50.790
Sugey’s iPhones: I started a journal

823
01:26:52.140 --> 01:27:05.130
Sugey’s iPhones: I started a journal and so anytime I really like can't can't focus or something's bothering me. Or it's catching up to me, I write it down. Write it down. And I kind of feel like the event.

824
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.530
Sugey’s iPhones: Um,

825
01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:14.940
Sugey’s iPhones: Before that I was doing meditation. So now I would, I did.

826
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.620
Sugey’s iPhones: It as a coach.

827
01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:19.260
Sugey’s iPhones: I do mindfulness

828
01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.170
Sugey’s iPhones: Mindfulness so yeah it's helped me a lot.

829
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:37.890
Sugey’s iPhones: And that was one of the problems I had before, not, not knowing how to manage stressful situations, other than taking a pill.

830
01:27:41.190 --> 01:27:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking in here. We haven't worked together much so.

831
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.890
Sugey’s iPhones: What we've done and what we haven't done

832
01:27:53.910 --> 01:28:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you receive formal instruction on that diet dramatic breathing already. Do you know how to do that.

833
01:28:04.170 --> 01:28:10.590
Sugey’s iPhones: Um, I think we did it a little bit last time, but honestly not not enough to where I could say

834
01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:13.260
Sugey’s iPhones: I know how. Okay.

835
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to go over that with you.

836
01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's one of those things that

837
01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It tends to be the one thing that people, when they walk away from treatment here.

838
01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:26.910
Sugey’s iPhones: Mm hmm.

839
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's their coping skill that's

840
01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:31.680
Sugey’s iPhones: That's the one.

841
01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're anxious and

842
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It can in a lot of ways. It depends on the type of meditation, but you might think of it as a still a top down intervention, we are still asking the mind to do something.

843
01:28:45.210 --> 01:28:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where, whereas the box breathing. Whoops.

844
01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:49.980
Hopefully you'll come back.

845
01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got you back.

846
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me.

847
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, yeah, I got you.

848
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:15.600
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay, good. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened.

849
01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to teach you this box breathing.

850
01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not a natural breath. So it's one of these things where I'm going to kind of tell you about the science behind it. Then I'm going to teach it to you. I'll model it and then we'll do it together. And then you can do it on your own.

851
01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:35.100
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay.

852
01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So the basic philosophy behind it is I was talking a little bit. I think as you were logging out was mindfulness practices and meditation can still be a top down intervention which means we're still sort of working with the mind up here.

853
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Was this is working bottom up, which means we're using our organs to send a message to the brain. We're okay.

854
01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what this one is. Okay, so it's not

855
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is just biology working on

856
01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: On your behalf right now so you don't have to actually believe it, you can think it's silly and it can still work.

857
01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.000
Sugey’s iPhones: No, I believe it, though.

858
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.540
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah.

859
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, I mean you're doing meditation and your yeah so

860
01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:26.700
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah. And before I was the type of person that didn't believe in. I was like, oh my god, why, how could that how

861
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This in order to really get this though, I can see by the way you're seated, it's going to be really hard. So let's, you're going to need to be able to get your air on this desk, you're going to need the air on the bottom of the long and you can't do it when you're scrunched over

862
01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: With you a little space here. Now of course you can be. You can do the the lazy boy post when you are sitting down in let's say you were

863
01:32:54.060 --> 01:33:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Seated you could do this. And you could pull your hands back like you were on a lazy boy, you could kind of pull your hands back and and you'd have expanded chest. That's one.

864
01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:04.020
Sugey’s iPhones: You could

865
01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Be seated and you can be sitting up right you can tuck your hands underneath your thighs, put it there. And if you're standing. You can do this sort of super, super one. Oh, Superwoman, or Wonder Woman and kind of put it bit on your on your hips to open up in this chest but

866
01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: In that basic instruction. It doesn't mean that you can't be laying in bed and doing this breathing.

867
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me talk about the science behind it for a second. So we've got got some basic positions, you do want to have this chest open because the whole idea is you're going to be basically you'll be breathing in.

868
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Through the nose and you'll be pulling this this diaphragm damn will be expanding the belly and what is happening when you're doing that when that air goes down in here. So watch. I'm going to inhale and you keep an eye on my shoulders. You're going to see when I do it.

869
01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You barely know that I just inhaled right

870
01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's happening I'm expanding the air down at the bottom. I love when I don't do that.

871
01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I created a high. Yeah, you can see my shoulders moving. So you really want with fidelity to

872
01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: To push those hands away from your belly expand that belly. It's a hard thing to do. It's very unnatural. But we did it when we were babies and it will come back.

873
01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So the science behind it is this when you do this diaphragm breathing when you are breathing deep down into that full lung and expanding that belly out what it's doing is smashing down the organs below.

874
01:34:33.810 --> 01:34:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Those organs are all wrapped around the Vegas nerve the Vegas nerve is also called this wandering nerve and it's an amazing

875
01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Amazing nerve. What it does is when those organs are smushed right it activates the Vegas nerve, which is wrapped around all those organs and it sends a message up to the brain that says, oh,

876
01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in complete contradiction emotionally to how we're feeling because we're anxious and in order for this body to be breathing like that where the diaphragm smashes down

877
01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We must be okay. So again, it sends a message up to the brain. Oh, we're breathing deeply, there must not be a threat, there must not be an actual danger.

878
01:35:22.170 --> 01:35:22.530
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay.

879
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It just sends the message because you can't breathe like nobody brands like that.

880
01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're like,

881
01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.050
You don't love me anymore.

882
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, my kids. My kids hurt.

883
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, its way up here, short, short, short, short, short little brass short

884
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:40.230
Sugey’s iPhones: Mm hmm.

885
01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So with that breath is in complete contradiction to what the mind has been activated to a threat response, we can. It's called a Vegas break can pull the brakes on it with a parasympathetic nervous system that is the Vegas nerve.

886
01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you think of it as a break. We are sympathetic nervous system, which is a threat response.

887
01:36:03.630 --> 01:36:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely conscious. You're like my son is hurt right

888
01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We immediately probably don't want to be in threat response because we can't think straight. We can't problem solve all the blood is in our large muscle groups. It's in our biceps, triceps and in our size.

889
01:36:17.610 --> 01:36:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can't think straight. We want to be able to have a conversation with someone, we want to use logic, reason and plan something out and can't do it because

890
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We're activated. So you do this, breathing, and I'm going to teach you today moment. So first, I'm just giving you the science behind it.

891
01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:33.840
Okay.

892
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So the other thing, the other way that this is helpful is from a top down perspective, which has to do with

893
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm going to teach you actually is kind of hard to do. It takes concentration because it's going to be in, you know, it'll be enough for

894
01:36:49.710 --> 01:37:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Second, inhale, and they'll hold your breath for four seconds of your exhale for for and then right you'll hold for four and you'll inhale. And you do this over and over. And it actually is hard to do. So, this

895
01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is hard to do will take concentration and you'll get your mind off the monkey mind that wants to. What if everything catastrophizing everything so it works in two ways. Right. It focuses the mind, but the actual physiology of that breath.

896
01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's say you forget to do the belly breathing, you can still have the benefit of it because a lot of people weren't doing it sort of this right way when they were breathing deeply in the bottom.

897
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And they were still benefiting from it because it's such a hard breath to do it got their mind off their stress thought got their mind into a different neural network.

898
01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: They were focused on the body. And they ended up coming down. So let's do both at the same time and that regulation is going to happen so much faster.

899
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the two mechanism mechanisms of action where that works. So now let me do a little

900
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:57.210
Sugey’s iPhones: Instruction on it so I

901
01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Mentioned earlier, it's basically I call it box breathing, because it's shorter than swear

902
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's basically it'll be like this. First I'm going to instruct you don't have to do it.

903
01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The instruction is this you're going to be inhaling for four seconds you'll be inhaling through the nose and you'll be using those mindfulness skills that you've been developing

904
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Which has to do with paying attention to the sensation. How does it feel coming make you feel it in your nose. Here's you can feel the air that temperature coming through. And now you've got these hands on your belly and your bellies expanding

905
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the inhale, so it's right. It's an inhale for for and then you're going to hold that breath, you're gonna hold that belly out for 4321 then you're an exhale really feeling that pure slips.

906
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale out of the mouth flattening that tummy for four seconds you're going to hold it. Now some people can't hold it for four seconds.

907
01:38:51.690 --> 01:39:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That that part. I'm not, I'm not too picky about maybe only hold it for to that part doesn't really matter. But then you're going to feel it again coming in through the nose for four seconds you're going to hold for four seconds you're going to push it.

908
01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of your mouth for

909
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Four seconds feeling as it feels coming out of the mouth all that sensation and you're going to feel that tell me going flat. So I'm going to do it in front of you and

910
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you kind of get the rhythm.

911
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.110
Sugey’s iPhones: Then

912
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel free to join me. Okay.

913
01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and for your first time while you're learning, you definitely want to have an expanded sort of

914
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So make sure you're creating that opportunity for yourself. So can you

915
01:39:28.290 --> 01:39:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see my belly.

916
01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:29.520
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah.

917
01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: My name. I can't tell. Okay.

918
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.390
Sugey’s iPhones: So I'm doing now.

919
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to inhale for for and I'm paying. This is the hard part. The shoulders are going to want to go up.

920
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure you're watching those hands and

921
01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's have them.

922
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: expanse, here we go. I'm going to inhale for for

923
01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale

924
01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, hold 32 want to know, expanding belly.

925
01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 and now the exhale

Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale

933
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Push it out nice and slow. Out of that now, so keep it going. See if you can keep doing that count.

934
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Really conscious with his hands were expanding as that belly expands.

935
01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: push the air out really yeah there we go. Nice and deliberate. Keep it hold the air out for a couple seconds and then breathe it into the nose, nice and slow. That was a little fast.

936
01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. A little slower.

937
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.310
Sugey’s iPhones: And

938
01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it going in. Let me just check in, it's going in download

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, your hands are

01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:40.290
Fantastic.

941
01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:41.880
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay.

942
01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go.

943
01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Push it all out.

944
01:41:50.130 --> 01:41:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold, hold, hold. Inhale through that note.

Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 push it.

946
01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All out on purpose. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat

947
01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Tummy Flat. Flat. Flat

948
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale expand that happen.

949
01:42:13.530 --> 01:42:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Let it all go

950
01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can do it inside your own mind. What's your own count.

951
01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:03.030
Sugey’s iPhones: I noticed I get more relaxed. I feel like my shoulders aren't temps.

952
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:08.640
Sugey’s iPhones: There's yeah there's a lot more loose. I'm, I'm so used to feeling like this.

953
01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:09.930
Sugey’s iPhones: Right, yeah.

954
01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:13.590
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, absolutely.

955
01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So as you you you can also. Okay, so this is a really handy technique when let's say you're about to pick up the phone.

956
01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you're about to talk to so

957
01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to meet someone or something happens. You get a text where you notice your body responds with a threat response for a lot of people, their stomach turns

958
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There they start grinding their teeth for you. It might be the shoulders up so you catch the shoulders drop them down and you start doing the breathing.

959
01:43:46.050 --> 01:43:46.500
Sugey’s iPhones: Done.

960
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in the moment, that's a sort of an emotional regulation.

961
01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:51.870
Sugey’s iPhones: Skill right there. There's

962
01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:52.380
Sugey’s iPhones: Also

963
01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea of doing it when you wake up. So you do when you wake up.

964
01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a practice. I'm going to set the tone for this day or relaxed day I'm going to have this lovely imagery in my mind, I'm going to be doing this breathing and then you can do it before you go to sleep to about maybe five 710 rounds of it.

965
01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's both this sort of meditative practice as well as on the spot feel better practice.

966
01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.200
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay.

967
01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You could also. So you're going to be this really neat that you're learning Tai Chi, so you're probably learning stuff like this. Right. You learn

968
01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.390
Sugey’s iPhones: You burn this ball.

969
01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.130
Sugey’s iPhones: Right and

970
01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, you're probably learning is it's not your hands doing it like this, isn't it, you're turning your body

971
01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.540
Sugey’s iPhones: Hmm.

972
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:41.130
Sugey’s iPhones: Isn't it, yeah.

973
01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes a lot of concentration to do it with fidelity to do it the right way. So yes, that's a great way to get out of the out of your head so you can be doing some breathing, as you're doing it so

974
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing it up here, and on the other side and exhaling, so you can

975
01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:21.240
Sugey’s iPhones: Incorporate

976
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how much concentration that face, you're going to get out of you.

977
01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.190
Sugey’s iPhones: Mm hmm.

978
01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:30.690
Sugey’s iPhones: And what I have noticed with know that I joined that

979
01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:34.080
Sugey’s iPhones: I have a hard time. Um,

980
01:45:35.370 --> 01:45:37.350
Sugey’s iPhones: I think it was that by concentrating

981
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.100
Sugey’s iPhones: Because like I will either go too fast.

982
01:45:41.730 --> 01:45:51.840
Sugey’s iPhones: And I find myself, like, you know, and I don't know if it's a part of part of that I'm learning. But I tend to like move to us.

983
01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:53.760
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah.

984
01:45:54.090 --> 01:46:00.120
Sugey’s iPhones: And I feel that's part of my my anxiousness like you know

985
01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, I mean, I'm not an instructor. I used to

986
01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Many

987
01:46:04.710 --> 01:46:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Many years ago, I would

988
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:07.500
Sugey’s iPhones: I was teaching

989
01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Filipino knife and stick fighting. Some are nice.

990
01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I really love the Tai Chi that some of those moves. It's just stuck with me. They resonated so powerfully and

991
01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Reason why I like that particular move is because it's not about right this destination. It's not about you know getting over here. It's about how do I get there by turning

992
01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: On turning

993
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:36.720
Sugey’s iPhones: With my whole body.

994
01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And by the time I get there, my left ankle is pointing out and I'm over here like this. And how do I get over there without turning just in my upper body. How do I turn from the waist over here. How do I do it, how do I bring this over by turning my whole upper body with it and

995
01:46:56.310 --> 01:47:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're meeting with this, with this instructor. Say, where should I be concentrating my focus as I'm turning. Where's the, the part. How am I getting over here because I it's not just this right and

996
01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Right up here and he might say, oh, maybe, maybe the core. I'm not an instructor in it. But for me, I feel it here.

997
01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:16.500
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah.

998
01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I also feel

999
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:20.100
Sugey’s iPhones: All the way down to my heel. I also

1000
01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because by the time I get here that heals turned out and for it. I can do this.

1001
01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:27.600
Sugey’s iPhones: Is

1002
01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a completely different focus and maybe asking, Where are you guys FOCUSING ON WHERE AM I MAKING THAT TERM happen. They probably be able to kind of fine tune it

1003
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:50.190
Sugey’s iPhones: And it's funny because he's actually really good. I really like him, and he's very detailed and the first week or two. I won't even say he's telling me exactly

1004
01:47:50.910 --> 01:48:08.580
Sugey’s iPhones: What part of my body to use and it's so weird, because it's I just couldn't. I was like, yeah, yeah. But again, I think it was just the anxiety of learning. I guess something new. And then, but obviously it's gotten a lot better. Yeah.

1005
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you've been going for a month. Right.

1006
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.400
Yeah.

1007
01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:13.410
Sugey’s iPhones: That's

1008
01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Not body awareness is going to serve you.

1009
01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: To pay attention to the body.

1010
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:29.070
Sugey’s iPhones: Yes, I've never been the type to be able to like use my body very much like my fingers. My husband can, like, move his toes.

1011
01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:34.950
Sugey’s iPhones: And I can't. And it's, it's weird. I've never had never paid attention to stuff like

1012
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.210
Sugey’s iPhones: Well,

1013
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's really neat that you're you're doing this activity.

1014
01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:42.960
Sugey’s iPhones: Yes.

1015
01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:43.380
Sugey’s iPhones: All right.

1016
01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check him on a couple other things, you're

1017
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

1018
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: About that one try and do that one at least five times a day until you really, really get how it's going to serve you.

1019
01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:57.180
Sugey’s iPhones: And

1020
01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, even as you're doing Tai Chi. My guess is this instructor will do some instruction around breathing.

1021
01:49:03.690 --> 01:49:04.080
Sugey’s iPhones: Oh, yeah.

1022
01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Then follow that instruction. There's also this breath work with cheap calm. There's lots of stuff out there where you

1023
01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:14.100
Sugey’s iPhones: Oh my God, yes. Yeah. Yes, neat things that she

1024
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:15.660
Sugey’s iPhones: Knows

1025
01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, another one you have is I to get more organized

1026
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure that you know that's missing to get more organized so as

1027
01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To lessen frustration levels. Tell me what that means.

1028
01:49:34.530 --> 01:49:36.780
Get more organized so

1029
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:48.570
Sugey’s iPhones: I think all that was i was i would do the hard things that I have to deal with, like, just an example of there's something

1030
01:49:50.430 --> 01:50:02.820
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm okay. Say that like something that I got a pain that's just a and I know it's like a burden. And I'm like, I would put that aside and then like the last moment, I'm like,

1031
01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:19.800
Sugey’s iPhones: Oh crap, I have to get it done. And then that would stress me out because sometimes you know doesn't work that way because something happens and I don't get it done. And then I'm going to get a lead charge. And that's just starts building all this other stuff. So I kind of

1032
01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:21.720
Sugey’s iPhones: Needed a

1033
01:50:22.890 --> 01:50:29.340
Sugey’s iPhones: Way of putting setting my priorities. Yes. And in doing that.

1034
01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:36.090
Sugey’s iPhones: I think it would it would be less stressful for me when I have to do stuff.

1035
01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you at with that. How good at. You are setting things that are important.

1036
01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:45.240
Sugey’s iPhones: Urgent I'm getting

1037
01:50:46.710 --> 01:51:08.520
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm getting better. I'm getting better. I don't feel like I still have it all under control, but I am getting better. I and I started to use an actual I know this is sounds old school but I started to use an actual calendar a planner, because if I see it. It's weird. If I see it.

1038
01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:10.710
Sugey’s iPhones: Then, then

1039
01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder

1040
01:51:11.850 --> 01:51:23.610
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah now. Oh, because everybody's like, Oh, we'll just put it in your phone, but the planner actually helps me because I turn to that page of the you know the date and I see. Oh.

1041
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:34.650
Sugey’s iPhones: I have to do this. And yes, the phone. Reminds you, but sometimes you don't hear it. Sometimes you don't hear the reminder. Sometimes, something happens. So that planner is helping me

1042
01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:36.150
Sugey’s iPhones: Yes. Okay.

1043
01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful.

1044
01:51:37.170 --> 01:51:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've gotten hacked, you can see a layout. You can see the whole week in front of you right

1045
01:51:43.050 --> 01:51:44.280
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay, that's beautiful.

1046
01:51:44.730 --> 01:51:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your understanding about about procrastination. What do you know about it.

1047
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:53.370
Sugey’s iPhones: Maybe Lauren. Oh.

1048
01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:57.270
Sugey’s iPhones: Well, to make it

1049
01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:05.790
Sugey’s iPhones: The short version. I guess I would say or what I think it is. I'm waiting till the last minute to get things accomplished.

1050
01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.720
And what's your opinion of a procrastinator.

1051
01:52:11.190 --> 01:52:11.520
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm sorry.

1052
01:52:11.850 --> 01:52:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your opinion of a program

1053
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:20.880
Sugey’s iPhones: Oh, I hate it. I hate it. I hate it because I wasn't like that and I hated

1054
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:22.110
Sugey’s iPhones: What is. I'm like,

1055
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:35.400
Sugey’s iPhones: What did you use um during all this because I learned how to step all the like the part not the things that were used. Important to me at that time, I would put them aside.

1056
01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:46.770
Sugey’s iPhones: Which were actually the important things I should have paid attention to. So I kind of learn to, you know, deal with the leader, it'll work itself out.

1057
01:52:48.690 --> 01:52:50.040
Sugey’s iPhones: That type of behavior.

1058
01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now um

1059
01:52:57.150 --> 01:53:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a couple things that I've seen be effective around this. One of them is so let's let's make it realistic. What is something that

1060
01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd like to see yourself chip away at but instead you're gonna wait to the last minute to

1061
01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:11.520
Sugey’s iPhones: motivate you.

1062
01:53:14.670 --> 01:53:16.290
Sugey’s iPhones: See, what would that be

1063
01:53:22.770 --> 01:53:24.900
Sugey’s iPhones: Something that I do that lives.

1064
01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:44.400
Sugey’s iPhones: Maybe like

1065
01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:56.880
Sugey’s iPhones: I always say, I'm going to go to the gym and I don't. And then like a last minute or somebody says, like my neighbor and I go together sometimes

1066
01:53:57.180 --> 01:54:10.440
Sugey’s iPhones: She'll say oh I'm going and I'm fine. I text, I find myself texting or later. I'll be right there and there was like a whole hour to get to get everything together. But no, I decided at the last very last minute to go

1067
01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so she's texting.

1068
01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: She's invited you. And for an hour.

1069
01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:34.770
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, like an hour before she's leaving and and I'll say, oh, you know, I have things to do, or I'll let you know. And then I find myself texting her and made her like maybe even at the time that she's leaving and saying, Oh, wait.

1070
01:54:35.850 --> 01:54:36.780
Sugey’s iPhones: I am going to go

1071
01:54:41.970 --> 01:54:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

1072
01:54:42.930 --> 01:54:43.680
Sugey’s iPhones: An interesting one.

1073
01:54:44.970 --> 01:54:45.420
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah.

1074
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's pretty it's pretty similar actually to way procrastination basically works.

1075
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: There is

1076
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone's a procrastinator.

1077
01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And we give ourselves this hard time

1078
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But try and understand that the gym.

1079
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have a set deadline. Right, so maybe I could lose weight. Maybe I'll fit in these clothes, maybe above

1080
01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you but if you realize the actual constraint is your friend is leaving. It's a lot easier to take action. The closer you are to that deadline.

1081
01:55:31.530 --> 01:55:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, you do you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. And then you make a decision. So just, just think of it like this. Is there something in your life where there's no deadline. There's no constraint. Think of like a

1082
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A PhD student right who they've got a lot of time to write this thing, but they don't right

1083
01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't write because this is really no set deadlines are so far off into the future. They're having a hard time writing it.

1084
01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

1085
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But try and have compassion because we're all like that we need to know what the constraint is when we don't have a deadline when we don't have a set constraint, we're left to our own regulation.

1086
01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:13.770
And

1087
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not going to do it. We're going to wait the monkey mind will say, Oh, let's play. Now let's feel good now.

1088
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but just know that that is normal.

1089
01:56:24.690 --> 01:56:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you can do is

1090
01:56:25.770 --> 01:56:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Set an actual straight to it, you give yourself a deadline or you can manufacturer it from the outside by committing to going with your friend once you commit to your friend, you're not going to be rude.

1091
01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:42.510
Sugey’s iPhones: Right, probably guessing on

1092
01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The x. So the constraint is an actual COMMITMENT, I'LL BE OVER THERE ON THE OUTSIDE five minutes before

1093
01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You commit to it because you won't. You're like, they the whole time. They are maybe I'll go. Maybe I want. That's not a constraint.

1094
01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.330
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay.

1095
01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So manufacturer by committing hey

1096
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to now maybe you've done it with the Tai Chi. Maybe you did it with money, like, ooh, this was a little bit more than I'm

1097
01:57:06.450 --> 01:57:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Comfortable with if I make myself go

1098
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, you know, I'll probably go and so I signed up for this. And I'm going to go Monday and Thursday.

1099
01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want the constraint there. So on your agenda right here you are with this agenda and you're like, Okay, I need to do this thing.

1100
01:57:25.890 --> 01:57:27.330
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm going to invite her

1101
01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: On Tuesdays and Wednesdays to go to the gym and it's on your agenda and you just text her and you commit to it. That's the constraint, because we have this

1102
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:38.520
Sugey’s iPhones: social pressure to be our commitments with people.

1103
01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're probably going to do it.

1104
01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That the sample. But my point.

1105
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:44.190
Sugey’s iPhones: Is if you

1106
01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch yourself with something with a constraint way out here, you probably aren't going to do it until it's right on top of you.

1107
01:57:51.450 --> 01:57:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's normal.

1108
01:57:54.300 --> 01:58:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So give yourself a break. That's like human nature. We all kind of do that so it's hard to chip away at it.

1109
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that as the truth, right, because that's probably true. So, the other one is that this technique and 54321 can be helpful.

1110
01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You literally

1111
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have any time to waste. Let's say you say today, I'm going to make I'll make something up. I'm going to do this.

1112
01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This Tai Chi video, I'll just say I'm going to do this video once a day, and this is how it works. You wake up in the morning.

1113
01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you thought of it. You have to say 54321 you're literally standing up, believe it or not, if you wait those five four seconds. Your mind will say, yeah.

1114
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You do it later. You don't really want to do right now. Come on. You want you to feel it. Doesn't this bed feel good. This feels so good. You need to do and I can do later.

1115
01:58:53.610 --> 01:58:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Later, and guess what another whole day is gone by and you didn't do this thing. But watch what will happen.

1116
01:58:59.670 --> 01:59:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm all watch. I don't overthink it. I do, I do. The 54321 and I just kicked my legs out of the bed. Well, my legs are already out of the bed.

1117
01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I might as right oh I'm tired and I walked over and I've turned the light on. Now, now I'm already up already up

1118
01:59:17.130 --> 01:59:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm counting I'm literally counting the mind doesn't have. Right. It can't intrude with it's nonsense and try and tell you not to do it you're counting 54321

1119
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already in motion the likelihood that you're going to get where you're going is so much higher. It's, I can. And this may seem oversimplified, and how can this work. This is ridiculous.

1120
01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but, hey, Thomas

1121
01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:44.370
Sugey’s iPhones: No, no I willing to try it. I want to tell it.

1122
01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:45.900
Sugey’s iPhones: Actually is

1123
01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Funny because

1124
01:59:49.290 --> 01:59:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's made it on your to do list. You've already worked out, whether it's either important or urgent.

1125
01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't bother putting it on the list. If you're not, if you're not going to do this thing. If you haven't already worked through this is something you want to do and don't put it on there. But if you have

1126
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's okay, I want to spend 20 minutes developing this, you know, I've got to work on this this project. And so I say well to get it done. I need about 20 minutes a day if you bother writing it in there.

1127
02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you just do the 54321 you've already done all the analysis you wrote it down because it's important to you.

1128
02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're never going to feel like doing it.

1129
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You never know. One is

1130
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to be bored. We want to confront people. We don't want to ask for things we want

1131
02:00:40.590 --> 02:00:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't want to be challenged with a good grief. I don't know if I knew this stuff yesterday now doesn't like I know how is this possible. Nobody wants to sit with that do it anyway. It's on your list if you wrote it down, you've already worked out, whether it's important origin for you.

1132
02:00:53.910 --> 02:01:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: 54321 you literally you're literally like a few seconds. I got a call right now live for. And you just do it. Hi.

1133
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:10.110
Sugey’s iPhones: Ya know, that's, ya know, I'm willing to try it. I'm curious, actually.

1134
02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of cute because during you

1135
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:14.010
Know,

1136
02:01:15.090 --> 02:01:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: During that counting

1137
02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not busy convincing yourself.

1138
02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing, you're already in motion and the likelihood. Oh, this I want to I want this, I

1139
02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk to this professor about a question I have, or whatever, there's this residency. I want to do, or I want to make another impression. If you're already walking like

1140
02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning walking the line.

1141
02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already walking, you're probably going to get there. You're already walking so just

1142
02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:47.670
Now,

1143
02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:50.310
Sugey’s iPhones: Just put it

1144
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'd like to say, the thing about the constraints, because a lot of people give themselves a hard time about procrastination, they think there's some sort of something just broke

1145
02:01:58.770 --> 02:01:59.130
Sugey’s iPhones: No.

1146
02:01:59.340 --> 02:02:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We like we like, believe it or not, our mind likes to have a constraint we may say, Oh, that's too limiting and and I don't want to be enough budget budgets are for people that are broke. Well, guess what happens if we have a constraint white and that's how much we spend if we don't

1147
02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: We spend more.

1148
02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the way we are. And whatever amount of time we have will fill it doing that project, but give yourself this much time will then that's how much time this this task will take you'll get it done.

1149
02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:33.180
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay.

1150
02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.390
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, that makes sense. So here's

1151
02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your friends texting you say I'm going to go

1152
02:02:43.770 --> 02:02:44.070
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah.

1153
02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's a commitment right and the

1154
02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Likelihood is

1155
02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go and on 543 I'm already getting my my shorts out. I've already got my my sports primary got my stuff out.

1156
02:02:57.390 --> 02:02:58.890
Sugey’s iPhones: And guess what, if

1157
02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't keep that commitment. If you break that promise. Well, then you can apologize but

1158
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. We make mistakes we overcommit sometimes, but we'll deal with it when you get there, that's okay to

1159
02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.390
Just some thoughts around procrastination.

1160
02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

1161
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the gym. One of the ones that concerns you or is there something more pressing

1162
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:33.510
Sugey’s iPhones: Um,

1163
02:03:35.670 --> 02:03:37.080
Sugey’s iPhones: I just think it's like

1164
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:42.810
Sugey’s iPhones: With my daily being was it's so weird, like

1165
02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:55.140
Sugey’s iPhones: I can give you another example. I know my, my husband is going to get home at five and and I want to start dinner before he gets here.

1166
02:03:55.410 --> 02:03:57.810
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah. And then I look at the clock and I'm like,

1167
02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:09.690
Sugey’s iPhones: It's like five minutes from him getting here and then I start you know making, making dinner. And I'm like, I have all this time to make it and no wait till the last minute. Yeah.

1168
02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so the chain of events, a great one, actually. So you go

1169
02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, what do I do you already know, like, Tell me, what are you going to eat for dinner tonight.

1170
02:04:21.570 --> 02:04:25.920
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm gonna make some vegetables with chicken chicken vegetables.

1171
02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you going to make the chicken.

1172
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:28.920
Sugey’s iPhones: Grilled

1173
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you have enough propane or what gas whatever you're going to need for that. Yeah. Okay. And this takes grilled chicken. Is this about

1174
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: 20 minutes

1175
02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.330
Or though.

1176
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:48.570
Sugey’s iPhones: I takes like like 40 minutes or 4045 around there.

1177
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay 45 and then now that's just the grilled chicken. What about the veggies. What do you have to do with those guys.

1178
02:04:55.260 --> 02:05:03.840
Sugey’s iPhones: But you grill in those two. Those are no those I'm going to make inside and those probably take about 15 including the

1179
02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Looting like cleaning and whatever you needed you to cut them right

1180
02:05:08.250 --> 02:05:23.070
Sugey’s iPhones: Oh, why would I have them already cut, I, I tend to cut a lot in then I put them in bags. So those are cut. So I would say about 50 we can say 20 okay

1181
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need to be right next to the grill or do you

1182
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:33.990
Sugey’s iPhones: Know what I can, I can go back and forth.

1183
02:05:34.770 --> 02:05:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want dinner made by what time

1184
02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:40.230
Sugey’s iPhones: Five.

1185
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: By five

1186
02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:45.180
Mm hmm. Okay.

1187
02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're talking about starting at that for for 10

1188
02:05:54.750 --> 02:06:01.980
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, that would be all right. Okay, I'm sorry I've waited till 455

1189
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything

1190
02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's more urgent than that. Is there anything that's getting know what

1191

Gwenevere Abriel: Good could get in the way of it.

1192
02:06:14.190 --> 02:06:22.050
Sugey’s iPhones: No, like I said, I think it's just daily, things like that in and I would say urgency, I would say like

1193
02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:34.110
Sugey’s iPhones: making phone calls or bills or even like payroll. When I do payroll, I will wait till like Thursday and, you know, and

1194
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:56.010
Sugey’s iPhones: We paydays Friday. So if I don't get that in on time, they're not going to get a check and they're not every happy. So, and this happened where once I didn't get it in on time so they had to wait till Friday afternoon to get their paycheck, which my husband was curious about so

1195
02:06:57.270 --> 02:07:00.720
Sugey’s iPhones: Those kind of type of urgency user. Yeah.

1197
02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You did do it, but you had to wait till it was right here. So please understand that is a human nature thing we do you do something wrong or broken this takes a lot of work to say no matter what the monkey mind. I gotta show you this little video it's gonna make you laugh.

1198
02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he's calling himself the master procrastinator.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're never going to feel like it.

1202
02:07:46.170 --> 02:07:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to feel like doing payroll and as far as this goes you pull out your agenda, you want to set yourself a certain time to be chipping away at the payroll you write it down. If you don't bother writing it down. If you're not going to do it. Don't kid yourself.

1203
02:07:59.490 --> 02:07:59.940
Okay.

1204
02:08:01.230 --> 02:08:02.460

Gwenevere Abriel: Three to four. This is what I'm going to do it or whatever it is. That's it.

1207
02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are 321 it you just start walking over and I can tell you it's not going to be as bad as you think your mind is going to say you're going to be bored you

02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Dis this. No, no, wait, just wait till you feel like doing it by the time you get there and you've done. You've done your 20 minutes you might end up doing more than you thought.

1209
02:08:28.890 --> 02:08:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But now brain of yours is going to tell you just wait.

1210
02:08:33.690 --> 02:08:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's its job is to postpone it wants you to have this this enjoyable experience and just, just chill. It doesn't mean it's the only way to handle that day.

1211
02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Trust me on this 54321 you're already walking over there. And if you embody this idea. You're never going to feel like it, you'll see

1212
02:08:54.330 --> 02:09:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain is going to be telling yes you can. You're gonna you'll see later you'll feel like it later you'll see you'll see now, you won't. Nobody, nobody wants to do this. We want to do that stuff.

1213
02:09:02.850 --> 02:09:03.360
Right.

1214
02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it as soon as you have the thought. I want to do this video I want to do this. This cooking. Right. No. Oh, I've already got it set for for for for for 10 or you have an alarm set, but when it comes to these things like

1215
02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Like the payroll. I have no idea. I don't know if what would serve you better is having it scheduled on the book or I have no idea. Yeah.

1216
02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:42.540
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, no, I think that's a good. That's a good way to start. I think by by putting it on that planner, because that's definitely helped me get a lot more done actually

1217
02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:44.700
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, I think so too.

1218
02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And remembering running it through like you notice how I keep saying it over and over, you never get to feel like it.

1219
02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:51.360
Sugey’s iPhones: Mm hmm.

1220
02:09:51.630 --> 02:09:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: See

1221
02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:54.030
That's why it's work.

1222
02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:57.480
Sugey’s iPhones: Right now you

1223
02:09:57.510 --> 02:10:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Aren't going to feel like it you won't feel like it then. So why not do it right now, you won't feel like it. Trust me, you won't you wait to feel the guilt pressing down on you.

1224
02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1225
02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: See what it feels like to do the 54321 walk over and do it anyway.

1226
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to do it anyway.

1227
02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But now you won't have that pressure. See if you can do it.

1228
02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:33.120
Sugey’s iPhones: See what happens.

1229
02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Here is a little behavior experiment, see if your mind is going to push back really hard and say, yeah.

1230
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And make commitments to people because that's a constraint. I already committed to my friend. I got her go.

1231
02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:49.500
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay.

1232
02:10:50.700 --> 02:11:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um, let me just look real quick in here. You did say something about better communication, you said better communication with my husband. I taught you a little bit about the I feel statements.

1233
02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know how far we got into that piece. Did you have a chance to

1234
02:11:06.090 --> 02:11:15.600
Sugey’s iPhones: Practice it with him. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm I'm using it more now I find myself. I'm not apologizing for everything.

1235
02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:32.490
Sugey’s iPhones: So, you know, I definitely think, um, I would say these last maybe two months maybe month to two months, I feel a lot like I've been putting a lot of what

1236
02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:34.470
Sugey’s iPhones: I've been taught

1237
02:11:35.490 --> 02:11:37.920
Sugey’s iPhones: Recently into play. Yeah.

1238
02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And

1239
02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you given some thought to

1240
02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.470
Sugey’s iPhones: Inviting your husband to

1241
02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:44.670
Sugey’s iPhones: Do something

1242
02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Around communication.

1243
02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:51.270
Sugey’s iPhones: Yes, I have. I'm going to talk to him about Elvis over this weekend.

1244
02:11:51.930 --> 02:11:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the one thing he might say that is your worst fear. What's your worst fear that he

1245
02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:02.970
Sugey’s iPhones: I think he'll probably say, I don't need it.

1246
02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:05.940
Sugey’s iPhones: I don't need counseling.

1247
02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:15.420
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay, he's gonna say, I think he's in it. That's one thing I would think he's going to say, or he could say um

1248
02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:25.770
Sugey’s iPhones: I don't know, we haven't talked about counseling or a while but at first it was like I would try to come and tell him you know that the things they would

1249
02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:31.530
Sugey’s iPhones: Teach me. And he'd be like, Oh, why don't even care about that because that's your problem.

1250
02:12:32.970 --> 02:12:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, how did you feel when he said that

1251
02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:50.670
Sugey’s iPhones: I would be very upset. Oh, yeah. So, like, more recent he started to open up at first he was completely like that's your problem, not mine.

1252
02:12:51.330 --> 02:13:03.750
Sugey’s iPhones: And then like as months kind of went by and they would slowly come back and say, you know, all this happen, or this they taught me this, he would start like listening.

1253
02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:17.790
Sugey’s iPhones: And now he understands. Like, why was so important to meet for him to be able to understand or be a part of. I told him, you have to be a part of this treatment.

1254
02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:23.400
Sugey’s iPhones: There's no way I can do without you being part of it. So yeah.

1255
02:13:23.670 --> 02:13:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're changing a lot, you know, he's going to be left out kind of going, Who is this woman, she's changing so much, you know,

1256
02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:31.020
Yeah yeah

1257
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:40.350
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, and I think he's made the comment here and they're like, oh my god, you're, you're changing. And he's like, it's just hard to kind of

1258
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:52.980
Sugey’s iPhones: You know, deal with the, the change all of a sudden, and I'm like, I don't think it's all of a sudden, but I think he he feels like it was OK.

1259
02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So now think about for yourself.

1260
02:13:57.390 --> 02:14:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you want him to join you in session. Think about it.

1261
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:04.530
Okay.

1262
02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Go inside right now and just kind of ponder

1263
02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:09.630
Sugey’s iPhones: For a moment.

1264
02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it. So asking yourself, what do I want from this

1265
02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because somebody had asked

1266
02:14:17.610 --> 02:14:19.020
Sugey’s iPhones: What do you hope to gain from

1267
02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:19.350
It.

1268
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a minute and just think about that.

1269
02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what you want.

1270
02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: From it from the experience of meeting together to know what you want.

1271
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:52.410
What is it, what do

1272
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.290
Sugey’s iPhones: I want him to even

1273
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:02.310
Sugey’s iPhones: Understand me more.

1274
02:15:03.930 --> 02:15:08.970
Sugey’s iPhones: And I would like him to maybe open up a little bit more

1275
02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:23.700
Sugey’s iPhones: Like I said he, he, he's come a long way, but sometimes I still feel like he's like, I don't want to not that he's never said I want to talk about it, but I feel that way because kill like

1276
02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:44.790
Sugey’s iPhones: Switch the subject. He'll kill avoid it. Basically, when I start saying, you know, this or they're teaching me this or or in counseling today or in group. And he's like, kind of like, oh, you know, so I wish you would just be more involved.

1277
02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what would you gain from his feet more info.

1278
02:15:51.390 --> 02:15:52.020
Sugey’s iPhones: Oh, wonder

1279
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:57.540
Sugey’s iPhones: I think it would help us a lot in understanding

1280
02:15:58.590 --> 02:16:07.950
Sugey’s iPhones: Each other, not just me, but I would think that it would help so much because he could really see

1281
02:16:09.210 --> 02:16:14.550
Sugey’s iPhones: You know, the how the process is going how hard it's been

1282
02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:21.090
Sugey’s iPhones: Yeah, so I think it would help both of us in our relationships.

1283
02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me tell you what I've heard. What you want is understanding from him.

1284
02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And specifically, you want them to understand how hard it's been for you.

1285
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:36.390
Sugey’s iPhones: Yes, recovery.

1286
02:16:37.530 --> 02:16:38.730

02:16:40.650 --> 02:16:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, this is what you want. It's going to be hard.

1288
02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but

1289
02:16:48.750 --> 02:16:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: He didn't ask for this. This is that was stuffing, you want

1290
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you before the way might be to sell this

1291
02:16:56.670 --> 02:17:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Idea what he has to gain from it.

1292
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: He wanted to do this.

1293
02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:24.660
Sugey’s iPhones: High think I would feel better if I feel better, or I'm going to be in a better mood. I can you know because a lot of times that that's something that he says, sometimes, like, Oh, well, you're always in a bad mood.

1294
02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:32.460
Sugey’s iPhones: Or you're always stressed. So I think he would be happier to have. I was happier.

1295
02:17:33.510 --> 02:17:41.910
Sugey’s iPhones: I have, you know, because we're of his understanding, then I could probably get more even more done. Okay.

1296
02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, um,

1297

For him.

1308
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:41.700

02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:54.060
Sugey’s iPhones: You know, we'll be talking. I'm like, no, I've been stressed today.

1324
02:19:54.330 --> 02:19:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing,

1325
02:19:56.400 --> 02:20:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The he you in your stress. What are you doing, but he doesn't like

1326
02:20:03.900 --> 02:20:19.650
Sugey’s iPhones: Um, well, actually, one of the things he really hates us the me procrastinating he he hates that because he knows so he'll tend to like tell me five times to do something in that that bugs me.

1327
02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:33.420
Sugey’s iPhones: Because I'm like, I know. And he's like, please get it out now because you're gonna forget. And then when I do forget or if I don't do it for you can imagine. Yeah.

1328
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we put up a little pin in this idea of meeting. Let's wait a little bit to invite this. How about, there's a little stronger need. I thought we should wait for

1329
02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because typically, when there's

1330
02:20:51.390 --> 02:20:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: yelling at each other, or there's this

1331
02:20:57.150 --> 02:20:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, let's say it's about money.

1332
02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You're spending all this money and it's not getting saved and it's starting to be this huge or let's say he has a parenting style, you have a parenting style and it's so

1333
02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:10.680
Sugey’s iPhones: She's lying.

1334
02:21:11.070 --> 02:21:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be able to talk about this. I want to work with my partner, but I can't.

1335
02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: therapy can be helpful, but

1336
02:21:22.050 --> 02:21:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If you end up addressing your procrastination issues, maybe this will just sort of solve itself. I don't know.

1337
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

1338
02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I don't know it because I'm having

1339
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A hard time seeing how we can

1340
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.600
Sugey’s iPhones: For know

1341
02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe wait and see.

1342
02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Figured it out. Like, I know, I know what what would help him feel good and how we would be how we would do better.

1343
02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if he hasn't said something like

1344
02:21:54.900 --> 02:22:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think you're going to be able to stay clean but you know he hasn't said something, you know what I mean, like,

1345
02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Where he has this really broad understanding of this

1346
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I don't know that you're going to be able to wrangle them in

1347
02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: If you decide

1348
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:18.150
Hey,

1349
02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: At all. Have you noticed that I've been kind of talking different I've been saying how I feel.

1350
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I feel better. And you notice for not arguments much

1351
02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I learned this from Gwen and in love, if we could, you could learn it to. And then we would both have this really direct way of communicating that is a place if you decided you want to go to, like, I want you to be able to talk about your feelings. Also, so you don't have to keep it inside

1352
02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And structure has been useful and we can both do it together. That's one one piece is around that that communication. So, just give us a

1353
02:22:58.530 --> 02:23:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, was there anything in here. Do you want to set

1354
02:23:04.530 --> 02:23:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: A new goal, um, let me see something happen here.

1355
02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: better communication improve her health through losing. Oh, you wanted to lose some weight.

1356
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay today is one

1357
02:23:22.890 --> 02:23:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

1358
02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to increase frequency of engaging and daily exercise.

1359
02:23:30.330 --> 02:23:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to do exercise every day.

1360
02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:52.080
Sugey’s iPhones: Try to do at least 30 minutes every day because I was walking, I would walk every day. And now that it got cold I stopped doing that. So I feel like that makes me a little even lazy to get me going.

1361
02:23:53.160 --> 02:24:01.920
Sugey’s iPhones: Because when I want to get the surgery and I you know I'm up and moving and and I just feel like when I don't walk I yeah

1362
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So twice a week. You've been going to type cheap.

1363
02:24:07.290 --> 02:24:09.660
Sugey’s iPhones: So that's helped okay now.

1364
02:24:10.290 --> 02:24:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just break it down for me. How many days a week. Are you actually exercising.

1365
02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:20.700
Sugey’s iPhones: Right now. Um, I would say just the two days that I go over there.

1366
02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll extend this target date.

1367
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you want to do. Notice that you do have access to, to video to YouTube and things like that. How do you increase it a little bit. If it's not walking outside if it's too cold. What would you do

1368
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:45.720
Sugey’s iPhones: Oh my can do it inside. And actually we've been talking about getting maybe a treadmill. So maybe I can start you know that way also.

1369
02:24:52.050 --> 02:24:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Give some

1370
02:24:55.170 --> 02:25:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Give some thought to practicing the homework 54321 as soon as you think it. Just do it.

1371
02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And have compassion around the fact that you do need a constraint.

1372
02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:08.100
Okay.

1373
02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning we all kind of do. It's like human nature. We all kind of. So even though you're giving him a hard time or, you know, you're telling me to go drive around

1374
02:25:19.290 --> 02:25:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You could instead of not liking that about yourself. You could say, oh, you know what

1375
02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I do that everybody does that we all wait to the last minute. Oh, this 5432 1am I get up and I'm just going to do five minutes, and all of a sudden, you've walked over you're sitting down and all you're doing is five minutes.

1376
02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: probably end up doing that, but he tricked in mind by saying, I'm just gonna walk over, I'm just going to open a book.

1377
02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.470
Sugey’s iPhones: Okay, so

1378
02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a trick.

1379
02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Works, who cares 54321 as soon as you have the thought. I'm not kidding. They will only have a few seconds before the brain convinces you not do it.

1380
02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Start committing to things because that's the constraint.

1381
02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:04.500
Sugey’s iPhones: OK.

1382
02:26:07.350 --> 02:26:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, let's meet again, um, you want to meet in a month, two weeks. When do you want to do it again.

1383
02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:16.320
Sugey’s iPhones: I'm doing we schedule for the seven

1384
02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What I do, I did I put you at 105

1385
02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. That's beautiful. I will see that

1386
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.800
Already

1387
02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any medication bridge to today, or you're good.

1388
02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:32.610
Sugey’s iPhones: No, I'm good. Okay.

1389
02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. There's a lot to do. You've got breathing, you've got, you know, 54321 you've got competing commitments you've got lots of things that you could be playing with

1390
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:44.970
Sugey’s iPhones: Let's see how it goes. Sure. Well,

1391
02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:46.650
