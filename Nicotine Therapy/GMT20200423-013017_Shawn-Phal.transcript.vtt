00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.980
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

2
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.070
Mitch: Good. How are you doing,

3
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.330
Shawn Phalen: Good. Can you hear me okay

4
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.260
Yeah.

5
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.850
Shawn Phalen: Hey, so how's it going, Tommy. Tommy what's been happening.

6
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.190
Mitch: Well, I'm back to work full time. Well, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I

7
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.080
Mitch: Got out of shape these past couple weeks not working in my my jobs kind of physically demanding so

8
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.930
Mitch: I've been exhausted, to say the least.

9
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.990
Shawn Phalen: So how did you get to go back full time, how, how is that, how's that

10
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.750
Mitch: Well, it's um

11
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.550
Mitch: I'm not too sure the like specifics, but we get a lot of our nails and stuff from China. So that was a big thing that slowed us down and

12
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.630
Mitch: Just my boss said, we can only do special orders and no inventory and now that our inventories depleted. We have to get back after it so

13
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.650
Mitch: We're, we're hitting it hard, who were pretty busy.

14
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.700
Shawn Phalen: So here replenishing the inventory, then

15
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.520
Mitch: Yeah, as well as special orders to

16
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.860
Mitch: Those good were so basically we were going to have to hire on a few new people.

17
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:22.020
Mitch: Oh my god, that's so good to hear well right before all this happened because we're one branch of many and our branch was a

18
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.110
Mitch: 20% more production than any other branch.

19
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.980
Mitch: So we were doing pretty good before all these crops happened.

20
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.300
Shawn Phalen: Where did the special orders come from.

21
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:50.490
Mitch: Yeah, just everywhere. Other just around our general County and sometimes like another branch will make a sale and it will be near us so they send it over to us.

22
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.700
Shawn Phalen: And it smell houses, right, is that

23
00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:13.500
Mitch: Well, yeah, like sheds there. Yeah. Our biggest shed that we do is 14 by 14 okay you did a lot of flooring. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Cool. This one. It's one of the more physically demanding positions, but it's also pays more to

24
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.450
Mitch: That's good.

25
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.760
Shawn Phalen: Well, you're one of the lucky ones that you got to go back to work and you got

26
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:32.730
Mitch: Time and that this is happening and that they're considering it in the central business for you. Yeah, well, we never really shut down. I think I don't know.

27
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:45.840
Mitch: Because we're such a small little company. We have less than 15 employees. I don't know if we ever really had to shut down because it's not essential. Honestly, like

28
00:03:48.630 --> 00:04:04.260
Mitch: But I think because it's like privately owned or maybe because it's so small. It's kinda and it's probably because you don't have a lot of cases up there. Would you say there's you don't have a lot of yeah people with

29
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.700
Shawn Phalen: The virus.

30
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.320
Mitch: I think there was like

31
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:20.940
Mitch: One for sure and the county. Next up next to us, and there was like rumors of someone having it in our county, but it's not for sure. Right.

32
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.840
Shawn Phalen: So compared to the rest of the country right

33
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:34.230
Mitch: Yeah, yeah. You're in really good shape. So that's probably also why you're a stay open and do business. Yeah.

34
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:48.510
Mitch: Good for you. I'm happy i don't i i was getting kind of worried because I don't like to worry about finances so it's it's it's relieving to be back.

35
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.070
Mitch: See you guys have a baby. Yeah, especially

36
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.510
Mitch: Got a baby coming

37
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.880
Shawn Phalen: Once the baby do

38
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.220
Mitch: July 9 okay

39
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.820
Mitch: Okay, yeah, I'm excited.

40
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.820
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so, yeah, you should be

41
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.160
Shawn Phalen: Very exciting time.

42
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.210
Yeah.

43
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.040
Um,

44
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.510
Okay, what else, anything you want to go over anything you want to

45
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.180
Talk about

46
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.060
Shawn Phalen: How you feeling in your sobriety.

47
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.060
Mitch: I feel good. I'm

48
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.770
Mitch: The only thing that gets me is

49
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.820
Mitch: I've like tempted to use not heroin, but some math, just because

50
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.650
Mitch: Going back to work and like hitting it full time and like

51
00:05:48.060 --> 00:06:00.570
Mitch: It is kinda tempting to have something to motivate me right and I mean I haven't used but like the thoughts there in the back of my mind.

52
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.270
Shawn Phalen: So I wonder if the if the thought is tied to being physically tired.

53
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.220
Mitch: The wall. Yeah, I believe, for sure, because like

54
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:39.420
Mitch: In the morning, since just like I'm dragging ass but I've been also trying to not take as many my my medication. My Suboxone I've been trying to like slowly cut back and I've noticed when I am doing that, like, like if I, I'll take a piece of my my strip and like that thought goes away.

55
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.070
Mitch: So,

56
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.840
Shawn Phalen: So,

57
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.820
Mitch: Here's because oh yeah

58
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.840
Shawn Phalen: So my suggestion is the don't mess around with what you're okay so take it as prescribed.

59
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.940
Mitch: Do not do that do not focus on having to be on Suboxone

60
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:12.150
Mitch: That is, you're, you're going about that in a really backward ass way. Yeah. Makes sense. You want to have

61
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.960
Mitch: How, how much sobriety. Do you have, again, I am eight months clean

62
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.120
Okay.

63
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.150
So,

64
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.250
Don't do that.

65
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.380
Mitch: Yeah, I mean, the only reason is like

66
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.530
Mitch: I kind of catch some shit from my, my parents for

67
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.890
Mitch: Having to be dependent on something.

68
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:57.990
Mitch: And I mean, I tell them you know it's better. I see is better than me stick sticking a needle in my arm, putting who knows what into my system, you know, this is prescribe

69
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.300
Mitch: Right, so, so here's the thing is like at this

70
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:22.590
Shawn Phalen: At this stage, I don't think that you need to hear your parents opinion on that. Yeah, okay, because they're not living your life. They didn't live your addiction. They weren't in your skin living it

71
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.080
And

72
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.700
Shawn Phalen: With the Suboxone you are able to have a productive life.

73
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.690
Mitch: Normal function live. Yeah, totally. You are

74
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.770
Mitch: To be present. You get up, you go to work, you have a baby coming

75
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:57.840
Shawn Phalen: So I suggest that you don't even think about the fact that you're on Suboxone you get up, you take it as prescribed.

76
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.120
And

77
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.280
When the time is right to start try trading off of it, then you can start targeting. This is not the time.

78
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:22.260
You have a major life transition coming up having a baby is a huge life experience and it is a huge responsibility.

79
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:35.670
Shawn Phalen: And the fact that if you're not taking the Suboxone as prescribed and you're getting that thought in your head like, Wow, a little bit of math would help me get through this day.

80
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.190
Mitch: There's just a whole issue that I shouldn't SHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER WITH YOU. Right.

81
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:56.430
Nope. Because one thing leads to another leads to another and then your life is back where it was the physical thing.

82
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:10.140
Mitch: Yeah, and that's that's just not an option. At this point, it's not just me anymore. It's like, I got a family that depends on me I couldn't, I couldn't imagine getting arrested or going back to jail.

83
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:27.510
Mitch: Like I could handle it me, but like my family camp. Right. You know, and I just feel like, you know, I mean, is it even a conversation that you need to have with your parents about like

84
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:34.650
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's kind of like how does it. How does it do you just tell them that you're on Suboxone and that

85
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.880
Mitch: Well, yeah.

86
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:53.010
Mitch: I, I was a I had a meeting over there are always out their house and I live in the next town over so I I had had to do a meeting over at their house. Those kind of how they know about it. Well, I mean,

87
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.710
Mitch: I had a meeting with bright heart.

88
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:10.320
Mitch: But I mean, I was totally open with them about the whole thing because they were wondering how my addiction was doing stuff. So I tell them all about it. But yeah.

89
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.520
Mitch: I mean, I can understand where they're coming from, but

90
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.390
Mitch: It's, yeah, you're right. It's just not the time.

91
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.510
Mitch: One thing at a time.

92
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:30.870
Shawn Phalen: One thing at a time, you know, once you hit your year mark, maybe, you know, we can have a conversation about

93
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:46.320
Mitch: Yeah, you know, like, get used to having a newborn in the house, get used to not having sleep get us like you know it's it's a lot of ups and downs, like you're feeling exhausted. You know, you need to be

94
00:11:49.290 --> 00:12:05.940
Mitch: Are you guys married or just. No, not yet. So, you know, you and your, your girlfriend need to be supportive of each other right this is I'm telling you, like, you guys. You need to be there for each other. You can't do that if you're smoking now right

95
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:18.870
Mitch: Yeah, that's we were nothing. We were opposite of supportive right you're using right. Did you use with her. I did, yeah. Before she found out she was pregnant.

96
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.840
Mitch: And that's another thing I can't obviously

97
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:30.510
Mitch: I couldn't put her in that position, because if I were using she would want to use. And that's obviously a no no

98
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:39.630
Mitch: She has, you know, you have her daughter to right yeah of course, you know, so that's, you know,

99
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.290
You don't want to make her daughter go through

100
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.480
Mitch: Any using, you know, like that.

101
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.360
Mitch: Yeah. Yes.

102
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.170
Mitch: It's a terrible thought you saying it out loud and makes it even

103
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:03.000
Mitch: Worse, right, because you know she she doesn't your daughter doesn't want that she she doesn't

104
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:14.310
Mitch: You know, so we're better parents off of it. Anyways, right, much, much better parents and how long ago. How long have you guys been together a year.

105
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.480
Mitch: Moved kind of quick

106
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.990
How did you meet her.

107
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.320
Mitch: I'm just through

108
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.930
Mitch: Acquaintances

109
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.710
Mitch: Is actually like a trap house. I hate to say but

110
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:42.270
Mitch: That she met she found me when I was full blown using heroin and stuff though.

111
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.440
Mitch: So she kind of pulled me out of that whole circle.

112
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.160
Mitch: She's one of like the main reasons I quit doing heroin.

113
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.060
So she stopped before you

114
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.710
Mitch: Yes, she never did heroin.

115
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.900
Mitch: Yeah.

116
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.880
Mitch: She, she quit before me.

117
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.440
Mitch: And is she in the program know

118
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.270
Mitch: Does she go to meetings or push you go into meetings. No, no.

119
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.870
Mitch: And she was with her family. She has short um

120
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:31.020
Mitch: Yeah, she has a couple sisters that she's close with but they are. They don't know honestly about

121
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.620
Mitch: The extent of her addiction.

122
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.060
Mitch: But

123
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:54.420
Mitch: Now she's so she's so strong that not aspect, like when she was done, she's done she she realized herself that she wasn't a good parent on and she she couldn't do that to her daughter. Yeah.

124
00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:05.010
Mitch: So have you told her about the thoughts that you're having. Yeah, she's one of my main one of my main, main people like

125
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.680
Mitch: Yeah, I

126
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:14.730
Mitch: Yeah, she's like the main reason I don't like follow through with those thoughts. Okay, good.

127
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.040
Shawn Phalen: So it's like when you talk to her about it. It's like you're telling on yourself.

128
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:28.650
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, right. And so when you tell on yourself, you have less of a chance of actually following through thoughts.

129
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.670
Yeah.

130
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:42.270
Mitch: When you get those thoughts, you know, talk to her about it, you know, just be really, you know, as long as you're really open about it and you're really honest about it.

131
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:59.220
Mitch: Yeah, and I am. That's like that. That's why I do it. Like, you're right. I tell them myself. So I can have her help with, you know, encouraging me not to. So, and also, you know, when you talk about it and you telling yourself. It takes the power out of it.

132
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:06.870
Mitch: Yeah, you're right, because there's a lot of power and force behind thoughts abusing

133
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:18.150
Mitch: You know, it just can bring you back to where you can romanticize, it, it's, you know, think that it's not going to do

134
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.780
Mitch: Justice how quickly a thought can turn into right now.

135
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:30.990
Shawn Phalen: And so it's like you have to have a lot of respect for where your addiction can take you

136
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.800
Mitch: Know it's being very respectful.

137
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.680
Mitch: What because it's a monster can turn into a monster very fast.

138
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:42.900
So,

139
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:54.240
Mitch: knowing yourself is one coping skill. So that's what we would call it coping skill. The other coping skills like make sure you're getting enough rest if you're feeling fatigued.

140
00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:05.040
Mitch: And if you're feeling like almost like that feeling of fatigue as a trigger for you, then you need, you know, you need to know that you have to get

141
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:21.600
Mitch: Back or have to do something that's gonna help you to not feel so tired. So I don't know if it's like taking vitamins. If it's getting an hour more sleep a night and that's

142
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:37.770
Mitch: Now I want to sleep. Hell, early the other night, and like I got like eight hours, nine hours of sleep, and I was weird enough. I was more tired than I was the night before when I got like five hours of sleep.

143
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.790
Mitch: I was like, whoa, like drastically sluggish.

144
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.690
Mitch: Dude, so the thing is is like what you want to try and do is maintain a

145
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:59.310
Mitch: Regular sleeping schedule, you know, go to bed at the same time wake up at the same time. So if you only need seven hours of sleep. Just make sure you're getting seven hours of sleep.

146
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:20.220
Mitch: But you know I'm five hours of sleep continually is probably not a good idea, catch up. Yeah, it catches up with you. And so you want to that and that's like that's self care right that yeah you know it's part of being clean part of being

147
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:29.760
Mitch: You know, it's paying attention to your body painted your thoughts and how you're feeling internally. Then I found like

148
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:47.820
Mitch: I've been drinking a lot more water cuz since it started getting hot I sweat a lot. I work in, and I was dehydrated for a minute and it like takes a toll on your body does, but I've been. I've been making sure I drink a bunch of water at work. I stuff and it makes you feel so much better.

149
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.910
Water, food sleep.

150
00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:04.230
Mitch: You know, and you know just maintaining maintaining that healthy lifestyle, you know, keep it really simple right now. Very simple. Nothing needs to be complicated. Okay.

151
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:24.300
Mitch: You know, it's like you've got eight months. That's great. You know your goals to make it to a year. Right. And, you know, then more things open up for you. And you know, just keep doing what you're doing but pay attention, pay pay attention to your thoughts and to how you feel internally.

152
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.100
And also externally concert external triggers to

153
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:38.910
Mitch: Write. Okay. So, good job. Like you talk to me about it. You talk to your girlfriend about it so

154
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.370
Shawn Phalen: When that happens when somebody tells me that I know that you're there on the right track.

155
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:51.810
Shawn Phalen: And I know that they're serious about their sobriety. So you know you didn't push it around, right.

156
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.680
Right.

157
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.850
Mitch: Good, yeah, I would hate to drag drag her like my family down with me. Yeah.

158
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.290
Mitch: Yeah, it's not just myself anymore. It's not

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:20.790
E D: I mean, what's new is basically the scheduling the appointment with a new provider that hopefully will be able to prescribe me my ADHD medication. That'll help a lot. Okay. Okay. So look for that. That's supposed to punish

197
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:22.470
Okay.

198
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.020
E D: All right.

199
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.060

Shawn Phalen: What are you looking forward

202
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.470
E D: To that appointment and hopefully getting that started

203
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.750
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, okay. That's awesome. And it's hurt.

204
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.550
E D: Yeah yeah that's true by heart.

205
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.520
Shawn Phalen: Right. Okay, good. You must be relieved. I know that's a big issue for you.

206
00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.050
E D: And

207
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:09.750
E D: Your husband has been my whole life. And I'm relieved that finally getting some help with this. Yeah, I've been. I've been trying since I was a eight

208
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.390
E D: Yeah, right.

209
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.470
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so

210
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.020
Shawn Phalen: Do you want to

211
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:28.590
Shawn Phalen: Do you continue to meet with me or tell me what you because I know your main goal was to get that medication. Right.

212
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.680
E D: If they if they require me to continue meeting with you guys like

213
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.230
E D: I know they kind of do

214
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:50.100
E D: They want to keep track of like my. If not, then that's fine. Of course, I mean with you it's a lot easier to talk to you as an individual done in the group.

215
00:24:50.340 --> 00:25:00.900
E D: Yeah yeah so hard to talk over other people in the group. I don't have a hard enough time doing this as it is because, well, that might change. So once I get the medication.

216
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:13.170
Shawn Phalen: Thinking like that's kind of what I'm like my what I'm thinking is like once you get on the medication that's going to help you keep a little bit more guest and like how like maybe we

217
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.690
E D: Can think of stuff you want to go over

218
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.620
E D: Does that

219
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.820
Does that sound right.

220
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.390
E D: Yeah, that sounds right.

221
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:32.460
Shawn Phalen: Because I mean I'm more than happy like if you have some stuff you want to discuss. We can absolutely do that. I just know that

222
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.440
It gets a little agitating for you because you're not having your medication.

223
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:50.460
E D: I know, I know. I try not to get. I try not to. But like, okay, yes. I mean, I sent I sent her over for half an hour staring at a blank screen.

224
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.220
E D: waiting and waiting and that's interesting, too.

225
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.510
Shawn Phalen: Yeah I don't blame you.

226
00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.040
E D: I don't know what happened.

227
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:10.170
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I don't know what happened either. It didn't come through. I think it's are you good the connection isn't very good where you are. Is it

228
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:25.680
E D: Um, it's a it's a broadband connection is pretty good. This is streams Netflix and everything. I just don't know if our software is being slow today or something that could probably be what

229
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.160
Shawn Phalen: It is because you're freezing like you're kind of breaking up.

230
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.740
E D: So I'm kind of wondering if that

231
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.670
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, kind of wondering because it's it's it's kind of

232
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.940
Difficult to hear you.

233
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.960
E D: I'm sorry, I don't

234
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.220
E D: Know what say like, it's totally

235
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.160
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, no, it's fine. It's not your fault.

236
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.710

239
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.960
E D: Possibly. I'm not, I'm not sure I'm not the real look at the email.

Shawn Phalen: Hey,

241
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.000

E D: I believe so. I believe it could be that person.

243
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.970
Okay.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.740

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.620
E D: It's, it's been a long time and it's gonna be a lot longer.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:13.110
E D: I still have to the pharmacy and I hate going there. I am so scared to go there.

252
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:20.790
E D: I were like a masculine yeah I wear this this giant mask that has canisters on it.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:25.890
E D: Know,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.250
E D: If I could literally wear a hazmat suit.

256
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.070
Shawn Phalen: So you are afraid of catching it.

257
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.330
E D: Well yeah, I mean, in our area as just

258
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:51.000
E D: Pull that just don't even think about it like a lot of the people in this area, don't even think they don't even realize it. Those are the people that are going to get infected and pass it on like this whole thing worse.

259
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.170
Shawn Phalen: So you guys haven't reached the peak yet. Is that what you're saying.

Wow.

267
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:36.660
E D: Okay. That's because people don't take, I think it's because people don't take it seriously.

268
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.320
Shawn Phalen: Could be definitely. I know.

269
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:49.170

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.890
Shawn Phalen: Other food banks.

291
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.970
Shawn Phalen: Have their, their

292
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:12.990
Things.

293
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:25.920
E D: Yeah, there are. And like we have food right now okay I'm different came down to that I'm really scared to go to any of those places. So

294
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.020
E D: Will your girlfriend. Go. Is she is. She scared to go

295
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:40.470
E D: Yeah, she's, she's even more scared than I am likes she actually as a

296
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.340
E D: Immune immune deficiency.

297
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.160
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so

298
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.380
E D: In that respect, I'm, I'm afraid I'm afraid to give it to her.

299
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.630
Shawn Phalen: Okay, but if you wear a mask and if you are

300
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:03.840
Yeah.

301
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:23.580
E D: Hey, I know that they tell us that yeah yeah and and use all the old stuff. I know, I know, but it's still scary if people are still getting sick people are still dying. I read somewhere that in China. People are getting infected twice now.

302
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.700
E D: The second time around. It's way worse. So

303
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:33.990
E D: China stay focused on what's in front of us here, and I know

304
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:41.850
E D: China will first, you know, and Italy was second and then you know we're even worse off than both of them now in the numbers so

305
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:51.600
E D: I'm just following what's going on. I'm not, I'm not being oblivious to it and taking that everything's gonna be okay cuz right now, everything's not our countries and and

306
00:33:52.830 --> 00:34:06.990
E D: Something that we've never been in before and I don't want to be right. I don't want to be one of those numbers. I'm sorry, but I really like to, and I can protect my family. Right. It means sitting away from everything

307
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.020
E D: Right, exactly.

308
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:16.350
Shawn Phalen: But you know, I just don't need to be so scared that you don't get food, you need to go get food.

309
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.900
Okay, I just want to make sure. Okay.

310
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:27.990
Yeah.

311
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:42.900
E D: I think my prescription. I don't know if you can check this, but I think my prescription for Suboxone has been sent to my pharmacy and I wanted to find out what exactly they did about that.

312
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.580
What do you mean if they sent it or not.

313
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.740
E D: Yet, cuz I ran. I ran out last night.

314
00:34:53.880 --> 00:35:08.100
E D: And I called in to verify my appointment. Yeah, I did. I talked to someone yesterday and they said they were going to talk to Dr fig and let them know you know the circumstances and and

315
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:20.700
E D: And and send me and get a script or something, but I never got an email or nothing, saying that I do that and then then my pharmacy, send me email saying there was one to pick up so

316
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:28.650
E D: I'm wondering is that it like I'm sure that's it you need to call the pharmacy, though, and ask, are they still open.

317
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.380
E D: was hoping to get there before they close

318
00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:39.690
Shawn Phalen: Though it's seven o'clock. What time do they close. I know the cold.

319
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.380
E D: Very close. I think a

320
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.950
Shawn Phalen: Okay, how long does it take you to get their

321
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.260
E D: Power. Okay.

322
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:59.970
Shawn Phalen: So here's what I want to do. We're going to schedule another appointment, because they want to be able to get there on time before they close. Okay.

323
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:08.400
E D: I kind of thought we were going to start this meeting a lot earlier than I thought I'd have more time.

324
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.890
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I kind of thought so too.

325
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:16.860
Shawn Phalen: Okay.

326
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.970
Shawn Phalen: What if we do May six at, can you do 730

327
