Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

103
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:06.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, so, Jerry. There's a lot of patients that are experiencing the job loss.

104
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:27.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From Cobra 19 and so I saw this rap and I thought it was good to just garner some conversation in regards to the impact of this. The question is, who do I want to be during this process. So if you notice here in the stage of fear.

105
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:33.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's over buying food the necessities things you may not need

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: After now and worry and anger.

107
01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:46.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Giving information automatically watching a nuisance obsessively and being impatient right if you're in this dynamic

108
01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:52.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is a stage of fear. Do you identify with any of these characteristics.

109
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.820
Jerry Howard: Of your words.

110
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.950
Jerry Howard: Like a

111
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:00.630
BlackBerry.

112
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.550
Jerry Howard: I'm

113
01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:05.760
Jerry Howard: So worried you know like

Jerry Howard: Tidy

117
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.790
Jerry Howard: And like, wait, we went through and

118
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:21.090
Jerry Howard: Play and Hulu and

119
01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.320
Jerry Howard: Now, now, now while we're

120
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.510
Jerry Howard: Out of both of our checks at the end of the month.

121
01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.550
Jerry Howard: Roughly half laughs

122
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.990
Jerry Howard: Because we know like

123
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.090
Jerry Howard: $50 a week.

124
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.110
Jerry Howard: They all have roughly around

125
01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.420
Jerry Howard: Four or 500

126
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:54.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What about food stamps. So you are eligible for food stamps.

127
01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.780
Jerry Howard: Not really sure, I'm sure.

128
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:18.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Identify with when you start to let go of anything that's outside of your control.

129
01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:30.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This, this is some of the things that we talked about last session identifying your feelings and emotions and then being able to cope with them, minimizing their exposure to the news.

130
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:48.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Contemplating and awareness to the changing and helping yourself to manage processing the information and then filtering before just automatically sharing and then understanding that you're doing the best that you can right now.

131
01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:53.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you identify with any of these characteristics.

132
01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:58.500
Jerry Howard: Like

133
01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.600
Jerry Howard: Letting go of my

134
01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.020
Jerry Howard: Friends work. Now that that's out of my control because of the code.

135
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.320
Jerry Howard: NOT WORRIED ABOUT

136
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.140
Jerry Howard: That

137
01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:25.800
Jerry Howard: Because I feel like God wants me to know no matter what I do.

138
01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:30.000
Jerry Howard: Good. Either way, no, um,

139
01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:40.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any characteristic here that you don't have, but that you want to work towards

140
01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.040
Jerry Howard: Changing

141
01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.440
Jerry Howard: Really can't

142
01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:02.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Get cultivate awareness to the changing situation and feel better able to manage

143
01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what that means.

144
01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:04.620
Jerry Howard: Is

145
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:13.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Being aware that this situation continues to change. And so in the changing. You're just learning how to manage through the changes.

146
01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:23.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, um, you know, that statement of having the awareness and the acceptance to just the thing that you cannot change is being there.

147
01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:35.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: it aligns with this comment of understanding that you're doing the best you can. So a lot of people have been given on furloughed they lost their job. They don't know when they're expected to report.

148
01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:46.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know here in Florida. They keep giving us different days of when the kids may return to school in the back of our minds, all the parents are like these kids are going back to this year.

149
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:59.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's managing those things. It's, you know, preparing for the long term for the worst case situation and then the bit that it gets better than hey whoa, we'll celebrate that. But

150
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:16.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From what I'm hearing. You guys are good in the sense that you've already established a budget, you've already eliminated the things that is not a need. At this point, you guys are really focused on just taking care of the needs and not the ones at this

151
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:19.770
Jerry Howard: Yeah.

152
01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:35.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's that's vital because this process is hard for people once take a lot, a lot of our, our long gains and are being right so not being able to access those once. How has that been for you.

153
01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you hear me, Jerry.

154
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:46.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're on mute.

155
01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.040
Jerry Howard: Bye.

156
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:39.630

161
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:49.080
Jerry Howard: That you know that stress and whatnot. It's actually been really good for

162
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:51.030
Jerry Howard: That kind of

163
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:54.960
Jerry Howard: Guy.

164
01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.020
Jerry Howard: Know each other.

165
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:10.380
Jerry Howard: Because she got a new mattress.

166
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:13.140
Jerry Howard: And we had some

167
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:39.690
Jerry Howard: love what I do, or no, I don't bother me. I'm not really sure.

168
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:50.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's interesting. So, since you're outbursts. You feel it as a positive shift your step daughter, she's a little more connected with

169
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.980
Jerry Howard: People in her bedroom clean light up ago we had to stop, but she

170
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:10.680
Jerry Howard: Ever bedroom.

171
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.360
Jerry Howard: Floor.

172
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.730
Jerry Howard: Plan.

173
01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:33.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The outbursts or after you started spending time with her like building the bed training on

174
01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:43.110
Jerry Howard: Our site our site after I started my when I would go to the store.

175
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.020
Jerry Howard: I would ask her if she would go away.

176
01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.220
Jerry Howard: After spending time with me.

177
01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.010
Jerry Howard: She was just crying for attention.

178
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:12.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And one of that quality time where the time does it, you know, based on doing chores, but it was going out to the stove you building that bed.

179
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:26.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's amazing book. It's called the five love languages by Gary Chapman and he has it for adults, and he has four kids, and he describes how people receive love.

180
01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:32.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: physical touch acts of service words of affirmation.

181
01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.380
Jerry Howard: receiving gifts and qualities, what what what what

182
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, Gary Chapman, the five love languages.

183
01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:47.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He has it for adults. And he also has children.

184
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:54.240
Jerry Howard: Okay.

185
01:15:55.980 --> 01:16:04.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Girl, and it's pretty cool because even if you Google it, like they have different tasks that you could take so that you could learn your love languages with your

186
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:22.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wife says take it you gotta take it because they say that all of us have there's five different ways that we give and receive love. And all of us have like a top preference of how we want to be loved these five categories physical touch.

187
01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:41.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: acts of service means doing things for people like washing dishes washing the car I'm receiving gifts, which is self explanatory, you buying different stuff and it doesn't matter. The price value is just buying gifts quality time

188
01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And words of affirmation.

189
01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:46.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

190
01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:54.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The premise behind this is that everyone has a primary thing that just makes them feel so loved and connected with other people.

191
01:16:54.780 --> 01:17:13.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it would be interesting if you had your step daughter, take the test and find out what really gets her. What makes her feel connected to other people. And if she says quality time when you're right, maybe what she doesn't do certain things. Because really, she just wants to be loved.

192
01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:30.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they say that when our love take is like say on he amount for we tend to the plate and my arm are not be the best to be around because we're not getting the love that we want and the type of love that.

193
01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:40.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what's interesting is that for instance Jerry's say if your love language was giving gifts. You may always buy gifts for your wife or for your dog.

194
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:50.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if their love language was words of affirmation of quality time they would be thankful for it, but it wouldn't measure up and wouldn't make them feel connected

195
01:17:51.720 --> 01:18:06.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So Google it and take the quiz. I think will be a fun little activity for you guys to do you know why you're all at home and be able to access that and learn more about each other and how you guys give and receive love.

196
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:12.330
Jerry Howard: Okay, other than others.

197
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:14.880
Jerry Howard: Wow, I wanted to know what it was.

198
01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:27.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, it's very interesting. And every now and then you may feel yourself feeling disconnected and then you'll realize my love language is not being filled

199
01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and that's usually the reason and when each of you have the understanding of Berlin London which is also an additional resource. You could use and communicating and me.

200
01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:45.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So for instance, if you don't feel connected with, you know, your lady instead of saying, how are you close to your, something like that.

201
01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:50.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You could probably say, you know, my love language job whenever it is fill in the blank.

202
01:18:50.970 --> 01:19:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is not being fulfilled, or, you know, I'm feeling like I'm running on he because my love language is not being and so it kind of helps the other person to identify what's the best way to support you and build connections.

203
01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The next one I wanted to discuss

204
01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:12.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is our faith stage of growth right here.

205
01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:25.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this one is think of others and you try to help them. I use my skills and allow other people to benefit from them. I try to live in the present moment.

206
01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:46.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have compassion. Compassion towards myself and others. I appreciate and cherish my loved ones I try to be positive and maintain an optimistic outlook. I practice patience creativity enterprise and basic challenges and I cultivate modesty and actively listen to others.

207
01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:52.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In characteristic dragon identifying the stage of growth within the zoom in for you.

208
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:13.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: At the come out. So it says, I think of others and try to help them.

209
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:23.220
Jerry Howard: I do that quite often, especially when my lighting and

210
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:45.600
Jerry Howard: I'm not

211
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.210
Jerry Howard: Sure. I don't know what was called

212
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.130
Jerry Howard: I'm not sure.

213
01:20:52.500 --> 01:21:06.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would be a good conversation. A good check in, you know, with her of saying, hey, I noticed that, you know, despite everything that's going on. You been able to be calm. You know what's working for you.

214
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:21.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because then that helps her to the also notice through was feels, am I using to stay calm. And then the next time she gets back into that interest mood. She may recall this time where she was able to exhibit calmness.

215
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:33.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is why we asked these type of questions and therapy because when you happy awareness of a skill set that he used in other times of distress. You can go back to it.

216
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:42.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oftentimes, we don't we don't recognize to identify how well we're doing in the midst of a trauma, Rob.

217
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:53.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we often look at a neutron presents itself. And we think it's the end of the world are we worry or we get frustrated or we have the outburst, like you mentioned,

218
01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:13.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But now that you have some tools on the your belt and you realize Blackie communicate that I feel I need. I understand. I can use that. And last time I noticed it was a difference for me. And so the next time you feel like you're getting activated, you would use the same skill.

219
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:23.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you asked your lady, she would know. Do you think she would be able to identify what's working for her.

220
01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:30.750
Jerry Howard: Yeah.

221
01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:44.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Challenges you're having in either the stage of learning the stage of growth or the stage of fear.

222
01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:59.040
Jerry Howard: Probably

223
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:15.690
Jerry Howard: angry, frustrated and daddy worry all of that. And that's not knowing know what's gonna happen.

224
01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:18.810
Jerry Howard: We've got laid off and

225
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:26.550
Jerry Howard: I was bringing in over $1,000 a week, and now I'm only bringing up for our

226
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:28.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Refer

227
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:44.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, can I just assure you that this is a natural response to have. There's nothing wrong with the fact that you have anxiety, frustration, where we and that may, that may look like anger.

228
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:57.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anyone in this position in this predicament would be fearful would be anxious, if they weren't. I would say that maybe they lack responsibility and accountability. Right.

229
01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.880
Jerry Howard: Those are the care for people that could care.

230
01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:00.240
Less

231
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:12.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is while it's not the best state to be in a pattern this anxiety this frustration is worried. I want to show you that, given your situation, it's okay.

232
01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:18.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's okay to feel this. But what we want to work on is just how we behave with

233
01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:22.350
Jerry Howard: The thought of how

234
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:33.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The feeling of worry the feeling of frustration and anxiety is fine, but the work that you want to have is, okay, how would you respond

235
01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:47.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Instead of react to this. How would you respond and you're doing it right now. You should have for individual session, we could have been doing anything else you show them.

236
01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:55.980
Jerry Howard: What the Hell no. I've been on top of that.

237
01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:01.890
Jerry Howard: I've never

238
01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:06.750
Jerry Howard: I've never had.

239
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:08.340
Jerry Howard: One.

240
01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:23.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're resourceful, Jerry. The fact that you would tell them that you have a move out of the place and you were able to get a new place for your family within a matter of days.

241
01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:39.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's something to to acknowledge you know that, wow, despite everything I'm doing the best that I can, and my best is looking pretty good right now that I can still find a roof over my family's head.

242
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:45.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's some people that are you're saying

243
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:53.340
Look at it.

244
01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.630
Jerry Howard: That's a positive way to look at it, you don't worry as much about

245
01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:06.450
Jerry Howard: It's not really

246
01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:21.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. So, acknowledging that feeling, you know, when you feel it.

247
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:29.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just acknowledging. Hey, Jerry. This is really stressful. Right now I'm feeling anxious right now.

248
01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:39.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then once you speak it out, it gives you an opportunity to now saw how am I going to deal with this environment. Am I going to go for a walk.

249
01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:57.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Am I going to look at my budget, again, that gives me the assurance that I have a plan in place, you know, am I going to see if there's any side work that I can do. Am I going to see whatever resources, I can pull together that is what's going to be the comfort right now.

250
01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:11.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The anxiety and frustration and the worry probably won't go away until you actually start working again because you've been working taking a lot of pride in the work that you do and how you provide for your family. That's okay.

251
01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:34.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you have these feelings you acknowledge it. You give it a number so that you can separate yourself from it because Jerry is not anxious to Jerry has some thoughts. That's creating the feeling of anxiety. That sounds totally different from Jerry is anxious right now.

252
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:39.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that gives the anxiety power over you.

253
01:27:42.810 --> 01:27:50.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so that's what I want you to do this. Whenever you have that feeling of fear, anxiety or frustration, given a number

254
01:27:51.750 --> 01:28:08.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On the scale of one to 10 how how anxious. Do I feel, given the number. Look at that number and then say it. For example, if you're at a six. What can I do right now to bring my anxiety tool for

255
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:12.870
Jerry Howard: Something reason

256
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.430
Jerry Howard: Why, my channel that Russia. Russia.

257
01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.250
Jerry Howard: Body.

258
01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:24.240
Yeah.

259
01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:27.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

260
01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Give it a number, give it a reasonable number because right now thinking that the anxiety of the frustration of the worries going to go to a zero back not reasonable. All of us, even those that have jobs and security, the enzyme to the frustration, the worries, not having zero

261
01:28:47.520 --> 01:29:00.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because of everything that's going on. So give yourself grace and know strive for a number that's more feasible if you're at a six think how can I get to a four. And when you get to that for celebrate that for

262
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:09.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that gives you the power to know that you can regulate your own emotion. You're in control, not the emotion.

263
01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:30.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. So these are the these are the emotions you want to monitor this fear, anxiety, frustration, worry. And as you said, these are the ones. Is there one either like two or three that you're feeling the most at this time.

264
01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:34.680
Jerry Howard: I'm

265
01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.760
Jerry Howard: Sorry brush.

266
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:40.380
Jerry Howard: Over

267
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:42.480
Jerry Howard: The top three

268
01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:59.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so you put all those up worry, anxiety, frustration, you put three columns and then you put your roles to put your bros, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

269
01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:17.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then you do a self check. Today's Tuesday, right, was it was it Wednesday.

270
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of my days. Okay, it's Tuesday.

271
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.160
So,

272
01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:26.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. So you look at it.

273
01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:47.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You look at the time, and you say, all right, it's Tuesday. Let me see. It's very worried your frustration here. And if it is, give it that number write down the number and then whatever that number is strive to make it lower but whatever seems most practical for you.

274
01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then if you're able to get to that number.

275
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:59.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Put something that represents you celebrating a thumbs up a checkmark whatever that looks like for you.

276
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:08.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you want to be over a period of time. By the time you get to Sunday. I want you to be able to look at each day of the week and see what emotions were present.

277
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:16.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I want you to be able to celebrate and receive whatever symbol you choose that Jeremy was able to get his number lower

278
01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:25.410
Jerry Howard: So like for example I could I could like a Malik.

279
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:35.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that would be good. You can you imagine at the end of the week if you saw that you had anger, where you frustration throughout the week.

280
01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:48.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That even despite all of that you have three happy faces that would make me look and say, wow, despite all of that I was able to get it together on three occasions.

281
01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not as bad as I thought it was

282
01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:59.640
Jerry Howard: Because I'm, I'm really bad about my anger.

283
01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:00.330
Temper

284
01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:03.180
Jerry Howard: So,

285
01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:12.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

286
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For you, the worry

287
01:32:17.670 --> 01:32:19.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The frustration.

288
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.640

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:10.830
Jerry Howard: I'm

312
01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:17.910
Jerry Howard: Craving alcohol. So instead of acting urges

313
01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:24.840
Jerry Howard: Got my lady to come with me, and we just drove around, you know, like a mile or two.

314
01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:28.740
Jerry Howard: Clear that and then we came back.

315
01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:37.440

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:40.830
Jerry Howard: Understand that

317
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:55.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that moment was a red flag thought the thought was that, you know, you were justifying if you do the alcohol is not a big deal because it uses not drones.

318
01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:12.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the good thing is you cut you cut it and questioned it in the challenge that thought that one only been like alcohol that's never been my drug of choice. Where is this coming from and then you went to the next coping skill distraction.

319
01:36:13.890 --> 01:36:25.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then he took it a step further. He activated. Your support system, your girlfriend. Do you see that series of that is relapse prevention plan like right there.

324
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the addict brain says who's not drugs or alcohol.

325
01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:13.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You because of the RP because of the therapy and the emotional awareness, you realize, Oh no, I don't want to do that. So you activate it, you're sober brain.

326
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:30.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're sober brain reminded you extraction tools and who your support system was and utilize how to allow the adult brain keep speaking to you and we'll have convinced you that alcoholism is ok because it's natural.

327
01:37:33.570 --> 01:37:36.120
