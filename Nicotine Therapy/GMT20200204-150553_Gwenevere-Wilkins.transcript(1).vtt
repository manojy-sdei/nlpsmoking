61
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.440
Benny Chavez: Oh, I haven't got it yet. I did the judge when I went back to the courtroom.

62
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.340
Benny Chavez: He must mistaken me for somebody else because he's he's invoke my license for a whole year. I just wanted to get out of jail.

63
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:37.890
Benny Chavez: I was just like, just let me out, man. I'll fix it when a kid out just to get them out these so when he did that as a child support ticket away. I don't think he realized that I already had my license before that he thought I was driving on the repo.

64
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't care. To clarify, you just wanted out of jail.

65
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:53.100
Benny Chavez: While I was trying to clarify, but it was just everybody's in a rush, and I was just trying to get out. I, I know Thursday's day to go see him we finished our last time.

66
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.820
Yeah.

67
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.830
Benny Chavez: Fingers and we'll talk to him. Okay.

68
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to do it or you're just

69
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.620
Benny Chavez: Going to take because Toronto. I'm going to do it.

70
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing anything else that we get in the way of that.

71
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:19.740
Benny Chavez: I'm I'm getting all the stuff I have, I mean, because I think he really thought it was something else, he thought I was driving on revoked. And that wasn't the case I had got my license back

72
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I, what I mean by is when you say I'm going to go on Thursday when I'm asking you is, is there anything that is going to get in your way of getting on the bus and getting down there, you know,

73
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What time are you going to leave.

74
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.500
Benny Chavez: Six in the morning.

75
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Thursday.

76
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: People boo, take a bus. Because really we got, you know, we live in a society. Nowadays, we gotta have transportation. I mean,

77
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:59.220
Benny Chavez: Yeah, and the bad part about it was my mom user is using my car right now like to get back

78
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.500
Benny Chavez: On her name so

79
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going to extend this goal, and you're gonna put put work into it because you want to have your license.

80
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.300
Benny Chavez: And let's see if

81
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: A judge can get clear and you'd say, you know what you need to bring with you.

82
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:25.800
Benny Chavez: Yeah, I know. I already have everything already. I got it off the website from to do MTD

83
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:26.850
Nice.

84
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.580
Benny Chavez: Child support all that's current to

85
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How often are you, this is a different goal. This is not one that you said it's one that I include in everyone's treatment plan.

86
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to think about how spirituality or your religion, your faith in God affects your recovery. How often are you right because you did have a slip you used math. So how often like right right in that space. Did you forget to go to God does like what happened.

87
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:12.720
Benny Chavez: I really did. I really did. I've been so confused, since I got out of jail and everything. I lost my job. You saw the double whammy is right back right and you start making excuses, look what's happened to me. I lost everything. I

88
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:22.950
Benny Chavez: Kind of blame everything else. And it's like I'm I need to just I I'm taking responsibility now. That's the first step. So yes, so

89
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yesterday's discussion about right guilt is taking responsibility versus shame, which you just want to stay in bed and not not be you.

90
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's so overwhelming. So in your language today, you're, you're in your solution. And that's exciting because it's more hopeful there to say, well, I

91
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a crummy part of my life right now I've got a lot to work on.

92
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me ask you.

93
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.270
Um,

94
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice like when

95
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You were using prayer and then it stopped. Like, do you remember you were using it, something happened with this, but then this happened and then all bets are off. And instead of prayer you went to a false god, which is drug

96
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:21.480
Benny Chavez: You know, I could tell you go in after my brother day that kind of like told me, like, is there really a God is all

97
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.100
Benny Chavez: My family and I used to be real spiritual when I was younger, I believe it or not.

98
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:32.550
Benny Chavez: I mean, I will leave my hands on my mom. She is unrealistic, you know, this night and she said she could feel like this five in me.

99
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:38.880
Benny Chavez: That I have this spirituality and I lost it somewhere down the line. And when I lost my wife and everything. That's when I said

100
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.520
Benny Chavez: I just want to live, no more. I had a gun to my head. Just to let you know I had a gun to my head. Anyway, thought I.

101
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:56.070
Benny Chavez: Wanted to say I never thought in a million years, but I really almost did. And it's just kind of scary because I never thought I'd be doing something like that. And for me to go that

102
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.200
Benny Chavez: It's pretty pretty bad.

103
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It is pretty bad. Whereas that gun now.

104
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.700
Benny Chavez: I don't have it.

105
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Who is what this was it.

106
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.330
Benny Chavez: Was my buddies.

107
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And where's your buddy.

108
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:15.330
Benny Chavez: Oh, he's not around them one she's came from Oskar Eustis other data come see me and he had in his car and

109
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.760
Benny Chavez: He was just on my cousin's house because all my mom's my mom's neighbors. They're like my uncle's were all related. So it's so easy to

110
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:36.180
Benny Chavez: That's why I don't like being around here because she knows it's severe anxiety and you know it's not easy to stay clean around here. I'm not saying, Yeah, I can't do it. I just didn't like doing but

111
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.130
Benny Chavez: It is possible.

112
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, how many miles away as last Christmas from where you are now.

113
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.470
Benny Chavez: I'm about to 300 okay

114
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do not have access anymore to a gun or other Lethal Weapon.

115
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.420
No. Okay.

116
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: About 200 miles away it. Does that scare you, that it got that bad.

117
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.290
Benny Chavez: Yeah, I didn't think. And then after that I was just like crying like I was at my wit's end and I even said like I do want to live, you know,

118
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:18.540
Benny Chavez: I told myself I put my myself and my mom shoes because she just lost a son and I choose because I was like, oh no, they did that pain for them being variable unbearable.

119
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.520
Okay.

120
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: My son's pain would be unbearable. So you're going to bear the pain of living. Okay. And maybe for now it's it's it's it's just surviving. But later on.

121
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Benny. Let's work towards thriving, not just surviving. Okay, let's work towards that this isn't any kind of life to have it. Get that bad. So this might be a real awakening the next six months of your life or so might be a real awakening for you. It might be exciting. Instead of terrifying.

122
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.250
Benny Chavez: I'm so scared. Yeah.

123
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, did you notice you know how you said in group, you said it seems like you're speaking directly to me, you know, doesn't it seem like you went to shame. I'm unworthy. This is I can't solve this, and you want to guess what you want to do you want to die.

124
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

125
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.530
Benny Chavez: Weird

126
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.850
I know

127
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.530
Benny Chavez: That's weird. Like, I feel myself coming out of the shell. Yeah.

128
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is true for everyone. That's why when I say everyone I recommend you detox from shame. The second took and how to recognize it is the second to catch yourself name.

129
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.520
Benny Chavez: Falling I am

130
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm worthless. I'm an A hole. I'm whatever as soon as you catch a name call inside your head. Stop push it away and say,

131
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That will literally lead me to death right and leads to death or addiction, doesn't it, what

132
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.780
Benny Chavez: I got in a fight with my uncle to yesterday.

133
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:07.290
Benny Chavez: My dad's dead now. And he's all training with my mom and to call my brother proceed, my brother, my brother's dead. You know, I was helping them to guard.

134
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:15.090
Benny Chavez: And I just couldn't take it. And he went off on me and I just went off on him and kind of let loose full of couple scrapes and bruises, but

135
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:27.960
Benny Chavez: It's just like, what else can go wrong. Like, cuz my mom's house is out of hand with everything going on my sister just moved out my uncle's face your mother. My dad's best friend is saying, you know, my mom, my dad did know what kind of friends that you know

136
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Any it's not

137
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If you start to see as you get more and more sober.

138
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I start to see what you actually like and don't like not what what what was normalized. When you grow up, but what you actually will not tolerate it anymore. When you start to really get in touch with that.

139
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to have the same friends anymore, right, because you're going to see, oh, you only liked me when I was

140
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing this behavior. You only like me when I was using there wasn't a real connection. You may not like yourself when you're around people anymore.

141
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Those people may fade into the background. And there might be quiet.

142
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: While you grow and develop who you are. There might be some quiet when you don't have a lot of friends. It might happen while you're learning how to set boundaries, how to recognize a healthy person as you become a healthy loving person to yourself and others. Right. Yeah.

143
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how you're seeing. I don't like this guy's behavior. Now, you write for and i and i didn't get to it quite in this last group, I did this morning at seven for some people, the discharge. Notice how you felt better after you hit someone

144
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: All of that right, all of that shame.

145
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so uncomfortable that probably what's happening is, is wanting to be discharged. You don't want to actually have that feeling.

146
00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I can't get behind PUNCHING SOMEONE I can't get behind that I can get behind going for a run punching a bag right doing, taking a karate class or getting in something where you're hitting a heavy bag, something like that, not a person right

147
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You always

148
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:22.860
Benny Chavez: Kind of glad because he was kind of a pain in the ass. Anyway, that's kind of, she said that was a blessing in disguise, because he he comes in here, acting like he owns a house and he doesn't live here.

149
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Take it progressively at least you have the awareness that that dynamic was going on.

150
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be some norms in your in your family Benny an acceptance around violent behavior that isn't isn't mine or isn't your neighbors or isn't this person's with that person. So there's going to be some acceptability around violence that

151
00:16:49.950 --> 00:17:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I might you might hear me sort of saying, well, maybe let's redirect energy to something more compassionate that contributes to health and growth that the solution being violence.

152
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When there's so many other options. Right. It's going to be hard for your therapist me to get behind actually using it as a solution, it will. I will. Kind of have too much by in there.

153
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's go back to you. Let's go back to you. Okay.

154
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:28.560
Benny Chavez: Like I've never, I was always a nice one, the one the jolly, the one the hard worker. You know, my brother was. It was always this one pain and as a scapegoat. This and that. But, uh, now I told myself, almost becoming him like

155
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:36.870
Benny Chavez: This place and it's just like that place is not good because it's dark funnel that was very lonely, you know,

156
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: scapegoat your blame for everything.

157
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your wife, Maddie. Yep. Okay. So she's here.

158
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:46.590
Oh,

159
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.680
Here we go.

160
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.350
Benny Chavez: You plug this in, please. I can't

161
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.360
Benny Chavez: Thank you.

162
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she is tech savvy. Hey, Maggie.

163
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

164
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's do a sound check make sure you can hear me. Can you hear me. I can't hear you just yet. Sometimes it takes a second

165
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Check, check, check.

166
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi. Hi. Oh my gosh, this is so cool.

167
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. I love this is so amazing. So Maddie, are you able to hear and see me okay

168
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, Ma'am, are out. Okay, so we have a half hour. And I wanted to ask you, um,

169
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Next Friday. If we wanted to have a full hour if I have an opening and I was speaking with Benny about it at 7am next Friday. Would that work better if we had like a little bit more time to chit chat, too.

170
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.880
Mady Hernandez: Yeah, that would work a lot better.

171
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're going to do that.

172
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.540
Mady Hernandez: Let's see if we can get a

173
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit. A little bit done here this morning, but let's plan on following up February 14 at 7am

174
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. So in general, Maddie. And I thought what we could do with a little bit of time we have right now is to say

175
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In the back of your mind. What were you thinking like, just very basic, we'll just start way out here just a broad sort of goal, like what you were hoping to get from just even even signing on here today what we think. What was your expectation

176
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:34.650
Mady Hernandez: better communication and for bending to understand boundaries, a little bit more

177
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Oh my gosh. Now you're talking my language, girl.

178
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I love communication and boundaries boy just love love love that. Okay, so, um, I would love to touch boundaries is a really big piece.

179
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But communication effective communication can help facilitate boundaries. So maybe we could start with some very fundamental communication.

180
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That let's say if bending knew it, and you know it, then you had the structure that you could talk about boundaries or whatever because once people have a structure of how to communicate safely without pissing each other off.

181
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we can talk about whatever

182
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. OK, cool. I would love to do that. So I'll get as far as we can today. What I'd like to start with is has. Have you ever been in therapy or anything like that. Is this your first time kind of trying this out.

183
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.010
Mady Hernandez: Now, I've been in counseling and therapy before I had a very rough childhood, so

184
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, well, positive one. We ended up kind of really trusting this therapist. Was it a positive experience.

185
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:48.780
Mady Hernandez: Oh yeah, but I've kind of shied away from doing like the exercises and stuff that my counselor had me doing back when I was like 15 or 16

186
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:55.620
Mady Hernandez: And I recently just started picking it back up probably like two, three days ago. Okay.

187
00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And are those exercises sort of mindfulness self regulation emotional regulation practices and setting boundaries. Is that what she was, she or he was encouraging.

188
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:17.190
Mady Hernandez: No cuz at the time when I was going to counseling. A lot of the time, I wouldn't, I wouldn't talk about my feelings. I want to talk about my issues until I would blow up at the person

189
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:29.580
Mady Hernandez: Yeah, so my counselor had me writing in a journal every day. And then after I wrote in it. He had me burning it so that my feelings were gone, and I didn't hurt anybody's feelings or anything like that. So,

190
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's working for you right now.

191
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:39.870
Mady Hernandez: Um, I haven't. I didn't burn it, but I, I've been writing the last few days, and, um,

192
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.730
Mady Hernandez: Yeah.

193
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I guess.

194
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So, well, I'm excited about something, first of all, that you're here right that says, you know, you kind of are given this a shot. And you want to kind of see what's possible in here.

195
00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like to do just remind me, if you're able, I understand you were doing some childcare. Are you able to sit for like 510 minutes

196
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.780
Mady Hernandez: Yeah, yeah. Because it's barely 830 I just have to take my kids to the bus stop by 840

197
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so what I want to do is I'm going to pull up a worksheet and I'm going to go over some really fundamental communication skill and it's called an I feel you've probably heard it before. Super important one, but we forget it. It's real easy. It's three words. The word

198
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The word feel, I feel in this third word is an emotion word and it sounds like it's really easy, it's only three words but we don't do that. What most no

199
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: No, we don't you know we do we replaced that third word

200
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: With the word like

201
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah and that and something so simple, because you mentioned communication. Something so simple as that changes to trajectory of how the person hears it, because we go into that third word if we don't use an emotion word

202
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's storytelling and guess what stories are subject to interpretation and feel blamed we get defensive, and off we go. And now we're pissed about something someone said in the I feel statement. So let's go today and I want to teach this concept of

203
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel

204
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. I teach this one to you already

205
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.100
Benny Chavez: Oh yeah, I feel like. Yeah.

206
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:42.930
Benny Chavez: I feel I like like yesterday was it I'm kicking shame and blame or whatever, I think, I think I get this one. I'm not too sure about.

207
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: The cues of what you said. I would say it needs to refresh.

208
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:46.890
Know,

209
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I pay attention to language. I'm like this little, little word detective.

210
00:23:54.810 --> 00:24:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go take, let's take a look at this together. And this sounds really easy. So don't give yourselves a hard time

211
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If you find this more difficult. Once you're actually doing it like let's say I I see that you guys are comfortable enough that you could actually do do an interaction where one person says, and I feel the other person that teach mirroring. Let's say we get that far.

212
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to see it's harder. It's harder than you think. Because it's hard to own one's own feelings. It's difficult because we're risking being

213
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Rejected criticized abandoned right so it's actually kind of a scary thing to share our vulnerability our actual emotion.

214
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but let's at least learn this structure can really change what normally might take days and days of arguing may only take know 1010 minutes of a discussion.

215
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's read this together. The I statement taking responsibility for your feelings will help you improve your communication.

216
00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: When you feel upset or angry or any emotion, frankly, one way to achieve this is by using the I statement this technique will allow you to communicate what is upsetting while minimizing blaming

217
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If our statements feel to blaming the person we're trying to speak to will often becomes defensive and then they they can't hear you.

218
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is this is what we're going to do today. Today is just all about this. See where it says, I feel in the blank.

219
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We're barely beginning get into this other piece around when you blah blah blah because blah, blah, blah.

220
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be hard enough, because you guys I think based on some context of what Benny was saying there's a lot going on.

221
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it's going to be hard enough to even get this out. So we'll do a little practice. Can you see this well enough, this thing that says examples and then the regular and then this first one. You make me angry because you're always late. Do you see that daddy.

222
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.540
Mady Hernandez: Yes.

223
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I saying your name correctly.

224
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I'm going by the way.

225
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.120
Mady Hernandez: Nice to meet you.

226
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I jump in right away. I'm just like, oh boy. Boy, boy.

227
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.840
Benny Chavez: When he brow like my doctor my doctor

228
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I jumped right in and get right to work so um okay so let's do this. Let's look at this together. Do we all agree that that's kind of how I normally we talk you make me

229
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.650
Angry

230
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:21.390
Mady Hernandez: Yes.

231
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so notice the finger we're pointing outward. Aren't we, you make me angry because you're always late. That's how most of us talk, we're going to flip the switch. We are going to say it differently, what are we going to do. We're going to own our own feeling

232
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is how it might sound I feel

233
00:26:44.100 --> 00:27:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: angry, frustrated rejected abandoned right in here. See that third word is frustrated. This is the key has to be an emotion word, it cannot be li ke cannot be tha t cannot be life cannot be that, but you're going to be so tempted I betcha, hey,

234
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.420
Benny Chavez: Yeah, this was a hard one for me. That's why I do remember it's

235
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A penny. I told you.

236
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This is no joke, it's three words and it takes so much concentration because we're not raised this way.

237
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Is this way. Okay. We're used to blaming people were used to rationalization justification. So I feel frustrated when you come home late

238
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.340
Benny Chavez: Because

239
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I stay awake worrying.

240
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do another one. Regular this one, you never call you don't even care.

241
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how we talk right this is you don't you don't call and you don't care. I'm saying it like it's a fact. But if I said what emotion I feel I have done. You see it's nowhere in there.

242
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm lecturing someone with you never call and you know what I'm doing. I'm getting inside someone else's head and I'm saying you don't even care.

243
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm interpreting I'm analyzing. But you know what, I didn't do I didn't risk my own vulnerability and say,

244
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel scared when I don't hear from you. After I've texted you. Over the last few hours. I feel scared.

245
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what that person who's listening to me is not going to feel lane, they're going to go, oh my gosh, I can relate to that on the word do

246
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Let's do another one. So why don't you show off Benny and let's let's uh let's show some vulnerability here and kind of show

247
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Maddie, that you can struggle through this or maybe you'll find this just so easy and we get to brag about you. But let's let's you start. Take a look at the scenario.

248
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm right here I'm I help you if you get clunky with it. Okay, so your friend keeps canceling plans on the last minute and just pretend it's me.

249
00:28:50.430 --> 00:29:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've been. I've been. I've been. Your friend for 15 years and I keep canceling on you. Last minute last weekend you are waiting for me at the restaurant. When I call to tell you I will make it

250
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are feeling hurt go up here. Here's your structure. This is all you need to say, let's see if you can even do the I feel

251
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:14.970
Benny Chavez: I feel

252
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.960
Benny Chavez: very frustrated. I go first.

253
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now I've been doing it to you for 15 years and that's all, that's all you're feeling

254
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You sure

255
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You just froze up. Did you better just poop out

256
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I think he was having some battery issues.

257
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Benny, can you hear me you froze up there, huh.

258
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hit your mute button, you're muted. Once you log off, it gets hankie hit your mute button toggle that back and forth. And let's see if we can wake it up.

259
00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Already back

260
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh man, your volumes terrible

261
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me, or is it just me.

262
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.570
Mady Hernandez: I can barely hear

263
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You. I can't hear him at all, then a lot, all the way out and come right back.

264
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: See squirming out of the homework already

265
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Money just joking.

266
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not laughing You're crying. You know, we gotta laugh.

267
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, you know. So do you want to do that one. Since you're still in here. What would you say if I'm your friend 15 years I've been making plans with you and I just flaked out again. What would you say to me.

268
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.600
Mady Hernandez: I feel hurt.

269
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When I

270
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.270
Mady Hernandez: Want

271
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You take it even further. See if you can take it further, when I

272
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.620
Mady Hernandez: I feel hurt when you cancel on me last minute.

273
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.430
Mady Hernandez: Because I was looking forward to seeing you.

274
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Oh, you're good at this. That's very nicely. I gotta get him in your notice here.

275
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, Benny. Sound check.

276
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.150
Benny Chavez: Check, hear me.

277
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so I went ahead and Maddie. Maddie did that one for you lucky dog.

278
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: She did. She did great.

279
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So Maddie, why don't you do it so he can he can hear how adept you are at this

280
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:25.680
Mady Hernandez: I feel, I feel upset when you cancel on me last minute because

281
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.440
Mady Hernandez: I was looking forward to seeing you.

282
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.730
Yeah.

283
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said earlier, actually, you use the feeling word hurt.

284
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:35.820
Yeah.

285
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: upsets interesting can't upset be sad jealous angry disgusted so upset. It's kind of a free for all, it's not as precise. If we really want someone to know what we're going through

286
00:31:50.190 --> 00:32:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to be really, we want to get at a core emotion happy scared mad disgusted surprised we want to use one of those core emotions. If we want to be really, really efficient with it.

287
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.590
Mady Hernandez: Okay, Ben.

288
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And I give you a chance this time. So look at the second one.

289
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You are working on a project with a group

290
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Of people and one member is not completing their tasks on time, you have repeatedly had to finish their work which has been very frustrating. So see if you can do and I feel

291
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.540
Mady Hernandez: You need to brush your teeth.

292
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.630
Benny Chavez: Feel very

293
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.940
Benny Chavez: Good. Okay. Because

294
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And should I Maddie, do you need like two or three minutes. What do you need

295
00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.480
Mady Hernandez: for child care. Yeah, give me like two, three minutes, just so I can get the kids to brush your teeth.

296
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, excellent. So

297
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You did a great job, Benny do another one down here. This one.

298
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.030
Benny Chavez: A friend who becomes mood.

299
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:12.540
Benny Chavez: Swings and damage. Yeah, I want to borrow one once again and you're feeling worried. I feel very

300
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's drop the very end.

301
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.300
Benny Chavez: On easy

302
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

303
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.900
Benny Chavez: And but you're worrying nicely.

304
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You're worried see their step telling you what emotion. So go ahead, do it, do it again, all the way through.

305
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.940
Benny Chavez: I feel worried when you borrow my movies because

306
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.890
Benny Chavez: They're always damaged and they're always messed up. Yeah.

307
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.480
Benny Chavez: And

308
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you worried your

309
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Friend is going to

310
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Not treat them respectfully and return them damaged again.

311
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.170
Benny Chavez: Yes, I'm very worried

312
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

313
00:33:52.590 --> 00:34:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's different than you saying, Hey, man. You're a jerk. You don't take care of my stuff. You see the difference.

314
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.220
Benny Chavez: Yeah, yeah, we've

315
00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, your friend has no question about what you're worried about

316
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:09.570
Benny Chavez: Right.

317
00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You've named it you own your own emotion you didn't blame them. You described the causal relationship between how you're feeling and a particular behavior. Okay.

318
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm going to introduce you guys to something else which is mirroring and I'll do it again when she comes back. But the more we get to know this, the easier even Friday is going to do because will already have these some of these basics.

319
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to

320
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do mirroring okay so mirroring right mirroring is you say back what someone said you don't interpret

321
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You try to hear all the words they use, especially the emotion word. If someone says,

322
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Uneasy. Then you say on easy if someone says frustrated you echo back that emotion word really key, keep your eye out for the emotion word

323
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And try to use their particular language because what does a mirror do America doesn't say, you know, you have Short, brunette hair when I look in the mirror. I don't see sure it Burnett. Right, right.

324
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I see a blonde.

325
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a mirror.

326
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.870
Is

327
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Reflecting back what you heard trying and it's got to be a really short statement because we can't remember.

328
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of information in our active short term memory. If we go on a whole paragraph, we start to lose the details we lose the specific words that were used. So we want to be notice these are short and concise.

329
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel uneasy and thinking about lending you a movie because you kind of bring them back busted up

330
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:42.510
Benny Chavez: Period.

331
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what Marin would look like, Oh, I hear you, you, you're worried about lending me movies again because every time I bring them back to you. They're all busted up

332
00:35:54.600 --> 00:36:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's very, I basically just regurgitated what they said it's not condescending, we do have to pay attention to our tone. We don't want to be like passive aggressive about it. We don't want to be. What do we call mimicking we don't want to do the mimicking tone.

333
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to use our compassionate, you know, let me see if I understand you. That's how we want to start with a mirror.

334
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.670
Benny Chavez: Or a bad habit of doing that people take it off like I'm being smart answers and dinner. I'm not

335
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.290
Benny Chavez: I'm. Don't be really exercise will be really good for me then.

336
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you would want to

337
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Check your tone, tone of voice. So if, if, if the voices to monitor if it's like this, you know. So what you're saying is this. If it's all one level, a like that people will hear it maybe as as mimicking

338
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Or fits to up and down the process is going to up and down, people can feel like you're making fun of them. So being a smartass like you said. So we not only is it what we say, but it's also how we say

339
00:36:55.110 --> 00:37:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you may want to do you have pen and paper Benny do. So, write this down. There's something. Notice what I did with my mirroring just now is I had this little statement that came right in front

340
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.430
Benny Chavez: And it was

341
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I understand you.

342
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:13.770
Benny Chavez: Okay, yeah.

343
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I got it.

344
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I hear you.

345
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You're saying you see that

346
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.140
Benny Chavez: These little markers.

347
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.000
Benny Chavez: Doing great. You're doing

348
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's a little bit later. That's actually next level. This one right here, really want to get into it can

349
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just doing this one exercise for the person who's listening to you, they can feel validated that would be amazing.

350
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That just this one thing validation. We'll get into a little bit later. Let's just do this one. But notice the you probably aren't doing that introductory phrase. Let me see if I hear you correctly.

351
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

352
00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:58.650
Mady Hernandez: Oh,

353
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. Let me see if I hear you correctly, what I heard you say is

354
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I return movies damaged.

355
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And you feel uneasy about money.

356
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, you see it.

357
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:13.320
Yep.

358
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:15.210
Benny Chavez: Well,

359
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna, I'm going to role play one with you and I'm going to come at you pretty hard at the reason why the reason why mirroring is difficult.

360
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is because

361
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Our mechanisms come up

362
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:34.770
Benny Chavez: You guys

363
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to hear this really loud and clear when we're mirroring. It is not the same thing as agreeing should hopefully she'll come back. It's not the same thing as agreeing

364
00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To understand

365
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It does mean you agree, you're showing another human being that you can listen

366
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:56.160
Benny Chavez: Right.

367
00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. It doesn't mean you're weak. Just because you can hear it, it just means I can hear you. You are a reasonable, rational human being. I can hear you. I'm listening.

368
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what once someone feels heard, like you said, they can probably they may feel validated. They may be done.

369
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: They might that might be, it might be all they ever needed

370
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:25.770
Benny Chavez: Yeah, for instance, this morning when I, she said, This is the worst time I have to go to the meeting and I said,

371
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:34.650
Benny Chavez: No, I said, well, I said, well, it would be a lot to me if you do show up. He says, Well, I've tried the last 13 years and I don't see what whatever she said

372
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:45.450
Benny Chavez: And I said, you know what you have tried the last 15 years and I really do appreciate that a lot to me if you show up to this meeting today and I didn't show up, you know, it just

373
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, you didn't call her names. You didn't make her feel bad. You stuck with what it means to you that was

374
00:39:53.550 --> 00:40:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That was really smart and your tongue just now was really sweet was very kind. I hope that's why you said it. If you did, it makes sense that she showed up here today. Yeah.

375
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.640
Benny Chavez: She's, she's taking the kids to the bus stop. She'll be right back.

376
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, even if she doesn't come back today she I, my guess is you know she smiled a little bit. She did the activity, she got to see me. See, I'm a real person. You know, I'm not mean and critical and hopefully not creepy.

377
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And so hopefully then on Friday, I already know you know I'm going to be meeting with Gwen and and this is what it will look

378
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.020
Benny Chavez: Like

379
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This right you know i mean she at least got a first introduction to me. Yeah, so

380
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.000
Benny Chavez: Next week, everybody.

381
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. So I really let's take time and really hone this skill. I'm going to come at you pretty hard. When I say that I'm going to, I'm going to think of something that might piss you off.

382
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because mirroring is really hard when our defense mechanism comes up and guess what we're like this in our head. That's not true.

383
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.320
Benny Chavez: Right.

384
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't hear it anymore. It's really hard to be just be listening to mirror back not thinking how I'm wrong.

385
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How I'm off on my facts.

386
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This listening is hard to do, especially when you're like,

387
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like how you see me. I don't like it.

388
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because some of it might be true. I don't like hearing something that I don't like in myself. I certainly don't want to hear it. And someone else. Okay, so our defense mechanism comes up and be like, I want to hear any of this.

389
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's natural. But this. That's why listening so hard, because some little part of it might be true, doesn't mean you're a bad person. It just might mean there's some responsibility there. And so it's going to bring up a defense mechanism. So let's give this a try.

390
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, Benny. My ears are really bad today.

391
00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, here we go. Let me think of something that might really upset you.

392
00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got one. You ready, ready as you're doing this, Benny. I want you to go to accountability, responsibility, right. Remember, we're detoxing from Shane You can't go to blaming yourself like as in all of you is bad can't go there anymore. Now, just go to

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to hear what what this woman has to say I want to show when that I can hear her.

394
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I am a good person, you might be saying the whole time I'm lovable. I'm a good person and I can hear another human beings perspective and I can show her I'm listening.

395
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to hold on to yourself and really believe that you're a good person.

396
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, here we go. So I'm going to keep it nice, nice and short. You want to say, let me see if I heard you correctly, and you want to make sure you use my feeling word and some of the data that I said alright so here we go.

397
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Benny. I don't trust you. I feel scared, you're going to end up

398
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Using again.

399
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.970
Benny Chavez: Well, I'm sorry. You feel like that.

400
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.260
Nope.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.210
Benny Chavez: Sunday, correct me.

402
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.380
Benny Chavez: If I understand you correctly, you have a feeling

403
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.570
Benny Chavez: Trust me.

404
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.270
Benny Chavez: Coming to you. Yeah.

405
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't use my feeling word. How do I feel

406
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.350
Benny Chavez: You feel pissed off or you feel a know you were

Benny Chavez: Know, I said.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, scared. So notice how hard that was you reverted to. I'm sorry, that's not marrying a mirror doesn't say girl, you should be a brunette kind of ugly as a blonde.

410
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.590
Know,

411
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to work out, baby. It doesn't do that my mirror doesn't apologize. Right. Let's do it again, notice how hard it is. I told you this is hard.

412
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:09.900
Benny Chavez: You

413
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, just how the feeling were disappeared. I flipped it and put the feeling word at the end. But you got to be a detective and keep your eye out for it. Your ear out for it. I'm going to do it again.

414
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll make it easier on you and I'll do it. I'll make an I feel statement. Make it easier on you keep your eye out for it.

415
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a deep you so here's what you want to do you want to take a deep breath. Want to look at your note and say, let me see if I hear you correctly, and then you just mirror back what you heard. All right. I'll make it easier on you and us though I feel structure.

416
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel angry when you

417
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Did everything I told you not to do. And I've been telling you for years.

418
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:56.550
Benny Chavez: You probably

419
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.690
Deep breath.

420
00:44:58.890 --> 00:44:59.550
Benny Chavez: Let me see.

421
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.140
Benny Chavez: Let me see if I understand this. Okay.

422
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:06.540
Benny Chavez: Because

423
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:13.890
Benny Chavez: I do everything. Can the complete opposite of what you want, but I'm very sorry for that and I will work on

424
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Mirror doesn't apologize. You're doing it again.

425
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.640
Benny Chavez: The second time.

426
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry to

427
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Benny, here's the deal.

428
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The person on the other side. This is not an apology.

429
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is because guess what have you made promises and not kept them.

430
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.190
Benny Chavez: I guess so.

431
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't bother. Then don't bother apologizing do differently. That's how you'll be measured. Most people right after and when it's years and years of it. They're just like place.

432
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:44.790
Yeah yeah

433
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just don't bother.

434
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:48.030
Yeah.

435
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:49.740
Benny Chavez: Yeah.

436
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So just

437
00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what that apology almost makes this moment about you. You see how that can happen. You can't take a chance. It's too important. We've got to do it differently. You're almost there, but to how to to you don't apologize. Let's drop that piece.

438
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna I'm gonna come at you again.

439
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how I'm picking ones that probably are activating for you a little bit

440
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.930
Benny Chavez: Oh, yeah.

441
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to make it so that you can really when she does this when she actually says I feel to you, you need to be ready. Yeah.

442
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:28.320
Benny Chavez: Okay.

443
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm trying to pick one kind of pulling from the air here that might have gone on.

444
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.420
Oh, yeah.

445
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

446
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you tell me what's your biggest complaint about you. Let's see if I can really make it relevant. What's her biggest complaint.

447
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.210
Benny Chavez: About

448
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.930
Benny Chavez: Abandoned i mean

449
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Her biggest complaint about you.

450
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:01.350
Benny Chavez: How I did ever. I used to go to the casino all night long and not want to cuddle with her night.

451
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:10.500
Benny Chavez: You know, I'd be sleeping on the couch. You're not going to tell me you want to. I mean, you can come to bed and I would sleep on the couch. I mean who does that you know well

452
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about gambling and losing all the money that's not what it's about. It's about affection.

453
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.270
Benny Chavez: Lot of fiction to nonfiction gambling.

454
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.690
Benny Chavez: Just a lot of stuff I was doing

455
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, is it real. Did you lose like really important chunks of money to gambling.

456
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.730
Benny Chavez: Oh, yeah.

457
00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:41.640
Benny Chavez: I were to go and yeah and I wasn't given money to bills but like the other half hour just like you know we didn't dinner for the next week or something, you know,

458
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:48.960
Benny Chavez: Everywhere else, and just turn when you shouldn't have to bother them. No, there's no reason for it.

459
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let me do one more. Right before we jump out. Okay, here we go. Deep breath.

460
00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This one might sting.

461
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know what, Benny. I

462
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel betrayed. When you throw our money away at the casino.

463
00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:12.390
Like you don't care about this family.

464
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. Deep breath. Use the structure

465
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.520
Benny Chavez: Well, let me do

466
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.050
Benny Chavez: This correctly, you feel betrayed because

467
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:31.770
Benny Chavez: I spend all the money at the casino.

468
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:34.920
Benny Chavez: I will try to

469
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just about to make a promise, weren't you

470
00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:39.840
Know,

471
00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What

472
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.010
Benny Chavez: I'm not gonna go no more.

473
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not what America does it doesn't apologize and it doesn't make promises you're jumping way ahead.

474
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:52.650
Benny Chavez: Yeah.

475
00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard for you if any

476
00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're used to telling people making promises and maybe I don't know you too too well but

477
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have a pattern of not keeping

478
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Up, you're just going to piss her off.

479
00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To understand that.

480
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't do it. Don't make it about you feeling relief.

481
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And making a promise. You can't keep instead

482
00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just try and my way, you haven't done it my way. Just see if it works. If you have this woman who actually feels heard

483
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to fight the fact that there was another promise.

484
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That this man may not keep Nope. She doesn't have to be distracted by that an empty. Sorry, and some promise. Maybe that's not what she wants. Why don't we wait and hear what she wants.

485
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do one more time. See if you can get it and I cut you off because you were about to tell me how you're going to solve it. That's not what America does America justice. Let me see if I got that if I if I hear you correctly.

486
00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I spent all our money at the casino really important you know money. We were saving for something and what it means to you, sweetheart, is I don't care about this family.

487
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you hear that because remember I included that but you went to solution. You didn't include what it means to her is you don't care about this family.

488
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:20.850
Benny Chavez: Right.

489
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to hear the meaning it has for her. It may mean something completely different for you. We're not here to agree or disagree. We're here to show

490
00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We can listen and it's huge. Look how much time. This is taking all I had to do is just say back what someone said it's harder than you think. Yeah. One more time. We're going to do another one.

491
00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we got to go. I know. Someone's knocking on my door here.

492
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you I feel rejected when you you say you love me, but you don't you don't show me cuddly affection.

493
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:58.770
Take your time.

494
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:09.780
Benny Chavez: Let me see if I understand this, you feel rejected because I don't show you know section.

495
00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.360
Benny Chavez: betrayed our side into somebody

496
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay but but that was what you just went off on your own again.

497
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

498
00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.190
Benny Chavez: Nobody showed me

499
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Any. This isn't about

500
00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.400
Benny Chavez: You. I know.

501
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard for you to

502
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, write this down. This is the part that comes right at the end, after you do the mirror. This is what you say.

503
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maddie. Did I get that right.

504
00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Then write this down. If She nods their head like this yeah then write this down.

505
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It is there more

506
00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You very quickly go to you. You're making it about you.

507
00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Know your promise to do differently, how you feel.

508
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to flip and you're going to be able to do the same thing she's gonna have to just mirror you but no promises. This is just the art of listening and it's harder than you thought, isn't it.

509
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.280
Benny Chavez: Yeah yeah so far.

510
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:28.320
Benny Chavez: Yeah, it's

511
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:36.090
Benny Chavez: Like I'm trying to deal with all of it, too. It's usually, you know, I go back right away or something, but this time it's just like, no.

512
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do it differently. There might be some neat things happening, she's starting to revisit some of the old skills. It sounds like she learned in her own individual therapy.

513
00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're

514
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing some skills with me. Let's see. And you're taking my feedback really well because I keep interrupting you. I keep redirect to you. You're doing great.

515
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because it's hard to hear people sort of say, I'm not, you know, I'm not doing it right, which talks about, you know,

516
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I will see you on in group next Monday. Right.

517
00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.870

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, did you go by virtual clinic this morning.

533
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.890
Shaun w: Yeah, I went by there to get the number. There's only way they give me the number

534
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. My ears are kind of messed up this morning. So you're going to see me doing this weird head tilting

535
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to let you know what that was our behavior is me trying to feel better. So just ignore it.

536
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I had it for many years. Okay, so let's see.

537
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.010
What we got here.

538
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I noticed yesterday.

539
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Correct me if I if I'm inaccurate. There was almost this like I can't relate to these concepts of guilt and shame. Is that how it felt. I can't relate to this topic.

540
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.780
Shaun w: No, I don't have shame. I didn't know about the guilt that we're doing the chain.

541
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, tell me more about your understanding of healthy guilt, let's say,

542
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:58.890
Shaun w: Healthy guilt. Uh huh.

543
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.190
Shaun w: Oh, not only feel guilty about nothing.

544
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You really don't

545
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And so how do you live with people in a home if you don't feel guilt for something you did or didn't do. How do you live, do you live with someone in a home without like they're being

546
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.990
Shaun w: Lot of arguing here.

547
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.800
Shaun w: Like how do I live with someone good why my boss feel guilty.

548
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:30.660
Shaun w: When

549
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:33.600
Shaun w: You. Yeah, I feel guilty for that.

550
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you haven't told me a story yet. How is it that you function in society without the ability to have remorse. How do you do it.

551
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.470
Shaun w: Bob, what should I feel remorse about though.

552
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, Sean, you're going to be better at this than me. Okay. But let's just take a look at your goals. Most we're gonna move on because you're, you're quite adept

553
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:03.090
Shaun w: I don't know who's done that, though. I don't know. You told me that feel guilty about something I would

554
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Certainly I'm not telling you to feel guilty. I'm actually asking you a question.

555
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're answering me with a question. So I'm not getting any information. Let's just shift gears. We're going to spend that

556
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to the things that you do have

557
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:21.270
Shaun w: Oh, I got asked you some. Can you do a mental health assessment on me.

558
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.520
Shaun w: I appeal wanted to ask that.

559
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:31.770
Shaun w: Yeah, can you, I need to do a mental health assessment. I guess that's part of my parole.

560
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe today. I'll write that down is about making sure we look at having a good release of information. Okay, we'll make sure that we have that

561
00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so one of your goals is I want to get a job. We'll just go sort of

562
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Tangible behaviors. Let's see what we got here, we have

563
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm job assembly line doing bracelets solar panels, two weeks. Oh, bracket, sorry brackets for solar panels, two weeks, I get bored easily you had shared really useful to understand that about yourself. That's important. I don't hold

564
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A job real good held a job as a manager of a warehouse for two years. We talked about that. I ran a warehouse. You did the hiring and firing.

565
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Without job you have given two weeks notice and you wanted wanted to be in your family. So how do you do it around his board and popping up at this job, you

566
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.140
Shaun w: Know it's kind of, it's really fast paced

567
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:47.700
Shaun w: It's nonstop for eight hours.

568
00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

569
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:55.110
Shaun w: Yeah. Before we get to 20 minute breaks loose. When we were working on top.

570
00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And are there any people there sometimes individuals have a challenge in working with authority. And what's your boss, like, What's your relationship with your boss.

571
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.270
Shaun w: I just do it. He says,

572
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.600
Shaun w: Oh, are you ready to do whatever he says

573
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.650
Shaun w: Only have a relationship with them. He just tells me to do something I do it.

574
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That is a relationship. The word relationship is you know them you interact with them. That's what the word relationship means you are relating he tells me to do something I do it. That's a relationship.

575
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's no issue you basically don't challenge him don't question it. You just whatever you tell me, I'ma do it.

576
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.130
Shaun w: Yeah.

577
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Has there ever been a time when he asked you to do something that you're like, this is a stupid idea. I don't want to do it.

578
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. Okay, well that's convenient for you, right, because you don't have to sort of question.

579
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: His choices.

580
00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:03.330
Shaun w: I do the same thing. Almost every day. Hmm. So, yesterday I did something yesterday, different they put me on a different line yesterday because they broke down the lines. A lot of people didn't show up to work.

581
00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you have another goal, which is I want to get a good relationship with my kids you let me in a little bit last time you let me know about

582
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a son that's 18 you have a 15 year old, you have a 14 year old.

583
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So she's going to dance. I think your, your child, some other

584
00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, a plan. Oh, this summer, you're going to get to see them. Your that's your hope. Right.

585
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.870
Shaun w: Yeah, that's my hope.

586
00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're currently living with your mom. You're living with your nephew your niece, your sister with three dogs and you get along good with everybody. That's the one. I'm curious about

587
00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the reasons why.

588
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm talking about guilt with you right now has to do with

589
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: A general function in society. If we have a society, let's say,

590
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Where nobody

591
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Cares that they've hurt someone, how well would that society work would you say

592
01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well picture your own home.

593
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture if nobody cared that they had hurt someone in the home. Would everyone be able to live together.

594
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:37.440
Shaun w: Why not

595
01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, probably not.

596
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm

597
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So that it earlier. Remember we were you know we touched on kill and that's what that was. It was about. Maybe it's about the word, maybe it has to do with you may actually take responsibility.

598
01:00:54.990 --> 01:01:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: For what you do and don't do you may actually be doing it. And the word just may not have the same definition for you.

599
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe shifting to responsibility accountability that might be one. Do you see yourself as someone who's responsible for your actions and accountable for what you do or don't do

600
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:15.720
Shaun w: Yeah.

601
01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.180
Shaun w: Yeah, I go to jail. I go to prison.

602
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's something bad. What about just regular I'm responsible for, you know, if someone says, hey, I need you to pick something up at the store I pick it up. And if I don't, I'm kind of maybe all hurt their feelings, because I let him down, just that.

603
01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.200
Shaun w: Now we have we have we all help each other around here.

604
01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you do to help around

605
01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Your family.

606
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.310
Shaun w: But even a clean cut through. I'm the one that throws out the trash, I hope, clean, I

607
01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:55.020
Shaun w: Do whatever they asked me to do this. My sister's also is, you know, I mean, my mom loser to we all know

608
01:01:56.370 --> 01:02:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you didn't care if you didn't have empathy, right, if you didn't care about someone else's feelings you wouldn't be inclined to clean you wouldn't be inclined to throw out the trash.

609
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Okay. And so if you didn't, let's say, one day, you didn't throw out the trash. You're just extra tired like wow you wiped out. Here's where guilt might come in.

610
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I slept in.

611
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.250
Shaun w: My I forgot to throw the trash.

612
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's guilt. Now you see we're getting closer to to the shared standing. Yeah, it's not

613
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:38.580
Shaun w: Yeah, but I don't. I just don't understand what am I supposed to feel guilty about so I'm supposed to think of something to feel guilty about

614
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:42.270
Shaun w: Yeah, I have no i don't know what that question means I'm

615
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna be honest I'm clueless about what that means.

616
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't know what that means.

617
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's continue the where we do have overlap, which is

618
01:02:53.460 --> 01:03:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: In if we have a shared definition of what healthy guilt is just for our work together. It's taking responsibility for your actions taking

619
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Accountability for things you did or didn't do. Let's say you you called someone a name you like, Oh man, I lost my temper.

620
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be healthy, guilt, right. Oh, I called someone a name.

621
01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I lost my temper. Some. My bad, sorry about that, pure and simple. I take ownership for what I did I see them hurt someone else I acted outside my core values. I really don't like myself as someone who swears

622
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And call someone a name, pure and simple. That's what I'm talking about. That make sense.

623
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So now when I say, you know, are you, are you owning your grain of truth a little bit of truth about your responsibility. That's what I mean by guilt.

624
01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:50.940
Now,

625
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame, which is this thing that you can't relate to, we agree. You said I can't relate to this, we agree.

626
01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:00.030
Shaun w: Yeah, okay.

627
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It is this thing. And you're going to see it in group that but you're going to be around.

628
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:10.080
Shaun w: I feel shameful about what I did with my kids I feel shame about that. Oh.

629
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:21.690
Shaun w: Yeah, yeah, I just say my I kind of left them flat. And when I was in prison. I left them for all those years, and it was my fault. This last time I was in prison, it was my fault.

630
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one. Yeah. And what will happen. So that was powerful that you you let that vulnerability with me that you made that possible. So Sean what I was saying in group has to do with healthy guilt is let's say it's around I left my kids flat.

631
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're going to solutions like, you know what I'm going to make sure when I get out that I show them.

632
01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in the past. I'm gonna write letters. I'm going to work on myself and I'm going to work my recovery and I'm going to spend time with them.

633
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's healthy watch. Now if we go to shame. It's I'm a bad person. I'm never going to be any good of a dad, I'm worthless as a dad now. Right. So maybe you are more in

634
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Healthy guilt, where you're you're making sure you're communicating you're making a plan for the summer. Yes, it was shame, Sean, you would be wiped out.

635
01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be wiped out. You're breaking up. Yeah, yeah, that's

636
01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Thanks for telling me that, let's do a sound check

637
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.810
Again,

638
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.730
Shaun w: Hey, you know, you look like, hey, I want to show my mom you look almost identical to my brothers ex wife Ashley. You guys look like twins.

639
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.530
Shaun w: I want to show my mama. You guys look at almost just like

640
01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're

641
01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The connection. Now how's the connection.

642
01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Connections. Good. Okay.

643
01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:06.900
Shaun w: You're breaking up all crazy was going, oh man.

644
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no.

645
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

646
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be, Sean. And this is how you can check whether shames getting activated or not is if you're labeling yourself.

647
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: when when when Shane is the feeling, what are you calling yourself, what's that voice like what do you, what do you, what do you name calling. What's that inner critic sound like inside your head.

648
01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:35.880
Shaun w: Yes. Well, I wasn't a good dad. Yeah, okay.

649
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what does a good dad do he

650
01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.110
Shaun w: Takes care of his family.

651
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that look like, how will you write take action and take care of his family. What will you be doing because right now they are way over here. They're far away.

652
01:06:53.070 --> 01:07:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you be doing that represents I'm in my solution. I'm not in shame. I'm in the solution. I'm taking care of my family.

653
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:03.570
It can look really cool.

654
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:06.600
Yeah, that's right.

655
01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So it turns out after you and I talked a little bit more. We have a lot more overlap about the definition, then maybe you initially thought is that a possibility. Yeah. Okay, so I'm guessing maybe

656
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what was here before that was. Were you worried that I was trying to make you feel bad about something.

657
01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

658
01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.790
Shaun w: I just it was, I guess I'll just thinking, I didn't really, at that time, I didn't think about, I felt bad about

659
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah ok but

660
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.210
Shaun w: Until you pointed out, yeah. Okay.

661
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So we hung in there. And now we have a shared understanding is beautiful, very nice. So again, just to review.

662
01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll find yourself maybe choosing if you want to choosing the word guilt like man I feel guilty that I let my family down and left them flat.

663
01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That is healthy. It gets you doing the next right thing but shame. This is the one I'm recommending people detox from has to do with I'm worthless. I'm a bad person, and you don't try anymore. He just don't. You don't even try to be this better, Dad.

664
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.000
Shaun w: He's throwing a lot at

665
01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:25.440
Shaun w: The loss of hope.

666
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's it. So if you catch yourself saying the word I am this phrase I am bad I'm unworthy I'm worthless. I'll never they then you know your shames activated in the invitation here and treatment is to shift it and go to

667
01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't go there. I can't go there because then

668
01:08:45.690 --> 01:08:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The potential for isolation, the potential for secrecy, the potential for a relapse goes up when I'm in shape. So I can't do that. I gotta push it aside. I've got to get in. I've got to own my part. All right, I'm a good person who

669
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Made some crummy decisions, but I'm not making them today I'm making good decisions. Today I'm on it. I'm on point.

670
01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't go to shame. It'll wipe you out.

671
01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.530
Shaun w: You see, yet.

672
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.420
Shaun w: I will try to avoid it. Try to avoid it.

673
01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. You got it. All right, get into right. What can I do differently today. How can I get in my solution. I think, I think we've got a real clear picture of that.

674
01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. So let's go over to. I'm going to go over to your documents and see what release of information already have, because maybe we have a good one. Already there for your PO and we won't have to do one

675
01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:44.220
Shaun w: Yeah, well, yeah, I just stopped pointed out other cancer there I was gonna get them into the whole says, I guess it says it on my wall. He asked me to ask you that if you give me a mental health assessment.

676
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

677
01:09:45.150 --> 01:09:45.420
Shaun w: Guys.

678
01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have that document in front of you.

679
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:49.110
Shaun w: Like go get it.

680
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.940
Shaun w: Hold on, real quick, I gotta put my Xbox down

681
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.160
Shaun w: Right here somewhere.

682
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:15.030
Shaun w: Mental health assessment.

683
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: When you did the bio psychosocial with me, you

684
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You basically got one. I asked you about suicidality, I asked you about homeless. Oh.

685
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:35.520
Shaun w: Good. You feel

686
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

687
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:36.810
Shaun w: It. Yeah.

688
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of cover that I tend to focus very much on the substance use, because typically that's why people are seeking treatment.

689
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.710
Shaun w: It do

690
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't get into personality disorders. It doesn't didn't Delve much into that.

691
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can, if you have a release of information I can make that available.

692
01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To your officer.

693
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:06.690
Shaun w: Yeah, just says, A on my pride somewhere in here. I gotta find it by next time. The next group. I'll bring it

694
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

695
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:08.490
Shaun w: I'll get it.

696
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.510
Shaun w: It just says they want a mental health assessment of me.

697
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:14.400
Shaun w: I don't know, whatever that is.

698
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: They go by many names. Oftentimes, it is a bio psycho.

699
01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:20.010
Yeah.

700
01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

701
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, so you probably he may be satisfied with a copy of the one that we already did. Wouldn't that be convenient.

702
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.360
Shaun w: Yeah, it'll be convenient.

703
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's do this while you're walking around, Sean. What do you find your, your officers card.

704
01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:42.660
Shaun w: Yeah, I got I got his number

705
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And the card will have his title the address the phone number.

706
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.770
Shaun w: Yeah, I don't have. I don't think I have a card for that day.

707
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have a document that has that

708
01:12:53.760 --> 01:13:07.830
Shaun w: Information on it though. No, I don't, because they gave it to me when I got to the pro when I when I got to when I got to the office, but I never got a card or nothing from him. I never got nothing from him, he just he comes by and

709
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.960
Shaun w: He just told me he was

710
01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know and then it goes through the reason I'm being so specific is I'm seeing right now if we can get this done.

711
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you have the exact first last name of this officer, as well as his title, the actual physical address the phone number and the fax number do you have those things for him.

712
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.660
Shaun w: Regardless, phone number, okay.

713
01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. How about we do this, Sean. Since we have time and

714
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's something you want is to make sure this officers getting everything that you know you've made a switch that this is where your treatments happening, how about we do this, you tell me if you like this, if this is a good use of your time if you log out right now.

715

748
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the best way I can describe it. I don't have a diagnosis for it. It's like, you ever been in the bottom of a pool.

Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm still struggling to try and find this form.

779
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:07.890
Shaun w: I kind of didn't want to trust you with all that I got was, when you asked me that day I got right away. I got kind of

780
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

781
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:15.660
Shaun w: You gotta you all my appeals know before I was like kind of tripping on that day when you asked me, yeah.

782
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It can feel threatening, right, like what is this

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You what she going to do with

784

Shaun w: Our to trust people

785
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: MAN, ISN'T IT EVER. It's so hard, because you've had a lot of people have hurt you, you know,

786
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.590
Shaun w: Yeah I know I have

787
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:36.390
Shaun w: But I've also heard people too. So, I mean, it goes both ways.

788
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well in here.

789
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I trust myself. Okay. I happen to be someone who I take very seriously safety and the therapeutic relationship. So in here, it's not going to be about me.

790
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.800
Shaun w: Just being who I who I am cops.

791
01:20:55.830 --> 01:21:00.450
Shaun w: Don't like me. So they were they, they want to lock me up as fast as possible and

792
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:12.630
Shaun w: He told me that when I have something happens to me his boss gets involved because I'm so high profile. He said that when anything happens, the main people get to get involved. Yeah.

793
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well in here, Sean. What will probably happen is somewhat like what we had early on in the discussion around guilt, right, notice how you tell me if this is true for you. And this is a therapeutic moment right here.

794
01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice how when I said, You know, I want your probation officers number or when I started to say, hey, do you ever feel guilty about anything. Did you notice yourself feeling defensive feeling angry.

795
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:50.610
Shaun w: I got defensive when you asked for the number because I was like, Why does she want my appeals number like why does she need my appeals number. You don't need my appeals homebrew like you know i mean

796
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:56.310
Shaun w: So to me, that got me kind of like a red flag went up. Like why would you want my peels number. Yeah.

797
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So that will probably happen again in our work together those feelings of threat perceived threat will come up

798
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though I know my my interest is in service to you, right, because I need to be able to communicate what you want me to do this officer like my intentions are good, but because of your life history, Sean.

799
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You will, you will at times and I don't have any control over it, you will perceive me as a threat.

800
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And the best we can do is you can catch it as early as you can and say,

801
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling defensive or what do you want like why you want this. You just need to pay attention to you how you're feeling and asked me a question if it comes up and I will try to catch

802
01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Up if you're being defensive and I might say, hey, did something just happened. Yeah. You know what I mean. And then in that space right in there. We can check in with each other and we can see if maybe

803
01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I came across like I was crossing a boundary, maybe. Or I was going somewhere that you were uncomfortable and right in that space. We can learn a little bit about what how far we can go about talking about certain things and noise.

804
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.300
Shaun w: Do you know what

805
01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:22.620
Shaun w: You know what happened to me. One of my best friends set me up on murder charges and then he comes forward three years later and media, he lied.

806
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:29.430
Shaun w: And then the I was sitting on death row lazy. I didn't get convicted yet but they moved me to death row were desperately needs are they as

807
01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:34.230
Shaun w: I was a county jail hold in prison. And I was thinking, and how they put me in prison. I've never been convicted of nothing.

808
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:45.540
Shaun w: And so by then he came forward admit that he lied and everything and then they found evidence and then I end up they end up throwing me back on the streets. Right. They didn't give me that I tried to sue them and I lost because they didn't testified

809
01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.270
Shaun w: Yeah, so it kind of

810
01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: How many years that take for me.

811
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's four years. You can never get those years back.

812
01:23:56.610 --> 01:24:04.530
Shaun w: YEAH, MY LIFE WAS THREATENED EVERY DAY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT I KILLED two kids. So every day, they thought, I've heard some old family. They said that I went up and murdered.

813
01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:11.970
Shaun w: For people and I had nothing to do with that. Are you been to this place. I'm talking to cops. I've never even been there. How are you guys arresting me, please. I've never been

814
01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:21.780
Shaun w: You know I'm saying that I didn't understand that because I know there could be no physical evidence because I've never been there, you know, and then it was this is it's a lie. It's gonna be. It's a big murky saw here and

815
01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:29.100
Shaun w: It just really, that's where trust comes in, like, I found it really fucked up life you know

816
01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:30.660
Shaun w: But

817
01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is you tell me

818
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Where else have you been betrayed besides that event.

819
01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:41.760
Shaun w: Everywhere.

820
01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's not just

821
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:44.940
Shaun w: Yes.

822
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to back to back. So it'll show up in here. It has to write because in here.

823
01:24:51.450 --> 01:25:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be asking you to be vulnerable. I'll be asking you to talk about your underbelly feelings, all that kind of stuff. And for years, you've probably cultivated this defense mechanism of being tough and strong.

824
01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's, you may feel uncomfortable going there. But the neat thing is you might end up liking.

825
01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The changes that happened in here you might like it you might like not being as defensive. You might notice over time.

826
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That relationships start to change that people don't see you as defensive and guess what you might have more intimate closer relationships with people you might like it over time.

827
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When right when you start to develop trust in yourself a little bit more trust in Me, we can reverse it in here and then you take those skills out into the world.

828
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I

829
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:43.680
Shaun w: Try not even go nowhere because I don't want no problem.

830
01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:53.730
Shaun w: So I try not to give you have friends and going over like this. This girl he kicked with the other day and I had to go to the hospital. But I didn't even want to kick it with girls like she ended up. You know what I mean. And I was just like,

831
01:25:54.930 --> 01:26:06.240
Shaun w: I didn't even want to kick it with her. I didn't want to have sex with her and she was all like, you know, I mean that I did, and I know it's happening now to the hospital. You know, they mean

832
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.110
Shaun w: Friends, I just want to be left alone.

833
01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. And I completely forgot, Sean, you, you shared something in group that just like I literally just snap to it. Are you okay

834
01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.430
Shaun w: Yeah, just got all this urgency surgery Sunday.

835
01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is now, did they put like an implant and or anything. What did they do.

836
01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:38.130
Shaun w: To the the cut my skin like where I'm circumcised pulled my skin down sewed up wherever it rip that that pulled my skin back up and resold it

837
01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Piece

838
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:53.910
Shaun w: As it hurt. It's still a stinging right now as we talk and then they won't give me no pain meds because I'm on Suboxone. And so they said Suboxone should be good enough. But it's doing all right. Yeah. Yes, just lost him.

839
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you can you manage it, that

840
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.990
Shaun w: Can you manage

841
01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This to see yourself through this. Yeah, you'd be pretty proud of yourself. I bet if you can pull this off.

842
01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:07.500
Shaun w: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not trying to do drugs. I'm not

843
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.200
Trying to

844
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:17.850
Shaun w: Keep her because

845
01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.510
Shaun w: I just, you know,

846
01:27:21.690 --> 01:27:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not talking about that we're not even

847
01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:24.780
Shaun w: Going to it right

848
01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I learned my lesson. I know you guys are all the same when you first started like way people talking about I want to take her I'm finally like trying to get stable.

849
01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.890
Shaun w: I just got on it. Yeah, I

01:27:38.190 --> 01:27:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Got on your program. I got you.

Shaun w: And I even think one's not even though I really need to a day, really, to be honest with you one of these, like, really low, like I really need one in the morning, one at night.

852
01:27:51.420 --> 01:28:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's go do this release of information. I am just failing as far as my ability to pull up this document, maybe has it's been too many months since I've done it. How about we do this. Let's go visit together. Let's go over to a virtual clinic. Together we go do that.

853
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:07.920
Shaun w: Yeah, how we do that.

854
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:20.730
