00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Samantha.

2
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

3
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.280
Samantha Scott: Okay.

4
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.470
Samantha Scott: How are you

5
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm going to take just a second to hit send on something.

6
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't want you to think that I'm ignoring you.

7
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, my attendance. Fine, I'll just take a moment to center myself. Nice. You know what's up. Don't you

8
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.110
Samantha Scott: I'm still trying to maximize my zoom. I was able to turn on HD, which I hope maybe makes this a little bit better.

9
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.910
Samantha Scott: How that works exactly but

10
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Scoop today.

11
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: 14

12
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm opening up the notes. That's why I'm quiet now. Now remember, it's this awkward thing, much like a phone call. Right. It's this weird thing that if we were in person, we'd probably have a higher tolerance for but it feels odd.

13
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.480
Samantha Scott: Can you hold on just one second. I'll be right back.

14
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.230
Samantha Scott: Okay.

15
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.660
Samantha Scott: One sec.

16
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.360
Samantha Scott: He forgot his keys is giving me

17
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.520
Samantha Scott: Settle

18
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.070
Samantha Scott: Settle

19
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.340
Samantha Scott: Okay, sorry.

20
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a note open now.

21
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Where did we leave off.

22
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We start. Okay, I'm guessing you and I started developing the beginning of the anchor room. Does that sound familiar

23
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

24
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So your audio is completely off right now. I can't hear you at all. I don't know, it's weird because it doesn't show you're muted super strange

25
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what log all the way out. If you want and come right back. I'll stay right here.

26
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That might snap it too because I can't hear you. I can tell you're talking, but I can't hear you. I would, yeah, there we go.

27
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.750
Samantha Scott: Hello.

28
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.710
Hi.

29
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

30
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic. Let's see.

31
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. You're not going to believe this. Yeah, there's definitely something wrong. So Sam, your audio is out again.

32
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's try this. It was there for a moment, and then it, it disappeared. So

33
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try this. Let me just play with take your video off so just hit stop video button and see if all of a sudden audio comes online, let's give that a try. We'll do some troubleshooting here test test test test test.

34
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: No, nothing. Um,

35
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What to do

36
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to share my screen with you and I'm going to type something to you. If not, I'll give you a call.

37
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think what I'll do is I'm going to screen share and I'm going to type something to see you can hear.

38
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm saying

39
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Test test test.

40
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, hi.

41
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.910
Samantha Scott: Okay, I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on. Maybe you should just use this one instead of why

42
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Though, let me tell you what I see on this one. I have better better video there's a better camera some for some reason.

43
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so I'm a fan of this one. I don't know what you're using, but I'll fan.

44
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.000
Samantha Scott: It's my phone and like

45
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it.

46
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:32.130
Samantha Scott: Because my mom cut off my service. I can't use it as a phone phone but I use it by connecting to Wi Fi here in the House, and then I have this app that lets me tech so I can text with

47
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. Okay.

48
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.380
Samantha Scott: So,

49
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that sound familiar that during that second session and what we had done with start to develop the anchor rooms.

50
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.940
Samantha Scott: I remember the protector.

51
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.160
Samantha Scott: A cheerleader, and the wise one.

52
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so what you had developed was your resource team.

53
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And you also have a distancing metaphor. And what we're beginning it's great.

54
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.090
Samantha Scott: We go right before the container.

55
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

56
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What what we were beginning to do. And this takes sometimes as many as two or three or more sessions to develop

57
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think it's going to because you're you're able to

58
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Identify internal experiences and emotions and you're pretty adept at labeling your psychological phenomenon pretty easily. I don't think this is going to take more than today. And then our next session.

59
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.730
Samantha Scott: Okay.

60
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to give some more instruction.

61
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and it's not know, taking it's you really

62
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: being present in the body. You really being present. You don't need to write down. I'm going to be Writing it all down.

63
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.570
Samantha Scott: So, okay, yeah.

64
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, all you have to do is just pay attention to the next question that I asked just what comes up for you physically, emotionally, psychologically, if an image comes up, okay fine and you name it, and you tell me

65
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What's really key for this is that you're not sensor as if well maybe one doesn't want to hear this. I won't tell her that

66
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's probably going to get

67
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.070
Samantha Scott: Whatever stream of consciousness comes up just

68
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just go with that. So because

69
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be it'll be me asking question after question after question. You know, there's going to be another one coming so you might as well just give me your answer. And then when we'll have another question. I'll just answer her and then I'll have another one.

70
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's going to be let let me guide you

71
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:32.910
Samantha Scott: Is really or

72
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The invitation is so let me go over what what we're doing again.

73
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I had asked you last time. I said, Well, where are you feeling blocked and you said the hardest is with my mom's harassment.

74
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.210
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

75
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where the block is. In other words, you've been trying to address the issue.

76
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: In various different ways. And there it is. Still, it's still this big sort of emotional thing, I think,

77
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.690
Samantha Scott: With Mother's Day and everything. You know, it's, it brings it all to the fore.

78
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely.

79
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

80
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's start there. So let me kind of get sorted out here.

81
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.410
Samantha Scott: Is my camera good now.

82
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.370
Samantha Scott: This is a good

83
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Move it just just right there is perfect, right.

84
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have where you're blocked.

85
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.020
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

86
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bridge earliest age of being aware of

87
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom's harassment. Now I just for my own knowledge is harassment.

88
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A bombardment, is it

89
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: An invasion into your emotional space. Is that what harassment is

90
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.490
Samantha Scott: Though I think that was one of the ways like

91
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:02.310
Samantha Scott: It was that plus when she would just be gone withdraw a lot the bedroom door, you know,

92
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

93
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:19.830
Samantha Scott: So you always that was the only door in our house that ever had, like, a deadbolt in it like a hardcore one. And yeah, so she would she would just lockers that she work, work, work hard, the day go home lock yourself in basically

94
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:20.760
Huh.

95
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.980
Samantha Scott: I mean, not all the time. But that was a regular pattern. Like if it was like a school day because she worked at the same school

96
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

97
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:31.200
Like

98
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So her

99
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.890
Samantha Scott: YELLING

100
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.330
Samantha Scott: To

101
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The harassment encompasses not only action, but also in action. It's also this withdraw it feels like harassment.

102
00:11:49.110 --> 00:12:01.200
Samantha Scott: And the constant fear that if I disagreed with her on any point at any point in my life, which when I finally did like in a serious way. This is where we are, where, you know,

103
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:17.070
Samantha Scott: Where we're not even talking. I mean basically by my choice. I guess because I will not talk to her. I'm sure I could go back into a relationship with her under the old terms, you know,

104
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. So in this one, we're just kind of looking for first response. You don't have to explain your answer. Not to me.

105
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:27.600
Samantha Scott: Okay.

106
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Good enough just sitting there on the plate all by itself that response is perfect, without any garnishing without any side of, you know,

107
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.580
Rationalization

108
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The potato fries. We don't need any of it. It's just, you can have a big just the meats just sitting there by itself.

109
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, perfectly fine.

110
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And

111
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what we're doing the destination is to develop a safe space.

112
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what I'm calling an anchor room and it's going to have. That's where we're headed. So just so you know it's going to be a good positive safe place we're headed. I didn't want you to think, well, maybe we're headed somewhere scary awful. We're going somewhere. Good.

113
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. Yeah, I know, right. I want to start that right up front and I'm so it does take imagination. So it's going to be there and right brain, your mind is going to probably tempted to want to force memory, but just it meaning.

114
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you put in this room doesn't have to have existed.

115
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.610
Samantha Scott: Right.

116
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be tempting to do it the other way around. Well, I can't put it in there, didn't exist. Well, in this room with me. You get exactly what you need, what you needed and what you want.

117
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.140
Samantha Scott: So that branch disbelief total

118
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention to display. That is right. You've got. I love that phrase so much. So yes, this is where imagination and fantasy can all all happened in this room. So this is how we get

119
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The asking you three. I know I just have no memory, but there will be some one will be. How old were you when will be. What's the nickname of the third one. You'll find out in the middle of the whole show. Okay.

120
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:21.450
Samantha Scott: Okay.

121
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well suspense and mystery for you.

122
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.380
Samantha Scott: It's like a game show

123
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And what otherwise just just I'm so you might hear me say, Are you having it to be matching the memory or could you give yourself permission to get what you need. You might hear me say something like that. Now you know why I'm saying it.

124
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You have some background story so

125
00:14:44.550 --> 00:15:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you to bridge back in time. So get in touch, first with this belts and Sam of harassment and you have to go all the way. If it's very distressing this all the way up at 100 of zero to 100. You don't have to feel it that intensity but just make contact.

126
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: With harassment with being in the presence of

127
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Another pulling away all the house with a deadbolt.

128
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Rather door with a deadbolt that awareness that if you open up and disagreed with her.

129
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: There'd be a distinct consequence.

130
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Be aware of the yelling and then go back to the earliest age that you remember that feeling of harassment.

131
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Earliest with me.

132
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.670
Samantha Scott: I think I'm somewhere in that

133
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, however you

134
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.610
Samantha Scott: Want to say for

135
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And did you have a nickname for

136
00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Sammy. Alright, Sammy, so I'll probably want to distinguish younger self. This is getting into sort of a psychodynamic framework. So we're going to be going there. You don't have to do the analysis, I'm here.

137
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's what I'm getting paid for. You just have to pay attention to you. It's enough to just catch that first response was the ones I'm looking for. OK.

138
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok we have Sammy and then they'll be Sam. So I might have some moment.

139
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.680
Samantha Scott: 50. I'm not sure.

140
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.650
Samantha Scott: Because that's more my grandparents Sissy, you won't

Gwenevere Abriel: How big is that window. It

176
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:07.080
Samantha Scott: The way it should be like oversized, you know, like it's you know it's like where the, where a bench is like right up against the window, and there's enough room to lay down, you know,

177
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, we'll get into it and get a sense of what the window looks like are there drapes or their blinds or curtains just really good

178
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:28.740
Samantha Scott: I like all I like hardwood smooth hardwood. So that's how I imagine it, and it'd be like, Why are no yellow fluttering curtains kind of

179
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.690

183
00:19:51.600 --> 00:20:00.750
Samantha Scott: You can look out, but all you can see is just really nice like a wildflower meadow. There's nothing to distract outside

184
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue to look around the room and see what else you notice

185
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:33.390
Samantha Scott: There's a law. I need to have, like, I need to keep myself like I don't, I don't want to be thirsty. So there's like a nice carafe of water and some juice glasses, some fruit.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:09.210
Samantha Scott: See, there should be a bed too because sometimes you're not going to want to be in the window seat. You're just going to want to be in a nice soft white fluffy bed.

223
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so we have that sense. And then if you could kind of get a

224
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: An awareness of what data.

225
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: coming in through your ears. Notice what you hear in there, Sammy.

226

228
00:24:51.180 --> 00:25:07.440
Samantha Scott: Soft the sound of the air going through the when I mean going through the trees and occasionally the tree branches rubbing against each other and the sound of birds. There's definitely the Sound of birds not overwhelming, but

229
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.250
Samantha Scott: They're talking outside

230
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice the temperature of this space. Notice the skin, how it feels, just get a sense of temperature and maybe moisture even

231
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:47.280
Samantha Scott: It's like perfect temperature. It's like, for me that's like about 65 degrees cool air is always moving and flowing and never gets stuffy are stagnant. It's not human, but it's not so dry that your skin starts to crack. It's like the perfect

232
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.600
Samantha Scott: Temperature and beyonds

233
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So then kind of have an awareness of

234
00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Even the tactile experience and maybe noticing how

235
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: All the flooring.

236
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.270

237
00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:26.940
Samantha Scott: Yes hardwood, but it's finished so well. But you don't have to worry about splinters. And there's no wax or anything on it. It's just clean and gold blame me. When the sun shines on it. Little rugs.

238
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.950
Samantha Scott: Certain spots that same a rabbit for stuff.

239
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:41.010
Samantha Scott: But mostly it's it's it's very, it's just really, you're not going to hurt yourself on that floor.

240
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no chance you could slide on it.

241
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:50.820
Samantha Scott: All day yeah no splinters splinters don't exist in here.

Gwenevere Abriel: We go.

243
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And get a sense of

244
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of what you smell.

245
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.880
Samantha Scott: I can smell the incense. I can smell the just sort of

246
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:23.730
Samantha Scott: Oh, that'd be nice. I can smell the Hetrick or the after the rain. Like it's rarely rains here, but in this room there's rain smell outside that clean

247
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:34.740
Samantha Scott: It's like a certain smell you can't get from anything else, it's from bacteria coming out, it's, it's like a smell of after rain.

248
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.160
Samantha Scott: You can smell that makes him like coming in through the windows.

249
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Now become aware of the taste of

250
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What's noticed in the mouth. These are a little harder to get to. But maybe there's something there.

Samantha Scott: I've got a I've got a nice corral full of cold, flu cool water cool water not cold and I so my mouth is nice and

252
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:23.520
Samantha Scott: You know, it's not dry mouth, not dry but it's not really overwhelmed with any senses. I'm just trying to be here in this space and enjoy it without, you know, without necessarily. I want to be overwhelmed by taste right now.

253
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just

254
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so there's just a sense of, there's no need for anything in the mouth. It's just right there.

Gwenevere Abriel: It's just fine.

259
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've touched on what you hear, we become aware of

260
00:28:47.820 --> 00:29:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What you see it's like you to turn towards how you got into that room and see if there's a door, and then just described with state of the color, the shape where everything you possibly can about it.

263
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:23.190

264
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:40.530
Samantha Scott: A crystal door knobs that are so pretty from all the houses, but it's really secure. It's not wobbly at all. And it's just a, it's a really solid door when you close it. You can hear that lock click

Samantha Scott: Go and have a drink of water or maybe I want to take a nap. I don't feel like I'm ready to take a nap. But I've got a place to take one and I've got a fridge if I want to snack. I'm not hungry.

285
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:00.450

Gwenevere Abriel: Emotion. Do you have, as you are there running through all of your options. What's the emotion you have

288
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.350

289
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.680
Samantha Scott: Grateful

290
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.940
Samantha Scott: IT'S NICE TO HAVE A Room of One's Own, you know,

291
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can be aware of that. Contentment safety and gratitude, having this nice from all on your own. Where do you feel that in your body.

292
00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.860
Samantha Scott: Right right here.

293
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.120
Who

294
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, is that the stomach area.

295
00:32:55.530 --> 00:33:02.520
Samantha Scott: It's more like the real like the bottom of the real like I guess we're trying to breathe into when I

296
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Left that diaphragm area up there.

297
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:06.210
Yeah.

298
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

299
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like we'll call it the bottom into the ribs.

300
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.270
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

301
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

302
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:26.190
Samantha Scott: Basically that thing. I guess it is close to the stomach is it when we say we're feeling something in our stomach. I feel like we're really feeling it more there.

303
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I get it. What will be a word, though, that we can use. So we can reference that space would work for you.

304
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.470
Like

305
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.030
Samantha Scott: The root

306
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:42.990
Root

307
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.630
Samantha Scott: Feels good. And this is a fun

308
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I want to also add something to this face, and that is that in some secret little compartment in there and the wall. Maybe that only you know about you also magic.

309
00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You also can just press on something and it opens it

310
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:23.820
Samantha Scott: A little hidden a little hidden compartment. That's totally smooth. You can never tell. But

311
00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No one knows you do, and you can pull out this magic wand or whatever it is that you want it to be. But it embodies this

312
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.410
Samantha Scott: I love that I when I was a little kid, I used to

313
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:41.280
Samantha Scott: Literally dream about having a magic wand to do things with

314
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Okay, so we got this one. Beautiful. Yeah.

315
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now I want to move into number I said there was going to be this other question. So here comes and this one just just go back to the room presence there Sammy and

316
00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You were as you were moving around, but

317
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I could drink in my thirsty. I couldn't tired. I could sit here too. I want to sit there

318
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:17.400
Samantha Scott: Right, you can just curl up in the window seat like a cat, you know,

319
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All of those opportunities and it is just the right temperature and that will send awareness.

320
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell the sun's coming through that oversized and

321
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.410
Samantha Scott: Very content very peaceful

322
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.360
Samantha Scott: Yes, great day.

323
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.410
Okay.

324
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To be present with that.

325
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay there. Your eyes close and stay in that industry. And I want to ask you a question. And it's an odd one, so don't expect the answer to come as quickly as these other things did okay

326
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's okay too.

327
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.140
Samantha Scott: Right.

328
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Invitation is to wait for it. Don't explain to me why am I taking so long. What's my don't go there, just wait.

329
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:06.840
Okay.

330
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I certainly am.

331
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll rephrase it a few different ways. I'll just keep guiding until you interrupt me and you know what it is. OK.

332
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:18.990
OK.

333
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Along the way, Sammy, you have had to adapt.

334
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to survive and environment.

335
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.910
And

336
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to survive in order to survive and had to believe

337
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.750
Misinformation

338
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And your adult self Sam knows it was BS. There was a lie that you had to go back

339
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't know any different, but

340
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:48.900
You

341
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Had to absorb that misinformation.

342
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:54.990
From your own

343
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Culture

344
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A greater message, somehow. But.

345
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: did indeed to survive.

346
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Sam knows that.

347
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

348
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not true but Sammy.

349
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Had to believe it was true.

350
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Misinformation was

351
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Patient with it.

352
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.770
Samantha Scott: Feels like it's be small.

353
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:41.880
Okay.

354
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.590
Samantha Scott: I have to be

355
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.190
Samantha Scott: Mom.

356
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. So let's find out. Let's go see. So be in touch with this younger self.

357
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And the best guess Sammy is

358
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:55.380
Samantha Scott: If you

359
00:37:55.410 --> 00:38:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Shine. If you are big, you get sickness. If you are in your full tilt full body slash self.

360
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Badly.

361
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.590
Samantha Scott: Mom Yeah.

362
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There was there's some real truth to it, you may want to check into the root and see if something starting to happen.

363
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's some real truth in it.

364
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.700
Samantha Scott: Oh, no.

365
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do this. Let's check in with

366
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's mom will find out. Or maybe it's your adult self, which one would you like to start with having a little conversation and find out is being small the misinformation that I had to

367
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Conversation with the older self or

368
00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:56.430
Maybe

369
00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:59.370
Samantha Scott: My mom.

370
00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's up to you if you really want to have a vision with your mom, that's up to you. But there are other resources available doesn't have to be her right now.

398
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.200

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Cable stay with that one for a little bit.

400
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:14.850

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:21.000
Samantha Scott: I don't know. It doesn't feel like it was the only message or the main message, maybe

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:23.910
Samantha Scott: I don't know.

403
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.690
Samantha Scott: Or maybe I'm just second guessing myself. I'm really good at doing that.

404
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that so we can come out of it. You want to analyze. You want to come out and we can now.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.730
Samantha Scott: Oh, but I just don't know. I mean,

412

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look

Gwenevere Abriel: Let it flow in the day.

507
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.350
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

508
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.330
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

509
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:07.710
Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: You witness moves up just as it moves further away, you see a way

Samantha Scott: Right.

518
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And Holly Hunter.

519
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: A cool place to be.

520
00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:49.590
Samantha Scott: floating away.

521
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see them when you get to maybe they would say, a little something. Or they would talk with you and

522
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: They might look at it and then come back to you and be

523
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: present with you and choose

524
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:04.380
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

525
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.940
Samantha Scott: They when I feel safe, they will go into those little

526
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.420
Samantha Scott: Good which bubbles and float float off as well.

527
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.580
Samantha Scott: But I know there

528
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there if you need them.

529
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's that leaf. Now, out of sight.

530
00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:29.310
Samantha Scott: Yes.

531
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's open eyes and be present with this therapeutic moment here where we we use our, our skills reflection and let's take some time.

532
00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Process all that work.

533
00:51:53.520 --> 00:52:05.220
Samantha Scott: Well, it feels good. I mean, it felt weird. I've never done that before. I guess it's been a long time since I did at like play acting or anything like that.

534
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:19.260
Samantha Scott: So it definitely is taking so a rearrangement of myself to go back to play with that idea, but I did feel like I connected with the real truth.

535
00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:30.030
Samantha Scott: And I also think I've just kind of scared of the whole enormity of everything, you know, so are probably still really protecting myself even though I'm trying not to.

536
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, let's stay with

537
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.090
Us right

538
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.500
Samantha Scott: They would

539
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be gentle. Be gentle with that.

540
00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Message is one of your there's still another layer.

541
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still protecting you let me know that didn't you

542
00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:49.050
Samantha Scott: Yeah, well,

543
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:56.730
Samantha Scott: I definitely feel that is, I mean, like I said, it's just so do that it's hard to

544
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:06.270
Samantha Scott: But I'm here and I'm present and I want you know I want to find all the pieces and or whatever pieces are necessary.

545
00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:23.970
Samantha Scott: You know, in my interaction with her. I'm just not except for that last talking to her by accident when she called I'm just not letting her. She knows what I

546
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:37.770
Samantha Scott: Well, there's a thing I published on Mother's Day letter, a sort of letter an essay or something. So that's public. If she wants to see it. She knows what I think.

547
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.720
Samantha Scott: So,

548
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.780
Samantha Scott: If she wants to know what I think she can easily find out

549
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:59.010
Samantha Scott: So I don't feel like I'm shutting anything off in terms of a bad way. I'm just shutting off the the bad stuff that you know her trying to be total control of me be just begging attachment of her all that stuff.

550
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:00.510
Samantha Scott: What does that sound good for

551
00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What did you notice about Sammy.

552
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:08.430
Samantha Scott: Sammy.

553
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:11.490
Samantha Scott: She's a

554
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:18.690
Samantha Scott: may try to see your from outside. She's right and

555
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.020
Samantha Scott: Loud and

556
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:29.490
Samantha Scott: She doesn't she doesn't get a lot of positive feedback for either one of those things.

557
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.630
Yeah.

558
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:40.320
Samantha Scott: She's back talking. She's smart mouth, you know, which is they gave you say good

559
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.720
Samantha Scott: I guess you know

560
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.480
Samantha Scott: What the problem is, you know,

561
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:56.070
Samantha Scott: Unfortunately, no matter what you do to try to please people they that's what they want. That's not what some people want, you know,

562
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:57.900
Samantha Scott: So,

563
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:09.480
Samantha Scott: I mean, I know a lot of the adaptive stuff that I've done is not serving me anymore, you know, and it did, then it does now and

564
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:24.480
Samantha Scott: And that's one of the things that I want to try to get to a through my therapy, you know, is figuring out what those things are. And I mean as goofy as it sounds, may be healing my essential wound

565
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.680
Samantha Scott: But I want to

566
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.690
Samantha Scott: I don't want to be

567
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:36.990
Samantha Scott: I don't want to be here. You know, I want to move forward.

568
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:46.980
Samantha Scott: But I know I have to be here and I need to stop overanalyzing everything but it's so hard, like it's the one thing that's like my Kryptonite.

569
00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:48.900
Yeah.

570
00:55:50.460 --> 00:56:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I heard, and I wrote an add a note, I just opened up the note again. I had done typing. But then you said something really important all of its important but I wanted to come back to it again and add it to this very specific anchor room.

571
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Paragraph that I have developed and that is I was bright

572
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And loud.

573
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:11.070
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

574
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's important.

575
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.190
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I was a my mom didn't like it.

576
00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:23.280
Samantha Scott: she's jealous of me. I mean, I hate to say that it sounds horrible. And it sounds like

577
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:44.910
Samantha Scott: Like it just for me from inside my perspective, it sounds horrible for me to be saying that because it makes me think I'm vain, or whatever, but I'm not. I don't think any of that stuff. But she was. She is jealous of me for having a marriage. You know, it's

578
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:46.800
Samantha Scott: Sucks.

579
00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:48.570
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

580
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and loud.

581
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, so that. And so let's lighten it up.

582
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.450
Samantha Scott: myself more permission.

583
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:10.260
Samantha Scott: To be loud and to say things wrong and to not worry that I have to have everything figured out before I even start a sentence right

584
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

585
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's some

586
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.240
Samantha Scott: Good insights. Actually, yeah.

587
00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So the

588
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That quote from. I don't even know if Nelson Mandela is really the one that has said it but he's the one quoted is doing. Doing that that quote about playing small. Do you know what I'm talking about.

589
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:32.340
Samantha Scott: No.

590
00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But, and I've got to find it. It's just too perfect.

591
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't take me long

592
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.800
Samantha Scott: This is the internet world.

593
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got yeah should pop right up right lane small quote

594
00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta be here probably quick. Let me just see.

595
00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, there it is. Just like that. Oh, well, Marianne Williamson is the one that is

596
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying this

597
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I remembered it as

598
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Nelson Mandela being the one who said it.

599
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just make sure that this is a correct one because it's off the internet, it could have been a bad copy. So let me just see.

600
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So far, so good.

601
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

602
00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you might. I don't know what your perspective is on your spiritual perspective, the word God is used several times in here.

603
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.730
Samantha Scott: Good advisory

604
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.590
Samantha Scott: I feel like yeah

605
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good, because it's mentioned a few times. I'm just letting you know that that's going to happen. So I got almost through it. Let me just do this lessons.

606
00:58:55.290 --> 00:59:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't heard, I haven't read this in over a couple years. So it really, it's moving on awesome listening to it because it's so beautiful, so our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.

607
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

608
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us, we ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous. Actually, who are you not to be, you are a child.

609
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're playing small doesn't serve the world.

610
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.590
Samantha Scott: I'm halfway for you. Oh.

611
00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.

612
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: We are all meant to shine as children.

613
00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.

614
01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not just in some of us it's in everyone.

615
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission.

616
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Same

617
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: As we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others.

618
01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:29.400
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

619
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:41.970
Samantha Scott: Yeah, that's beautiful. That's true. To me, it is true, it's totally true. I've never heard a phrase quite that way, though, I'm gonna have to, we'll have to find that quote

620
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.010
Samantha Scott: That whole

621
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:45.450
Samantha Scott: Keep with me.

622
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:46.110
What

623
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see why there was an urgency for me to try and find that for you.

624
01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:59.310
Samantha Scott: Yeah yeah yeah because it it's it's more than it's more than about myself.

625
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.530
Samantha Scott: I mean,

626
01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:23.280
Samantha Scott: If I it's about that entire like societal notion, or whatever causes it to make us think that we're not special. We can't offer anything to the world. And really, that's probably 1,000,000,000% on true for almost everyone on the face of the earth.

627
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You are not that special. And you are incredibly special

628
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.430
Samantha Scott: Right.

629
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.690
At the same

630
01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:37.290
Samantha Scott: And all and end all tamping ourselves down doesn't make any sense.

631
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.570
Samantha Scott: Well, we do.

632
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been in

633
01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The habit of it for a really long time.

634
01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:45.390
Yeah.

635
01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicely done.

636
01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:50.970
Samantha Scott: Was a good

637
01:01:51.990 --> 01:02:03.990
Samantha Scott: That was a good, a good session and I feel I definitely feel like if we were to do something like that. Again, I can maybe relax into it a little bit.

638
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:12.240
Samantha Scott: Sometimes it takes like a second. You know what I mean to or an hour or a year to

639
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:29.070
Samantha Scott: To get comfortable. I feel, I feel a lot more comfortable with that notion of trying to play act and giving myself permission to do it. And that's definitely something I want to do in my own life, to give myself permission to think more creatively and stopping so analytical but

640
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we call it play. What if we just

641
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

642
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:39.750
Samantha Scott: I think the great word I there's nothing bad associated with that word.

643
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a lot of what I'll do is they're, they're just play let's play with this new idea.

644
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's play it out. Let's role play

645
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's lots of play and

646
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at appointments and schedules and

647
01:02:58.770 --> 01:02:58.950
Want

648
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.220
Samantha Scott: Me to give

649
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:06.420
Samantha Scott: In terms of my flexibility.

650
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.110
So,

651
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: A specific

652
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a very time

653
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, I have a variable going on right now that I want to say to you that I'm available on Wednesday.

654
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:24.480
Samantha Scott: I'm sorry.

655
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:37.800
Samantha Scott: Hey, do you

Samantha Scott: Yeah appointment. I'm scheduling.

659
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I am I think at this point until I hear otherwise.

660
01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put something in the book here for May 21 it to 10 but what I want the appointment I want for you is actually at 110 the prior day on Wednesday, but I need to

661
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:16.080
Samantha Scott: Well, you're still trying to work the schedule around. So for right now. The 21st

662
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.120
Samantha Scott: Which is

663
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:20.730
Samantha Scott: Thursday at two, Tim.

664
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:29.280
Samantha Scott: Got it. And then in the future, we're going to be trying to shoot for 110 on Wednesdays, which will be great because it's right after group. Yeah.

665
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me let me let me clarify something you just said something that kind of threw me off just now. So your groups are Tuesdays. Is that correct,

666
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Correct. Okay. Beautiful. So we won't ever have mean it would be very rare for me to book a group and then individual therapy because because of insurance reasons we used to do it.

667
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All

668
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I loved it.

669
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say, Okay, I see in a minute group.

670
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:00.210
Samantha Scott: Right.

671
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:06.780
Samantha Scott: We can't. Right. Yeah. No, I'm on Tuesday at noon right now with group.

672
01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:07.800
The right

673
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm hoping for is may 20 at 110. That's the one I want. But the one

674
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is may 21 at 210

675
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.130
Samantha Scott: That's what's on the books, but you're going to try to switch it to the other one.

676
01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine.

677
01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And okay

678
01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.680
Samantha Scott: And you're just let me know by text. If that

679
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.820

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:30.570

Gwenevere Abriel: Tonight I might know tomorrow. And I know this weekend. I really, I need to, sort of, it's not all on me. I've got to talk with someone about it so

682
01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

683
01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:44.400
Samantha Scott: I don't. Oh, this video is better. The colors a lot better.

684
01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see this less pixelated. Yeah.

685
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.080
Samantha Scott: Okay, so I think I'm just going to use my phone from now on.

686
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It works so well today. That's all you

687
01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

688
01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.170
Samantha Scott: After weird start

689
01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: A lesson I sometimes I'll even just do audio from the phone and a video I am willing to do whatever it takes to get this done for you guys.

690
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:10.470
Samantha Scott: I appreciate it.
