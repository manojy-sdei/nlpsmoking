00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Justin. Justin Alan Kay Jay Williams Justin downwind.

2
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey how she tell me

3
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.950
Jay: What it's doing better.

4
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.480
Jay: I didn't grow up again. Yeah. And yesterday after that.

5
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No, just that one time.

6
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.030
Jay: This is the one time. Yeah.

7
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.460
Jay: In the mornings I don't know why it's a wake up in my stomach is real sour and real

8
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.370
Jay: Like easily triggered.

9
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.750
Right.

10
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you have so much going on. It's really, it's difficult for me to see the, the origin, the etiology of it's hard to see. You have so much that could be contributing to it.

11
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: If there was none of the liver going on.

12
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The just the anxiety of the unknown OF THIS COURT HEARING alone would have a somatic psychosomatic response it this part, the throat chest this core part of our body reacts to things. That's significant.

13
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And it could be causing upset stomach it's real, this stuff really happens. Our stump this gut brain access isn't incredibly refined in its connection so

14
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't

15
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't, I don't know how to pull it apart. So I say let's let's let's attack it at every angle. Let's get the physician. Let's get the specialist. Let's do the psychological stuff. Let's eat good healthy foods. Let's come out in every way we can

16
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

17
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.110

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

19
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.810
Jay: I don't think I don't think I've drink a Coke and probably four months.

20
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so glad that stuff is just pure poison. There's no food in that food.

21
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.990
Jay: Yeah.

22
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Let me get a note for note open for you in here.

23
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: As I'm opening up this note, J. So sort of tune in were to you and sort of identify

24
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe something that you experienced in group, you know that that share. We don't get to share too much in there but you had shared something in there.

25
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, around the thoughts of the cravings and what to do and things like that. Or maybe just go in inside and kind of see, see what you want out of today.

26
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take some time and open up this know take a few minutes and really think about it what you want. I'm interested in that.

27
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.710
Jay: Like as far as like, what, how I want my day to turn out.

28
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.180
Jay: Like what

29
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.550
Jay: After what I want

30
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: After today what you want from today either from from today or how you want to feel after our work together from the therapy from our income.

31
00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.210
Jay: After the session. Okay. I thought you meant like how am I going to tackle the big I tell my gunner. Am I going to do for the day.

32
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you know less about what I want more about what you want from it with that steer us and guide us

33
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a sense of what you want from today, Jay.

34
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.750
Jay: I'm trying to write it down.

35
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time.

36
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.330
Jay: Okay, I put what do I want from therapy.

37
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.130
Jay: I just put I'm just trying to put the tools that I've learned in action.

38
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.200
Jay: And then

39
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.660
Jay: I pull. What do I want from the day I'd like to stay busy cutting hair.

40
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you trust yourself with that money.

41
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That

42
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: We

43
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:46.500
Jay: Are with $50 I put back $50 after I made my first. I don't know 75 or so because I still need to change. So I just put the 50 away.

44
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.260
Jay: Because more hair. The next day,

45
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.990
Jay: At my $15 in change.

46
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.180
Jay: What's the best way

47
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.270
Jay: To about 1514 $15

48
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you wanted to get a stereo system like how much was the price point on a on a good one that you want.

49
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

50
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.390
One.

51
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Shifting gears.

52
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:23.910
Jay: Well, me and my mom because she keeps asking me, what, what am I saving the money for and I really don't have an answer. It's the first time in my life where I've ever had that problem.

53
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.080
Jay: While making money and I have nothing to spend it on

54
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's

55
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.870
Jay: What I got everything I need. I'm trying not to be materialistic stuff.

56
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

57
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So I heard you. And let me echo this back I want

58
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: To

59
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Put

60
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Tools.

61
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I learned into action.

62
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Tools, you've learned just tell me a couple or all of them, and then we'll start there.

63
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.650
Jay: I don't think I could physically tell you, hey, this is the tool that I use to not get high. But I could tell you my thought process. Good.

64
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.470
Jay: You know, I just know that what it's done to me, where

65
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.020
Jay: Where I'm going to go in on the type of person that

66
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.310
Jay: Was I get hiding and

67
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:40.290
Jay: That's the kind of luck. I have and I know that and you know before I really didn't care. I just want to get high. I just wanted to do my do me. You know what I mean. And this time being sober.

68
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.370
Jay: I tried to approach it from a

69
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.120
Jay: I'm doing good. I feel good.

70
00:09:50.040 --> 00:10:03.300
Jay: I attitude, you know, to me, because if I can keep that attitude. The whole time on cutting these people's hair why they're doing their thing and it's not going to bother. It's those times that I get down to myself that I did.

71
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.200
Jay: You know, angry, sad.

72
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.760
Jay: Stuff like that. You know, I mean, that's when you're Brian Moore says

73
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.590
This bubble

74
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.720
Jay: You know what I mean.

75
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's go, let's go for a second to angry, sad.

76
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And powerful that awareness that you have these are called emotional triggers and that is what everybody goes through when things are good. There's also people that that good isn't good enough. And they go, Oh, I can have it even better.

77
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, though. What I heard is sad and angry have been a trigger.

78
00:10:46.470 --> 00:11:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That it could lead you to because it probably has in the past. There's a lot of neurological connections to that where you've used to escape into that euphoria before. So right now, you're using the skill of of negative consequence you remembering what you're doing is you think through

79
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you broke up just a little bit on the on the tele health. So I gotta make sure I heard the last word. I think what you're doing is you're thinking through if I use

80
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The next day I will feel sick. I think you said

81
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you say that or day make that up. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

82
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.510
Jay: I just I just know that things that follow.

83
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

84
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:26.610
But

85
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not. The more specific you are, the better. So

86
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What are

87
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:47.910
Jay: I just I just know once I get a high, they're gonna pop up his chest on in the next day at my look. I'm looking at it like that and I'm looking at, like, I'm actually enjoying what I'm doing. I'm not getting high.

88
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.670
Jay: I'm getting along with my family.

89
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

90
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: They're two different ones that

91
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.850
Jay: What did you call the first one, negative one.

92
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: negative consequences.

93
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.430
Jay: Consequence. No, you said

94
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.430
Jay: Two words negative something

95
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.530
Jay: Where I look back

96
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A negative reinforcement.

97
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's like, so what

98
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If like

99
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.020
Good. What

100
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We're trying to figure out what word and I seem to have lost my own word, but it may come up again. If it's like a seat belt. So when we get in a car. We got beat the beat beat beat so something negative is happening.

101
00:12:44.880 --> 00:13:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Much to get you to do the right thing, something negative happening. They get to do the right thing. So watch. I'm going to have diarrhea my bones will egg. I'll be throwing up I'll be hot, cold sweats, I'll be anxious, the PPP when you mind goes here. It reinforces do the right thing.

102
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get back and you think about the negative it reinforces that you do the right thing.

103
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's an amazing tool that is thinking things through.

104
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And that does take time. So the again, you know, I'm a big advocate for not having that that opiate nearby because that thinking through

105
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though it's a fraction of a second, it still still does take time. So I don't want anyone to stick it in your pocket.

106
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I got my lecture I'm over with it. So let's go. So we're going to call it if you want a negative reinforcer so negative BB BB BB BB was watch it actually shaped your behavior because watch beep beep beep beep beep.

107
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want the beep beep beep beep beep. I'm going to do the right thing, it's shaping the behavior which is

108
00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I got up today. I got excited I reviewed on my list of clients I reviewed my list of people that need a follow up call. I double checked our my sister. Are they sharp. Are they clean or they debt.

109
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the behavior. You're I think you want more of

110
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.250
Jay: It reinforced walkability

111
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.380
Yeah.

112
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're happier you're connecting. I think you're spending more time, tell me again with with your mom, who else you spending time with or if it's just mom. Tell me what that relationship is like these days.

113
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.780
Jay: I mean,

114
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.030
Jay: Half the time on these things, you know,

115
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.920
Jay: What I'm telling her

116
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.610
Jay: You know, to me,

117
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.480
Jay: But she made sure to tell me every day that she's proud of me.

118
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.590
Jay: Constantly

119
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.690
Jay: my step dad.

120
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.400
Jay: Last night.

121
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.310
Jay: You were surprised me.

122
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of cool. How long has it been since your mom was bragging about you.

123
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So positive reinforcement are the positive things like I'm I enjoy. I remember hearing my mom brag about me. I enjoy seeing my step dad because you've got a lot of history with him right so

124
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing his face. He's like, whoa, that's nice, right, he's right. And that was all you, and you wouldn't be doing that if you were Slinging dope.

125
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if you were out on the street, you wouldn't be doing that because that that that's not fast money that's hard earned that's hard earned reward what you're doing.

126
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good stuff.

127
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But it does take responsibility. It means follow up calls it means you know not not allowing this stuff.

128
00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to talk more about this one when I get down on myself.

129
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to know more about that.

130
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And with the overall

131
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We just get this thought out with the overarching goal of today that there be a review of what the tools are and a way of sort of practicing them and putting them into action. So there'll be sort of this invitation. Maybe homework or something like that, so that we can

132
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do them review them so that you can remember them in real time. When you're faced with sad, angry, or being down on yourself that they're remembered because this stuff's hard to remember because you haven't done it much.

133
00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go into when I'm down on myself. Can I hear your the sequence of thoughts that you go through

134
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.430
Jay: I couldn't take you to the sequence sometimes

135
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.190
Jay: It just depends. Sometimes I can go from blacking out to tunnel vision.

136
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:20.040
Jay: You know, the hot bass hot tea and it's the same process of whenever I get mad.

137
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:31.050
Jay: Sometimes not all the time. It just depends on how let down. I am, I guess.

138
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.040
Yeah.

139
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.860
Jay: Like whenever I send out my girl number. I told you about that on my girl was texting or at

140
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:45.600
Jay: And I got that tunnel vision and stuff. It wasn't immediately anger know immediately.

141
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.830
Jay: Grief was like

142
00:17:52.530 --> 00:18:00.210
Jay: Right away my body just get hot, and I just feel a wave of rush over me and that's whenever I get tunnel vision.

143
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.400
Jay: Man, I got mad when I started texting back with the original emotional words.

144
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So actually the original which is really neat J. You have this gift for being able to go to the body. First, and it's cool, because that does React first so your body has this reaction which is

145
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Heat

146
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, it, it sounds like in some ways you do a you do a dissociative response you do sort of dip out of consciousness.

147
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, interestingly,

148
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We really can't fight when we're in that we can't advocate for ourselves when we're dissociated

149
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So you you return to anger this defense position, which is an act. It's mobilization, so that'll get you texting yelling fighting and taking action in your life.

150
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So a part of me is kind of glad that you don't completely

151
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, split into another personality. I mean, maybe you do. I don't know yet, but I'm glad that at least you can rally the mobilization into anger. Okay, so maybe the next person might say that's a bad thing, but I don't. I like when anger is around

152
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there there's movement.

153
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But I am kind of curious that the first response is

154
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You said blackout.

155
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that like like check out like like you literally are spaced out

156
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:44.940
Jay: Yeah, kinda, you're just like, Okay, like your mind's blown, you know, everything's just like

157
00:19:46.650 --> 00:20:04.350
Jay: limbo, you know, that moment right before something bad happens where you're like, you know, maybe you see your life. That's what I picture when people say my last life last performance at the moment when you're behind your own eyeballs back your head. You know what I mean. That makes sense.

158
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that shock.

159
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that you are now.

160
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.580
Jay: Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's

161
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.820
Jay: No.

162
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:15.960
Okay.

163
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

164
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.410
Jay: anything happened to me. What about my fellow my grandma passed away.

165
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:26.850
Okay.

166
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: OKAY TO ASK YOU CALLING IT grief there too. So maybe it's its loss of of love is that that shock grief response. Okay.

167
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to write down some of these these really important words. So we have this sense of blackout.

168
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Tunnel vision hot face.

169
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: When

170
00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Sig near frequently let down and then

171
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Grief

172
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Much like when last

173
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

174
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, why don't we. Let's see.

175
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What if today was more about doing some processing and not as I know what you wanted was to put

176
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Put skills into action. But you have so much trauma history. Jay, I clinically think that we're going to need to work through maybe sometimes we work on tools and skills and other times we do a grief processing and trauma processing. Would that be okay.

177
00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So today. Why don't we do a little bit of the processing. So let's do a little bit if we get to be him. Dr. Great. This this bit at age 15

178
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now it just how distressing. It is, it's just sitting here because it's a random number. But how distressing from zero to 100. Is it just talking about this age 15 loss with grandma.

179
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.300
Jay: That's probably one of the worst times of my life.

180
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling right now.

181
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.690
Jay: That harder.

182
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.670
Jay: I took that harder. They were my cousins got shot that's, I mean,

183
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:42.990
Jay: That's when I really started not to care you know back then. I was getting high. I was being a kid, you know,

184
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.440
Jay: Whenever that happens whenever I started

185
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:56.100
Jay: You know, thinking I can sell math and you can get people on board with gone. You know, I just graduated to a whole different level.

186
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Dang. OK, so

187
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what I have on my thermometer here is that was

188
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Age 11 when you saw your cousins.

189
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And

190
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This loss of grandma was even more significant is that right

191
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:29.310
Jay: I think, yeah, I took that harder than. Okay. Right. I think I might my cousin getting shot have more influence on my life. Does that make sense.

192
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I took that heart Grandma I took harder, that's when I really started not to care.

193
00:23:38.970 --> 00:24:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And now age 11. This is what what I wrote age 11 I saw three of my cousins get murdered rolled up to the park and they sprayed the car with gunshots. I was the only survivor the emotion confused. I never cried and miss the funeral, but went to the wake. The first time I saw violence.

194
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That I have up in 100

195
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But I can move these things around there might be multiple one hundreds, there might be a 99 I can put a number, whatever this this story about about grandma this loss.

196
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you, what number is it right now for you.

197
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

198
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.940
Jay: I don't want to change it.

199
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:42.930
Jay: I don't know, I just took it harder I cried for days I you know I mean I took in high school.

200
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

201
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

202
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you miss about being around her.

203
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hanging out.

204
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.070
Jay: I didn't even get to tell it to buy

205
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had a chance to actually write a letter by letter to her. Have you done that.

206
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.090
Jay: I did that.

207
00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:31.950
Okay, good.

208
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you miss her. Well, that's beautiful and and

209
00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Playing cards. What, what did you play with her what she likes to do with you.

210
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:47.610
Jay: All the dinner.

211
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Volunteer you guys would sit there and play solitaire

212
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Who else do you play cards with

213
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.150
Jay: Just play cards.

214
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That quote, you know, we forget what people did we forget the things they did, but we remember how we felt around them that my Angela home quote

215
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you feel when you're around her.

216
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.480
Jay: Happy

217
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you feel safe and accepted as well.

218
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:33.270
Yeah.

219
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Where else do you get those feelings.

220
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you want to tell yourself and people keep trying to label you

221
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. People that have that kind of connection with love the way you're feeling right now.

222
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not seeing it. I'm not seeing those labels that you've been assigned when you were a little boy, you know, when you were, you were saying be cut the head off because you thought it was the same.

223
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's a past. I'm not seeing that right now. I'm seeing someone who loves deeply who feels empathy.

224
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Who cares about others.

225
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that about you to that you care about people.

226
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's risky because we might get let down

227
00:27:48.420 --> 00:28:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This recovery thing is no joke. It ain't for the week. I gotta tell you, you know, people look at me and they look at me and they say, oh, you little buddy, a little cheerleader or something, you know, old one, but the

228
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Fact that right. I can sit with really big feelings. I feel like a badass.

229
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Because y'all. Y'all might know how to punch something

230
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But can you sit with fear.

231
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And really sit with it and not act out not throw something now call a name. The courage that it takes to sit with sorrow and not run away from it. That takes a kind of inner strength that you may not have really sat with

232
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: For big pieces of your life and you're doing it now, because you can't run away to the euphoria of a substance. I know you're still using marijuana, which I'll talk about some other time.

233
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But the biggest scape into heroin. That's the big one. So let's appreciate the progress that you're making

234
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That feeling that you just dipped into just now into sad.

235
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a part of you that is grateful to have known that kind of love.

236
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.230
Jay: I don't you wanna start talking

237
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:14.760
Jay: I get let down with the world, the universe. I just don't see why she waited.

238
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: He want to know why.

239
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that does kind of bring us to a philosophical question.

240
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You believe in a deity, like a god or is it like a karma thing like what do you rely on you have to think, how does this get

241
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: decided, why didn't you said bad luck, like you have shitty luck. Like, how do you see how the world works, why do good things happen to her him and other things they get crapped on like how do you make sense of it.

242
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.540
Jay: I don't I try. I just

243
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

244
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I imagine you've tried on structured religion right you've tried to cram it into formal religion. And did you end up kind of going no that doesn't work for me.

245
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did that formal religion was it Christianity or Catholicism was a Christianity. Okay. Where did it break down that it stopped making sense.

246
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.560
Jay: I mean,

247
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.360
Jay: Just the people that

248
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:53.100
Jay: I don't know how are you going to try to tell somebody else how to interpret something that on interpret the Bible. You know what I'm saying.

249
00:30:54.450 --> 00:31:02.550
Jay: And I don't believe that God whispered, if anybody here you know I'm saying I think everything is just the way it's supposed to be.

250
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:07.440
Jay: And if I'm supposed to walk out the door and break my leg that's exactly what's going to happen.

251
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:13.770
Jay: Is something intervenes and later on down the road. I'm gonna break a leg. It was gonna break a break.

252
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay that's outcome. Can we stay there because I could see some, some places that I could kind of kind of enter here.

253
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just stay there for a moment.

254
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're if I'm hearing you correctly, it's you can accept that.

255
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to walk out the door.

256
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I there may be steps there. I may remember to step correctly or I may not, and I may break my leg. You can do that much. Right.

257
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But go outside you shell.

258
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right

259
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You still go outside. You walk out the door. You don't know if you're going to break your leg.

260
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you can see the behavior in walking outside and trusting, I'm assuming, basically.

261
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be okay. I know you're saying, I won't be okay. But if you were sure if you're more sure that you're going to break your leg, you probably wouldn't go out that door. You probably do something to

262
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.080
Jay: More of it. If you're having this conversation in your head. It's going to drive you crazy.

263
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's go around.

264
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:39.240
Jay: I think that I think that we determine what's going to happen to us by the choices that we make right now.

265
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.380
Jay: You know I'm saying you're making a 5050 chance

266
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.870
Jay: Pick up his pen.

267
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.950
Jay: That could create a butterfly effect to who knows what.

268
00:32:50.760 --> 00:33:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. Okay. So, and I do have a destination in all my ramblings I promise I'm trying to teach something and I'm going to make my way back. So here it is. We all agree that walking out the door has a risk of the butterfly effect. We don't know what it is.

269
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And we also know that picking up the pen.

270
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: has an effect. Those are behaviors, you'd both agree to agree. Those are behaviors. Can we can we move back even earlier to a behavior which is

271
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: A thought so sit with that for a second.

272
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If I

273
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Think I'm going to walk outside our night thinking it before. I'm actually walking outside

274
00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we do routines things. So we might not be thinking too much like we automatically might lead a cigarette, where it's like, it's so ritualized but you did actually have a thought it was an automatic one and it was a bit unconscious, but it still came from here, didn't it

275
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is the part that I want to see if you have been with me. Do you believe that the thought alone.

276
00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a behavior.

277
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, far out so

278
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Can changing your behavior thought

279
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: change what you do in the world, as in where I walk out the door. What I do with the pen.

280
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Can change my thinking change my behavior.

281
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

282
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:41.580
Jay: You have, you have to catch yourself in those thoughts.

283
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.540
Jay: That's

284
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:52.470
Jay: The hard part. That's what I've been trying to do. My whole life I've been trying to get over this for a long time, not just with heroin with math.

285
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.330
Jay: For alcohol. I have now called on for a long time and

286
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:08.790
Jay: That that's usually better train yourself to recognize what you're thinking. But basically you you've got to think about it. You know I'm saying that makes sense.

287
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.320
Jay: And that's where your conscience comes in and talks to you and tells you

288
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:25.110
Jay: You know it's making your decisions behind the scene everything. So everything so uniform. You do it so much that everything just comes natural.

289
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.950
Jay: So in order to change that you got to train your mind.

290
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.890
Jay: Like you said, a thought isn't

291
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That part. And I would add is I think maybe about 10 years, or maybe more, I would have agreed with you. I didn't have any of the somatic and the body awareness. It was like the body was just this thing that that my my my brain drug along just to make sure I ate and put clothes on.

292
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It was like nothing. It's like, what do I need this body, for it was all about this.

293
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't think that anymore.

294
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I think my my brain is connected to my body.

295
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this has something to offer.

296
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think the quicker you tune into that hot face.

297
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens before your fancy thinking happens, I promise you.

298
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It knows danger before it has a word to describe the danger. That's why you're alive.

299
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It knows it instinctively threat response. I don't know what just happened, but my body just responded to threat. It does it instantaneously.

300
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The sooner you so you want to get all fancy up here you've got data going on in the body in the crunchy stomach type job fists clenched sweaty palms, whatever it is for you that's happening.

301
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Milliseconds, which to me is a long time before you have thing goes all the way up the amygdala, all the way up and if it bothers to make it all the way to a thought which

302
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're so flooded with fear and anxiety.

303
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted to get to the thought so you you think the point of entry is a thought. But you could be in so much distress, the amygdala cuts it off and you won't make it to the, to the left.

304
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hemisphere, or to the prefrontal cortex, which is the last one to come online. And that's the one that does this.

305
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Sequence. And if I do A, B, C, D, it will lead me to jail. It's the one that you want to rely on and I'm telling you, it's the last thing to come online.

306
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So I say let's catch the thing that comes online first and that's our body, our body is going to know there's a problem, long before your fancy brain is going to come up with a word to describe it.

307
00:37:54.630 --> 00:38:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to know something's up so the more you get into and this is what the rehab right probably didn't talk much about

308
00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But that hot face. That's your key something. So this is what it would look like if it was happening right if I had if I was more attuned to my body. Now I have a fever senior group, but I do this, but

309
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It last week, even I said, or I think was my 9am 1pm yesterday.

310
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I said out

311
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: My lymph nodes.

312
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So those are mine. I have I now know I get a, like a needles DP. So I know something important just happened when they sting.

313
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I kid you not. It's just the wildest thing and I go, something's going on and I soon as i feel that i i go intro selective I go in, where I go something important.

314
00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is happening, what is it that I just said, what is it, because I was in group. What is it that someone just said was I a phony. Was I a fraud. Did someone just say something

315
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I would have had a longing to finish, or maybe it was to be liked, or maybe it was to say something or get across the point was something really important just happen. I wonder what that was. But notice that it came after I felt it.

316
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to you.

317
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to a recent interaction. Let's go subtle, not the big heavy

318
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.410
Jay: hitters

319
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go subtle. Let's go. Recently, sitting with mom.

320
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Recently with stepped out something like that where you maybe resisted getting into an argument. Let's just see if we can find one like that where there was a threat response of she's misunderstanding me or I'm about to get a criticism, can you pick up a little story recently like that.

321
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:02.850
Jay: Um,

322
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:12.840
Jay: Yeah, I mean, whenever my step dad asked me to help him hang the lights are no, he said, I'm going to give you a job to do, is what he told me

323
00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. How did you feel. Soon as you said that

324
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.020
Jay: I was just like, Okay.

325
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but that's what you said, I want to know. And this might be the work is you got to investigate how it feels.

326
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell you to track it back to deconstruct it most people get their body responds, as soon as they hear step down say this I as soon as they hear that sound coming from Step Dad. The body remembers that man's voice.

327
00:40:44.580 --> 00:41:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And that shits about to go down. They know I versus I think the body remembers the intonation like one of them is going to be a lecture. One of them is going to create confrontation, the body knows that tone of voice it registers at different what the way he said it. I

328
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have a stress response to you remember

329
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.030
Jay: Big idea that I remember.

330
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Your eye out for it.

331
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the work you want to find out the earliest sign of perceived threat that the body experiences because guess what, when you catch that much like the thing I just showed you with my lymph nodes, right.

332
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I can catch it and I can see I say to myself something important at stake if you don't like that one, you could say I have perceived threat going on my body is responding doesn't mean it's accurate and

333
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be responding to an old memory of something from

334
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be it's misinterpreting it

335
00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's where our big brain can psychoanalyze that and say, oh, that's all dialed up because of my early trauma. This ain't nothing. This is just, he's just asking for some, I need to have relaxed muscles and be in a relaxed body.

336
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'll think better

337
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: faster, stronger.

338
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be have a more

339
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Efficient brain, but it does start here.

340
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So over the coming week I kid you not, J.

341
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: track it.

342
00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you pick up the phone and look at a text want you to pay attention to how your body feels when it sees who the sender is

343
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you read the text. How does your body respond as soon as as soon as you hear your mom's voice and the different voices. She makes

344
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yay versus

345
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel me

346
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:51.690
Jay: Yeah.

347
00:42:53.910 --> 00:43:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I just kind of pretending. So pay attention to the different inflections of her voice, the volume of the voice and same with step dad.

348
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Are and okay the same let's start there.

349
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be a detective.

350
00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and I together will uncover the mystery to find the core messenger that's going to give you the earliest sign of how to behave differently.

351
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people Jay are not paying attention to me what percentage is my body compared to my head like massive there's so much more data going on for some people, they're they're doing this and they don't realize they're doing this.

352
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There are there there little toes are scratching up or this

353
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.500
Jay: Left to

354
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.000
Jay: I'm UVA law.

355
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.420
Jay: Yeah, like my mom will be like all stop. I'm like,

356
00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.170
Jay: Dude just it's like a

357
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.640
Jay: It's like a what you call it.

358
00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.580
Jay: I don't know, call it

359
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You can call it a lot of things. Jay, but I'm more interested. I'm less interested in a label labels.

360
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Are followed by like a period. And we're, we're done talking about it. I'm more interested in when you're doing this, when are you doing it more when you're around mom and I'm more interested in how this helps you to deal

361
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: With the interaction with someone who is it and I want to know what is it doing to help you. What is it helping with because it is a solution for a problem.

362
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know what the problem is. Notice you said anxiety in order for you to have anxiety in your brain. The body has to be in perceived threat if you're talking to your mom. There is perceived threat and I want to know what is

363
00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:00.150
Jay: It, everybody. I don't like being around people and antisocial.

364
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.980
Jay: That's not

365
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.010
Jay: If I don't know you like

366
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.770
Jay: You know, then I'm not comfortable

367
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:08.580
Jay: You know,

368
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:15.270
Jay: Even my grandparents, my, my step dad's parents and even still now.

369
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a period that's the end of it, but not for me. I want to know more about it. I want to know the actual perceived threat, your body

370
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is getting you ready for danger. It's trying to cope. It's trying to self soothe and get you ready because something bad's about to go down and I want to understand that more

371
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Because people are work we're dangerous we lie we hurt you. We let you down. We betray me physically. I mean, we were dangerous we creatures. So, I get it.

372
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But I still want to understand the first inclination and registering

373
00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit more with this person, a little bit less with this volume, the way they were talking or if I noticed I wasn't moving as much that might be where you start. I noticed I wasn't moving as much when my mom left the room and she was in the kitchen.

374
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to investigate your own response. How are you responding differently. Even subtly to different people in order for you to cut hair.

375
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing something to modulate that movement because you're going to still you're in order to cut, you're going to have, you have to I've cut hair, you got to be steady. Oh.

376
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're doing something you pay attention to.

377
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And how it changes.

378
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Start start there. That's my my

379
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation is to start there.

380
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to me.

381
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.680
Jay: Know,

382
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So the word you were probably you may have been looking for the word compulsive

383
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Or an obsessive behavior. I don't know. But the way I think about people because I like to think of people as an adaptive that you've adapted a particular coping skill or solution to a perceived problem or threat. I like that works better for me.

384
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm interested in what the perceived threat is and more interested in that.

385
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus

386
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the label. Like, what do we do with a label. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO DO WITH US. There's no movement. There's no girls, what do you do with a label.

387
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing.

388
00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not a label.

389
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.710
Jay: Mark frozen. I don't even know where this conversation.

390
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I can bring us back.

391
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I think I'll pull up the anchor.

392
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did want today to be about

393
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.040
Jay: Using the tools.

394
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking tools and putting them into

395
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Action right

396
00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, now we're both frozen. Hmm. I think our

397
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear and see me okay hear and see me, I'm doing away.

398
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And we're back. Okay, so let's let's tether back to the origination. I want to be able to put this tools I've learned into action.

399
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

400
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like you to put into action. If you're willing

401
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: A paying attention to your body's response to social encounters, and that includes looking at a text hearing the Phone Vibrate it starts that early like even knowing I'm about to have a social interaction.

402
00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It can happen very fast or your eyes wake up and you're like, oh, I don't have to talk with people today will have to meet customers today.

403
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to walk out into the kitchen or may see someone, it happens very fast. As soon as consciousness hits us

404
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Or sometimes even in our dream life. I'll have to interact with people pay attention to how your chest feels your gut, your arms, your legs, your head, your neck, your back all of it.

405
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:41.100
