00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Stena hair. Oh, 7am

2
00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.710
Individual therapy.

3
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.920
yearn for

4
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, good morning.

5
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.780
Christina Haro a: Good morning.

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Right. Nearly you got your coffee handy.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.660
Christina Haro a: I got my coffee. I'm

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Excellent. So I saw you already checked it. Thank you.

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so today we are going to do a little review of how you're doing with your goals and I just started to look at them and then I logged in with you. So let's take a look at

10
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: First one, which you've identified as wanting a job. I know that that care position fell through. And I know you've been busy putting in applications. Are you feeling optimistic discouraged you noticing something's getting in the way.

11
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:27.990
Christina Haro a: Nor I feel feeling really optimistic. Actually, I have a, I have an interview this week. Well, totally different kinds of dub, but it's somewhere where my son works and going to try to get me in at a hotel, so I'm

12
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.010
Christina Haro a: I think of my pen out so

13
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, and what's the position for

14
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:46.020
Christina Haro a: I'm it's housekeeping while it's not really housekeeping room attendant slash housekeeping. Okay, which would keep me busy and

15
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.890
Christina Haro a: Helped me with exercise a little bit more. So that would be good.

16
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you'd be moving around. Yeah, okay, and

17
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Has your son told you anything that you might have concerns about as far as the ethics or the behaviors of bosses and things like that that we can get ahead.

18
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.300
Christina Haro a: Actually, he says mom would be really good for you. He says, because why work. It's a really nice when he works in a really nice out

19
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:29.220
Christina Haro a: Get hotel, a really expensive hotel here in Albuquerque. When is the most expensive hotel. So he says, it's really quiet the buses are really till he says, I think the atmosphere would be really good for you.

20
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I love hearing that. Okay. Excellent. And let's see.

21
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The topic of spirituality and religion supporting the recovery process. That's a big. It's a big topic, most people go through waves of connection with their spirituality

22
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When they're in their active addiction. They've sort of pulled away from it.

23
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You had mentioned on the 10th of February. I go to church on Sundays. I do pray and talk to God.

24
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked God to help me and you have a private private moment with him and that your mom had raised Catholic

25
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But, see if you can zero in a little bit further into the connection between your relationship with with God and recovery. See if you can hold those two things, see what those are for you. These days, how spirituality could help you maintain support your long term recovery goals.

26
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.250
Christina Haro a: Well, I, you know, let's we're talking this last boo, you know, I'm I kind of pulled away a lot from you know

27
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:55.470
Christina Haro a: Anything regarding a religious religious and spiritual stuff I did for a while, you know, when I was at my worst and then slowly. I started kind of

28
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:08.550
Christina Haro a: You know, pulling myself back into it and lately. I think I've been doing okay to where I go to church. Once in a while, more than what I did before. Okay, so I've kind of been, you know, a little more

29
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.600
Christina Haro a: You know a little bit more open to

30
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It. So Christina.

31
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

32
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That is general you're going the kind of question I'm asking you is is a, it's a deeply personal one. It has to do with how it helps support recovery and and this you might not be there yet. And that might be what I'm running into

33
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just going, I could go to

34
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't mean anything.

35
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you. What's the missing piece. What's missing between the connection between your spirituality and looking ahead, or even today, drawing the connection between

36
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Spirituality and faith God. However, you think about it, right, of using some of your wording.

37
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And your ability

38
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To maintain sobriety.

39
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing actively. You know what I'm trying to get at.

40
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't wanna

41
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.260
Christina Haro a: I wanna, I think.

42
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.650
Christina Haro a: I think you're right. I'm probably not there yet.

43
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:29.580
Christina Haro a: Okay, the point to where I actually feel like okay I can actually, you know, I probably not. Okay. I'm not there yet.

44
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:37.680
Christina Haro a: Okay, I wish I was there a little bit more than what I should be. But I'm not going to say, Yeah, I am, because

45
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's finish that sentence because there's a couple of fragmented sentences.

46
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I can actually see if you can finish that you identified of something might be missing. So see if you can identify the rest of that sense. I'm not there yet. When where I can actually what

47
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.600
Christina Haro a: Why can I leave

48
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.710
Christina Haro a: Turn to my faith and actually say, You know, I'm I have guidance, I

49
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.640
Christina Haro a: Know, yeah I don't feel that I don't

50
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And so that's probably what I'm picking up on because typically when people are there. It's like they just can't talk enough about, you know, moments and oh yesterday. Oh, this morning, you know,

51
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I yeah so when you're there, you know, the way the details the stories will be rich in your life. So that's where we're at. Got it. Okay, let's let's keep going.

52
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're just touching lightly on some goals here.

53
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's very, very personal. You know, this is something that you're going to register. Maybe you'll dip into it a little bit closer. Maybe at other times, you'll be pulling back, but this is this is by no means defined by me, this is, this is your own very, very deeply personal experience.

54
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So you identified very early on. I want to feel normal.

55
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And work and not depend on drugs. I want to be drug free. So that's the overarching goal when it comes to sort of the MA ti part, you know, checking in with

56
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: With your physician and how am I doing on my dose and MIT brain. How am I feeling

57
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And am I still self, self medicating or am I, kind of, well, you know, my kind of malingering here and hanging onto this low longer than I need to this is this space that's right there. So we're going to touch on it for just a second.

58
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically, you know, kind of an uncomfortable. One is, people aren't really excited about tapering yet.

59
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about tapering not off but down, not the same treatment plan people oftentimes stay at two milligrams point seven five. I've been working with someone who's been at point seven five for quite some time. We continue to do individual therapy.

60
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's nobody saying much about it because it's such a low dose, you know, and, and she's doing just fine. So there's a difference between a treatment plan that's off.

61
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And a treatment plan that's just down. So, for a moment, try on this idea of you're living your life with a low dose of buprenorphine what what comes up for you.

62
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:40.950
Christina Haro a: Well, to me, um, I, you know, so, because I think about a head, you know, and they think about what's going to happen. And to me, I looked at it, and I'm like, well, hopefully, at that time, you know, I

63
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:55.890
Christina Haro a: A lot more myself and I can you know I'm not looking forward to, to, okay, is this medicine going to make me feel better. Am I going to feel okay today. I'm hoping that when they get there. I'm like,

64
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.370
Christina Haro a: A lot more normal than I am now.

65
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.150
Christina Haro a: Okay, you know what I mean.

66
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.050
I like to

67
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Point out

68
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.780
Christina Haro a: Here I'm just hoping you know things are a lot more

69
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So well

70
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.580
Christina Haro a: For me,

71
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Well see that North that word normal is going to need a lot more explanation. We're going to come back to it because it's a word you use

72
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think that's why we're meeting still weekly. So really understand your expectation and see if our work together can get you there. But I got to understand what that means, because normal for you and me probably not the same thing.

73
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want your comfort normal or or an exciting normal or calm or whatever it is. Okay, so let's go over to

74
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Me just put target.

75
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.310
Are

76
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

77
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.040
T. A.

78
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And this one here, same goal, but just a different objective you coming to individual therapy, you've actually been really consistent with that.

79
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get the sense that you want to continue at this rate will continue to address underlying issues.

80
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll continue at this rate, but at this point.

81
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If something happens where you need to cancel. We can do it every other week.

82
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But the progress will just get slowed down as all okay

83
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go over here to I want to be happy and not bring my baggage. Now, you went in again to explaining what baggage is and so interesting because there's a little note without word normal in here again you really like that one. He

84
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta know what that is. So you touched on February 20

85
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It the baggage is referring to

86
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you sound like Grandma, I think it's that anger. I think it's that that temper piece that that the baggage you're bringing

87
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. Yeah. Alright, have a short fuse.

88
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay and over this last week. What have you noticed about that fuse.

89
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:32.940
Christina Haro a: Actually this last week has been pretty calm, you know, we, I've been busy. You know, we've all been busy. And actually, you know, it says been pretty common here you know that even, even in myself. I've been feeling, feeling pretty good.

90
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know how you went like this, right.

91
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha Oh, do you remember where you got yeah maybe irritated or angry and you did something different than you normally do. Do you remember doing anything differently.

92
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.540
Christina Haro a: I'm

93
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really.

94
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't know okay okay okay but you're this, you're going like this and sort of saying

95
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.030
That you have

96
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:22.290
Christina Haro a: Because what I've noticed, I guess, um, I noticed that when I get angry and my views starts to light and it gets really short.

97
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:37.830
Christina Haro a: And I could feel it in here you'd like to fill it in my chest. I could fill that I'm getting angry, I said to my heart's pounding my chest in my head. So that's why I tell you, I've been feeling just calm you know hominids happy about that.

98
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that could be you tell me, is it because people have been doing what you want them to, or have people been ups doing things where they break the rules they disappoint you, and you're responding differently.

99
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:05.520
Christina Haro a: I think it is. I'm trying to respond differently. I've been using a lot of the stuff you tell me and I've been trying. I've been trying really hard.

100
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice, earlier I said, what have you. What are you doing differently. You weren't able to remember. So this time, you're saying I am doing the stuff you're telling me. And so, do you know what you were doing.

101
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.720
Christina Haro a: Um,

102
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.720
Christina Haro a: I think the breathing helps me

103
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:25.830
The breathing.

104
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the belly breathing. You're getting that error down in the bottom of the lung.

105
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.180
Christina Haro a: Yes. Okay.

106
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. And that helps everybody and then you remember the other cool stuff little tricks, maybe just to review.

107
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Son, I feel scared, I see you looking like you're going out tonight and I'm getting my chest all tight.

108
00:13:52.620 --> 00:14:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you reassure me where you're going to be. And so I don't have to worry on a really different way of talking right I feel scared it's the I feel remembering that

109
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.350
Christina Haro a: I feel

110
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a pretty different one for most people, because we're not raised to talk like that.

111
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Were raised to tell stories. I feel like you don't care about me and you don't never you never going to care and you're so inconsiderate and

112
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't care. Then I get, you know, I'm going to have a heart attack and I'm gonna love you know love me. And we started tell right we instead of saying, I feel scared.

113
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We give stories about what it's like this other person or listener or son can hear what our internal experiences, but using an emotion word is precise and it's irrefutable. It's not up for debate.

114
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel scared.

115
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm showing up irritable and angry, son. But that's not really what's going on inside of me. I'm actually really scared.

116
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Different really different way for people to talk or it's it's vulnerable. It's, you know, we're we're putting our little underbelly out there and saying,

117
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, be gentle with this thing that's precious to me. My fear.

118
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But it gives your son a chance to really see how deeply you care about his safety, right. I'm just making up an example, obviously, but I happen to have a little story from you in the past.

119
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, let's go over to same air here. Let's go to app. So one thing that I like to be developing all the time is the relapse prevention plan. So a relapse prevention plan is developed sometimes for years as I'm working with people or months, however long you guys stay here with us.

120
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I just started chip away out and I'm always adding a little sentences and little bits. So today, let's put a couple items in it. Okay.

121
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think

122
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think back at times when you have what's called self medicated when you have thought

123
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't. Oh, this is awful. I'm just going to reach for a pill.

124
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Or heroin or more Suboxone

125
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Or alcohol. Remember, right.

126
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's a category that I have in the relapse prevention area that is called emotional triggers.

127
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: For you. What is an emotional trigger

128
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: In the past doesn't have to be yesterday. Just need to keep your eye out have it written down. What's an emotional trigger might be an emotion. It might be something someone does an event a memory. What's an emotional trigger

129
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:06.060
Christina Haro a: I think to me was when my older daughter was here. I think that was she really poked around me and motion Lee was when she was yelling at me, telling me.

130
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:21.720
Christina Haro a: When she was here, which was last year, you know, probably summer time I'm yelling at me, telling me that I was a horrible mother. Yeah, that I was like my mom. That's very emotional. That really triggered me. Yep.

131
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the emotion that you felt was what

132
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.980
Christina Haro a: It was like a

133
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.850
Christina Haro a: Hate anger.

134
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

135
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You were hating who or what what St. Where's the hate

136
00:17:47.040 --> 00:18:00.930
Christina Haro a: Directed I think at the time I was hating her because of the way she talked to me and then I was angry because of, of, I guess, the memory of brought you know when she was telling me that was, she was yelling at me.

137
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.900
Christina Haro a: Okay, I was hating her for the way she talked to me and I was angry at

138
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.420
Christina Haro a: The memories that brought back

139
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the memories that brought back

140
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Where was the anger directed

141
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.990
Christina Haro a: I guess why my childhood. That's what my anger was directed I was angry at

142
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.350
Christina Haro a: That was angry. You know, all the stuff I went through when I was young.

143
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Hundred and underneath that it's very rare that anger sits there alone as a primary emotion, it tends to be the secondary one if underneath anger. When you think of those childhood memories. What's an emotion underneath anger.

144
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.890
Christina Haro a: Hurt. I was hurt. Okay.

145
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the same as sad.

146
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You find it.

147
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.810
Christina Haro a: quite sad.

148
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you feel I know these are hard to get to, because you probably isolated from from feeling these because you go to anger quite a bit.

149
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: As a way to self preserve and I completely understand it's a very common phenomenon.

150
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about that childhood was much of the time just sort of being an angry child, or was it feeling unwanted unloved sad rejected confused scared confused. You know, like you see there's other words we can use here.

151
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What are we

152
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.260
Christina Haro a: Getting close to anything. I was more like

153
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.430
Christina Haro a: More like a rejected kind of filling up

154
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.310
Christina Haro a: Yeah, rejected.

155
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.030
Christina Haro a: Rejected last scared, you know,

156
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.940
Christina Haro a: Yeah, it's a mixed with those

157
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Hurt rejected scared mixed

158
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And then of course those emotions are vulnerable ones, which means

159
00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I protect it with anger. I won't let people know that's how I'm feeling because they might continue it. I'll show up angry and protect so i don't i don't touch show those pieces.

160
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's very common. But notice how this little example I did with your son.

161
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that you're an adult and those those memories and slowly over the work that we're doing those memories in the past will stay in the past and they won't be relived in the present.

162
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But the kind of connection because I know you want the kind of friendship right with your adult children you want that intimacy that closeness with your, with your children that you didn't have with your own parent. I know I've heard you say how much you want that.

163
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And being able to say the under those underlying feelings. I'm feeling, believe it or not, I feel kind of rejected, I feel kind of abandoned I feel her

164
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You're knowing that it's okay to sit with those uncomfortable emotions is a healing process for you and it's going to bring a more genuine

165
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Intimate relationship with your children to. I know it doesn't seem like it would seems like, Oh, I should just be able to say I'm angry and that should bring us closer

166
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. It's better than showing anger and and calling them names right it's better, but being able to really identify identify the underlying the core emotion of I'm scared.

167
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to bring closeness and healing to you. Believe it or not,

168
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you're doing great. You worked hard for that one. Oh boy.

169
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um,

170
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't have anybody listed in here, and we've talked about friendships, you've had to really sort of these negative people have fallen away in your life and you're in a space right now where

171
00:22:54.570 --> 00:23:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if I trust people, these people are kind of still tripping. There's still a life and they're, they're not quite seeing that you're working on healing and there's still sort of throwing you know

172
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Connect opportunities in your face and that doesn't feel very supportive and I get that.

173
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If you still want to check them on the landscape of people that you can call or text. Is there anyone that let's say you were starting to consider using

174
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It was starting to slip in

175
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Or doctor shop. I'm going to go to another doctor

176
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:34.800
Okay.

177
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm going to take more buprenorphine.

178
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: When those thoughts start to come if they do, and you just want to reach out and have a connection with someone who can you reach out to. Is there anyone in your landscape that you can give a call to

179
00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:57.540
Christina Haro a: No.

180
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really, okay.

181
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:13.920
Christina Haro a: The only one I talked to, like, like, stuff like that. And we, you know, actually talked really good as my older son because me and him with a talk about anything and I taught him a lot of things that don't tell other people

182
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's fun and Martin.

183
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.570
Christina Haro a: Know my older son Martin.

184
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.300
Okay.

185
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do it, but do you

186
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:41.070
Christina Haro a: Yeah I do, actually. And you know there's there's things I told him about my you know there's things I told him about my addiction and and you know he tells me you know a man. He says, I'm never going to give you. He says, you know, and I and I'm proud of you. He tells me

187
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:51.060
Christina Haro a: And we and we do we talk we talk about stuff you know and and I'm able to tell him things and he you know he never he doesn't judge me.

188
00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, and for full we added a couple things there. That's excellent. I put Martin's name in there.

189
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And we also have

190
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Increased with no tolerance for semantic emotional coloring the integration. Okay so grounding in a boat.

191
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Is by grounding of concurrent experience rather than dissociated from the body. So I have a question for you.

192
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.800
Christina Haro a: Go where

193
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do your such sport.

194
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Has anyone ever talked with you about

195
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Your. Let me see you start typing and look at you.

196
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're talking with someone. Has anyone ever mentioned. Oh, hey. Christine I noticed that you're closing your eyes are they dry. Is there anything going on. Has anyone ever said, Hey, hey, your eyes closed.

197
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.740
Christina Haro a: No, no.

198
00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:04.410
Christina Haro a: So notice

199
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:17.550
Christina Haro a: No, no, I just I just brought back something my ex once told me because me. How come you're always walk behind me and you always look down and don't look at me.

200
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:26.190
Christina Haro a: Okay. And I don't know if that's the same thing as what I do when I close my eyes, maybe I don't like to

201
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.440
Christina Haro a: I don't know, maybe it's a way of shielding myself you know from a lot of stuff. I don't know. Okay.

202
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to know we don't have to. I just wanted to check in, because that's it's been present throughout its right now. Everybody has their own style. I have my own aspects. These funky little things that I do to everybody has them.

203
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you. I had wondered what was going on with that if anyone had said anything. And what just came up for you was

204
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You used to kind of

205
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe protect yourself and stay behind him, so that it was a lot less threatening if you were in front of him. Then something might happen.

206
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:15.330
Christina Haro a: And even though he was a nice person like Toby was a nice person, you know, wasn't mean or anything, but that was the way I

207
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:28.680
Christina Haro a: I've always been. I don't know. Maybe I've been like that since I was younger, I really never know this. I don't look you know look at people directly, or maybe I do close my eyes, I don't know, but

208
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.900
Christina Haro a: I remember that that came into my mind.

209
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.950
Christina Haro a: When you said that up.

210
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, now remember, I'm not right in front of you so it could very well be that your eyes aren't closed and maybe they're looking down. I don't know.

211
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It was an interesting kind of cool feature about this program is that these recordings. These are recorded and they used to hold on to them for a whole year. They don't anymore. They only hold on to them for a month and then they disappear.

212
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I have in the past when people are not aware of maybe something that they're saying all the time or something's going on.

213
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What we do, and it's a neat thing was we look at it together. Now I get. I'm like, Oh, I hate hearing my own voice. And I'm like, ah, because I'm such a goofball, but I'm you and I could look

214
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: For a second, so that you could see what I see. And then you can formulate your own opinion.

215
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that something down the line. Maybe you'd be curious about

216
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, sweet. So that's something for us to play with and that

217
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: They're always recorded so we can we can take a peek at them.

218
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Excellent. But there's a suspicion and typically people are on to something. You know what I mean, because notice what happened when I brought it up, you had this like your hand went up like this, it might be a shield. It might be a way for me to

219
00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't like to look at me like there might be something going on where you're shielding. Maybe someone not being able to see you fully or make a I don't know shielding from something. I don't know. We'll find out.

220
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me get back in the notes here.

221
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how are you feeling right now as I brought that topic up. Let me just check in.

222
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.360
Christina Haro a: I believe it just made me think about it made me think about that, you know,

223
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

224
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, got some time to maybe do a little

225
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see how far we get in your room feels happy mommy's or friends. Yes, we all go through that one.

226
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.400
And happy increasing your times

227
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.770
Change this

228
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.860
Or two

229
00:29:48.090 --> 00:30:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: For two um you know you mentioned something and group, you want to follow up with that a little bit. You said I want everybody in the same room and I want to talk to him.

230
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to talk to him about

231
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:21.840
Christina Haro a: Not necessarily about mean I like to get everybody together and talk about, you know, the dramatic stuff that's gone in and are you know gonna you know happened in our house because I haven't really had any everybody together because like when

232
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:34.110
Christina Haro a: One was here. The other one had left and we weren't all together. So I would like to get all my children together and just have a real talk, you know,

233
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.130
Christina Haro a: Okay, well,

234
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.740
Christina Haro a: Now, I mean, what thing, you know.

235
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. The goal would be, they will tell me what

236
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.740
Christina Haro a: How they feel

237
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.950
Christina Haro a: About what about know everything that's happened.

238
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.830
Christina Haro a: You know the drama that's happened in her house.

239
00:30:51.030 --> 00:31:01.920
Christina Haro a: Because I know they all talk to each other, one by one, and maybe I talked to each one of them one by one, but I can't talk to all of them to get there.

240
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you share one of the drama events.

241
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:14.010
Christina Haro a: I'm just, you know, everything that happened like the last time I got it was here and she blew up and everybody was involved, you know, but

242
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:24.660
Christina Haro a: It just got so ugly, so you know her shouting at all of us and then shouting at me and then

243
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.360
Christina Haro a: It's like

244
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.160
Christina Haro a: It was like everybody was angry at each other because

245
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:48.870
Christina Haro a: You know, it's like everybody took the site. So I would like everybody to just get together and we could just get this all out, you know, of how they felt because I just get the sense that when that happened,

246
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:56.190
Christina Haro a: Everybody just kind of pulled away and we don't talk about it, or you know, everybody.

247
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:09.660
Christina Haro a: Team to build a different emotion at that time when all that happened with my daughter everybody like one was angry at the other one for taking the side mom was angry at me. It was just

248
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, notice how for example.

249
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: In here, I asked you to go underneath the anger. What is it, what is it about your children that makes you think that they know the emotions that are going on underneath their anger.

250
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.360
Christina Haro a: I don't know. I

251
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.250
Christina Haro a: Don't I don't really know if I'm

252
00:32:42.930 --> 00:33:02.760
Christina Haro a: How they really feel. I don't know what they're really, really feeling. Oh, I know that when I tried to talk to each one of them. It's like they just don't really want to tell me exactly how they feel they don't want to make me upset or they don't want to even bring up the topic.

253
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.780
Christina Haro a: So I was hoping you know maybe but got them all together, we could we could all just talk about it.

254
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So they don't want to upset you.

255
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.470
And so, exactly.

256
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But if everybody's together.

257
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: They might be doing the same thing. Well, now I don't want to upset mom because there's three or four of us coming out at the same time. Why do you think this would be a successful approach.

258
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.260
Christina Haro a: I wouldn't know if it would be

259
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:49.080
Christina Haro a: I just hoping that if I got them all together. We could just get it out and they could, you know, feel better let out their emotional let out whatever they feel and maybe just clear the air that's what I'm hoping for.

260
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.220
Christina Haro a: Cleared the air and they can all feel a little more comfortable with each other.

261
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

262
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.340
Christina Haro a: I know, I know.

263
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know I'm checking

264
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.150
Christina Haro a: To see, oh, I don't, I don't even know when I don't need to know

265
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.080
Christina Haro a: But that's what

266
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That. Oh, I hear you, I hear you. No, no, no, you're going to, you're going to do your thing. The reason why I keep focusing on it is I'm trying to understand maybe how

267
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Our work together, could be useful to that end. And, you know, you're my client. So I want to be sort of at all times, making sure that we're protecting your recovery that we're not creating this this potential relapse moment where there's drama.

268
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.360
Christina Haro a: So I'm looking

269
00:34:42.480 --> 00:35:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: At it and trying to say what new skills do you have or what new skills do they have that you believe that it wouldn't go sideways and be exactly what happened before, because if no one has anything new to bring to the room. Why wouldn't it just happen exactly the way it did before.

270
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:16.710
Christina Haro a: Exactly. Yeah. And I don't think I would be able to do that now say now, let's say, oh, tomorrow I'm going to bring them up together. And no, I don't think it would happen. No, definitely not. Yeah.

271
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: CC now me I'm a writer. I'm a systems person and systems trained person in marriage and family therapy. I love a group

272
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. I love it. I love the dynamics. The way people talk and a little faces. They make and they try their little communication tricks passive aggression or mind reading or

273
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know they puff up big or they try to be the rescuer they tried to be the persecutor I love watching all of that, I find it all very fascinating and interesting but I don't get activated.

274
00:35:50.940 --> 00:36:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: because love is not on the line for me. I can step back from it. I can have a comp heart rate. I mean, I still get excited and like, oh, whoo. That was intense. You know, but I can hold on to myself because

275
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not gonna get my feelings hurt. They'll come probably come after Me too. And sometimes they do.

276
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But you might get hurt. And typically what you do Member your baggage. When you get hurt. You don't say.

277
00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, Clara one

278
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel hurt when you you just dismiss something I said it's not your style. In the past, say that

279
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be to show as what most of your family members use they show anger show anger. Anger. Anger and that's all anybody has in the room who's going to outwit

280
00:36:52.050 --> 00:37:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's going to make a better counterpoint. And so it's just counterpoint after counterpoint and watch what you did. Who citing was who to then have counterpoints and have this argument.

281
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody's feeling any better.

282
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if you're the matriarch right if you're the one that's going to represent someone who can hold on to herself, not make it about her and really almost like a therapist. Think about that right in the room who can say, you know, Clara.

283
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Kareena ice. Yeah, I know we were all yelling at each other, but I think underneath. We might have fear.

284
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Of rejection of abandonment, we might have other other feelings underneath. I want to be close to all of you. And as your mother. I feel sad when I think you guys don't have each other as each other's best friends. You know, I don't know what your truth is Christina, but like

285
00:37:53.490 --> 00:38:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another way to go about it, not just let's clear the air because clear the air for some people is this. Oh, I'll tell you exactly what I think. And people just start coming out them.

286
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Again. Oh, the air. Clear All right. Oh, it's going to be clear and then one pop up on my way. We're in an argument. Again, it takes a different approach. And so, Christina. It was really neat that you said you may not quite want to do it right away.

287
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When you actually can do it internally inside your own self. In other words, ooh, I'm feeling hurt right now.

288
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone just said something or they weren't even nearby. They were on the phone, or as a text and I regulated myself and I shifted my negative thinking

289
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I took a moment and reflected what's really going on for me. What do I really need. What do I really want when you're able to get in the habit of doing it internally, you're going to be the role model for teaching right and how to do it for your family.

290
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.080
Christina Haro a: Yeah, okay.

291
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

292
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.190
Let's see, trying to see where where to start here.

293
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we got for time a little bit of time, let's use it just to review.

294
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I am hoping that you'll not only remember the belly breathing, but also have you know a lot of people forget this one, remember I was teaching you grounding and the five senses. If you get really activated.

295
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people keep little things in their pocket.

296
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can put your finger on it and just feel it when you start to get really angry or irritated. You can just sort of hold it.

297
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And get back into your body and feel grounded. See if you can keep playing with those throughout the week. What am I hearing right now I'm hearing cars go by. I'm hearing a bird. I hear my

298
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, whether it's a heater. Oh, I can hear.

299
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Her another car. Hey, I can hear one of your voice. I can hear some static i here. So we go to our five senses. That's grounding in the five senses.

300
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: as many things as you can hear, as many things as you can well adjectives have one object. It's better if you just pick one object. So you grab one object to look at. I'm looking at this little icon on my computer black curved brown

301
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Straight, you know, you'd pull in as much data from that sense everything you hear everything if you pick one object you feel it describing the different texture. What do I smell smells a really strong one. A lot of people have a strong reaction to that one.

302
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And then taste. You know, usually get too much other than some people do.

303
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It will bring that heart rate down to

304
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And get your back in your body when you're feeling so angry.

305
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all there is.

306
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.220
Christina Haro a: Most people do.

307
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's called emotional reasoning will I'm angry. So I'm justified and what I'm about to do.

308
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like, We'll wait, there's this we can access other parts of our brain for this to not just this one amygdala reaction. So see if you can try to remember also and practice the grounding in the five senses.

309
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, excellent. It'll be really handy because when things like that are going on in our family, you're going to get activated, because you've been doing it that way for a long time.

310
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But the key is to use these other skills. We say, Okay, what do I do

311
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Or Let's all just

312
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a nice big belly breath. Oh, yeah. And you remember something else. Right. And that's when the frontal lobe comes online oftentimes it's completely offline when we're that upset.

313
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, Christina.

314
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: If you wanted to work on something for just a little bit longer today, what would it be, what was the so we could sort of spend a little bit of time on kind of working through what would that be

315
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.170
Christina Haro a: I don't know.

316
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.040
Yeah.

317
00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we take the, the one you mentioned, which is a pretty common one for you. It has to do with rejection

318
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And it could be mixed in with mistrust. It could be the hurt. It could be

319
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. What will this person do

320
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now as I as I talked about rejection or mistrust and things like that. Do you immediately go to childhood. Do you go to your ex husband, what are, what are, what are you, where does your mind go with that.

321
00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.040
Christina Haro a: My to the childhood childhood.

322
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, and I'm assuming mom yelling and and sort of taking it out on you. And, yeah, yeah. Okay.

323
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a particular image that comes to mind.

324
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.600
Christina Haro a: No. No, really.

325
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:35.700
Christina Haro a: It's a mix of, you know, things that I, you know, remember just, I guess the mix of stuff that I remember you know different times. Okay, going up. Yeah.

326
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember we've explored. At age 12 and 13

327
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm unwanted why why why

328
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Why me, I think.

329
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I favor noticing.

330
00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom favoring Nina right there must be or the might be something I can't remember if you identified why you think your mother did you look like someone

331
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: THAT WAS IT LOOKED LIKE HER FOR FATHER or husband, or would you know with the reasoning was do you have. Do you know why she treated you differently.

332
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:26.700
Christina Haro a: I don't know. I know my, my sister, though we didn't mention those two years older than me that my, my favorite

333
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:37.200
Christina Haro a: She resembles my mom a lot. She's a lot like my mom looks like my mom mom always told me that I look like my dad. That's when she couldn't stand me

334
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go, that's probably right. So you do kind of have a story that you've come up with. I look like my father and and she had what kind of relationship with him.

335
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:59.310
Christina Haro a: They had a great relationship. That's the thing I don't understand, you know, they got along great that that old fashioned marriage, you know, there would be

336
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:03.060
Christina Haro a: They'd be reality to their other or any of that.

337
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:12.090
Christina Haro a: So I never quite understood why you know you would tell me that

338
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

339
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's this mother that has all this this way of behaving. Did your dad ever see the way she treated

340
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.370
Christina Haro a: I you

341
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.450
Christina Haro a: Get your dad see

342
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.140
Oh, yeah.

343
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:42.600
Christina Haro a: Oh yeah, and we would tell her all the time. You know, when he would, he would catch her hitting me slapping me around, he would tell her you know you're crazy easy to do good and up until one day how you treat her

344
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:53.130
Christina Haro a: So I don't know. You know, I really don't know. You know, my mom, my dad had a good relationship.

345
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:01.950
Christina Haro a: I only thing I know and that dynamic so okay let me tell you my, my dad was a big that was a drinker.

346
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:13.680
Christina Haro a: He came from a big family. Don't like 30 brothers and sisters, but they all that family were drinker. They're all alcoholics, you know, and

347
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:25.410
Christina Haro a: My mom grew up with just her dad and my grandpa was an alcoholic and for my dad's my mom's father was an alcoholic.

348
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:33.390
Christina Haro a: So she's, she's a Dallas cheese, we already knew. You know how bad of an alcoholic. My grandpa was

349
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:42.930
Christina Haro a: And I guess she had at that time when her mom died. You know, when she was fairly young so there was only three sisters and to tell us how that they had

350
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:53.400
Christina Haro a: With their with their dad, you know, he never missed you did an awesome never about so they pretty much based themselves. The girls and then

351
00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:05.160
Christina Haro a: My dad was an alcoholic. Well, not really because my dad worked all weekend, get a drink you with more of a drinker on weekends, but it was weird because

352
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:17.820
Christina Haro a: It got along great. Yet she was always angry is family, you know, she was angry at them and she would tell me all the time.

353
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:23.130
Christina Haro a: That I look so much like my dad's family that maybe that's where I should go. We had a

354
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:34.140
Christina Haro a: I had an uncle that live because be right across the street from us, you know, bam, you open the door, you saw them. That was my dad's brother and my mom used to tell me you should go live across the street.

355
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:40.590
Christina Haro a: You tell me that I didn't belong there that I should go live across the street.

356
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, Tina.

357
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how much

358
00:47:53.250 --> 00:48:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you in touch with how that feels baby that's that's incredibly painful to even here.

359
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

360
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, man.

361
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I wish your mom hadn't said that it's not the truth. I don't, I don't know. I don't know what her truth inside was I don't don't get it.

362
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think you're onto

363
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Something, there's something about the way you looked

364
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: A bit about how she felt around

365
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And my guess it's it's exactly what you said is from her own childhood. You may resemble her father, you may resemble those things and it's coming up for her and she just didn't do her healing.

366
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And she just took it out on you.

367
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I'm so sorry.

368
00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know how careful you are to not let that happen with your kids. I know you're so careful.

369
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want them to go through it.

370
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:10.950
I know

371
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:14.790
Talk on it.

372
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And he has your mom passed away. She's still alive.

373
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:23.790
Christina Haro a: She passed away, she passed away.

374
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.590
Christina Haro a: Was it five years ago.

375
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and she never acknowledged the deep wounds that she

376
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.590
Christina Haro a: She did. Yeah.

377
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:43.320
Christina Haro a: Yes, you did.

378
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What did she say to you.

379
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.810
Christina Haro a: I took care of a lot. I took care of her. The last

380
00:49:51.570 --> 00:50:04.530
Christina Haro a: I guess about the last four years because she had terminal cancer. She died very young. She was only 74 was you die young. Yes, she did. She told me she was sorry for what he did to me.

381
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that enough. Did it seem like she really understood it, though.

382
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:22.710
Christina Haro a: Yeah, she did. She did we, we actually I brought it with me because

383
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:28.410
Christina Haro a: Nobody wanted to take care of her. So I brought it with me.

384
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That must have been difficult.

385
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I can't even imagine. I really can't even imagine taking care of her after her failure to take care, you

386
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Proof.

387
00:50:55.530 --> 00:51:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So she said she was sorry. But did she tell like stories to you about how she owns

388
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Like hey you know well, okay.

389
00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:07.500
Christina Haro a: She

390
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.320
Christina Haro a: She told me one day she looked at me. She was good at dies, you told me

391
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.850
Christina Haro a: I'm sorry she says I

392
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.120
Christina Haro a: I know I never to do right

393
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice to hear it. It's nice to hear it.

394
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she show you some kindness near the end.

395
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.220
Christina Haro a: Yeah we became best friends. Okay.

396
00:51:51.420 --> 00:52:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And the stories you told me earlier about her family of origin. The alcoholism there and the alcoholism on this side and a lot of alcoholism. Right. And even if it was a big part of your life for a period of time to

397
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:10.830
Christina Haro a: Yeah.

398
00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What else, what's something positive, that you have in common.

399
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:43.980
Christina Haro a: I don't know, we both like to cook. You know, I mean, especially when she moved over here with getting the kitchen and cook together. So, you know, we will enjoy that last few years together.

400
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.590
It was nice.

401
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So Christina, let's have an in vivo experience. Notice how you're probably experiencing some distress right now as these memories are very much on the surface.

402
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's use

403
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's practice that other skill. Let's practice that grounding in the five. Let's do it together.

404
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So, have a nice nourishing inhale and then

405
00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice, nice, easy breath and ICC breath and put your

406
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right hand on something. You got anything over there to your right.

407
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Which got beautiful pen.

408
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's right. And so just take a look at it and I want you to just start describing adjectives, the color, the texture, just as much as you can as quickly as you can. Go for it.

409
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.640
Christina Haro a: It's soft and smooth. It's long.

410
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.660
Christina Haro a: A narrow pointing

411
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:55.950
Christina Haro a: It clicks.

412
00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, you're doing tactile open your eyes and taking data from your eyes.

413
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.200
Christina Haro a: Um, it's black and red.

414
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:11.190
Christina Haro a: Very light.

415
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's tactile, this is what's different about this particular approach. So let me do some clarification.

416
00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now you're you're blending tactile with visual

417
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: This is why it's different.

418
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it is difficult to do that's going to get your mind off of something. If you want to be off of it. So you would do it only data coming through your eyes.

419
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Grace silver round shiny dull lines circles to

420
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Metal whole

421
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Spongy gray clip.

422
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then see how that was all data from my eyes.

423
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Then if you want to you can go to tactile then my eyes are closed and now I'm oh ridges moves to loose twisty

424
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Pointy smooth. There's a whole rubbery squishy cliquey

425
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. Those are tactile tactile means touch and then

426
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So now now now close your eyes and see if you can name as many things that you're here.

427
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:42.630
Christina Haro a: I hear a bird. I hear I hear cars I hear honking I hear

428
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:45.330
Christina Haro a: I hear a bus.

429
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.340
Christina Haro a: I hear the plastic just been

430
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Any refrigerator any kind of

431
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Like low hum sounded I

432
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:56.400
Christina Haro a: Heard the rubric yeah I

433
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:00.240
Christina Haro a: Like the refrigerator. Most older

434
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:01.740
Younger, yeah.

435
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.130
Christina Haro a: That's about it.

436
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:06.780
Uh huh.

437
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about smell. See if you can get in touch with smell. These are hard to get to see if you can find what's going on in there. So it's nice. Inhale.

438
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had to name at least two, what would they be

439
00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.150
Happy

440
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring your

441
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring the fabric of your shirt to your nose.

442
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What you got in there.

443
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.430
Christina Haro a: Smell London. London so

444
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:49.620
Christina Haro a: Okay, Downey

445
00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you're

446
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Check the back of your hand to sometimes they have other smell sitting there with what you got there.

447
00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.750
I'm

448
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.680
Christina Haro a: My lotion. Ooh, very

449
00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.190
Good.

450
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:10.770
Christina Haro a: My hand smell like coffee.

451
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. And now, last one.

452
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Go inside that mouse ears, see what's in their

453
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.540
Christina Haro a: Coffee.

454
00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.770
Christina Haro a: Coffee. Coffee and

455
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:40.320
Christina Haro a: My morning breakfast. No toothpaste.

456
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:42.630
Christina Haro a: Toothpaste. There it is. Yeah.

457
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So Christina. Notice how your body's feeling now.

458
00:57:49.680 --> 00:58:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus when that memory was coming up, you are able to regulate and bring heart rate down probably relieve maybe some tension in the chest. That's why this activity is so useful.

459
00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And doing it exactly the way like with fidelity, meaning we don't mix the sensations, because you were kind of mixing

460
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you had your eyes. Close it.

461
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: By the way,

462
00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. Because you so you went to tactile but with your eyes closed that memory.

463
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That memory might still be

464
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Sharp. So for you, you might want to open your eyes and start just bringing data in adjectives through the eyes silver gray circles shiny dull round.

465
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay in through the eyes so that that memory doesn't sit there where you're shifting the neural network you're focusing on sensations coming from the body, which is a bottom up. I won't get into that.

466
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Approach. I'm going to sell so top down. So you really going to change what your brain is focused on

467
00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, all right, we're at the top of the hour and just tell me a little bit about what you noticed that was important for you today. Christina. What did you notice

468
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.540
Christina Haro a: I think I gotta work on myself.

469
00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:26.490
Christina Haro a: I need to be a little more involved in I'm

470
00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.040
Christina Haro a: What I'm feeling, I guess, yeah. A little more

471
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:42.840
Christina Haro a: Than to kind of look into myself and do a little more spiritual stuff because I know I've lacked on that and that wasn't very important to me. I just did a couple of years ago.

472
00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:53.370
Christina Haro a: I was really, you know, into the spiritual, religious stuff, you know, and I was really important to me. Okay, so I really want to get back into that part of my life.

473
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe the homework if you want to over this coming week is, what would that mean to you.

474
01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I will do a yoga practice. I will come up with a prayer every time I start to get angry. I'll say this prayer or maybe just going to a women's group or

475
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Or reading literature reading the Bible reading the word, there's a certain scripture or singing gospel. I don't know what it is but you homework for you think of a way that really feels like no, no, no. Go ahead of yours ideas her ideas they suck. I got one. I want this.

476
01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I want us to be yours, how you can do it, anybody little thing that feels indeed quite spiritual for you. This will really be evidence

477
01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:39.840
Christina Haro a: Yeah.

478
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in it.

479
01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm starting to look at myself I'm getting more spiritual because you just identified today. I need to look at myself a little bit

480
01:00:48.030 --> 01:01:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And pulling in a little bit more of that spiritual connection but you got to see what that is for you. For some people literally is walking in the mountains. I mean it for everyone. It's very different. You got to find your own that feels deeply loving and personal. Okay.

481
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: ALL RIGHT, MAMA. I will see you in group.

482
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.150
Christina Haro a: Already but

483
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there. Have a good week. Let me just make sure we'll, we'll see each other. Same time next week.

484
01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.400
Christina Haro a: Same time

485
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:21.810
And is there any

486
01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Medication or anything right now giving me to send a message.

487
01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, everything's fine.

488
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see in group.

Gwenevere Abriel: Of what the evenings look like for you.

505
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that you kind of don't have a for some people they can't get their eyes off their phone, right, they're just stuck to it. Other people are like, yeah, I look at it once or twice a day. Um, what, what's it like for you around you.

506
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:56.250
Nick Graham: Well, I took a text sabbatical over the weekend, which is pretty nice, actually, to where I just that thing was gone. And I was up in the mountains and I do like think about a lot of stuff. So, like a lot of like future stuff. And so I did that and but yeah I don't

Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just saying, you know, I would invite you to not take it personally because I'm sure I've got people here during the day.

517
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

518
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.120
Yes.

519
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, you spent some time up in the mountains.

520
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so it's almost a spiritual experience this weekend.

521
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.510
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah, partially like

522
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:50.760
Nick Graham: To think about like

523
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.910
Nick Graham: Like if I offered it to Oregon to work this summer and

524
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:09.300
Nick Graham: I got like my ex is like trying to come back into my life and all these like things are happening right now. So I'm like really thinking about stuff you want to

525
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of unpack a little bit

526
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:18.780
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I mean, like, though the Oregon thing is like, you know, kind of

527
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:33.300
Nick Graham: I guess it offered like running an office up in Eugene, but which would be cool and everything, but it's going to go against my goals of like being able to get in full time school because I can't do both. I can't work in the school with the amount of hours in this job.

528
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.390
Nick Graham: Can I decided not to do that.

529
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that almost says how seriously you want school to happen. Oh boy.

530
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm hearing you just

531
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:53.160
Nick Graham: You just

532
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:54.270
Protected

533
01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That time like you really said, No, I'm not going to take this opportunity in order to protect. I want to go to school. Look at me. Look, what I'm willing to let go of. So I think you must want it pretty badly.

534
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.210
Nick Graham: Yeah, I guess so, yeah, that was cool.

535
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And ok so turned it down. Now, it might be other stuff too. So tell me, Sydney does is a pretty complicated one.

536
01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:24.540
Nick Graham: Yeah, that's a really complicated one.

537
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.200
Nick Graham: Something to the effect of

538
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:42.540
Nick Graham: She regrets things that she did and she wants to try other things. That's basically what your conversation to me was in

539
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.280
Nick Graham: So we're like,

540
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:59.160
Nick Graham: Getting back in touch a little bit. It's been fine like I've been freaked out. You know, I don't do that anymore. I says, Good like I, yeah, I really don't. I mean, maybe I haven't

541
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Had a chance to do it.

542
01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably. Hold on a sec. Well, that's not true. You could have been let me go. Let's just rewind a little bit

543
01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Is and I want to respect you know about psychological boundary for you is there are you deliberately being general and non specific with I regret, if there was an infidelity, or I regret having a called you

544
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: kicking you out or blaming you for this. Or, or, you know, I can't remember all this stuff. If it was

545
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.450
Nick Graham: Yeah party.

546
01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you did have an opportunity to lose your shit. You definitely could have

547
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have

548
01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:43.500
Yeah.

549
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:47.130
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I had it had a chance to

550
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:59.190
Nick Graham: After yeah and I like I didn't hate myself not like getting in that loop is like name calling. And then feeling like shit and then

551
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:05.400
Nick Graham: Stopped. So that was healthier, you know, then it's been okay

552
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, do you remember I want to reinforce what you were doing to make that happen. Sometimes it's unconscious because of the deep work that you've been doing

553
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because those old triggers aren't being relived as if in the moment and she's representative of this old Whoa, and sometimes the healing is just, well now it's just not as intense and we can't label it consciously and we just move on. If there's no

554
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to know why we feel better. Hey, let's just keep feeling better.

555
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.600
Nick Graham: Yeah, seriously.

556
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All about that. So, um, but if you did label it. Do you know, do you remember catching. Oh my gosh. I just know that if I would have heard this before I would have unearthed rage and righteousness and indignation and I would have gone in.

557
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This particular spiral.

558
01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's. Do you remember catching something and saying, Oh, look at this. Look, what I'm doing now I good what I've got. Now,

559
01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:10.170
Nick Graham: You know what, like not know like not really like there been other times that I've been doing that, like,

560
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.080
Nick Graham: Like the belly breathing, like, with emphasis on the belly and I was in that a few times in like

561
01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:35.190
Nick Graham: describing things like I saw, I saw actually sold on the TV show or something like that, like, great. Better Call Saul, you know, the breaking bad kind of show like this guy is like freaking out. And he was like, he's like, look at things and be like black smooth glossy like describing things

562
01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: In the five senses. That's a great technique.

563
01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:45.270
Nick Graham: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. We did do that just not in that we did the breathing the taste the

564
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.690
Nick Graham: Taste, smell that all that stuff. Yeah.

565
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.100
Nick Graham: I like

566
01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:55.170
Nick Graham: Do that a little bit. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I forgot about that one.

567
01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, at the end of the game. I'm happy to. I'm happy. If you guys think it was all your idea.

568
01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:10.380
Nick Graham: Some actor had more impact than you.

569
01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:16.860
Nick Graham: Did that hey, and now

570
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: She says, so there's she says I regret, you notice yourself.

571
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there was some belly breathing, there's some sort of using some of the

572
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Grounding exercise emotional regulation and then there is something, she said, which has to do with the future. She wants to what, what did she say

573
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:51.420
Nick Graham: She said something to the effect of, I want to work things out kind of thing. And what does that. What does that mean to you, um, good question. I think it means

574
01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:58.620
Nick Graham: I Don't Think things will ever be able to be the same as like before, you know, like, because a lot has changed.

575
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.650
Nick Graham: SHE'S CHANGED I've changed so

576
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:03.930
Nick Graham: I think it means

577
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:13.470
Nick Graham: That she wants to spend time and try to make it like try to

578
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.380
Nick Graham: Maybe like

579
01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:21.450
Nick Graham: reclaim the relationship that we had before. I don't really know.

580
01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then that's the place. Do you want to talk about that a little bit, because I'm excited. Right. I'm a marriage and family therapist. So you start talking about relationships. And I'm like,

581
01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we

582
01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Talked about that.

583
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:40.500
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, I think, like, you probably have more valuable insight, you know, like so, I'd be fine with talking about that.

584
01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So what interests me.

585
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you want on this hike.

586
01:10:50.370 --> 01:11:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: By eliminate by saying no to an opportunity and Eugene, you're basically opening up this wide open space for yes for school did you also basically open up a yes to Sydney

587
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:10.770
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah, totally. So that was the thing that actually talked with my like my district grow the person who offered me a job. I said, like

588
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:22.170
Nick Graham: I have a fulfilling marriage that I now have another shot to like try to correct. And I said, like, I don't think it would be

589
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.950
Nick Graham: Like, I need to do like probably everything I can to

590
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.550
Nick Graham: To like save it, you know, to try with what would like what while still not like

591
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:37.500
Nick Graham: Killing myself you know over it kind of thing. You know, so

592
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.330
Nick Graham: I like I vows to

593
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.310
Nick Graham: do my best to promote them. Yeah. Okay.

594
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back.

595
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: She didn't keep hers in some way. That's her

596
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't say I'll marry you if you keep your vows.

597
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll keep mine if you keep yours. You didn't do it that way. You said, and that's where faith comes in. It's i'm going to

598
01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Commit to this. These are the things. And this is what I'm going to do. Yeah, there is no way to exactly constructs and marriage that you had before. And maybe you don't want to. So you're you're growing. Now you've been getting health. You've been getting professional help from LA.

599
01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You're working on and

600
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what she's been doing, but she's been adding, you know, some drugs to her system that are helping me. And so let's just talk about you when you went on that hike. Now I heard you say, right, I'm going to stay put. Here I wanna

601
01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to stay married, I want to keep my vows. I'm going to keep putting energy into this marriage. Yeah.

602
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.990
Nick Graham: Which is also a complicated thing because

603
01:12:56.610 --> 01:13:04.620
Nick Graham: She basically believes that we got married too fast. And I also do we got married after like a few months because that's how you doing, you're in the military. So

604
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.560
Nick Graham: Yeah. And so her thing is like

605
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.600
Nick Graham: She wants to essentially start out from like

606
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:16.560
Nick Graham: Scratch really which

607
01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:20.430
Nick Graham: I don't think is a horrible idea but

608
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:29.970
Nick Graham: She's like, I don't want to be made as, like, but you are like illegally, you know, like, legally, you are. And so I think she has some fear of

609
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:37.560
Nick Graham: Marriage or some fear of like being the illusion of that. So I don't know, it's difficult to work through that.

610
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.090
Nick Graham: Okay.

611
01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's, that's her stuff, but I'm going to

612
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:42.450
Nick Graham: Show you.

613
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You want. So notice how right you

614
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just say you depart from she's not clear. Okay, then I get all this for now.

615
01:13:54.780 --> 01:14:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting clear about what you want. Let's say it's not contingent on her behavior. Let's just say I want it. If it is true, I want to keep. I want to keep my mouse. And what I want. Do you know what you want.

616
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: more now than you did before.

617
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:15.420
Nick Graham: Um,

618
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:19.650
Nick Graham: Well, I want to

619
01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:25.140
Nick Graham: I guess like be more present. Okay. Okay.

620
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's the only you know what that is. Um, let's get some specifics, I want to be more present with what

621
01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:41.280
Nick Graham: Well, I think that there were a lot of times when I was using like using drugs like during

622
01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.580
Nick Graham: Our last one and

623
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:52.800
Nick Graham: Then afterwards was a lot of fallout from that and has like heavy doses of Suboxone which kind of, you know, don't

624
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.950
Nick Graham: Have one like think super clearly

625
01:14:57.810 --> 01:14:59.130
Nick Graham: So, something like that.

626
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

627
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how that kind of manifests and other words

628
01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We try this one.

629
01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be more honest assertive and forthright with how I'm feeling in the moment.

630
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to

631
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: speak my mind in the moment when I see something that I don't like where once, maybe I would stuff it down.

632
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would ignore it. But now I would like to be present with my preferences with my needs with my wants. It's still her choice, of course, people can say no.

633
01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But being present means I feel what's happening to me right now and I name it. I now I'm working with the therapist. I now have some more words, I'm not

634
01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not kind of lost in the shame, which completely, you don't get to pay attention to anything, we're just miserable.

635
01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. And, or we're acting out because we don't want to feel it. So you're getting better and better and better at it slowly but surely

636
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And being present with your own feelings, you're naming them. And then if you want to know it gets in her personal now Sydney. You may notice that I'm saying things like, I feel angry when you don't respond to my text for three days in a row.

637
01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And that might be a new way of communicating. So some things might come up. Now when it gets in her personal with

638
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to improve communication. I want clear direct communication. I want to be doing things that you and I never grew up doing. So this marriage, we can see if we have compatibility. Let's see if I'm, if we like each other. And if we're compatible.

639
01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:55.110
Nick Graham: Yeah.

640
01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:58.560
Nick Graham: It's kind of kind of work that and um

641
01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.180
Nick Graham: Yeah.

642
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what just happened, but

643
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:11.370
Nick Graham: No, I just had a thought. And then I completely forgot what it was, it wasn't a bad. It was like

644
01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:17.610
Nick Graham: I just completely forgot is insane. But yeah, I think, I think that sounds. Well, I use that actually

645
01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:20.100
Nick Graham: When we were like,

646
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.600
Nick Graham: Kind of in a bickering match. And then I like

647
01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:32.670
Nick Graham: sent an email with like, and it's like, like with how I feel, basically like instead of like

648
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:45.480
Nick Graham: Which I think one can be like red and not sometimes like the messenger. Like if you're in a conversation. Sometimes if you're mad at that person, you're not going to listen to anything they say. No matter what because you're mad at them.

649
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.830
Nick Graham: I like

650
01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:51.720
Nick Graham: I like sending email with like feelings to that, like how I feel about a specific thing.

651
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.280
Nick Graham: And I was effectively.

652
01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.660
Nick Graham: Like actually saying like

653
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.670
Nick Graham: No judgments. No, you know, because I find myself like

654
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:06.060
Nick Graham: Not only saying how I feel. But saying how I feel like they are now.

655
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the trouble.

656
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.780
Nick Graham: And it was a big trouble. During our image to is I would like

657
01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.770
Nick Graham: You do like not not only accusations, but

658
01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:25.830
Nick Graham: weird stuff. Like, I would just like to say this is how you are like oh really, is it how I am like, you know, that

659
01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you know, and you so this showed up before when

660
01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it was with a

661
01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Friend girl right it was that oh you you're doing this. You did this cycle analysis on mode on her instead of owning

662
01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, a lot right very different approach.

663
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.720
Nick Graham: Really different

664
01:18:52.590 --> 01:19:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to tell you, you are more than welcome. And I think I've mentioned this before, but now that she's got a little buy in. If you guys decide.

665
01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To I wouldn't be your forever couples therapist, I'll always be your therapist, which means I'm pretty good at it, you probably wouldn't even see a bias, but I know deep down inside. I'm going to be biased towards you, no matter what, it's just

666
01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: A fair assessment, but most people can't see it because I'm really good at being objective.

667
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you guys decide to start this way to say, you know what, Sydney let's at least see what happens if you and I both go meet with when a beer and we learn the I feel statement we learn mirroring. These are just skills. You guys can talk about

668
01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether a blue as a better car for a minivan I doesn't matter content, you can still learn it without doing the, oh my gosh, I can't believe you cheated on me. You don't have to do go to content. You could light fluffy, you can still learn the skills.

669
01:19:53.190 --> 01:20:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel mirroring and Pathak validation, you have these things. You guys can talk, you can navigate the waters. The

670
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: 50 feet waves. Okay then, you know, because then a therapist is really in the room, and it's embodied in those linguistic structures, because if you have fidelity with them, you're going to be able to say

671
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, you use like instead of I feel. And if you guys have buy in and you say as hokey as it seems.

672
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And as contrived as it seems as boxed in as it seems, we're not paying all this shit ton of money to a therapist. If we follow this structure. I think we'll be able to get through these really difficult things. We got to talk about until we find one.

673
01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And more than that, if you want to meet with me. I know finances are an issue, but I am meeting with people in here and it's working. I just have one person.

674
01:20:53.010 --> 01:20:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In the room and they're sitting here, or they're logged in on another zoom

675
01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. Yeah. And they just sit here. We all login together and then we talk. So I'm open. I'm very flexible. But that's what happens. It's a skill building. I'm not your couples therapist, it ends.

676
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then let's say she has a bias about like, I'm not crazy. I don't want to blame in me, she gets to find out a real time that you can listen to her.

677
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And she can feel safe. So then later on when you let's say you talk with you say, well, let's go find one that's in real person like brick and mortar type deal

678
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, my. Hey, I got this one. Let's go check this person out, you have a frame of reference. You have all, do you, do you have this sense of feeling supported, kind of like you did with when a bear.

679
01:21:43.710 --> 01:22:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I do. Well, let's keep working with her and then you and I can come back to here. But either way, these skills. They're good for everybody. I'm paying they work magic, they work at work. They work with their family. They work with her with our spouses or children.

680
01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: They just work. Okay, so I'm throwing out there. You decide. All you have to do is text me and say let's set up a time she's game. I don't even need another release because you would be introducing her into it.

681
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:15.030
Nick Graham: Right, this is your and

682
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the other thing I'm not going to go oh yeah and Nick thinks this than that, it's, it's just still want me disclosing because this stuff is still very, very privileged to to our work together.

683
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.840
So you give it some thought.

684
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.580
Nick Graham: For sure. Yeah.

685
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And

686
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I imagine that's on your mind a lot what to do.

687
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.930
Nick Graham: Yeah.

688
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:43.740
Nick Graham: Because it's a big thing to be changed in a big

689
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:46.770
Nick Graham: Crazy situation.

690
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, let me do desert devil's advocate. Yeah. What is there to think about just go back to where you're married, like what's the opposite of that. Like what, what are you thinking about

691
01:22:58.650 --> 01:22:59.010
Nick Graham: I'm

692
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.960
Nick Graham: Kind of

693
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:12.150
Nick Graham: Well the main thing that is hard for me is like when she had like left to do what she was doing like partying and stuff. Well, she's like

694
01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:19.800
Nick Graham: Still like obviously going to be those their friends and she said, We hanging out with that group of friends like I can't get past

695
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:30.960
Nick Graham: The thought that, like, oh yeah. Like, that's probably the friend of shoes with and she did that thing that was not good for our marriage or, you know, and so, like, for me, it's been like

696
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:33.960
Nick Graham: A battle, like, oh, wait.

697
01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:43.350
Nick Graham: Am I, how do I not feel or be controlling when I'm going through, like, and I said, My feelings about it. But still, like,

698
01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What are they label. What was, what do we label those feelings, what is

699
01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.790
Nick Graham: Probably label those feelings like

700
01:23:54.450 --> 01:23:55.320
Nick Graham: I almost like

701
01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.500
Nick Graham: Believe that my

702
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:09.540
Nick Graham: My perception of like what she did was like all because of her friends like you know obviously individuals make decisions and so

703
01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.890
Nick Graham: I just like believe that her friends are

704
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.380
Nick Graham: bad influences and

705
01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:19.590
Nick Graham: Do too many drugs and

706
01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.740
Nick Graham: Okay, so I look. Yeah.

707
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not labeling the feeling good. That's a great explanation. You're a beautiful story and how does it make you feel right now.

708
01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.940
Nick Graham: Is sinking feeling nervous.

709
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:37.440
Nick Graham: It makes you feel uncertain for like the

710
01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.320
Nick Graham: The features like feasibility of that.

711
01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:45.360
Nick Graham: It's a steal.

712
01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:59.100
Nick Graham: It's like a like a touch of like resentment, anger, as well, like for these people who have never, I don't know what they, they probably never done anything wrong.

713
01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:02.850
Nick Graham: Okay.

714
01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: If she were here today. I'd be saying

715
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell her how you feel when she does lesson such and it might sound like I feel nervous and afraid when you're still hanging out with Tim Ed, Sarah.

716
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And it would just get that far. And she would have to hear you and then you would carry on and then you would continue and say probably all

717
01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You were seduced by their ideas of what fun is and maybe it'll happen again and I'm gonna

718
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it going to have my hopes.

719
01:25:52.530 --> 01:26:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That will have some development of stability stability pulled out from under me right, it would be it maybe

720
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if that's what we're getting to hear

721
01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.820
Nick Graham: Yeah, like basically what I said was, like, similarly to that. And I was like,

722
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.670
Nick Graham: I said like, it's like right now like we need a lot of work and

723
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:27.540
Nick Graham: It said it's probably unrealistic to think that like you can maintain a lifestyle of going out four or five days a week.

724
01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:42.570
Nick Graham: Like still be together in is what I told her, like me, I don't know. That was how I felt like I feel like if she hangs out like she does all the time. It won't work. And she hasn't been

725
01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.650
Nick Graham: So I think maybe you gotta cross on

726
01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What you and I don't know. And she may not know

727
01:26:55.710 --> 01:27:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: On the outside, it's I have this mist life is party now. Um, but why is it needed like we don't have to have that that

728
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what 20 year olds kind of tend to do. But that's what's the underlying need here what's you know, is she getting underlying psychological unmet needs you know from childhood. Also is she addressing them um

729
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.410
Yeah.

730
01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:24.570
Nick Graham: Not adjusting them.

731
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:29.070
Nick Graham: Well, she's addressing them through what she's doing. And she's kind of expressed that that

732
01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:30.900
Nick Graham: That, um,

733
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:44.970
Nick Graham: She's like developmentally behind as well because you know when you get married at 21 you kind of miss those years in terms of like the social structure. So I kind of told her like

734
01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:47.700
Nick Graham: Says she was saying kind of sounded like

735
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:53.250
Nick Graham: She's 24 it sounded like a like a 20 year old, you know, like a college student being

736
01:27:54.060 --> 01:28:02.010
Nick Graham: Saying, some stuff about going out of here for for 20 and like is just like some college like like middle cut like younger college kid stuff in.

737
01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:15.600
Nick Graham: And I told her, like, I feel like you sound like pretty young. And she's like, Well, we haven't. Probably the behind like I'm like sending it she feels like she missed a lodge developmentally behind. I don't know what to do with it. I

738
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to picture before there was clubbing okay we humans, culturally, if not at clubs, you know,

739
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a developmental milestone individuation

740
01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but what is right is individuation. And so, in the context of maybe I'm hypothesizing here. I don't know if because if there was really and truly on your part control.

741
01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what she's actually explaining is

742
01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This individuation part may have been missing. So if let's say she was in a home where she didn't get to

743
01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, feel her own if she didn't get to see herself. Oh, I can be trustworthy. Look, I'm going to make good choices at midnight.

744
01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: At one o'clock. I'm going to make good choices. Oh, I'm going to solve my own problems. Look at my family incrementally giving me more and more trust that's a missed growth.

745
01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Point that can be redone that can be redone that can be done. Now, that's fine, but that can be done in a monogamous relationship to, I don't know where you guys recapitulate to your family of origin stuff that I'm out, I'm out of the loop on a lot of that.

746
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.300
Nick Graham: Yeah.

747
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But to say I gotta do my clubbing because that's just saying I gotta do know it's meeting a need

748
01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it attention is it right. Is it freedom. And so when she's with you, there's this sort of she feels this stuff that she didn't get to sort of resolve developmentally with her family, but that can be done without having to go out and party.

749
01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's what really a good marriage THERAPIST WILL ADDRESS. She'll be he or she would address those pieces so that each of you can fully individually and then sort of look at each other and say, Okay, I'm a full person here I choose you.

750
01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Like choose you. Right. I like you. Let's Let's Let's Let's go play, let's work this out. Let's go have some fun. Let's live our life together let's plan. Let's do but there's something going on between you two that I'm blind to but I'm

751
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That the notion of that there's a developmental piece missing. I don't think it's really about the

752
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:40.620
Nick Graham: Money.

753
01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a solution to an unmet need to a problem. And I'd be curious to know what what that problem really is.

754
01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:56.040
Nick Graham: Yeah, she was a Navy wife and she like photo my underwear. She was like, I was a housewife and that's like that stigma of being a housewife.

755
01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:04.980
Nick Graham: Even though she worked and still have a social licence worked and did whatever she wasn't, but I think there's a stigma of being a housewife. It's probably been reinforced socially by

756
01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:15.150
Nick Graham: A lot of people like like when guys would like who would normally flirt with her with tell her she's married, it would like make her feel like, I don't know, some kind of

757
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:18.810
Nick Graham: Finding or something like that.

758
01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah i don't i don't know either. But your lives are so different now. You're not in there, you're, you're

759
01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking bikes, you've got a puppy.

760
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.020
Nick Graham: I know

761
01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:28.650
You're in

762
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, does she see you now. Does she seemed does she go. Haha. You seem a little different, does she see it acknowledge it. Are you noticing a different response from her.

763
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:45.120
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay.

764
01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's got to be reassuring and and and validating that she is noticeable to someone

765
01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.760
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean, if nothing else, I feel like like better, because like

766
01:31:55.230 --> 01:31:59.370
Nick Graham: For the first time, like I feel secure in like like knowing like kind of like

767
01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:11.640
Nick Graham: How I feel and not like I'm not like I'm still like drill to like a good measure of insecure but it feels like good knowing that like

768
01:32:13.650 --> 01:32:14.070
Nick Graham: If

769
01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:23.610
Nick Graham: This doesn't work out that it's fine because I communicated what I needed to. And I said, expectation. So that's been positive.

770
01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It took a while to get here. I think sort of not rushing right being able to say we rushed before. Let's be intentional about this. There's

771
01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: putting pressure on us right now there's no one putting pressure, there's, there's no urgent super important both acknowledge, but let's go gently really intentionally and then communicate. How we doing now. How we doing now. How we doing now. How we doing now.

772
01:32:57.630 --> 01:33:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it sounds like both of you are confused. What do you want, what do you

773
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you a little you I don't know what she's saying, but it sounds like it's easier for her to say what she doesn't want and that doesn't really get you what you want.

774
01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want this, and I don't want that they don't. Okay. Well, in the absence of those negative things that, what do we have, let's define

775
01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, what do we want in this marriage. What is marriage mean to you at this age and maybe the vow, in a sense, this rotten fruit fresh is

776
01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we commit to what do we really committing to do for the rest of our lives together. Maybe it's revisiting, what are we up to every 10 years or something, I don't know, but it's your marriage. It's not like anybody

777
01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's yours so

778
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

779
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.420
Okay.

780
01:33:57.570 --> 01:34:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and anything else going on. What about did it get to the point where the addict in you the voice said, oh, this is a great reason to go use again, don't forget about your connect

781
01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Number. In the next town remember him. You still got a friend that still has this number did that voice come up

782
01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:26.340
Nick Graham: Yeah, always comes up like kind of frequently the fact that I could just like buy drugs from some guy in Florida, and he could send them in the mail to me like that that

783
01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:28.380
Yeah.

784
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.850
Nick Graham: Yeah.

785
01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I just

786
01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have gotten rid of his number out of your cell phone.

787
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.190
Nick Graham: You haven't stolen my brain forever.

788
01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's right, yeah. We were playing around with. Don't you dare sell it to me. Don't give it to me because right

789
01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you arrested. We got to. We went to the ridiculous, or I went there.

790
01:34:57.930 --> 01:35:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what do we do with that.

791
01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:01.830
You because You still gotta crack

792
01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are risky.

793
01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.510
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's kind of like

794
01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.620
Nick Graham: I guess like I know I could. I know I could do it the next day. And, you know, and I guess.

795
01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:15.240
Nick Graham: It's kind of like

796
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:17.880
Nick Graham: Which I don't think I think of it.

797
01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.530
Nick Graham: Because like I always know I could do it.

798
01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:30.300
Nick Graham: But just not today, kind of thing.

799
01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.770
Nick Graham: And so that's been working like

800
01:35:35.970 --> 01:35:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It can for a while.

801
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If I can postpone it for today. Well, then another day has passed, where I didn't do it, and in kind of short term that those can be effective.

802
01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:51.420
But

803
01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:52.890
Nick Graham: Yeah.

804
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Having access

805
01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It be beneficial for you to not have access to it.

806
01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I told me that you told this guy don't sell it to me. I can't remember if you said

807
01:36:08.610 --> 01:36:13.140
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah yeah tell me that wouldn't ever change anything like

808
01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:27.060
Nick Graham: That you know people are shameless though that's the thing that I have to kind of like live with the fact that I have like access, no matter where I go forever. As long as I remember, this guy's number the access is there eternally you know

809
01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:28.800
Nick Graham: And so

810
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:32.640
Nick Graham: That's like it's scary thing.

811
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:35.940
Nick Graham: But it is the reality.

812
01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

813
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's revisit that number in your head to keep it there.

814
01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:48.660
Nick Graham: Is an easy one to remember. So

815
01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:52.530
Nick Graham: Um, I don't. Give too much thought to but

816
01:36:53.700 --> 01:37:10.110
Nick Graham: Like there's certain numbers that I just remember like like my childhood home phone number, you know, my, my, my friends, brothers 683 1616 is his cell phone number and I never even called him once like

817
01:37:11.670 --> 01:37:20.190
Nick Graham: My friends number from when he moved to Cincinnati and I never talked to him again, like I just remember like numbers and they just stay in my brain eternally

818
01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.950
Nick Graham: Yeah, it is. But it's like not good in this situation.

819
01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it's okay. The truth of the matter is being realistic. Hey, you know, we're never really more than a couple of people away from getting to

820
01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: From score want it bad enough. So the idea is really, yes it is.

821
01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a choice to choice for me it's a choice for everyone. So it's just getting that

822
01:37:50.460 --> 01:38:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Down at the bottom of the list, you will have run through all these other things. It won't make sense in your life anymore. It just it'll you'll cross it it'll cross a pass across your mind, you'll go how absurd. It'll just be that. So we'll get there.

823
01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:09.750
Nick Graham: Okay, it doesn't

824
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopeless. The fact that you have this this skill of remembering numbers that's I think when people say, you know, you're always going to be in recovery, in a sense.

825
01:38:22.770 --> 01:38:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, I think, really all it means the same way with the food. There's always an option to to overdo the always going to be fast food. There's always going to be that there. It's just you're building a life where it doesn't make sense to do with it.

826
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:38.370
Nick Graham: Right.

827
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to start tithing, Nick, you're going to start to make basically probably I'm thinking promises, in a sense.

828
01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Sydney, you're going to be basically saying, I'm going to be more present I'm holding myself more accountable for not escaping my emotions. I'm going to own and work through them.

829
01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And not run to drugs. I made dumb decisions. And the same thing with dipping into anger. I'm working on that. And that's a bit of a promise we're not saying, I promise.

830
01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a promise it's it's setting out this expectation to the to the listener. This is how I'm going to be, you can count on.

831
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You can count on this. I'm going to be this. So when I say you're developing a life where it doesn't make sense to us, you're going to have to go, oh my gosh, my relationship might be at stake here. If I go back to that way of living, I might start being an a hoe. Again, I might lose her

832
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm talking about. I'm saying there's a lot of

833
01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life won't make sense to going back to that life anymore. What if she has a child or something. I mean, it'll just stop making sense to do those things because you'll be so much better.

834
01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: At meeting your life on terms you'll feel those feelings, you will have had success in managing through them.

835
01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll be like, oh, this is, this one's inconvenient. Oh, this one's hard. What do I need to do I need to. I need to call some people. All right, I need to do some reading. I need some quiet time. I need to spend some time, hiking, you'll do those things.

836
01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll still that we can. We all got that stuff on the list. It's all there.

837
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know. It would be nice if temptation was never going to be on the horizon. Again, wouldn't it be nice if Suboxone just like a miracle made it all Kobe.

838
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:32.340
Right.

839
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry.

840
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's the mentality of the addict. Anyway, just give me a pill. Make it easy. Sorry. Being humans hard

841
01:40:42.450 --> 01:40:43.200
Just sorry. Yeah.

842
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful, too.

843
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am a little selfishly excited

844
01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: For you with Sydney am selfishly right

845
01:40:55.290 --> 01:41:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I've been kind of like, I'm kind of tapping my fingers like I wonder, she's kind of come around. I don't know who she is. I'm like, huh,

846
01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder. She's gonna come around. I don't know. Maybe she's not meant to be, I don't know anything better. And I've been wondering

847
01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.370
Nick Graham: Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, she didn't and

848
01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:16.890
Nick Graham: That's good. I like

849
01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:32.430
Nick Graham: I'm not feeling like super excited about a, you know, just because like when she came to me was when I had written her off like and I felt good about for the first time, being able to like face it, like, I don't have this person and so

850
01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:41.010
Nick Graham: You know, like that. It was interesting. The timing that you know kind of worked with that.

851
01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:43.620
Nick Graham: So I don't know. We'll see.

852
01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:45.180
Nick Graham: How it works.

853
01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:55.980
Nick Graham: There's a chance that I'm, I'm, like, heavily preparing for the fact that it won't work. And I'm kind of like, okay, if it doesn't, kind of thing.

854
01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And those are those are punctuations. But if instead the invitation and I am inviting. It is more your ongoing work is remember how you said its present present. What am I noticing right now. I noticed I DON'T BELIEVE HER SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MY something I'm being present.

855
01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what city.

856
01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about what you just said, I'm having a hard time kind of trusting right now not saying you have to do anything to it.

857
01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Will it work out won't work out. No, that's not where the energy goes, it goes, I'm going to continue to pay attention to how I feel. Pay attention to my intuition on name it. I'll talk about it. I will continue to be authentic in the moment.

858
01:42:47.730 --> 01:42:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Marriage is just yes it's legal, but it's a piece of paper.

859
01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Your commitment to yourself not abandoning yourself is key.

860
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt a lot of work on that. So hold on tight. Okay, it's gonna make you more confident and and and probably making decisions in the moment when you're around her that you don't end up regretting because you went slow

861
01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you really were intentional and just sort of sat with I need a little more time to think about this. I got to spend some time thinking about this. My automatic thought is this

862
01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to take some time. If it's just back at the moment. How do I feel right now. What do I need what what's going on for me right now.

863
01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Not making a decision will this marriage work well this marriage work if you're enjoying paying attention to you. Let's keep doing it.

864
01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:43.290
Nick Graham: That's it's a better way to look at it probably

865
01:43:45.570 --> 01:43:49.740
Nick Graham: Looking at the final answer. What you don't know or can't control.

866
01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.050
Nick Graham: Yes, that's like, I guess.

867
01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.090
Nick Graham: A good

868
01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.090
Nick Graham: Really state of mind to always take like

869
01:43:58.290 --> 01:43:59.640
Nick Graham: Living in the moment, kind of

870
01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:06.510
Nick Graham: It is without using that an excuse to make bad decisions. I think people use that as an excuse to make a bad decision, but

871
01:44:10.770 --> 01:44:26.550
Nick Graham: Yeah, that's been a hard thing. I don't know, like I through life of lately. I haven't felt like bad, which is good. Like, I haven't felt suicidal. I haven't felt extreme emotions, but I haven't really felt like like overwhelmingly good either. And I don't know, like

872
01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.310
Nick Graham: When that comes

873
01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

874
01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Layer that's problematic on that is

875
01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: As if as a problem.

876
01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So just just just witness it.

877
01:44:47.670 --> 01:44:47.910
Nick Graham: Is

878
01:44:47.970 --> 01:44:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know whether it's you're going to end up pushing out to make sure that you have those intense for some people. That's where the substance use was too is, I want this intensity

879
01:45:00.150 --> 01:45:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

880
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just giving you time for the low vibration that sort of like go walking in the mountains and just like maybe maybe the polarity of intense

881
01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: High right and this and all the way down. Maybe that's familiar to you, but sort of this is what finding out what feelings are all about in sobriety, or just seeing. Can I be with just

882
01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And just sort of in the middle, not too high, not too low. I'll look at me, I'm making meaning out of it. I caught myself.

883
01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Does this mean I'm depressed. Is this going to be my lifeline never have that passion and excitement you catch it. You're making meaning out of this middle ground.

884
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You just you, you look at it, you label it and you detach, maybe it's hey I'm, I'm still on the Suboxone i don't know maybe it's doubling the

885
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the experience of the serotonin needs because it does, it inhibits the serotonin. So maybe when I'm off of that that will come up as well. I'm just going to pay attention to it I noticing. It's not there.

886
01:46:13.890 --> 01:46:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some pros. There's some cons. I'm not doing these really big.

887
01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: gestures of drug use and acting out. I'm just kind of see, you check yourself you check the meaning you're making out of I'm not really too too happy either

888
01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Just look at it. All right, maybe let's let me see. I want to help on that, unless I wonder if today. And that's all you just watch over and over. You do that all day long. You just witness compassionate.

889
01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Witness just huh good that and I'll keep talking to going to hear about it. Look, it's again here today, I noticed today. I felt really dull.

890
01:46:53.010 --> 01:47:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, stinking thinking came in it that I must be making some negative meaning like this is going to be this way forever. Oh, I kept pastor five. That's a very common.

891
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought that people do. It's awful. It's so awful. Look. Look how do I feel now instead of that gently just well look at what my brain is doing over and over, like you said, this is the way a whole way living every day.

892
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: If you said, I want to be more present. This is what it looks like. We don't land judgment and then act.

893
01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Out from it. We sit, we look at the label, we say is that all there is. We look content context, we say, well, I'm in this. I'm still on the subs and wonder if there's something to do with it.

894
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it has something to do with a lifetime of doing this and this and I'll keep talking. Whenever you're about it. I'll do some journaling. Let me do something that also maybe gives me a little bit more joy and go do those things.

895
01:47:56.130 --> 01:48:00.120
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I think it's probably that i don't know i don't know like

896
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:14.790
Nick Graham: If there's a certain time that it takes like there's a brain heal after things like this was did this to do that opiate opioids like damage to the brain, like what is it like the physiological kind of

897
01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Question. You did mess with it. I'm not going to say forever. You didn't. It's, I can't say I I'm not in the brain of yours, but what I have heard from people in this program. I'm going to be three years here.

898
01:48:34.290 --> 01:48:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: In June.

899
01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The ones that are down 2.75 and I've been on that for a while, are like I got my brain back

900
01:48:44.370 --> 01:48:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, my it's I'm not fuzzy and they have access to happy they have access to it. You know how you say it's kind of like, where is that feeling.

901
01:48:53.220 --> 01:49:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So I, I think it will come back online but yeah you mess with it, you gave it this when natural organic right oh opioid

902
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Receptor response. The good dopa mean the natural adult mean occurring chemical reaction is this, and you did this to it. See a mess with it you mess with the expectation. It's like dharma.

903
01:49:14.970 --> 01:49:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Dharma dharma. Dharma. You want to throw the Dumb Dumb and Dumber. Gimme gimme gimme gimme a mess with it. So we need to get back to homeostasis right here so that that sunset that walk with the puppy.

904
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that those things can feel delicious again. So just be patient.

905
01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:41.160
Nick Graham: Because they used to, you know, and that that's like what's like I feel it kind of depressing. Like sometimes like trapped in a hole because I'm like, I remember times when I was like

906
01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:50.490
Nick Graham: smile at this sunset or like pass by someone in like feel a genuine like beautiful like human connection and be like happy about it. Now I'm just like,

907
01:49:51.570 --> 01:49:55.320
Nick Graham: Like I see it, but I don't feel you know this stuff so

908
01:49:56.430 --> 01:50:05.280
Nick Graham: I presume that that will be something that, you know, like, like the last time I got clean it came in time. And then I was feeling that kind of stuff. Again, while

909
01:50:06.210 --> 01:50:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to offer reassurance. I do believe it will come back. I'm not God's will. I will. I can't talk like that.

910
01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.350
Nick Graham: Yeah. Yes.

911
01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I love my what I've seen you just right. Now remember, okay. Just remember, yes. I used to feel this. I can't get it back. And I think you will

912
01:50:24.090 --> 01:50:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But it does require tapering which means you're going to have on that edge of on both scared and I want happy feelings back. I'm scared. You're going to be living that edge. So are you taking. Are you doing the best you can with 5.5 and for how many days. Have you been doing it.

913
01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:42.210
Nick Graham: Yeah.

914
01:50:43.290 --> 01:50:49.590
Nick Graham: I think I mean, yeah, I've been. I've been at that for who probably a little while but I could probably get down to five.

915
01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Little scared right

916
01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:58.320
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean a little bit like I think that'd be comfortable where I was even thinking like

917
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.540
Nick Graham: I could probably

918
01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:05.520
Nick Graham: We think I could probably good for kids just like easier to

919
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's too far.

920
01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:08.700
You

921
01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, do more than don't don't don't do more than one milligram out of time.

922
01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, start then you'll have an excuse. Look, I mean withdrawal papers for the birds. I can't do this.

923
01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we'll have

924
01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Really bad experience, but I'd rather it be

925
01:51:26.370 --> 01:51:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you're doing that the tablet thing. Right. Um, what would be an easy would five or four and a half be easier.

926
01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:38.130
Nick Graham: easier because there's two milligram pills and so I could do

927
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:41.640
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think five would be easy.

928
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I can't remember when you said you were going to go in

929
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, Nicholas march 3 that's you tomorrow. Right.

930
01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.130
Nick Graham: Yes. Yeah, but everything tomorrow and

931
01:51:54.270 --> 01:52:04.080
Nick Graham: If they let me pass through. So yeah, insurance things again and now this thing. I have a $4,000 deductible some weird things like that so

932
01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to get this is this is hard for a lot of people getting in there. This is enough stuff at least get your information go give them a call the person at bright heart, I think, so far, that's been really effective is

933
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Krista bending she's

934
01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:32.370
Nick Graham: Yeah, Krista. Krista told me that as well. So it seems as crystal look into it and my plans are not compatible. So I guess I need to call Cigna my insurance and tell them

935
01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:34.260
Nick Graham: Like hey

936
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:37.680
Nick Graham: Can you make this work kind of

937
01:52:38.850 --> 01:52:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't remember if they said it's because it's telemedicine Telehealth.

938
01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:46.830
Nick Graham: Yeah, like it's not it. Yeah, exactly. It's

939
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.880
It is

940
01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta tell you, if it's not today. It'll be soon. And you're not the only one. My signal. It's been having a hard time. I mean, you can go on the website and see all the insurance companies that are

941
01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That are providing this what's called like a parody niche, which means if you're going to provide services that are commensurate to another, you need to reimburse at the same. It's this Parity Act. So

942
01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, do let me let me hear how is it different, because people are benefiting from it. This this company this company this company. This is the service.

943
01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to use. I don't have access to one, it's easier when there's nobody around because you can say, well there. I don't have access anywhere else. You know, you can say, I'm in a remote area and I have to sell a health. That's a great argument.

944
01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But honestly, they're going to end up. If it's not today. It's going to be soon where they're going to have to because there's this is all over the place and it seems to be working just as well as you know brick and mortar. So they're going to come around eventually

945
01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And just cash. I don't know.

946
01:53:57.690 --> 01:54:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be really surprised if there's not someone in that office someone a supervisor or someone who's not looking at that right now saying

947
01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:08.970
Nick Graham: Yeah, you can reimburse and reimburse for

948
01:54:10.170 --> 01:54:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's just a matter of our billing being able to send a particular document in if it's a note or something, I don't know. But my concern is that it might be so scary for you that you might not want to give them a call.

949
01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:28.740
Nick Graham: Yeah. Well, it's kind of been a

950
01:54:30.450 --> 01:54:36.660
Nick Graham: Yeah, like I could I could I could give them a card. I'm trying to think, what's been blocking me from doing that, like,

951
01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.120
Nick Graham: Just

952
01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot of money.

953
01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:56.790
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah yeah like I guess I don't really want to hear the final result. I don't know cuz I'm close to, I think I'm at my limit with with bright heart and they might not. Let me through again.

954
01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:09.720
Nick Graham: My dad who told me he was going to pay monthly make $200 a month until me he like just withdrew that some reason.

955
01:55:10.410 --> 01:55:10.620
You

956
01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:21.420
Nick Graham: Know, even like he helped me as my my dog adoption fee and then he was like, so I pay for that. And then that's all I can do for a while and it's like

957
01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:23.790
Nick Graham: Okay.

958
01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.450
Nick Graham: I should probably have a further discussion.

959
01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice

960
01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be a little bit of that old habit of not directly asking people questions there might be a little bit that still going on. That's pretty common. It's hard to ask

961
01:55:40.650 --> 01:55:42.540
Questions, um,

962
01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:47.910
Nick Graham: He's given me so much money. It's like, like for different things. You know, like

963
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:50.820
Nick Graham: It's hard. It's hard to like

964
01:55:52.170 --> 01:55:58.710
Nick Graham: To do that, because he's given me like a lot. I mean, stay for a lot of coverage. He's, he's

965
01:55:59.730 --> 01:56:01.950
Nick Graham: Paid for my rent when I needed help. He's like,

966
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:07.140
Nick Graham: He's got a lot of money. You know, I mean this mean I'm entitled

967
01:56:09.150 --> 01:56:09.690
Nick Graham: To me to

968
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:15.450
Nick Graham: Ask that but he's been so helpful I think

969
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna go run a group, but I, that might be a place for us to explore next time. But notice

970
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.620
Nick Graham: Yeah.

971
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well the next times if we can't get this figured out and let me also say this, they, they will work out some sort of, Hey, well if you pay such and such payment.

972
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll work with you as long as you're sort of on board with with study bringing stuff in. So just just talk with them. The worst thing that's going to happen is

973
01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You have this $4,000 deductible. Okay, I'm going to have to really see I'm going to have to put my money.

974
01:56:51.600 --> 01:57:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in there. Am I going to follow through with with the homework. Well, I better. This actually is coming out of my pocket. This is a pain in the butt. Listen, we value what we pay for. I'm sorry we do, you're going to write up like I'm going to do it. Talk on it. I'm paying for this stuff.

975
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:09.090
You're going to see

976
01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay well i i really want to keep working with you. I sure hope we can figure something out. If anything, I want to work with both of you. I wanted you know

977
01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So try to remove any kind of shame layer that's attached to it. Okay, and get into accountability, responsibility, you're going to feel good. I'm taking action. I'm not

978
01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Making decisions out of fear and scarcity and get into ask the hard questions and be able to tolerate their responses that's that's that's big boy pants stuff right there for sure that's not i'm not easy. Right.

979
01:57:48.900 --> 01:58:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah but but I don't want to act like this is an important. I feel like this is something we may want to talk about in a future session because a lot might be coming up for you.

980
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:02.490
Nick Graham: Yeah, for sure.

981
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do you want me to, sort of, wait, and holding you let me know when you want to meet or what what do you suggest

982
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:10.560
Nick Graham: I would think like

983
01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:17.370
Nick Graham: To do that group, which is like more money tomorrow. Probably the week from whatever, like, a week from today.

984
01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

985
01:58:25.710 --> 01:58:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Eat, eat on

986
01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: March 10. Is that too soon.

987
01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:36.930
Nick Graham: Now, I think it's fine. Okay, you have a 777 days a week.

988
01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, actually I didn't I unless she she's been one. Oh, I got some been a month march 13 yet. That's a Friday.

Nick Graham: Let's do. Let's do it. Let's do eight on that.

Nick Graham: And if I have to change it. I will change it.

994
01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:06.240
Nick Graham: Change it.

995

Gwenevere Abriel: Will find out probably Sunday night I'll check with you on the eighth. Oh yeah, that's beautiful well be good to you and deep breath.

996
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: don't overanalyze it all we have to do is ask the questions.

997
01:59:24.150 --> 01:59:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a good person just because this we are we have crappy insurance, you are not alone. A lot of us do.

998
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: No reflection on your value. Truly, I promise.

999
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.930
Nick Graham: Very careful

1000
01:59:41.970 --> 01:59:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: With you, man. Let's not even go there.
