Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you get your nails done.

28
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.760
Jessica Freeman: No, but, um, you know, like they're, they look terrible like some lines aren't open so I there's not much I can really do right now.

29
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:38.700
Jessica Freeman: But like my toenails. They were gel polish and so I literally like, I can't buzz them off. I don't have one of those little buzzer things so they finally finally like came off right after a long hot bubble bath, which was glorious.

30
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:50.730
Jessica Freeman: And they were like, whoa scraggly so I eczema and they're ready to paint. I just have to find my nail polish and pick a color.

31
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

32
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.190
Yeah.

33
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:04.710
Jessica Freeman: My friend Amanda sent me a care package total surprise and it was full of like if it was called the quarantine spa package.

34
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:18.000
Jessica Freeman: And it had like like homemade bath bombs and like fragrances and all kinds of like face masks and makeup and just really cute stuff so I broke into that a little bit.

35
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.560
Good.

36
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.080
Jessica Freeman: I have wonderful friends.

37
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is just insane. That's really cool.

38
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.990
Jessica Freeman: How are you

39
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm good.

40
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am good.

41
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.090
Jessica Freeman: Right on.

42
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely it's been

43
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A long week but I'm good.

44
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.220
Jessica Freeman: Team.

45
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.910
You know,

46
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.550
Jessica Freeman: Every single day.

47
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. They are what I'm learning, though, is that we get to implement and do

48
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whatever we want to within reason, right. So it's not

49
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:11.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In every day. Same thing. Do you know what I mean. It's like, what are you going to put in. And this is kind of what I've been working on, are we, what are you going to put in your day to day. What are you going to do today that you didn't do yesterday.

50
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you can make today fun so like

51
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: replanting flowers like building a rock garden like you know stuff that's like right in my realm, you know, in my area that I don't have to go out a whole lot in the public for, you know, that kind of stuff.

52
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've been reading a lot with women for sobriety.

53
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah, and

54
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's pretty amazing. There is they have this daily this affirmation page and

55
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's basically an agreement that you get that you work out with yourself.

56
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:05.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So every morning you read this list, you read these these 12 affirmations every morning and every night before you go to bed. And the idea is to change your thought process around

57
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: low self esteem.

58
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.510
Jessica Freeman: Sorry, my kid.

59
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.950
Pretty amazing.

60
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.930
Jessica Freeman: Sounds good.

61
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

62
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.240
Jessica Freeman: I yourself. Okay, go play, buddy.

63
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.520
Jessica Freeman: Thank you.

64
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:48.390
Jessica Freeman: I bought some new recovery books and I've been trying to make it a part of every morning to read at least like two or three

65
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.700
Jessica Freeman: Meditation type

66
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.000
Jessica Freeman: Thing good daily thing.

67
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.250
Jessica Freeman: So that's been going well.

68
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, look, these are called

69
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're going to read them right now. These are called acceptance statements is what they're called.

70
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My computer's wanting to be slow this morning.

71
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.020
Jessica Freeman: It's okay, I'm in no rush.

72
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It says we don't know if we want to work. There you go.

73
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. Alright.

74
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright.

75
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see him.

76
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.270
Yeah.

77
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:51.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, this is women for sobriety. And the only difference is that it's it works off of a program called life. Life ring and it works off of smart recovery. So it kind of

78
00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:01.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dances lightly around the spiritual aspect because it seems like a lot of people have issues with spirit, the spirituality of recovery.

79
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.770
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

80
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and

81
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their higher power, you know, really looks like.

82
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.730
Jessica Freeman: Right I struggled with that for a long time.

83
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:25.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. A lot of people do. I remember my very first a meeting was because my ex husband was celebrating 30 days, who's in sobriety 30 days about 3045 days longer than me and I was so full of resentment towards him. And I was so full of her and

84
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He invited me to his 30 day birthday, and I had no idea what I was getting into my very first meeting and I walked in this in this room, and there were all these people

85
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:54.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they were talking, talking about God and they were talking about love and forgiveness and all this crap that I was filled with resentment and hurt and pain that I could. I don't think I could have ran out of that door fast enough.

86
00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I was so mad at him, I was like, don't either ever in that situation.

87
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:19.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now I look back on it, it is pretty funny. You know, but I was so mad at God. When I first was introduced to any kind of recovery program that I couldn't even fathom him being you know in my heart and in my life.

88
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No way.

89
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:29.580
Jessica Freeman: I thought it was for suckers. I thought everything spiritual and religious well first I group them together, you know, spirituality religion.

90
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:36.450
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. And then I just wrote it off as something for stupid people that needed a crutch, you know,

91
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:37.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

92
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.220
Jessica Freeman: You know, I can relate. I was

93
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:57.990
Jessica Freeman: You know, I had a pretty messed up trauma. When I was 17 years old, very heavily involved with the church and like all these people there, especially these good Christian people and now you know it just they look at me different they treat me differently.

94
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.480
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so I am

95
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.640
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I didn't want anything to do with it. But over time, and plus that gift of desperation. Let me tell ya.

96
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:18.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. Yeah, it definitely puts you in a position that you've, you get to a point that you're on your knees. You know what I mean.

97
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.010
Jessica Freeman: Literally for me.

98
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.390
Jessica Freeman: And it literally

99
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Insane um

100
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

101
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.600
Jessica Freeman: So the point. I didn't know what I was going to do. You know, I don't have any other options. Yeah.

102
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I totally know definitely it definitely bro, we're

103
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Reading this, you know, for me, feels like it's work that should have been done a long time ago and it's specifically designed for women and what women go through and for me that's important.

104
00:09:52.140 --> 00:10:02.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, because when I first was introduced to recovery. You know, it was for my ex husband and my world was wrapped around this person who was so toxic.

105
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

106
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And why the type

107
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:21.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm an individual, what I can have my own recovery. What you know what I mean, it was, it was crazy. And so I centered myself around these women in recovery that have been in recovery for many years and

108
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was pretty amazing. But my ex husband called them the man haters club.

109
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.110
Jessica Freeman: He sounds like a real gem.

110
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, he was, he yeah yeah narcissistic to full capacity.

111
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I'll tell you what they definitely saved my ass. More times than I could have ever thought of, you know,

112
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.030
Yeah.

113
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So for me, we can never get enough our whole life. We're working on being better and building our self esteem, knowing that we have value and worth

114
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:06.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and sometimes we forget that with every day bustle in and with kids and you know everything else feels like that. They come first.

115
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so, becoming really grounded.

116
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:18.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the fact that we're women. We have our own unique problems, our own unique issues and

117
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The great part about it is that we get to. We don't have to, but we get to create a world in a life that makes us happy, you know,

118
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really kind of it. Okay, I'll get off my soapbox but

119
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm just feeling a lot of a lot of joy and a lot of happiness today. You know what I mean.

120
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:48.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dan. This is a piece of it. And of course, waking up and putting your earbuds in and dance into my favorite songs is

121
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.790
Jessica Freeman: Also, I did that today.

122
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.120
Jessica Freeman: Big time. And I know

123
00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:01.740
Jessica Freeman: We're supposed to hate our Kelly, because he's an awful, awful person, but I still like to dance music

124
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:12.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's nothing wrong with that. It's totally there's nothing wrong with that, you know, just because he's you know done whatever he's done doesn't mean his music isn't beautiful

125
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

126
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.260
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. He's perfect. Oh.

127
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, a lot of them are that's

128
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

129
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.970
Jessica Freeman: Most men are really gross.

130
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:24.720
Yeah.

131
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I agree very much so.

132
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:40.950
Jessica Freeman: After everything that you just said about like you know how we have to try to find value in ourselves and all that, like,

133
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:51.810
Jessica Freeman: On a personal level, and like with my family relationships and my friendships and you know I feel good about that. I know that I'm contributing. I know I'm participating

134
00:12:52.590 --> 00:13:03.150
Jessica Freeman: I'm present like all the things that I need to be to be good, you know, daughter mother friend cousin, what have you. And, but when it comes to like the romantic stuff.

135
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:15.420
Jessica Freeman: I do have some some negative self talk on that because I'm 40 years old you know I'm I have a single parent to this little boy who is extremely

136
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:27.180
Jessica Freeman: high maintenance high levels of needs like and he's a sweetheart me so wonderful and anybody that gets to know him loves into pieces, but still it's it's a lot

137
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not so

138
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:36.390
Jessica Freeman: I don't really have a lot of hope for for that. And if it comes along great. But if not, I'm prepared.

139
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:42.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. It's like being okay no matter what with who you are.

140
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, knowing that your life is this just how it is.

141
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.260
Jessica Freeman: I'm happy with the baby comes first.

142
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:52.830
Right.

143
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's pretty good. Okay, so

144
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:11.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This let's read these. Okay. Okay. All right. So number one, I have a life threatening problem that once had me. I now take charge of my life, my well being and I accept the responsibility.

145
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My favorite one is number two we read that one.

146
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:25.290
Jessica Freeman: Yes, negative thoughts destroy only myself, my first conscious sober act is to reduce negativity in my life.

147
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:33.060
Jessica Freeman: I've done that quite a bit. Yeah, I mean, I can't. I mean, there's nothing in my life that causes me

148
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Negative thoughts.

149
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.150
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, like I'm

150
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.820
Jessica Freeman: Everything's looking good.

151
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:49.020
Jessica Freeman: Work though like I don't know. I don't know about that. I do have some negative thoughts about myself on that because how employable. Am I, you know,

152
00:14:53.010 --> 00:15:00.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you're 100% unemployable. You have a great mind you know you're smart, you know what I mean, it's like

153
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the part you know that that we minimize

154
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.920
Jessica Freeman: You know, I don't have any

155
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.210
Jessica Freeman: I don't have like any not even associates.

156
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.770
Jessica Freeman: Doesn't

157
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:27.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Matter. I found out that the hard way. Like, I went I didn't go back to school, till I was in my 40s and got my associates and honestly I went back to school because you got. I thought you got free money.

158
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

159
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:31.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah,

160
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I never in my whole life got in a in school.

161
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:54.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I thought, There's no way I'm going to be able to do this. What are you doing, what do you think there is absolutely no way you hated school when you were a kid, you're going to hate it now as an adult. But it turned out my very first paper my was my very first day and so

162
00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:08.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Writing. Oh my gosh. I was like, maybe I can't do this. Maybe, maybe I am smart enough to do this. You know what I mean. And it doubted that los you know belief system that I had in myself that I could actually

163
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:21.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get a good grade, you know, complete something I completed my associates went on to my bachelor's completed my bachelor's and my goal in both, you know. And all three of my programs was to

164
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get the best possible. Great. It was like I was in competition with myself from that point forward, and my first see was a math. I hate math.

165
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have to

166
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:42.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm terrible, right, for some reason, I don't care how many hours. I tried to study. I could not connect the dots. I just couldn't I just couldn't and

167
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wound up, you know, that was my very first see and it took me a little while to digest that you know to be okay. It's all right, CS get degrees.

168
00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:07.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, this is the area that you know you struggle in the most. That doesn't mean that you're less than. It just means that this is the area that you are almost done. And by the time I completed my master's program.

169
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was

170
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So done seven years. Yeah.

171
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.150
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and you did all this in your 40s.

172
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.810
Yeah.

173
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

174
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.110
Jessica Freeman: Feel like I'm too old. I mean, I definitely want to go back to school, but I don't want to spend seven years at

175
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:31.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And so, you know, nowadays. There's these programs that you can become, you can get certified to be pretty much anything in a short amount of time.

176
00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:32.670
You know,

177
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.560
Jessica Freeman: And so it's really

178
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:47.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Taking a look at what it is that you're passionate about and moving forward in that area. And another thing was that I was stuck in these jobs that were minimum wage that

179
00:17:49.740 --> 00:18:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what, barely survival mode, you know, it's just like, I'm going to be working till I'm dead. You know at this point.

180
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:13.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And going back to school just kind of gave me the hope it didn't give me the full hope and the end this whole retirement package that I hope that it would, but it gives me hope that I can move forward and I can do.

181
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And, you know, working in this field, definitely doesn't, you're not going to get rich here. You know, it's pretty

182
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: pretty minimal, but the internal satisfaction.

183
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: outweighs for me in anything and everything else.

184
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:32.910
Jessica Freeman: Oh, yeah.

185
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.620
Jessica Freeman: You know what you love.

186
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.050
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, that's what I want to do.

187
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:49.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you can anything and everything is achievable. You know, we've just got to be able to to put that fear aside and run forward.

188
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:58.500
Jessica Freeman: And it's not even just that like the fear. Okay, I can. I know that I can face this down, but it's like the feedback I get from the people around me.

189
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:05.070
Jessica Freeman: You know when when they don't believe in me. It takes another punch to the gut, you know,

190
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep.

191
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. Yeah, I took it.

192
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And use that to motivate me. Excuse me.

193
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My allergies are

194
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: bless you, and have it with me. I took that piece and said, Oh, yeah.

195
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:24.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Watch me.

196
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

197
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It added that fuel that I needed to push forward. You can't be. You don't believe in me.

198
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Watch me go.

199
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

200
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:46.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was probably one of the best motivators to take that hurt and that that that piece and add that fuel.

201
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To pumps, you know, forward.

202
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of amazing

203
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I'm going to think about. Yeah, totally. Something to think about.

204
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:04.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, number three. This one is my favorite happiness as a habit I am developing happiness is created not waited for

205
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When I first learned that that I'm in charge of my own happiness. I kind of was mind blowing to me.

206
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.590
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

207
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.780
Jessica Freeman: You know, yeah.

208
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:13.860
Definitely

209
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.140
Jessica Freeman: Waiting for some

210
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:22.500
Jessica Freeman: Some thing or some man to come along and that's what my happiness would rely on

211
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yes, it's all about them.

212
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:26.910
Like it

213
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

214
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay.

215
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:42.510
Jessica Freeman: Problems bother me only to the degree I permit I now better understand my problems. I do not permit problems to overwhelm me

216
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.970
Jessica Freeman: I've been through a lot of problems or back. I've been through a lot of problems like big ones.

217
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And boulders.

218
00:20:53.430 --> 00:21:04.950
Jessica Freeman: Oh yeah, big time. So now it's like I got first world problems. I'm grateful for the problems that I have, because they're like cake compared to what I've already been through.

219
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.090
Jessica Freeman: Luxury

220
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.900
You know,

221
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:15.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to do to to decipher what a luxury problem is versus a real hardcore problem.

222
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you know what I mean, it's like everything is a problem.

223
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:34.320
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, but even I mean when they do come up. I agree. Like, I've learned some coping skills, you know, like feelings are not fact they're temporary this too shall pass.

224
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.950
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, the fact that it's not forever just for now.

225
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.690
Jessica Freeman: He's your thing that

226
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That helped you learn

227
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:44.880
Right.

228
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I remember seeing all of those things, you know, on the walls in this place in Seaside, Oregon is called the little yellow house and all of these sayings on the wall. I'm like,

229
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What, what do they let you know what I mean. I was like, this is crazy, but I understood it, and I understood it, the more that I attended

230
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah, where I started going through the program. It's like you get exactly deep in your heart. What they mean but at first it's like they're just words. How is that possible, you know,

231
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:33.660
Jessica Freeman: They were the end up for me being things that I did. I had to like hold on to like a life preserver. Like I would remember these things, or maybe my sponsor would say these things are my therapist.

232
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:44.580
Jessica Freeman: And like repetition. For me, it took a lot of repetition, but then I would get something in my head like, you know, one of the things I just said, and it would be

233
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.070
Jessica Freeman: Something I could say to myself in moments of a trial.

234
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

235
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:51.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which I

236
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Absolutely love

237
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.580
In time

238
00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think one of the big ones for me was that realizing what was in my control versus what was it,

239
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.280
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and the Serenity Prayer. That's a, that's a good one.

240
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My, my sponsor read it to me as

241
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: God grant me the courage to accept the people I cannot change.

242
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:28.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: God grant me the serenity to accept the people that I accept the people that I cannot change the courage to change the one I can, and the wisdom to know that it is me.

243
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.770
Jessica Freeman: That's cool. Never heard that one.

244
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:38.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it kind of blew me away because then I quit trying to change my ex husband.

245
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And started working towards myself.

246
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:54.060
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I had to. I had to do the same thing with Kim's dad like when we split up, you know, and he took key and as mad as I was, I was still heartbroken.

247
00:23:54.150 --> 00:24:01.470
Jessica Freeman: And I had, I had to go through a whole long process to let that go. Yeah.

248
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is a process that's for sure. Yeah. You know, people that

249
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of

250
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:16.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People when they, when they go through a loss and they're grieving and they're going through, you know, the emotions. They're like,

251
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:31.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They want it to be over with so fast. And it's like, wait, it takes time to go through this process. You know, sometimes we get stuck, you know, and it takes longer, but there is no time limit.

252
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

253
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Takes what it takes for everyone.

254
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everyone's different.

255
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.050
Jessica Freeman: Yeah man, I've had, I've had relationships.

256
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:49.260
Jessica Freeman: From, like, my early, early adulthood that I swore I would never get over, then you know it's been 20 years

257
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.490
Jessica Freeman: Dude I don't I don't fucking care at all.

258
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.440
Jessica Freeman: And I have a long time.

259
00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you get to that point. It's like, all right, that's it. I'm done with that.

260
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.400
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, like I forgot about that.

261
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.670
Jessica Freeman: I'm living my life.

262
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try and live in my dream.

263
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:10.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

264
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am what I think this one's kind of powerful to

265
00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm a capable, competent caring, compassionate woman.

266
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, trying to to tell yourself that when you've never believed that

267
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:36.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: never had anybody confirm that that's the truth, you know, always had negative relationships in your life is hard. You know what I mean to grasp your head around.

268
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:53.520
Jessica Freeman: Well, until, until you you know you perform esteem bubble X right yeah like you got to make this true through your action, not just your inner monologue. I can tell myself I'm anything but like I need to act like a capable, competent caring, compassionate woman.

269
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.140
Jessica Freeman: And then I can start to believe it.

270
00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.620
Jessica Freeman: Yes way into right thinking

271
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:05.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right, yeah. I love that because, you know, oftentimes will act that way towards other people, but we want ourselves.

272
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:13.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and that's that piece that the more that we do it for ourselves. The more capable, we are to do it for others.

273
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.120
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm.

274
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of amazing.

275
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.430
Jessica Freeman: Yep.

276
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. Number six.

277
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:25.800
Jessica Freeman: Life can be ordinary or it can be great greatness is mine by a conscious effort.

278
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that just totally confirmed what you just said.

279
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

280
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:38.010
Jessica Freeman: Hmm. Right now, you know, in the lockdown. It's like

281
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.620
Jessica Freeman: You know, it can be ordinary and there's not a lot that I can do about it.

282
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.360
Jessica Freeman: But I do know that

283
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:57.000
Jessica Freeman: I'm doing the very best I can. And that's pretty great, actually. And it's okay like it's okay for me to not shoot for the stars right now, but to just manage

284
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:08.640
Jessica Freeman: You know the best I can, you know, teach my son, you know, do the pecs and the visual schedule and like get things done and like, that's okay. It's good. It's great.

285
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is awesome.

286
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:28.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and part of that is because you're just not not sitting around, letting him, you know, do whatever and sit on a tablet, you know, you're putting forth this effort to work with him. You know what I mean. And bring other things to the table, which is pretty amazing. Definitely.

287
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:38.370
Jessica Freeman: He's really stubborn, Rebecca, you don't even know. He's so stubborn like to get him to engage with anything. You have to do it like 100 times

288
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:40.740
I'm not trying to

289
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:48.000

290
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.640

291
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.690

298
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:33.900

301
00:28:47.790 --> 00:29:00.180
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I can only do it in pieces, as long as I put him first and take care of his needs first and then you know keep going down my list and do the best that I can, and it's a good balance. Yeah.

302
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:09.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very good balance and number nine. The past is gone forever no longer and my victimized by the past. I am a new woman.

303
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.310

308
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:42.240

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:15.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and not to take offense to it and be able to digest it. Think about it.

395
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:30.720
Jessica Freeman: Okay, but that means I also need to follow up with student loans because I was on this page like three months you pay $5 and then you get your student loans out of default

396
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:42.090
Jessica Freeman: Uh huh. I wanted to do that. But now with the coven like I don't know if that's still happening because they refunded some stuff from my student loan payments and I'm so I got to call them.

Jessica Freeman: Yes, we use a haircut so bad.

402
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.930
So,

403
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll be glad when things start opening up that's for

404
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.400
Jessica Freeman: Sure. No.

405
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.810
Jessica Freeman: I'm from Minneapolis right so

406
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:29.280
Jessica Freeman: They're opening everything and their numbers are so much higher than ours, and they are already like phase three on June 1 don't

407
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.060
Jessica Freeman: You want to know.

408
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:35.520
Jessica Freeman: Let's go.

409
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.060
Jessica Freeman: I'm and I'm like this is stupid.

410
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:51.780
Jessica Freeman: Higher numbers and it's going to spike just like it did in Texas and everywhere else to open up too early. It's just up. I'm like,

411
00:39:52.140 --> 00:40:00.090
Jessica Freeman: I'm talking about their numbers are so much higher than ours. But we had less than 300 deaths in our state and they have like 1500

412
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.140
Jessica Freeman: You know,

413
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.520
Jessica Freeman: Why would you do that why because people are restless and

414
00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

415
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.530
Jessica Freeman: Good for them and gonna get sick and die.

416
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:11.520
Right.

417
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.980
Jessica Freeman: Darwinism right

418
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.790
Yep.

419
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi, in a little town in Oregon that I moved from they

420
00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Went in one week to having like five cases to having 40 some odd cases, you know, that just that fast, and they haven't even opened up.

421
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their small businesses or downtown. It's a tourist town. They had a rally this past weekend people from Portland, which is about 80 miles away, which you know all the tourists from Portland always go to the coast.

422
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.080
And

423
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:57.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They had this rally to open everything up and the rally turned out to be less people attending attending them what the person holding it thought it was going to be

424
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:08.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And this part, I thought was pretty funny. But the city's response to knowing this rally was coming was to close all the public bathrooms.

425
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.690
Jessica Freeman: Oh, you told me about this last

426
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.590

Jessica Freeman: That's friggin hassanein

428
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just thought that that was

429
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.320
Jessica Freeman: No. Okay.

430
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Horrible. But after this rally happens, then they push out this

431
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know it was a flop. You know, there might have been 20 or 30 people at this rally, but

432
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:30.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh god.

433
00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:41.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, total flop and of course people that live in seaside were, you know, rallying and picketing, the people that were there from the, from the city saying go home. What are you doing,

434
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

435
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:50.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What a cluster. It was good. Yeah, just watching it, because that's all I got to do is watch it from afar, but

436
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: they wound up going from four or five cases to 40 some odd cases.

437
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And you know a lot of people are saying, well, that's bullcrap because you knew that either you were already had those 45 cases and hadn't announced it already, or you're taking it using

438
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:14.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The rally that just happened a week ago when symptoms don't come for 14 days and trying to say this is why you know what I mean.

439
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.210
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

440
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All that mind.

441
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.510
Jessica Freeman: Taking it and politicizing and

442
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:37.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally. You know, and you'll see that with you, you know, watch the news all the time. You'll you can start to identify that that's what's happening in a lot of areas, you know, the media is taken and running with it. You don't know what to believe. If I don't get it from the CDC.

443
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's questionable to me, you know,

444
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:49.200
Jessica Freeman: Did you read that letter the Trump wrote to the World Health Organization.

445
00:42:49.830 --> 00:43:01.350
Jessica Freeman: Ah, OK. So he has withdrawn funding from the World Health Organization because and there was like four pages of facts cited

446
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:18.930
Jessica Freeman: That that the World Health Organization is basically taking its lead from China and there hasn't been like accurate reporting and I don't know, there's a little thing, but it's a four page letter and Trump is giving them 30 days.

447
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:29.640
Jessica Freeman: To show that their interests are aligned with, you know, the world rather than just one country and, if not, then the US will withdraw its membership.

448
00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

449
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.700
Jessica Freeman: So I know I read that and

450
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:49.410
Jessica Freeman: I don't know what the truth behind anything is because our media is so slanted who knows and then China. Their, their media is state run so accurate information. I don't know if anybody really

451
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:50.520
Yeah.

452
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. And that's the concept that I stay with

453
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:57.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

454
00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:05.220
Jessica Freeman: It's just I try not to follow too much, but sometimes something interesting happening we sweatshirt maybe

455
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.670
Jessica Freeman: Got a little chilly in here real quick.

456
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.470
Here sweeping

457
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:12.960
Jessica Freeman: Here.

458
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.950
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, what time is it 915 minutes

459
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:30.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what you think about some of the things that you want to put on your list for this week.

460
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.690
Jessica Freeman: Well,

461
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:47.640
Jessica Freeman: I don't know, like I feel like it's already a good list or just maintain that list and you know keep going with it.

462
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:48.720
Jessica Freeman: I feel like that would be

463
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, yeah, keep expanding on what you've already started.

464
00:44:53.250 --> 00:45:02.220
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, you know, give myself a little more time to accomplish some more stuff on the list and kind of get into good groove and

465
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.750
Jessica Freeman: I don't know, I feel like like the list is good. What do you think

466
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:23.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think the list is good too. And I think that if you just continue to work on it you know you know as well as I do. We were not going to do everything on our list their goals and goals can be changed and expanded, you know, that's the great part about it.

467
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.240
Jessica Freeman: Is

468
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.540
Jessica Freeman: The list has a lot on it. Not only do I have

469
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.640
Jessica Freeman: Self care stuff on my to do list.

470
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.960
Jessica Freeman: It as fast as it, you know, gets done like it still

471
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.380

Jessica Freeman: Yeah. Well, somebody have

477

478
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:18.840
Jessica Freeman: Mattress

479
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.300
Jessica Freeman: Protector yeah

480
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've committed yourself to

481
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing a meeting on Wednesday night, holding it being the facilitator.

482
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.840
Jessica Freeman: It's actually Wednesdays.

483
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:49.230
Jessica Freeman: At 10 o'clock. My time am and it's noon being from from Indianapolis that I used to go

484
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:52.410
Jessica Freeman: Tonight. Yeah, the room where I got sober.

485
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's pretty amazing. Huh.

486
00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:06.090
Jessica Freeman: It is. It's great. And I don't think they're going to reopen the church until you know maybe August, which is cool because everybody that wants to go to that meeting will still do it on zoom. Yeah.

487
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:32.310
Jessica Freeman: That's what's up. Oh, I ordered some some masks, like a six pack of masks from FC, and I hope that I did that I chose well because like I wanted it to be safe, but also breathable, because I have a hard time with stuff over my face. I just don't breathe. So they should be here soon.

488
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See, that's good.

489
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I don't like having to wear a mask.

490
00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.460
Jessica Freeman: Nobody does. But you know, it's just what we have to do right now.

491
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:45.120
Yeah.

492
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:48.870
Jessica Freeman: There's just no way around it.

493
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.440
Jessica Freeman: Protect protect me protect the ones I love and then protect the at risk.

494
00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People in the community. Very much so. I agree.

495
00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I agree. So we were on when we leave, we were in when we're supposed to

496
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.690
Jessica Freeman: You know, and I don't wear them at home.

497
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:13.050
Jessica Freeman: I don't want them in the car. Unless I'm somewhere to pick something up and you know I'm interacting with someone then offered on

498
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.240
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

499
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:17.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm doing the same thing, same protected.

500
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:31.440
Jessica Freeman: It's super weird. I know it's, I mean it's weird, but like I was one of the first people that started wearing masks at the grocery store and I felt, you know, kind of dumb, but now it's like, Don't be that guy.

501
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:33.900
Jessica Freeman: Without the mask.

502
00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:39.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right now it's the norm. Who would have thought in the very beginning that that would have been the case.

503
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:52.320
Jessica Freeman: And it might stay that way, like maybe a part of our culture will change now i mean i don't i don't know maybe once there's, you know, once it's handled and there's a vaccine and you know people are

504
00:48:53.610 --> 00:49:00.510
Jessica Freeman: It's prevented and nobody has it anymore. It's gone, then maybe not. But still, there'll be something else that comes along.

505
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.830
Jessica Freeman: showing her it's going to things are permanently changed, I think. Yeah.

506
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do too. We have to figure out and adjust to the new normal whatever that's going to look like.

507
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:15.210
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I think there's going to be a few versions of the new normal.

508
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. And we can only like run towards it and not be afraid of it, because it is what it is. And we don't have the power to change it anyways.

509
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.490
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, only control what I can control.

510
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:30.180
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. And really, that's my own actions and attitudes.

511
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and your thought process around it.

512
00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that really looks like, you know what I mean.

513
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:39.870
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I really liked what you share today, I'm going to download that I'm going to use it.

514
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They definitely helps.

515
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm finding for myself that it is definitely helping I'm in a better headspace during the day I can

516
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: definitely look at today in a more positive manner. You know, I feel the difference. And that's why I wanted to share it.

517
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:10.110
Jessica Freeman: I can tell, like you're all happy and I don't know, you look good today like really on top of shit right I ready to conquer the world.

518
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I feel

519
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I just think when you feel when you add fuel to yourself.

520
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just allows you to accept what is, you know,

521
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.220
Jessica Freeman: I like it. I'm gonna try it.

522
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Good. I'm glad.

523
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:32.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's important you know that we build ourselves up instead of tearing ourselves down

524
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.180
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

525
00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:37.830
Jessica Freeman: And also to take that same approach with with other women, you know, build each other up.

526
00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:49.740
Jessica Freeman: But instead of tearing each other down remind you know remind ourselves and our friends and the people in, you know, whatever the people out there doing what they got to do, like, you know, you're valued.

527
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:50.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know,

528
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.520
Jessica Freeman: You're confident and you have a lot to offer.

529
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.050
Jessica Freeman: Even we

530
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:55.950
Jessica Freeman: Don't feel like it.

531
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:57.750
Jessica Freeman: Very much so.

532
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's hard when you have

533
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When the message that you've heard through every relationship. Even as a kid is that you're not good enough. You're the problem. You know what I mean in to change that in adulthood and to actually see that everything you've been told and programmed to believe about yourself as live

534
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:20.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

535
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:26.730
Jessica Freeman: Yeah rewiring your brain changing your system. It's big stuff.

536
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:36.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. It really, really is very much so. Okay, so you're going to read, you're going to implement the acceptance statements into your daily schedule.

537
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:37.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep.

538
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the morning. Can you dance in and out, love.
