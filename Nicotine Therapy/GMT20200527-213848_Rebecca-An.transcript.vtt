00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.050
Emery Kerby: Hello.

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well hello, how are you

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.559
Emery Kerby: I'm good, how are you

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.379
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am good. How is everything going

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something happened.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There you go. Wait.

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.770
Emery Kerby: I'm really quick. So

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't hear you.

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.990
Emery Kerby: Oh, is that better.

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.830
Yeah.

13
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.300
Emery Kerby: Sorry about that.

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.500
That's okay.

16
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:58.170
Emery Kerby: I was not able to get the book yet because I went to check my account to see if I had money for it and I had three charges on my account that weren't authorized. So I called the bank and he told me I had to cancel my debit card.

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.220
Emery Kerby: So they just. That's why I came over to my mom's house today because it just got in the mail, so I'll have to order that today, and then

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.300
Emery Kerby: We can start working on that next week. So I'm sorry about that, but

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. It happens.

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.570
Emery Kerby: You know where

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.870
Emery Kerby: I don't know how they. It was weird. It's like Microsoft charges, but I don't have anything

22
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:32.460
Emery Kerby: For Microsoft. The only thing my husband thought was about a laptop back in January and then I returned it. And I did like a trial thing to get like the office.

23
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:43.950
Emery Kerby: For it. But I thought I cleared everything off of the laptop. When I returned it. But I did it myself. So I you know I don't know if I mess anything up. But so they just had like three different charges for the for

24
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.280
Emery Kerby: Microsoft on there so they had to

25
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.050
Emery Kerby: Cancel my debit card and send a new one, which took forever so

26
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah, I love that. I just had to recently do that too. So, I get it.

27
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.020
Emery Kerby: Yeah, weird. I never had that happen before but I call my dad and it's happened to him quite a few times, he said.

28
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:17.610
Emery Kerby: People get his card information. So that was a little weird but they got it all figured out. I'm still waiting for the process, the claim. So the charges are still on there, but they're working on it.

29
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.460
Emery Kerby: I guess to figure out where it came from. And then they'll take it off. So I think it just takes some time.

30
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

31
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.750
Emery Kerby: To do that. But anyways, I got it today activated the card, so I'll be able to order that today when I get home.

32
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.100
Tool.

33
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um. How was your week

34
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.600
Emery Kerby: Um, it's been kind of stressful. I've been

35
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.770
Emery Kerby: Having a lot of anxiety, but I, I know it's a little TMI, but I started my period today so

36
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.310
Emery Kerby: I think that that has a lot to do with it. I

37
00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:05.640
Emery Kerby: Since I've had my daughter, my hormones have been kind of crazy and before the pandemic my doctor is actually having me do like a bunch of ultrasounds and blood work and all that stuff. I think you've heard about that in group a few times but yeah

38
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.720
Emery Kerby: Since the virus thing happened. I haven't been able to go get anything done to find out some answers. So

39
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.400
Emery Kerby: I actually thought I was pregnant, a couple times, but I think it's just whatever is going on with my hormones. It's making me have like pregnancy symptoms.

40
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:33.570
Emery Kerby: Because I, you know, obviously, I'm still getting my periods and pregnancy tests are negative. So it's not that. But I've got some kind of, you know, crazy wires going on so

41
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.060
Emery Kerby: My emotions have been all over the place and my

42
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.070
Emery Kerby: Cravings have increased with those

43
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.450
Emery Kerby: Because, you know, it's usually just something I always fall back on if I if I'm struggling that much.

44
00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:04.890
Emery Kerby: It's just weird to me because I've never been eight months clean at the actually I'm going on, nine months now in a couple days, I've never it's never been that long and

45
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:17.820
Emery Kerby: So I guess I'm just scared. I'm worried that I'm going to have a breaking point. At some point, because I've just been doing so well almost with no hiccups as far as wanting to use

46
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me.

47
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:31.230
Emery Kerby: So I feel like this is almost the first time i've i've really struggled with it, if that makes sense. It's kind of my thoughts. So now that I'm hitting these roadblocks. I'm, I'm just getting a little nervous about it so

48
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.580
Emery Kerby: I'm kind of don't know how to deal with it.

49
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:51.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just gotta keep doing what you're, you know, doing what you're doing and just kind of know you know you have to tell yourself to that I'm going to get this checked out. It's going to happen. I'm going to see what's going on.

50
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you just got to keep reiterating that to yourself.

51
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Through this process. So you figure until your doctor can get you in the figure out what's going on, you know,

52
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, remember that.

53
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A trigger is a thought and a craving can be controlled.

54
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there's a beginning.

55
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: middle and an end to that.

56
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and

57
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's about voicing it in the universe. And then, you know, doing everything you can to get out of that headspace if you have that catastrophic thinking that you're going to have a, you know, you're gonna have a breakdown. It's going to happen. You know what I mean. Then you will

58
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Subconscious subconsciously you'll push yourself to that if you take away that thought and just say, you know what today's today's gonna be a good day.

59
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.630
Emery Kerby: And you just bring yourself back to right now.

60
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Today, okay.

61
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.930
Emery Kerby: Like forcing

62
00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:04.020
Emery Kerby: That until you really feel like it takes over. And that's your truth for that. Yeah, because I I think I just got caught and kind of a hard spot because

63
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:16.020
Emery Kerby: You know, normally, I'm not even really around it, other than when I have to pick it up from my mom and they were really good about making sure I didn't have to do that. But you know when my dad's out of town. It's like, there really isn't any other option.

64
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.520
Emery Kerby: Right. But my husband hurt his back. And so my mom had offered, but I was kind of the middleman.

65
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:34.500
Emery Kerby: In that, and they had done that once before and it didn't bother me at all. So I was like, Okay, I'm good with this, but this time it did bother me so

66
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.510
Emery Kerby: I think because like I had to hand it to him. And then I told him, let me leave the room. I didn't want him to take it in front of me.

67
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.900
Emery Kerby: Because I was trying to set boundaries. But I like went in the bathroom and out of total meltdown, because I just

68
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.570
Emery Kerby: I didn't think it was going to be that hard, and then

69
00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:04.020
Emery Kerby: I felt bad because like you know he's taking it because he's in a lot of pain and he can't get into the doctor and he still has to go to work. He can't call in and so I know it was helping him in it.

70
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.420
Emery Kerby: It was because he's he's hurting, he's in pain. He's not using it to us like I would

71
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.250
Emery Kerby: Imagine, so I was trying to make that difference in my mind and

72
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:25.200
Emery Kerby: So that's why I just went ahead and went through it. But then, you know, I came over here to see my mom yesterday, too, because I thought my debit card was going to come in yesterday and

73
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.930
Emery Kerby: She said she had two more. But I said I didn't want to do that. So I told her no and then she was able to give me this cream.

74
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:42.510
Emery Kerby: For his back in his neck and I put that on him last night and he said that it helped him a lot like even better than the pain medication did so.

75
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:53.610
Emery Kerby: I was happy because then we found a way that when his back in that clear up or whatever we can just use that stuff and not have to worry about the medicine anymore so

76
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.200
Emery Kerby: That was good, but it's just still, you know, just kind of been a roller coaster with

77
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:10.200
Emery Kerby: emotions and moods my moods, or excuse me, switching a lot

78
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:24.360
Emery Kerby: I was doing pretty good about being able to stay stable in my mood, at least for an entire day. You know, I was either having a pretty good day or not a good day. But now it's kind of pretty good our not a good

79
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.710
Our kind of thing.

80
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:45.510
Emery Kerby: And I'm not. I used to be on a lot of psych meds for my be PT and bipolar and I'm not on anything right now. So usually when I start to get bad like this and I can't manage it on my own. That's when I end up seeing a psychiatrist and getting on medication.

81
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.360
Emery Kerby: And I had a

82
00:08:49.800 --> 00:09:08.400
Emery Kerby: Think it was like three or four months ago I was struggling really bad and I made I called to make appointments, but they were so booked out my I just check my calendar today because I was seeing what time are meeting was and I have a psychiatry appointment on the ninth of June.

83
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.920
Emery Kerby: That I had made months ago. So I have one.

84
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.110
Emery Kerby: coming up really soon. So

85
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:22.650
Emery Kerby: Obviously I have to see what's okay with Dr. PACHTER and what's ok for the psychiatrists for me to

86
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:30.180
Emery Kerby: Beyond, but I know just from past experiences that Prozac tends to work really well for me.

87
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:41.280
Emery Kerby: Um, so as long as it doesn't interfere with my soapbox and I think I'm gonna, I just need a little extra help. I feel keeping me stable and

88
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:53.580
Emery Kerby: Getting my depression under control. I did good today and yesterday I was cleaning, which when I'm depressed. I don't do that.

89
00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:11.010
Emery Kerby: And if something comes up. That is an inconvenience. I just use that as an excuse, but like my vacuum cleaner was all busted and broken and wasn't working. And I took that whole thing apart yesterday to fix it. So I can vacuum my floors.

90
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.810
Emery Kerby: And

91
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:23.760
Emery Kerby: It was a nightmare, because it was just hair was wrapped all around thing. And there was huge clogs my daughter's like climbing all over me while I'm trying to get it all done.

92
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:41.940
Emery Kerby: And I pulled a hose out to get the clock out and it just goes everywhere all over my sure all over the table. I just cleaned off like I wanted to cry. But I stuck to it and got it all cleaned out, put the vacuum cleaner back together and then cleaned up the whole mess so

93
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:53.820
Emery Kerby: I felt proud of myself. So I feel like that helped me kind of continue being active and still cleaning today. It just, I know kind of gave me like a second wind to just keep going.

94
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.320
Emery Kerby: And that stuff like staying busy that helps a lot. So, um,

95
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:10.050
Emery Kerby: Yeah, I just, I came over here to get my card. And then it helps my mom will watch my daughter so we could talk. So I'm not trying to chase her and and

96
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.140
Emery Kerby: get distracted, but

97
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable. Definitely. And if something happens, you know, I think that we have psychologists to

98
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:23.970
Emery Kerby: Help

99
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:35.370
Emery Kerby: Yeah okay because I noticed I my, on my calendar. It says psych and the time, but it doesn't say who it is. So I'm gonna have to do some investigating and

100
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.490
Emery Kerby: Try remember who I made that appointment.

101
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.960
Emery Kerby: So if I can't figure that out. I'll let you know and see if we can. I can get an appointment with somebody, cuz

102
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:55.170
Emery Kerby: I do enjoy the online thing. I'm not good at making physical appointments, a lot. I have a problem with that. And I always have, but

103
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.850
Emery Kerby: Doing it online is just a lot easier. I don't have to worry about.

104
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.080
Emery Kerby: Anything that's going on. Just as long as I have my phone so

105
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:06.840
Emery Kerby: Yeah.

106
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I encourage you to talk to Dr. PACHTER to about it and he might have some suggestions.

107
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, as well. You know, I'm, I'm not going to speak for him, but he may be able to, I don't know for sure, be able to prescribe you Prozac, you know, until

108
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can get into. See this like to

109
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:37.950
Emery Kerby: Okay, it wasn't. I know he's helped some people out with different medications for, like, you know, I just didn't know what his limits weren't stuff.

110
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:49.080
Emery Kerby: I just don't. Sometimes I can go through things and be okay. But it's been a cycle in my life where I always hit this wall.

111
00:12:50.640 --> 00:13:05.580
Emery Kerby: When I lived up north. My son went to his dad's every summer. And almost every summer I would check into an inpatient hospital because I needed that extra care. I would hold myself together as best I could all year and

112
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.860
Emery Kerby: Then also, my son, not being with me because he was my only child. At that time I had a really hard time with him leaving so

113
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:26.190
Emery Kerby: You know, and I've had like a couple attempts in the past and stuff. So it was kind of just as a safety thing to make sure I was going to be okay. But since moving down here. I haven't had any

114
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.140
Emery Kerby: Mental Health support. I had a huge system of North

115
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:42.450
Emery Kerby: Between the inpatient hospitals and I did outpatient therapy to I would do that for months and that was like a nine to five job, Monday through Friday. You had to be there.

116
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:52.770
Emery Kerby: To do the group therapy. So I feel like I went from all of that to nothing here and I've been here almost three years now so

117
00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.090
Emery Kerby: You know, and a lot of different life changes. I have a husband down and another child and

118
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.970
Emery Kerby: All that kind of stuff. So I just, I'm recognizing that I am

119
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.620
Emery Kerby: Excited, aside from maybe finding out medically what's going on with me.

120
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.820
Emery Kerby: I'm reaching that kind of that wall again so

121
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.610
Emery Kerby: I'm just trying to figure out what kind of steps I can take before anything

122
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:34.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Happens, you know, yeah, being proactive with it, which is really cool, you know that you're able to do that. You can identify when you need that added support and able to, you know, utilize what you have available. Definitely.

123
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:35.730
Yeah.

124
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was wondering if I should email Dr factor and asked him if he can do a metal valuation with you.

125
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

126
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get you in to see him.

127
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

128
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.980
Emery Kerby: Yeah, that would be good.

129
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.000
Okay.

130
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give me one second. And I will

131
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on one second.

132
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, so

133
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I sent him an email and

134
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't see him on right now. But it doesn't mean that he's not

135
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:57.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here.

136
00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

137
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm hoping that I'll get a response from him. And, you know, if I definitely if I don't he, I know he would have checked my email, and we can touch base with him on Friday. If nothing else,

138
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.310
Emery Kerby: Okay, yeah.

139
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:12.330
Emery Kerby: Yeah, we'll be

140
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.650
Emery Kerby: Done to him in a couple days.

141
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so, um, let's see what we can do, you know, to help you through this, this piece.

142
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:28.440
Emery Kerby: That would be awesome. Yeah. That just I know I've had to go through. I don't know. Gamma is the right word, but, you know, they

143
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:42.990
Emery Kerby: prescribed me all kinds of different medications and I then at some point say me on like nine different things I'd have to take every day and I really didn't enjoy that. Especially when you start getting side effects. You don't know what it's from

144
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:43.980
Yeah.

145
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:56.340
Emery Kerby: But I had before I moved down here, I just kind of had, I think it was like four different medications that worked really well for me, even though a lot of them were kind of old school.

146
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:03.030
Emery Kerby: Me, but I know Prozac was just the best thing as far as the

147
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.450
Emery Kerby: Depression and keeping me motivated

148
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.100
Emery Kerby: They also have me on like family on lithium, which

149
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:19.830
Emery Kerby: I maybe I can talk to Dr. Proctor about it. I'm if there's a medication that similar that's not

150
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:32.400
Emery Kerby: That one because there's two weeks where I'll be so tired like there's no way I would be able to watch my daughter while I start the lithium.

151
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For whatever reason, it's

152
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.820
Emery Kerby: You know, the first two weeks, getting adjusted to it. I'm

153
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.360
Emery Kerby: Want to sleep all day and then you have to watch your sodium like crazy, which is really hard for me because

154
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:55.140
Emery Kerby: You know I get like swollen and shaky and all that but it works amazing for to stabilize my moods. It's just the side effects of it I guess they're just really

155
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:04.920
Emery Kerby: Kind of crazy. So maybe he might have some ideas on something that would, you know, work and not be that bad.

156
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, he just responded back and said, yes, we can, she said. He said, We'll schedule it on Friday. So when you see him on Friday. You guys will schedule an appointment for you to be able to meet with him and talk about it. Okay.

157
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.110
Emery Kerby: Okay, cool. Yeah, I work good. Yeah.

158
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

159
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:31.140
Emery Kerby: Yeah, I really do like it. I actually, no, no, this is allowed. So just let me know if it's not, but I

160
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:44.130
Emery Kerby: Have a couple of groups that I'm in for addiction and I recommended bright heart health to some people. So just because I really enjoy you guys and I think everybody does a really great job and

161
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:52.800
Emery Kerby: The support has always been there and he's so easy to work with and talk to. So I've had a couple people that weren't really

162
00:19:53.460 --> 00:20:03.930
Emery Kerby: Either they were looking for a clinic or somewhere because they didn't have one or they didn't like the experience. They were getting. So I've always told people just to check them out. I don't know. You know, insurance wise or anything like that but

163
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:12.270
Emery Kerby: I always recommend it to people because I think it's, you guys have a really good thing going on for us.

164
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:22.920
Emery Kerby: Especially in this pandemic, where we get, you know, not to leave our house to be able to still get service. I think that that's really, really good.

165
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. And there's nothing wrong with it. Don't worry, definitely, you know, totally fine. I think it's great that we've been able to provide you know and meet your needs.

166
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love when that can happen. You know what I mean. So

167
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. There's not a problem with that. No big deal.

168
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And Dr. Factor is very easy to work with. Isn't he

169
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:58.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know I. He's amazing. I haven't found a whole lot of doctors that I've worked with because I work with several through bright heart with groups and stuff.

170
00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.160
Emery Kerby: And

171
00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think I've met one that I

172
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Struggled with, you know,

173
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.590
Emery Kerby: Yeah.

174
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're all it's pretty amazing.

175
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:07.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then

176
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:22.800
Emery Kerby: My status struggle with Dr. Sometimes I mean I've all hasn't been and like the addiction side of things, but just with my physical or mental health. I've seen a lot of different doctors and some just do not have the best bedside manner or

177
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.870
Emery Kerby: They're not really

178
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:35.400
Emery Kerby: Compassionate. You know, so it's nice when you when you come across somebody that actually you know that they care and they do their best. I think that that's

179
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.310
Emery Kerby: That's awesome. That's why I think I got really heated and one of the groups when I felt, one of the

180
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:55.320
Emery Kerby: Other patients were kind of coming at him long, so I was a little worked up with that but you know people have their bad days. And sometimes you take it out on all people so that happens but

181
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.060
Emery Kerby: Yeah, I like I like our little group.

182
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.640
Emery Kerby: I wasn't another one. I think I was going on Tuesday nights.

183
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:16.950
Emery Kerby: Where there was just some patients in there. I didn't really a one one guy was just very triggering for me so I had to switch

184
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.050
Emery Kerby: Think that's what happens. So I've been enjoying the group that we have. I like

185
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:28.590
Emery Kerby: I think we got some more people coming in. Recently, I think I've seen a couple new faces.

186
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.070
Emery Kerby: Yeah, just good because I mean they'll bring in a different

187
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:39.420
Emery Kerby: aspect to the group and stuff, but I think I related a lot with the females in there too so

188
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.010
Emery Kerby: Yeah.

189
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.200
Emery Kerby: I'm glad I have this support.

190
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely it's good. Okay, so

191
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Next week we'll work out. We'll start working on

192
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: ISS internal family systems.

193
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, really start diving into it and understand

194
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what the program is about and how it can identify each of our parts internal

195
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.910
Emery Kerby: Yes, I

196
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:21.090
Emery Kerby: Will start my timer for that. I'm sorry. I was, I was really amped up to be able to do it. You know, I should have just called and let you know my card was

197
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.540
Emery Kerby: Cancelled. And then I had to wait for an I just didn't pay at told them I paid for two to three day shipping.

198
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:37.560
Emery Kerby: And that's why I was over, when I came here yesterday because I realized Sunday was gonna mess me up and then memorial day Monday.

199
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:47.070
Emery Kerby: But I thought for sure I would have been able to get it yesterday in the mail. I wouldn't be able to just do the Kindle thing and read through the first chapter. Last night or

200
00:23:47.100 --> 00:24:00.510
Emery Kerby: This morning so and it didn't come yesterday, I called the bank and they said it was even in the ladies notes to do the expedited shipping, but for whatever reason it didn't because they didn't even charge you $25 to

201
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.980
Emery Kerby: Have it shipped. So he was telling me my card was me. I'm going to be here until Monday.

202
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:10.170
Emery Kerby: But my mom just happened to call me today. And she said she check the mail this afternoon, and it was here. So,

203
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:16.110
Emery Kerby: I activated it. And so we're ready to go order it when I get home and

204
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.950
Emery Kerby: So you want me to read the first chapter.

205
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.760
Emery Kerby: Mm hmm.

206
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before we get next week.

207
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:22.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

208
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.660
Emery Kerby: Yeah, I can ended up

209
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:42.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And even if you don't have it. If you don't have it by next week. I still want to meet with you just to check in with you to see where you're at, to see how things are especially if you meet with Dr. Dr. On Friday, and you begin any new meds. We want to be consistent. Right.

210
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We want to make sure that year. Okay. And do a check in. Okay.

211
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

212
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I wouldn't, but I think it'll be here.

213
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.840
Emery Kerby: I would like to

214
00:24:53.130 --> 00:25:08.700
Emery Kerby: Just at some point. I don't know if it's okay, good. I guess it's not really addiction related. I mean other than it's kind of a trigger. But just my, I need to kind of talk out my husband's infidelity or whatever you want to call it to

215
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.110
Emery Kerby: Be kind of sign up, we can kind of throw that in there. Next week if we have some time.

216
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.190
Emery Kerby: This is, I feel like that's

217
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.230
Emery Kerby: Kind of AMP or making things worse.

218
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.090
Emery Kerby: You know, just because it's still in the back of my mind. I'm not over it and I need to figure out how to get over it.

219
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.620
Emery Kerby: So, and I feel like that was free me up a lot in my recovery. So

220
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.390
Emery Kerby: If you can just kind of put that on the table, maybe next week.

221
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, I would help a lot too. So

222
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.430
Emery Kerby: Yes.

223
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.690
Most definitely.

224
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.940
Emery Kerby: Okay, what you want to do, same time, I think that have you long

225
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.940
Emery Kerby: Um, he said, for five weeks. I think it's Wednesdays or 230

226
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I asked them to put you on, let me take a look

227
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I have you 230 on the third

228
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's the same time next week.

229
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and we will definitely start diving into the stuff. Okay.

230
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.110
Emery Kerby: Okay.
