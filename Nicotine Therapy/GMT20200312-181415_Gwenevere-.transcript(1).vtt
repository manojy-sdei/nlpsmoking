5
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.680
Bianca: Sorry, I was a little lost. I woke up and I was like, do I do the virtual clinic or do I log in quickly. I was like,

6
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.550
Bianca: And then I finally went into the virtual clinic.

7
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're okay. We're okay. I ended up taking an extra few minutes. There was a lot of people in group just now. So I kind of took me so it was the timing seemed to work out.

8
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Alright, so what do you have going on over there. Are you having a little breakfast What is that you waking up.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Major changes.

15
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.210
Bianca: In your

16
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.050
Life right now.

17
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.930
Bianca: No. Okay.

18
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I just I just remembered something you said it just struck me, I just remember, I was thinking about that activity.

19
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Around you know volunteering.

20
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And

21
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was like, I remember you saying something like

22
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I correct me if I'm wrong by swear it was like

23
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to meet people.

24
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.320
Bianca: A YC that for the friends for friends.

25
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. Tell me more about that.

26
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:21.150
Bianca: Ah, not that I don't want to meet him. I just not interested, like in in people's drama or, you know, just I have enough with my life that I can't deal with anybody else's life right now.

27
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.010
Bianca: And I haven't had friends in a long time. Like I

28
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:37.680
Bianca: Like I have but i i'm not in a few years, like I just haven't it or not. Those kinds of friendships actually those friendships are more like a, you know, with the you seeing in the using and stuff so

29
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.860
Bianca: I don't have any like friend moms like you know that are dedicated like I have to my family and stuff so I haven't met people like that yet.

30
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.500
Bianca: And I just moved from January to Albuquerque, a year and a half ago as well so

31
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What friends can be kind of cool because sometimes our stressors Bianca can be with our husband, it can be with our right, our mom or dad, they can be with our family and it's nice to be able to get perspective and kind of vent even a little bit. Some people get different perspective.

32
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And but I hear you. I remember because right I had said, Well, does this seem like a motivator, or does this not seem like a motivator and making friends, for example, is not a motivator for you.

33
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:39.780
Bianca: Yeah, yeah. Well, usually my stressful times I like to stick to myself or get a break from them, like the kids has been and I will go do like were shopping. My Therapy shopping retail therapy.

34
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapy.

35
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.110
Bianca: That's what I like to do watch you, I got you now.

36
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that come from.

37
00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a place of betrayal, like there was a group of people and they teased you they wrong do in some way. Does it come from that kind of history or you've always been someone that sort of refuels quietly on her own.

38
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.890
Bianca: Yeah, no. Uh, no, it's not from friends at all. Yeah, it's just I guess it's just a

39
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.810
Bianca: Mechanism. I don't know my own since like I don't have friends. I mean, my friends were not good influences back then, they were all because we were using together. Those are the friends.

40
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:36.240
Bianca: Like I said, I don't have friend moms that are so bird dedicated phone, you know, stuff like that. And we'll have that. And I never had that it's always been the other stuff. So I guess I just built a thing on my own on my own.

41
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And what what might be something that would motivate you, like if you were to, I know you won't do it now because of the coronavirus I remember that part two. But, um, if you were to volunteer like of all the list of seven things. Was there one that you thought

42
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Reason.

43
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.020
Bianca: Um,

44
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:13.410
Bianca: Well, I'm not sure, but maybe maybe uh maybe like just, um, those stories like like Goodwill's and stuff like that.

45
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.030
Bianca: But really I haven't thought about it, to be honest.

46
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.020
Bianca: Other than that, that's like all that came to my mind. But other than that, I don't know what else I could do

47
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.800
Okay.

48
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:42.180
Bianca: And I would say like you know the the homes elder homes, but then they're more prone to coronavirus oh

49
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.170
Bianca: Was that

50
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It really is, you know, they're already so vulnerable or thing.

51
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see.

52
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Learn to cope and manage feeling

53
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.280
Manage feelings and life without prescriptions. Okay.

54
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one of your goals. That's a big one, too. That's an important one. Now that's the core of everything that everybody's up here. Right. It's learning how to cope without

55
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.110
Bianca: Substance, yeah.

56
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And has it been so long.

57
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: what that's like.

58
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.460
Bianca: Yeah.

59
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.690
Yeah.

60
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you were a teenager and

61
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: We started with

62
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, and it's been so long forgotten kind of who you are around feelings.

63
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.780
Bianca: Maybe possibly

64
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.210
Bianca: Thought about it.

65
00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:04.200
Bianca: Or maybe I just have to realize because I haven't really thought to that. But, you know, it could be possible. I'm not sure I haven't really looked at myself like that.

66
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've kept yourself so busy.

67
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Time for self reflection.

68
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.180
Bianca: Yeah, sure.

69
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you have an older child that would allow you to

70
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Go and have some privacy.

71
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.670
Bianca: And be really hard to be

72
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.040
Bianca: Sorry, you're like cutting out a little bit.

73
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I was wondering if you could go somewhere.

74
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:54.000
Bianca: Oh, is it is it loud. Okay. Sorry, I just, I usually go to my restroom, but I need to go get a light bulb. So it was like a little arm was a little dark, but let's see, I do have a lot in there, but I need a new light bulb. And that's usually where I go. Okay.

75
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.120
Bianca: That's like the quiet place cuz

76
00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.580
Bianca: All right, let's see.

77
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.040
Bianca: Alrighty.

78
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.120
Bianca: I didn't realize how loud in the background. I got I got there.

79
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Your use you're used to so much

80
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.360
Bianca: Yeah, yeah. I guess you're right. Excuse me.

81
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:47.850
Bianca: Yeah, I guess you're right that I don't even. I guess I block out a lot of steps. That's a lot of moms do you block them out sometimes

82
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you noticed that you had a chance to use the belly breathing.

83
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.760
Bianca: Yeah, I've been using it every week. Yeah.

84
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a story of a time you used it and what it was like for you.

85
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:26.640
Bianca: Um, well, the other day, they might my husband and my daughter both like woke up throwing up in the middle of the night.

86
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:36.330
Bianca: And I mean she couldn't go to school. So it was that morning it was at early is like four or five in the morning when they start throwing up

87
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:49.770
Bianca: And then we try to go to bed a little bit more because they were exactly. Well, when I woke up, I felt like so stressed over it and sad and feel so well. So I did the breathing before we left to school. Wow. And

88
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the outcome of that.

89
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.200
Bianca: I helped out a lot. Yeah.

90
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you notice that you did it. You cycled through how many times two times three times five times, how many do you think

91
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.600
Bianca: It was like five times. Okay.

92
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.850
Bianca: It was enough.

93
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly and

94
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Afterwards, maybe, where's your brain able to work a little better. We were more patient able to solve whatever's going on.

95
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:36.240
Bianca: Yeah, I was definitely relaxed me quickly like I yeah and I was able to think and, you know, the stress level went down.

96
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did is what we call a bottom up intervention, right, the visceral up versus changing your thinking, which is a really useful one to

97
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to teach you another bottom up intervention. Before we get into some of the cognitive ones because these are so convenient and they work so far.

98
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I teach you one more.

99
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.400
Sure.

100
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This one is

101
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes you guys forget this one.

102
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I should like it.

103
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: This one is called grounding in the five senses. I call it that. Anyway, it comes out in this model called dialectical behavior therapy and

104
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to explain it. I'm going to show a little poster and we'll

105
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

106
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And then like everything you personalize it you you do your own kind of thing to it and like I have the way this poster is that I'm going to share with you.

107
00:11:48.930 --> 00:12:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even do it this way. I kind of make it my own. But first, give it a try. Just the way I'm going to kind of instruct it just to see if you like it, and then you can kind of modify it and do it do it your own kind of style.

108
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So I see if I can find it. Hold on to nose can do that, let me just write crowned king. There it is. Okay.

109
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty much what what you think it's grounding and the five senses mean side from the six cents, which

110
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everybody's got that one.

111
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So grounding in the five senses, is this. It's basically when we're in a stress thought, let's say,

112
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness, I have two children sick. I need to do this. And now I have all these

113
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Things to do. I'm feeling helpless. I'm feeling stress. You can use this

114
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:44.880
Bianca: Field.

115
00:12:44.940 --> 00:13:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Around it again. And this is kind of what it would look like you would around you. So right now you have some items in your bathroom right you have toothbrush. She might have a hairbrush. She might have. So washcloth you probably have some things on the counter. Right.

116
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And she grabbed one of them.

117
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.000
Bianca: Anything.

118
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The more

119
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of funky almost better which is which.

120
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.430
Bianca: Oh, I got my first solid liquid glass.

121
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds good. I like it. So I'm going to show you how I do it. And then maybe we'll use that item when you do it. Okay. Okay.

122
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what it basically is

123
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice poster says when we want to do this grounding exercise and grounding means getting back in your body. We're not up in our head. We're not completely hijacked by our emotions.

124
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This is an exercise that can get you just like the breathing back into your body and help you feel calm. So you look around, just as you did you pick up that I am using stare at it and you use adjectives.

125
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:55.710
Bianca: Call it

126
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.090
Bianca: Oil basically

127
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The things that you see, I'm going to do for you here. Um,

128
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, first, I'm just going to say where you're reading here. So it's going to be five things you see four things you feel with your

129
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Fingers three things that you hear with your ears.

130
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Things you smell. One thing you taste.

131
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, does that make sense. Like, that's what we'll do. We'll be saying

132
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.200
Bianca: Five things

133
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We see with our eyes. We're not going to label it. We're not going to call it pin. That's an interpretation. We're going to call it black move

134
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Shiny you see the difference.

135
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.380
Bianca: Mm hmm.

136
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Our creativity stops when we call it a label pen.

137
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not what this is for. We've got to actually not label it.

138
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Give it more time the data coming through our eyes. So I'm going to stop sharing here so you can actually see what I'm doing. Okay.

139
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.110
Or yeah

140
00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I do already. I depart from the structure of five I do as many as I possibly can. I think it works better because it's supposed to get you out of your head, get your mind off of whatever negative loop as well. I think you should do many as you possibly can. So it would look like the

141

148
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Words to label what coming through my eyes everything I possibly could went from shiny to sharp pointy to like I just try really hard to come up with as many words as I possibly could, for you.

149
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Men, you're going to do what something feels

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.220
With your fingers.

Gwenevere Abriel: Ready. Okay. So then you'll be doing

155
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Magic, just as you can for a tactile experience you've got a fuzzy robe, what I might do with you is when you do your part.

156
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have you put your finger right where the the seam is you know where you've got, uh huh. We've got the seam on your robe, because there's going to be where the stitching is at both Stephen

157
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Fuzzy then stitch going to be paying attention to. Oh, I wonder

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How many

159
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Five. And there's another stitch and then there's, it's going to be literally focusing only on the tactile

160
00:16:51.540 --> 00:17:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then you'll do, what am I hearing. I hear some some sweet zoom or I can hear. I can hear my husband out there talking to the kids who I just heard my little boy.

Bianca: Of hearing

164
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you'll go to smell. Hopefully that bathroom doesn't smell bad.

165
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.250
Bianca: Actually, I just cleaned

166
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:34.320

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's not much that comes from taste. I've noticed. Okay, so I gave you an example.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what this, it'll look like. So I want you to take your actually I'm going to have that light and that'll be your the thing you're going to use for tactile, I want you to do as many adjectives or you can put something on the screen. Okay, you're just going to put that down from

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You did great.

193
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and now take your little bottle, close your eyes and just describe what you feel from a tactile perspective.

194
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.470
Okay.

195
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.310
Bianca: Well, I will put rubber

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.260
Bianca: I sell middle class.

197
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:15.060
Bianca: And smooth a glass. This little cold metal is blues is the

198
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Rubber squishy.

199
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.180
Bianca: Question. Yes.

200
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.060
Bianca: And that's it. There's pretty much, not much to it.

201
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So the metal might have felt cooler than the squishy part, you might have noticed

202
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And on the bottom.

203
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there.

204
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: On the bottom, you might you might do this like oh circle.

205
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Not as smooth, a little rougher bumps you might feel tiny little differences, just give yourself permission to do that because the more you can come up with a better work.

206
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.650
Bianca: Okay. The bottom feels

207
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.380
Bianca: Like lettering.

208
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.760
Bianca: Does fail obviously circle. There is another letter at the bottom.

209
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:22.320
Bianca: It does feel smooth. It does feel called THIS FEELS COLD AND SMOOTH AS WELL. It feels more slippery than like glass these bills squishy and warmer.

210
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.720
Bianca: Circle.

211
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic, fantastic. All right, let's do another sense now. Tune in less to a tactile less two eyes. And now let's use those ears.

212
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.880
Bianca: Okay.

213
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice in the room, and then move your awareness out into the home and then all the way outside, you can

214
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.290
Bianca: Well i feel i mean i hear

215
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.850

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.680
Bianca: I have seems quiet and nobody's talking right now.

218
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.410
Bianca: That is a miracle.

219
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Say. Has that ever happened.

220
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.250
Bianca: At the time when you tell me to hear something.

221
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:18.570
Bianca: Yeah, they see quiet now they're talking, but that was a quick nice second silence.

222
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what are people. Okay. Did you have a wave of panic like somebody hurt.

223
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.700
Bianca: No, I just thought maybe they're all busy entertained. I don't know.

224
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so go back to hearing. So we've heard

225
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.900
Bianca: Yeah, that's my baby knocking at my door.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.110
Bianca: Here's a door open.

Bianca: wipes season and disinfecting spray sounds like mango. He smells good.

235
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:21.990

Bianca: Cool.

240
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So can you picture.

241
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you're in a discussion with someone maybe there's a disagreement. Maybe you're having a reaction to some feeling strongly about something you don't really like how it's going

242
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to be able to remember something you want to be able to perform in a particular way. This exercise is also

243
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We were doing the diet for matic breathing part

244
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you notice that you were really

245
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Really trying to give me what I was asking, can I give her some words.

246
00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.020
Bianca: Yes.

247
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what

248
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. It gets you out of thoughts.

249
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Worried worried. What if what

250
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: if, what if, what if something about the future or some people they spend more time thinking about the past intrusive and it's really uncomfortable. Nice.

251
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's good for either one to get you back in your body.

252
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When you want to break from it, you just

253
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay. So let's add this to rehearsal, if you can, if you run across some

254
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.270
Bianca: Kind of want to feel a little different.

255
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say the kids bathtub and they're slipping around and they're not listening to you and

256
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.390
Bianca: safety zone. You don't want the kids to get hurt.

257
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to keep your patience. But you're noticing you're running a little short on it.

258
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:05.820
Bianca: Yeah, I will.

259
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know the neat thing about these kinds of things is

260
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Although I just close my eyes just now, you don't have to. And no one even has to know that you're doing.

261
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Carry

262
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Something in your pocket.

263
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That can help you right to sort of focus.

264
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:24.870
Bianca: Focus your attention.

265
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.860
here for a second.

266
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Frustrated can just sort of feel that little pebble that's in your in your pocket in your robe and just kind of focus on him for a second. He gives your brain a break even for those fractions of a second. We need those reprieves because you've got stimulation coming at you a lot.

267
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So we need a little break.

268
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes to got to have. I'm so glad

269
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I find these two are incredibly helpful.

270
00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

271
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:10.320
Bianca: Has been the first thing you taught me was how it's been helpful. Really, so I'm sure this will be too and

272
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.480
Bianca: It's good. I'm glad that you've taught me these because it has helped a lot. Thank you.

273
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.590
Thank you. Welcome.

274
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

275
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Another time when maybe it's helped on an interpersonal level. A lot of times people get are angry as to the people that love us and who we love has it come up around that.

276
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:35.430
Bianca: Can be getting angry. Yes. Like, I tried. He's getting angry.

277
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.140
Bianca: Yeah.

278
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a story, maybe has happened.

279
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.360
Bianca: Oh, let's see.

280
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:56.910
Bianca: Well, I got angry for something every time I happens. I don't know why I can't remember exactly pinpoint it. It's where is that weird

281
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Um, it could be really adaptive Bianca because plenty of people

282
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to anger.

283
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And it gets them sick, they, they get kidney stones, they get sort of sick inside from holding on to all that resentment, anger. So if you say, is that good. I don't know. Is it working for you. Is it adaptive for you.

284
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:38.460
Bianca: Well, I don't know. I mean, I, yeah, I guess I just let go of it so quickly that I don't even remember like it seems like it was just like a petty thing that I don't even remember or care to remember what the argument was about. It's so weird. I don't

285
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:54.060
Bianca: I answered. But yeah, I had done it with with with an argument over after the argument I have calmed down, and it's helped me to get like call me collective you know after our Ewing

286
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes arguments are about things that we don't forget sometimes they're about spouses sometimes have different belief systems about big issues like parenting nutrition sports academics.

287
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right rest relaxation hard work versus, you know there's there's big things sometimes that come up. Um, what are some big ones that happened between you and your sweetheart.

288
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.210
Bianca: Um,

289
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:31.710
Bianca: I think

290
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.620
Bianca: Shoe

291
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:51.120
Bianca: Dahlia can't think when it comes through it. I know we have them definitely have I, I'm trying to think about what what it was about the kids, but I don't remember.

292
00:28:51.810 --> 00:29:10.590
Bianca: I don't know. I guess I should have bad memory. I don't know what it is that I just can't think of exactly what we were what he was mad about or he had told me something. Something I felt like going and asking him what it was, but I don't know if I have bad memory. I don't, I can't think.

293
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, well, I know. So is that something new work. People are saying, Hey, your, your memory is your affections short term memory stuff going on is that kind of new for you.

294
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:24.660
Bianca: Oh,

295
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:37.710
Bianca: No, no, it's just, every time you asked me, I can't think of stuff like I i guess i ever get asked it that much. I don't know, maybe gets pushed to the back. I don't know.

296
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:46.380
Bianca: It's weird. Now that I just been talking to you lately. It seems like I can't think of a story to tell.

297
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.950
Bianca: And it happens daily and you know I just

298
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.120
Bianca: I mean, you know, something happens with me every day.

299
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.330
Bianca: Oh man, I'm sorry.

300
00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's nothing to apologize.

301
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Why was

302
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: She wanted to work on was

303
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: cope and manage feelings. Because right now, what I'm when I'm investigating a little bit. I'm asking some questions about feelings. You don't seem to sit with very long. You don't hold on to.

304
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.690
Bianca: It doesn't matter.

305
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a fair assessment.

306
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:27.960
Bianca: Yeah.

307
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Does anyone have to hold on.

308
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.570
Bianca: For longer

309
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.470
Bianca: Mm hmm. He does. Okay.

310
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Show his anger.

311
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:57.120
Bianca: A by being mad or talking or saying whatever he fails or sometimes he'll yeah and that's when it gets worse when he else. So that's why I tell them. Don't yell just talk

312
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:13.920
Bianca: Because then you'll start up a brutal thing. You know, it's the way it's not what you say it's like how you say, I just, I'm just to say, call me whenever you feel just say commonly like know we could talk about it but doesn't always work. I thought

313
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:22.290
Bianca: Yeah, but he will. He will be like, Oh, I'm just gonna let it go. I don't care. But when the argument comes up and

314
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:36.330
Bianca: He'll talk about whatever we're arguing and then bring up whatever he was mad about in the past. And I'm like, I was gone. So yeah, that's how I know he holds on to his, his anger. Right.

315
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so yeah I'm

316
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

317
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But your style is

318
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not getting wounded by it. The particular way that he communicates, it's not really sticking with you it's not hurting you. It's not something that

319
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to stop trusting him. It's not to that degree. Is that right,

320
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.290
Bianca: Yeah, right. Yeah.

321
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:09.000
You got it.

322
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:12.120
Already

323
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.840
When we got here.

324
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at your relapse prevention plan that's something obviously that we're building throughout. I'm going to add

325
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: healthy coping skills. I'm just going to put the belly breathing there and the grounding and the five senses.

326
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.250
Grounding

327
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk a little bit about self soothing and self care behaviors. So oftentimes with busy parents they forget about doing pleasurable happy fun on the type of activities.

328
00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know yours is makeup, that's one thing you kind of enjoy

329
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun things are things that feel good include me. What years off and I'll write them down.

330
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:15.390
Bianca: Because

331
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have anything in here, actually. All right. Well, I don't know. Do you do that. Do you ever just for fun to feel good.

332
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or just say horny.

333
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And nobody comes in the bathroom or wherever you keep your makeup and just do a full

334
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Makeup you put makeup on a kid or your husband or somebody. I mean, you ever do that as a

335
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.680
Bianca: Yes, I have. Yes.

336
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, well, should I call it self, which I

337
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.040
Bianca: Know,

338
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:54.390
Bianca: Like it like me like I was self care or fine or what do you want to title that you need.

339
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I

340
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.670
Bianca: Oh, well I guess it's more like for fun.

341
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:01.560
Bianca: Okay.

342
00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I put I put up, but I was hoping maybe you could get a better phrase for me.

343
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:07.710
Oh,

344
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.330
Bianca: Yeah, I know. I don't have one.

345
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You make up

346
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, that's fine. Um, and do you ever take a bath. Do you ever take time and

347
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a special oil or lotion.

348
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Put on or some other things that

349
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how I was teaching you some things to help sort of calm the body, bring the heart rate down. These are things that just pure and simple. It just feel good and they're enjoyable, can we add to the list. A little bit. What would be something that you

350
00:34:46.380 --> 00:35:02.370
Bianca: Well, every time I shower. I stay in the shower for at least an hour and a half, sometimes even two hours and you know shaving and this, you know, all of that. Yeah, so I'm always the one that takes a long time to shower.

351
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We got long to our show. Yes. Yes. Yes. Very nice. So you're able to carve out some me time in the shower.

352
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Everybody kind of knows that. Right.

353
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.890
Bianca: Yes, and I bring my phone. I pull my Direct TV on my phone, watch something and I'm showery

354
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.100
Bianca: Yeah, I haven't

355
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, all right, I got you. Oh, good. We found another one. I hadn't thought about that.

356
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:35.640
All right.

357
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

358
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I know we were talking a little bit about people.

359
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of the people that you were hanging out with have gone. By the way, because they're continuing to use or maybe they were negative influence and you've parted ways over the years.

360
00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you look at the landscape, your environment of people that you can

361
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Call if you ever were in either emotional distress needed to then

362
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you were struggling

363
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about

364
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Using most people it's just emotional and really sad, angry, and I want to talk to somebody, because we can feel good, just like someone getting it off our chest. I don't have any one for people. I can call

365
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Text email.

366
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anyone it that if

367
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You could reach out to them and they would really hear you. They wouldn't judge you. They wouldn't lecture you they wouldn't should, you should do it this way, really just little song.

368
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.510
Bianca: Yeah.

369
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:48.270
Bianca: My mom.

370
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.160
Bianca: Yeah yeah

371
00:36:51.270 --> 00:37:01.740
Bianca: Yeah, she didn't have to text, she does. Listen, she gives good advice and she doesn't judge me time she's always been no real calm.

372
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This is your first right this is the first time you're you're doing therapy.

373
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.230
Bianca: Yes.

374
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Aside from group that group thing.

375
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.620
Bianca: Yes.

376
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So there is

377
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of I'm noticing.

378
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Need

379
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:41.970
To just

380
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Share a bunch of stuff I've noticed some people do some people. You just talk about the pressures from work and the pressures from kids the pressures from their spouse their parents.

381
00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The some issues around substance use maybe really want to get this particular education or whatever it is I'm noticing your style is is a little slower.

382
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:11.670
Bianca: A little

383
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: slower pace.

384
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.520
Oh,

385
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.330
Bianca: Is that what does that mean good or bad or does that mean

386
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think in good and bad and things like that. Um, it's an observation, but I guess what I'm wondering is,

387
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it on the outside, but on the inside, you have things that you do want to talk

388
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:47.910
Bianca: Yeah, no. Uh, I think I've been able to be honest with you. And I feel like I could talk to you is, whenever you ask me.

389
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:55.860
Bianca: Yeah, I don't think that I am holding anything back though I tried. I just those like

390
00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:05.070
Bianca: Like I guess those arguments I can't really pinpoint what the argument was about. That's why I feel like they're so petty that I just

391
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:16.770
Bianca: Don't care about it, I guess. I don't know. I've gotten to that point where before when we used to argue they used to be a big deal. And I used to be really sad. And you know, I would feel like, oh my gosh.

392
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:27.540
Bianca: But now we already used to each other and how he works or how I work that it's like okay, whatever. It's like nothing because we already know. That's how they are. That's how they express themselves.

393
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:44.160
Bianca: That it's I it doesn't seem like it's a big issues because I'm not like oh my gosh so worried about it. You know when you're worried about are you may or you need to resolve it. It's not like that. So I don't know. That's the only thing I can. But yeah, no, no.

394
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

395
00:39:50.790 --> 00:40:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So which which emotions. Would you say when you were saying, I need to learn how to cope. Right. Which ones are you talking about that seem like they're more difficult to cope with and others.

396
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.230
Bianca: I'm

397
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:14.820
Bianca: Just being angry, I guess, or or being frustrated or the overwhelming. Now it's hard. Okay.

398
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And this that frequently happened around child care or and other times.

399
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:39.000
Bianca: It just happens daily because I go through so much with kids and this and that, or whatever it is, or, you know, car issues or it got to go to hospital. It just seems like I i don't know why. Actually, your, your breathing has helped me to go through that but

400
00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:44.160
Bianca: I don't like to be angry, though I don't like to be overwhelmed and

401
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.850
Bianca: So I want to be able to cope with that.

402
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.860
Bianca: I mean especially going through a hectic life like we it's hard, you know,

403
00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How now, the way you present in here, of course, everybody looks sort of calm and relaxed in here when they're talking with me. But the way a typical day looks like you say, angry, how often do you find yourself getting angry. In a typical day.

404
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.290
Bianca: Probably a couple times.

405
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how do you express it.

406
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:18.600
Bianca: Oh, it's talking

407
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.980
Bianca: I'll be like, you're doing this and this and I don't like it.

408
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so your example of getting angry is I told you I don't like like that.

409
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:49.320
Bianca: Yeah, yeah. But if they keep doing I do get mad and I'll be like, I'm like, you know, blow up. And then I then I'll feel bad. After and then I'll apologize to them.

410
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:57.360
Bianca: And I just took kids is to him to or to anybody but in public. I don't like that. I don't

411
00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:10.500
Bianca: Like you somebody strangers getting you mad. I'm just like walk away from it because you know some people tell off strangers and stuff like or are the active in public. No, no, we don't do that in public.

412
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And how were you raised. What was the family environment. What was the belief system around anger.

413
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.820
Bianca: Ah,

414
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:35.730
Bianca: Well, my mom has never really been like angry time she never like really gal. She never spanked it or anything like that. She was always like really calm like

415
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.580
Bianca: That no i don't know i don't know how to answer that. No, no.

416
00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You did. You said what you remember it is your mom was not yelling said she was calm.

417
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Where they're trying a different approach.

418
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Was needed when you are maybe a teenager or something.

419
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:16.350
Bianca: Well, when I was a teenager, we really, I don't know, we really didn't get along that well it wasn't that great. As I was a child that I think I was just like a bad teenager.

420
00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What makes you think you were wrong.

421
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:35.910
Bianca: Well, I see the difference. A house you like raised me to my little brothers, so it's it's a lot different, like now she well they're they're boys, too, but I don't know if that makes a difference, but

422
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.320
Bianca: I don't know. I guess we I rebelled a lot

423
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:46.110
Bianca: And everything she didn't allow me to do like they are able to do

424
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What we

425
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.500
Bianca: Thought was back then. I'm sorry.

426
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You rebelling against

427
00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:03.360
Bianca: I guess just not be able to do anything like like there was stuff that I wasn't able to do, or I had to

428
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:22.170
Bianca: Yeah, no, I don't know, just stuff like that. Like I said, like, like, like my brothers, what they do now, like me, bringing friends over. I couldn't do that. But he has like girls over and he's a boy and or he was able to drive at this age, and I was a so it's different.

429
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And how is it that your fan made those decisions. How did, how was that decided on that your brothers could have girls over and can drive and you could not. How was that decided

430
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:51.630
Bianca: I have no idea. I just think that I was her first child. So maybe she didn't know how to do with it, I guess, or I don't know. And maybe she learned over the years. But I don't know how it was decided how she decided on that.

431
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're you're older than your brothers.

432
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.280
Bianca: Oh yeah. My brother is

433
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.250
Bianca: 1930

434
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.810
Bianca: Have another sister to but me and her group together and we're five years apart so

435
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:43.620
Bianca: So me and her went to the same treatment than what they are going through. They have a more lenient or they could do whatever they want, pretty much in ours it like we couldn't even shave our lakes at 50 you know it was a lot different.

436
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting, though you labeled yourself as a bad teenager.

437
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you're planning, you and your husband.

438
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This name a minute ago, a motto.

439
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:05.730
Yes.

440
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you're going to raise your kids when they're teenagers, how would you approach it.

441
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:22.110
Bianca: Well, I definitely don't want to be like her like Raza now I do have a teenager and what she's a preteen and

442
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:39.780
Bianca: Oh, and my mom and we do talk we like I talked to her and she tells me everything that goes on at school what kids are sitting there, smoking it and you know I just tried to be open with her and, you know, tell her you know you could talk to me, you know, to be scared.

443
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:48.480
Bianca: And obviously I want her to know that she can make her own decisions and I try to help her guide her through those. I tell you what, you cannot

444
00:46:48.900 --> 00:47:02.850
Bianca: Do this and this, and I think this is going to happen, like you're going to have consequences for what you do. And she is. She's very honest and open with me and that's what I want to be able to guide her as a teenager, because I don't think I had that

445
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.320
Yeah.

446
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just had. These are the rules and you just rebelled against them, didn't have the guide.

447
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:16.650
Bianca: Right.

448
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're offering that so you're someone who can listen and then

449
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Just my next client isn't just here yet just curious what what might be a recent piece of guidance offered to she Hello, the shoe.

450
00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:44.850
Bianca: Yes, she's 12 should be 13 out in July. So, yeah, yeah. Well, well, I kept what kind of advice I give you here is it was too much.

451
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:58.260
Bianca: Guidance. Oh, what kind of guidance. Well, I, I talked to her about like the boys and the drugs and pitching and you know friends that she hangs out with

452
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:08.730
Bianca: So, because that's all that's going on right now and as Sabbath graders, you know this. There's so much stuff going on in middle school. It's crazy, like

453
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:22.260
Bianca: It's a little scary, but I just do that stuff like, you know, I'm definitely I tell her, like, you know, you're gonna like this boy. For now, but you're not gonna like forever. He's not the one you know

454
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:35.040
Bianca: And then you know about these drugs and fakes that are going around right now. I just tell her that there is not worth it. Really it's you know and and she's also seen

455
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:43.590
Bianca: Like you know obviously that kids are not dumb and they see what us parents have gone through. She knows exactly like what I've gone through and

456
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:53.250
Bianca: About you know substance and stuff. And I tell her. That's just, you don't want to end up like that. Like, you want to do better for yourself. So I tried to motivate her to do better for

457
00:48:53.850 --> 00:49:05.490
Bianca: Them to be, you know, like me, like I want her to be 10 times better. And, you know, try to get to college and make career. I tell her, don't get married to after you have all that stuff.

458
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:18.930
Bianca: And then when you're ready, you know, just get yourself stable in life before, but I know I always does happen, but I just tried to talk to her as much as possible. No child tell her what could happen. She's seen it, though, do

459
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:21.570
All right.

460
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What piece of guidance would you have liked to have had when you were maybe 12 or 13

461
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.410
Bianca: All that. Yeah, yeah.

462
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:35.580
Someone

463
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, what would be something for mom maybe could have told you

464
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:41.940
Bianca: A little

465
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:54.060
Bianca: Um, well, you know, if we would have talked about drugs or say um you know

466
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:58.560
Bianca: Just everything that that teenagers need to know

467
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But none of those things were normalized, those weren't conversations that that people talked about

468
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.150
Bianca: No, no.

469
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're really making a difference when you're doing this this family quite differently.

470
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:17.550
Bianca: My Blab

471
00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation to you.

472
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have any time for reflection, you know, in this coming week it would be

473
00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only mom's experience of those things.

474
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But a skill that would have been nice.

475
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Back then, right.

476
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: She could have bought you that she could have said actually younger, you may not know that you can do this. But you can do this and you're about to run into a, b, and c. And you know what you can do this.

477
00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:58.770
Because I've

478
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Done age 13 before when you're 1212 when you're a woman. I mean, there's certain things we don't know until we know

479
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What we can do is give a little heads up to remind children about the skills that they have about maybe looking ahead if you heard someone say

480
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:19.020
This

481
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what you can solve instead of

482
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: what everybody else is doing.

483
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.510
Bianca: Right. Right. Yeah, I was just going

484
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To think about what we've just spent some time maybe over the coming week if you remember to maybe do some

485
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Jot something down around what it would have been nice that your mom had asked you to do, or that a skill that you would

486
00:51:47.430 --> 00:52:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And for you specifically a nice around the concept of feelings, emotions, because that's kind of one of your goals is to kind of maybe learn more about that. So, so ask yourself, maybe a wonder what nine have shown me taught me.

487
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Around my feeling

488
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: As a teenager.

489
00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what comes up. I don't already have an answer. Let's see what

490
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:17.730

Gwenevere Abriel: He doing some writing you have a free. Second, you know, take 20 minutes shorter your shower and do a little scribbling

492
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.640

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just playing with you.

494
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:32.730

538
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:16.920
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

539
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are your kids handling this change, they've got lots and lots of change going on. How are they adjusting to it.

540
00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:35.850
Adam Vallejos: Are we getting I could see the game better. My older son and I had a parent teacher conference yesterday and

541
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:46.590
Adam Vallejos: She said, I guess, pretty much like since he's they came with me. They that he's been doing better in school and

542
00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:52.680
Adam Vallejos: And I would, I don't know that she was saying that he has his days like some days you're going to school.

543
00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:55.950
Adam Vallejos: Like with confidence and ready to

544
00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:01.950
Adam Vallejos: Ready to learn. I guess pretty more in like he'll do and like some days, they'll just

545
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.350
Adam Vallejos: They'll be working on the same thing that he was doing good, the day before. But then he some goofy just

546
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:17.550
Adam Vallejos: Like, like you forgot everything. I don't know what other Overall though he's doing good in school.

547
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And in general, I have there been bouts for you, meaning there moments.

548
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're crying and in distress or is that really just not part of the phase of grief that you're in.

549
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.480
Adam Vallejos: I haven't really done it.

550
00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.940
Adam Vallejos: And the only time I really like is that the viewing. I didn't know but

551
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.090
Adam Vallejos: And I didn't want

552
00:57:52.260 --> 00:58:04.170
Adam Vallejos: Because my brother, my mom didn't want to take my brother. So at first and then the day over the viewing. He wanted to go and I wasn't going to take my kids he they

553
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:06.960
Adam Vallejos: Were

554
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:09.870
Adam Vallejos: Taking them.

555
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:11.850
Adam Vallejos: And

556
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.650
Adam Vallejos: I don't know. First, it's my older son he

557
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:36.000
Adam Vallejos: Didn't know he started crying a lot like he was the one like that, cried the most out of my brother and my youngest son, but I don't know if it was just him realizing, like that's a dead body right there in front of him or

558
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:49.500
Adam Vallejos: Like, because at first when you walked up to him. I don't know if he were just like in shock or something because he didn't cry until we like sat down and then him seeing everybody else going up to him crying or

559
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:52.830
Adam Vallejos: And then my youngest son he

560
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:59.490
Adam Vallejos: He was just sitting there like I know like he was in shock or something. Cuz she

561
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:07.980
Adam Vallejos: Was just sitting there and then he didn't cry until like we go in the car and were leaving, and then he started crying.

562
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:17.070
Adam Vallejos: But they didn't really see me, I guess, crying because when I did. I got up and went to the bathroom. I don't know, and

563
00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.770
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, so

564
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:25.380
Adam Vallejos: They had to know, but after that they've been. All right, they have

565
00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:33.690
Adam Vallejos: We already talked about it and lights out that day but this weekend out to go to the services, but they're not seeing them.

566
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:39.000
Adam Vallejos: And then we went and got shirts made and stuff and

567
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:45.270
Adam Vallejos: I didn't really know him. That's why the only Madam, like, two times there will like

568
00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:50.610
Adam Vallejos: It was now recently when he got us out of

569
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.770
Adam Vallejos: Prison or whatever.

570
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a minute.

571
01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And find a place so that your hands are free, see if we can get a place for this fun to land.

572
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:22.920
Alright.

573
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little better.

574
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why I asked you, not only because I care. I want to know kind of how you're doing that kind of thing. But I also want to get a read on what

575
01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We can and kind of can't do in here today.

576
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to develop a couple more pieces of imagery with you. You open to that.

577
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:54.060
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

578
01:00:55.260 --> 01:01:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You put or you've done a protective figure have done a nurturing figure. You've done a wise figure that's kind of what I mean by imagery. Use your imagination used a little combination of memory and

579
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, you had real people. You had grandma, my on to my grandpa, not a lot of imagination stuff but

580
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, and we're about to do a little bit more. That will be very much dependent on your imagination. Okay.

581
01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I want to develop right now are me see one to two things. The first one, and you may have done this in group and it just didn't get noted in here was the emotional container.

582
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's if you're feeling something kind of heavy, maybe even in here. You and I start to talk about something. Maybe it makes you sad or makes you scared or angry. You don't really feel like dealing with it.

583
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of, you know, how you went to the bathroom to cry. This would be taking whatever you're going through and sort of metaphorically symbolically putting it in the container.

584
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now out. And what I'd like you to do is think about an emotional container and it doesn't exist because it's a made up thing. Okay.

585
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to think about something that's big enough and strong enough to hold all of your emotional stuff. Okay.

586
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, I'll give you some examples just to kind of get the brainstorm going. It could be anything you want. Actually, you have one I've seen it. I just kind of control. It just now. It was like a wasn't it like a lock it. I could picture that you drew it for me.

587
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I just got it. I don't know. See if you can describe that for me because I need to type it up. He drew it

588
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Was like square and it had this like had this lock in the kind of top part but describe that for me.

589
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:51.450
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, just

590
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.000
Adam Vallejos: Like you love being

591
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the, what's the container.

592
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.560
Adam Vallejos: Like what is it I'm thinking, oh,

593
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What is it I can I just wrote the word keylock which is. That's only the last part. I want to know what the containers.

594
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:25.620
Adam Vallejos: Don't know what a key lucky as me I should look that up. It is a container me to see what's your

595
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.440
Adam Vallejos: Oh, no.

596
01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's just a locking system right

597
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:32.400
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

598
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.270
Adam Vallejos: I don't know container could just be like,

599
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.500
Adam Vallejos: Anything. There's the box that I can live with that.

600
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, how big is it

601
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.030
Adam Vallejos: Little bit of metal.

602
01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: wood and metal

603
01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it painted anything you notice, maybe on the outside or inside

604
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.630
Adam Vallejos: Inside

605
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: On the inside or outside, or both.

606
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Inside and

607
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.260
Outside

608
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about the size of the shoe box and you use a key lock to kind of close it up. Okay, so we might use that at some point.

609
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're welcome to also use it when you're feeling some strong emotion you want to get some distance from it. That's one way to sort of use your brain.

610
01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: In a way to compartmentalize I don't feel like dealing with this right now can kind of picture. How would I get it in the box. But I toss it in there like a basketball. Would I place it in generally like hammered in

611
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, just you get into that imagery and put it in there.

612
01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we kind of picture this distancing metaphor and just feel free to MIND ME IF WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE ALL can try and find another note it just didn't make its way into this one.

613
01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Did we already developed a distancing metaphor.

614
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:03.570
Adam Vallejos: So,

615
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we'll do it. I like this one. This one's great

616
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll give you some examples and that that will get your brain kind of brainstorming. Okay.

617
01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So for some people it's like this. It's like they're standing on a riverbank and they're sort of surrounded by

618
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: A protective figure nurturing quality and a wise quality and they're just sort of sitting on the riverbank are standing on the riverbank and what they picture on down the river is this leaf that's moving further and further and further away. And on that leaf is a memory.

619
01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The metaphor is a leaf floating further and further away on a river.

620
01:06:48.390 --> 01:07:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's a helium balloon, you kind of take this little message and they stick it in there and they tie it up tight and kind of takes off slowly sort of floats up into the atmosphere until you can't see it anymore.

621
01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:01.620
Adam Vallejos: That's

622
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Missing metaphor. You could also be a train right that car.

623
01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That you put maybe even the box you even put your container on it and you're like, Okay, you're out of here.

624
01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could see this train in your mind, your mind signs moving further and further away you can hear, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, and away goes further and further, further that train until you can't even see it anymore, certainly can't hear it anymore.

625
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people. It's a rocket ship. Like, it takes off really fast, like, get out of here and it goes off and you can't see it.

626
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So this was a few of them for you. When you think of, let's say you're having a negative emotion and you want. Or maybe it's a memory or it's a thought or it's a belief and you want to get some distance from it what might be a metaphor that we might use

627
01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:58.380
Adam Vallejos: I would use like

628
01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.590
Adam Vallejos: Yours a bottle and throwing it into those

629
01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Take it away in the Ocean, ocean,

630
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:20.730
Take

631
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Seem like it's been taken away quickly. Slowly, sort of in between.

632
01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.580
Lonely

633
01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So it seemed kind of a slow distancing. Okay. Very nice.

634
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So just let me know if some of these things are distressing for you. He'll come to me in. Okay. Um, I want to start to build this inventory of subjective unit of distress with you and get a few history stories.

635
01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: From right and zero to 100 on the subjective unit of distress. I'm gonna show it to you so you can see what I'm doing.

636
01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in here, see this stuff.

637
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Develop subjective unit of distress. So it's like a thermometer.

638
01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say we're at zero. We are relaxed.

639
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that would be able to zero. My muscles are relaxed. I'm my mind is at ease way up here at 100 would be

640
01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, my children dying. I mean, that would just be like too much right

641
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Canada. Okay. So you get the idea that a thermometer is is is this is registering how distressing an event is how distressing an emotion, the body or a belief.

642
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All you need to do here is I'm just going to ask you right at that 50 range, it's not completely terrifying up here.

643
01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the fight or flight response up here. This is the worst scariest thing most upsetting thing that's ever happened to you up here at 100. No, we don't want that one.

644
01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You just chill relaxed and kind of content. No, we don't want that one. We want in the middle. It's a little activating which means a little upsetting like to hear an event that happened to you.

645
01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a memory or something that you think of that was a little distressing. But you were still able to reason and think

646
01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me a you take your time, don't rush. But, see if you can think of a timer was really upsetting. It's about a 50 wasn't the worst thing and you could still think through and problem solve.

647
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: if something else comes up, I can move it to a higher number and then we'll come back to 50 don't worry about what are you thinking about right now. What's coming up for you.

648
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:27.150
Adam Vallejos: As my guest. The first time when I went when I went to like to Joe for some

649
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what was the predominant emotion there. You're the boss is getting you there. It's like what right

650
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.360
Adam Vallejos: I was thinking like

651
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.450
Adam Vallejos: 16 or 17 again. Yeah. Okay. So, thinking I can move that one up.

652
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, speaking of the word thinking, what were you thinking about when you were heading over there or when you actually locked in.

653
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:56.580
Adam Vallejos: That I was

654
01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:03.180
Adam Vallejos: That I was nervous and scared and for the first time, because I didn't know what it was really like

655
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:07.440
Adam Vallejos: But that I knew that I could

656
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.780
Adam Vallejos: Show them.

657
01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:11.580
Yeah, right.

658
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:15.480
Okay.

659
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were nervous and scared, but what everybody saw what do you think people saw on the exterior of the mask that you had to wear inside the jail to survive in there.

660
01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.760
Adam Vallejos: I wasn't really like

661
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.550
Adam Vallejos: Are we just

662
01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:46.290
Adam Vallejos: Really just being myself I was in like kind act or hard like I didn't

663
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:52.230
Adam Vallejos: Know anybody in there. You know me. Now I just acting like myself, but not like

664
01:12:54.150 --> 01:13:03.330
Adam Vallejos: How I was really feeling an inside scared and nervous or whatever. Just, I was just having to be chill, I guess, like if I did it before something

665
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Yeah. Like there's nothing better thing than here, whatever. Okay.

666
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And the belief about yourself at the time.

667
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard one belief. Let me just check and see if this is the core target that I want to work with the belief about yourself while you were in there, was it I can't show

668
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Who I am, I can't show that I'm scared. I can't show fear. It may not be that one. That might be something else. Do you remember what you believed about yourself during that period of time in jail.

669
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.480
Adam Vallejos: Was it was probably then I just kidding.

670
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:53.760
Adam Vallejos: Show.

671
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:56.430
Adam Vallejos: What I was

672
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:59.160
Adam Vallejos: Really feeling

673
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you think of the fact that you couldn't show how you're really feeling

674
01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:21.600
Adam Vallejos: It was

675
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:35.070
Adam Vallejos: And I guess it made it kind of veteran, I guess it's time to show that I was here just to make it seem like I

676
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:42.780
Adam Vallejos: Was just cool because another thing was already because if I

677
01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.050
Adam Vallejos: Like the week one. Yeah.

678
01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was what we would call adaptive you adapted to the environment and it sounds like it worked. So you weren't targeted.

679
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes sense.

680
01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever used this approach outside of jail.

681
01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:24.570
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I guess so, like, like I said, like in school and

682
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:28.890
Adam Vallejos: Whenever I whenever I was that I would just

683
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:34.530
Adam Vallejos: I was like, mostly in like middle school.

684
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:45.150
Adam Vallejos: I was always every day I would pretty much. I don't know why though it's like it because I wasn't getting like bullied or anything. I had friends and were just some

685
01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:56.910
Adam Vallejos: Nervousness, that would come in the morning and I would always like throw up every morning there for like half the year and have sixth grade and then

686
01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:02.940
Adam Vallejos: When I would go to school, I would be nervous and stuff, but I would just show like

687
01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:20.310
Adam Vallejos: Everything was all right. But I never like knew why I would feel that way because like I said I was a nobody was like bullying me or I was born. Like, I don't know, I think it was just

688
01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:27.060
Adam Vallejos: Being in class, I don't know, like how I didn't

689
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:29.220
Like

690
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:35.790
Adam Vallejos: Because in that and then middle school, you have like different classes. So always like in

691
01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:40.710
Adam Vallejos: In like language arts or something we would always have to read

692
01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.560
Adam Vallejos: Aloud and that's when

693
01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:51.900
Adam Vallejos: I would have to talk in front and like the whole class that was the thing that would, but I wouldn't

694
01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:59.220
Adam Vallejos: I was nervous or whatever. I would just go up there and do it like I was

695
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:00.690
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

696
01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:13.950
Adam Vallejos: But then in high school. I didn't know that all changed because then I

697
01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:15.990
Adam Vallejos: Got like

698
01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:24.990
Adam Vallejos: A lot more friends and like I didn't know I was like, I wouldn't say I was like popular nothing night but like

699
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.830
Adam Vallejos: I was, I have like a lot of friends and

700
01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:35.100
Adam Vallejos: In high school, you don't. I guess really like present or you have to talk in

701
01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.410
Adam Vallejos: Class. I've known

702
01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That sixth grade year was a really tough one. There was morning vomiting. And really, and you kind of have said that before that it's really kind of a fear of maybe someone making fun of you somehow possibly about the reading maybe

703
01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:59.520
Adam Vallejos: Yeah. Or yeah, just whatever we had to do in front of the class.

704
01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.650
Adam Vallejos: Yeah them.

705
01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:07.350
Adam Vallejos: We are making phone calls like that never happened. That's why it never

706
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:12.780
Adam Vallejos: Matter. I don't know why it just something in my head that if I

707
01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:21.660
Adam Vallejos: Were to mess up or something, then I guess I could say what they were thinking telling me what what they were thinking about me.

708
01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So finish that sentence. If I were to mess up, what would happen.

709
01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:33.810
Adam Vallejos: Then I would

710
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:36.000
Adam Vallejos: Be

711
01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:40.860
Adam Vallejos: Messed up presenting in front of the class. I would just have

712
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.840
Adam Vallejos: I don't know, some kind of hear that they were

713
01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:52.770
Adam Vallejos: Talking to their friends behind my back about what I did wrong.

714
01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you doing that to other people during that like in sixth grade, fifth grade.

715
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: During that time, I'm actually not only just that time try to go back even further and see if you can find the earliest age where you were afraid to make a mistake because somebody right might misunderstand you

716
01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone might spread a rumor, someone might have an form an opinion of you and negative opinion, try to catch the earliest age. If you can find that the earliest age where the same thing you're describing

717
01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on, can be in any part of your life if you can recall back to the most intense earliest stage.

718
01:19:53.550 --> 01:20:01.470
Adam Vallejos: I don't know. I was just at all I could think of is starting sixth grade, like in elementary school and stuff but

719
01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:03.390
Adam Vallejos: I

720
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.010
Adam Vallejos: I remember having to in like fifth grade, I remember having to

721
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.450
Adam Vallejos: Like, do a presentation thing but

722
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:26.580
Adam Vallejos: I like knew when I did it. Good. So like when I went to present it to the class. I knew what I was saying, talking about

723
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.650
Adam Vallejos: And I didn't have that

724
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.660
Adam Vallejos: That feeling

725
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there were some I worked hard at this I know what I'm talking about. And there was more confidence there.

726
01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:47.010
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, yeah. So I would just say sixth grade still is just when I would start feeling when I started feeling that we

727
01:20:48.870 --> 01:21:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Are pretty critical age item that's when we start to care more about what our peers think about us less about what our parents thing we really care. We want to not stand out. We want to look like them talk like them. It's this weird middle school nightmare.

728
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're not alone in that that experience. And that's pretty pretty typical doesn't make it right. Good. But it is typical of people's experience in middle school is a lot of pressure.

729
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your home life like during that time period.

730
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Background

731
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:32.730
Adam Vallejos: It was good. I that's when I still lived with my grandparents and

732
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.900
Adam Vallejos: There was nothing really

733
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:46.230
Adam Vallejos: crazy going on because I live my mom. I mean, she was in and out, like she would come visit some time, but

734
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:58.080
Adam Vallejos: Everything was good at home until eighth grade. And then, when will they great summer and I had to go to high school or whatever, that's when I

735
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.890
Adam Vallejos: Finally, moved with my mom because my grandparents.

736
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:07.650
Adam Vallejos: Were getting too old and yeah and but

737
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:16.140
Adam Vallejos: Everything was good. I guess I was my was spoil the Higher Self and grew and

738
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:23.100
Adam Vallejos: I was only one like going kids will my cousin, he would always come to me but

739
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.260
Adam Vallejos: I would just only

740
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:30.930
Adam Vallejos: The only child. So I don't know. I got everything I want one, everything is good.

741
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember kind of be unhappy during that time when you were home.

742
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.450
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

743
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.690
Adam Vallejos: My grandma.

744
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.520
Adam Vallejos: My grandma had passed away. I guess in ninth.

745
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:08.700
Adam Vallejos: Grade. And then I was only only had my own one grandma. That was taking care of me and then

746
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:15.720
Adam Vallejos: Everybody after that, like after my grandpa. And my grandma died down he had

747
01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:21.390
Adam Vallejos: My her daughter was my grandma's. Well, what

748
01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:23.190
Adam Vallejos: She

749
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.460
Adam Vallejos: That's when I guess like everybody started moving into the house.

750
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:35.010
Adam Vallejos: And like my aunt. She had moved into the house and then

751
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:41.610
Adam Vallejos: The eighth grade year, I remember my mom moved into the house to

752
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:48.540
Adam Vallejos: And then that's when my grandma wasn't doing good. And then she

753
01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:54.360
Adam Vallejos: We had to sell that. I don't know why they sold those, but they did.

754
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:56.940
Adam Vallejos: Because it was their house.

755
01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:06.750
Adam Vallejos: And then they to my ad. I had moved into apartment and took my grandma with your but like she was gone, like she couldn't even talk. She didn't

756
01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:11.250
Adam Vallejos: Like even like member to me, I guess, but

757
01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:21.990
Adam Vallejos: That's when I started going, I guess, seven. The end of seventh grade, eighth grade is like when everything started falling apart.

758
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Why you weren't living with your mother.

759
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:47.970
Adam Vallejos: She was doing her own thing that since I was three years old, she just gave me to my grandma She just was

760
01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.970
Adam Vallejos: Out living her life. I guess just partying and doing what she wanted.

761
01:24:54.660 --> 01:25:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And to this day that you haven't gotten like a moment where you've really talked with your mom about that time.

762
01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:06.090
Adam Vallejos: Show me.

763
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:15.060
Adam Vallejos: Show me bring that up whenever she's like she don't drink a lot, but when she does like

764
01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:21.450
Adam Vallejos: For all the days and so she'll get all drunk and then

765
01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:29.520
Adam Vallejos: She'll just start bringing that up link saying that she sorry, and she know she wasn't there. I mean, but

766
01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.490
Adam Vallejos: Like other than that she won't. We don't talk about it.

767
01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to take the credibility when someone's doing it right when they're drinking, but talking about how this is what happened when they were drinking

768
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right yeah I got it.

769
01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.070
Adam Vallejos: But like, I don't know, I, she asked you to tell me that

770
01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:04.020
Adam Vallejos: You wanted the best life for me. And she knows she couldn't do it. He knew my grandmother would take care of me and so

771
01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:10.380
Adam Vallejos: Which they did and they took really good care of me and and

772
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:13.470
Adam Vallejos: I couldn't ask for better

773
01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:20.070
Adam Vallejos: Years from three to 14 or whatever but

774
01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You've really got some gratitude for those

775
01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That treatment from them. I can, I can really hear that a lot of you felt their love and support that's that's very clear, very, very grateful.

776
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a thing to

777
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Our biology around our mother and father

778
01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't be surprised if it happens to you, too.

779
01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We sort of biologically

780
01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Want Our mother and father to love us.

781
01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of the way we're wired.

782
01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And we care a lot even unconsciously about what they think about us and

783
01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I know just now, you were saying, Shelly kind of processes. This stuff when she's, she's drinking

784
01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But between you and I, right, if, if we say, well, when she is saying she sorry I'm sorry I wasn't there for you. And she call it all that shit right doesn't sound like you, you tell me if I'm wrong. Do you believe

785
01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Her apology that she sorry she wasn't there for you.

786
01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.220
Adam Vallejos: Know, kinda. I do.

787
01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:43.770
Adam Vallejos: I know she probably wishes she could have done better and stuff but

788
01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.440
Adam Vallejos: It's just

789
01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:57.510
Adam Vallejos: Now that I have been living with her since. Well, since I was 14 or whatever, and she never really

790
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:09.900
Adam Vallejos: I still can take care of my own. I still took care of myself then like she actually put a roof over my head and how to food and stuff for me but like

791
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.380
Adam Vallejos: I was still the one

792
01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.380
Adam Vallejos: Pretty much taken care of me so

793
01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:17.820
Yeah.

794
01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were young, you aren't right. You are 29 your brain finished its development. About two years ago. You're just now basically an adult, you were taking care yourself at a very young age.

795
01:28:40.650 --> 01:28:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm imagining it might have been nice to have someone there to talk you through the risk that some of the things that she got involved in

796
01:28:54.210 --> 01:28:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

797
01:28:57.210 --> 01:29:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there an area that seems like it was really clear would have been nice to have mom there.

798
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:08.850
Adam Vallejos: I guess.

799
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:11.670
Adam Vallejos: During those

800
01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:14.700
Adam Vallejos: Middle school years, I guess.

801
01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.280
Adam Vallejos: Because like

802
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:30.270
Adam Vallejos: I guess, mostly, I guess my dad, I guess would be more on my middle school years to feel. I never really have like

803
01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:37.530
Adam Vallejos: A male figure in my life, my uncle was doing but he wasn't

804
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:39.900
Adam Vallejos: He wasn't like

805
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:46.710
Adam Vallejos: Doing good for himself either really as a time. He was an alcoholic to and stuff like what

806
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:49.380
Adam Vallejos: He was like Dhoni

807
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.890
Adam Vallejos: MLM my life at that time and then

808
01:29:54.720 --> 01:30:00.090
Adam Vallejos: Because my dad was already in prison. But even when my dad was out he was I never seen him anyway.

809
01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:02.790
Adam Vallejos: And

810
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:05.670
Adam Vallejos: I should just

811
01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:13.200
Adam Vallejos: Most young during like the sixth, seventh grade, I wish. Both of my parents would have been there more

812
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you think that's had an impact on you today, like I said, been there, I wonder, even if it's a curiosity how you might be a little different today.

813
01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:29.400
Adam Vallejos: You know,

814
01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:38.730
Adam Vallejos: They were there. Mark telling me.

815
01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:45.330
Adam Vallejos: What they had already been through, and what

816
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.570
Adam Vallejos: I could have my dad was a heroin addict to and here I had him. They're telling me.

817
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:56.400
Adam Vallejos: I knew it was bad. Yeah, but I didn't know like

818
01:30:57.810 --> 01:31:06.690
Adam Vallejos: At that time when I started doing it I i think if you were there to come out and never done it in the first place, then I think I like for the

819
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:10.290
Adam Vallejos: Different or like if I didn't

820
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.540
Adam Vallejos: Or I would enter started selling drugs in

821
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.080
Adam Vallejos: Like that fed case or whatever. So

822
01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:23.790
Adam Vallejos: I think my life would have been different if I just had him.

823
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:27.000
Adam Vallejos: There to tell me

824
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's interesting. I mean, there's plenty of kids and you've met them that you can tell a kid. Anything you want, we can role model. The best healthiest lifestyle and a child still going to make their own decisions, but

825
01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you would have seen

826
01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:44.430
Adam Vallejos: Like

827
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I had said, Listen, son. Take a look at my life I've lost years of it in prison and health. I've got, you know, I don't know, whatever got hep C or, you know, I've lost years of my life. I haven't watched you grow up.

828
01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know drugs are sort of a short term solution.

829
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: For a problem that can be solved in a different way. And let me teach you those skills. So if he had been able to do that with you. You think you would have really respected what he had to say. And you wouldn't have done what he was doing.

830
01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:23.460
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

831
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:26.670
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, at least.

832
01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:30.210
Adam Vallejos: In order to get to

833
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:41.910
Adam Vallejos: Like where I had to kill like selling how I was where I had the feds get on on me and I mean like I wouldn't, I don't think I will.

834
01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:56.280
Adam Vallejos: Even messed around with heroin open. Yeah, to tell me because like I didn't know like they could, like, I, I didn't really know my dad was on

835
01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.680
Adam Vallejos: Heroin, I didn't even know heroin was until

836
01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:06.090
Adam Vallejos: Like high school and stuff and then

837
01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:14.640
Adam Vallejos: That's when I found out that that's why he was in prison for 17 years because he was

838
01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:21.570
Adam Vallejos: Getting needed money to support his habit and he just did a grip of armed robberies.

839
01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:26.730
Adam Vallejos: And yeah, I just think

840
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:29.190
Adam Vallejos: If he was there more time.

841
01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:32.550
Adam Vallejos: I would never touch.

842
01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk with your kids are you pretty open about why you yourself have used or like just curious.

843
01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:11.610
Adam Vallejos: I tell him.

844
01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:19.050
Adam Vallejos: Like why because yes about modern medicine, when I take the Suboxone

845
01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.060
Adam Vallejos: And

846
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.540
Adam Vallejos: I just tell them it's just

847
01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:29.220
Adam Vallejos: Because something I was doing bad

848
01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:32.880
Adam Vallejos: I just

849
01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:41.310
Adam Vallejos: I just don't want him to do that to do any kind of drug on, I don't know, I just haven't really talked to him about it but

850
01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:46.650
Adam Vallejos: When he asked when I take my toolbox hundred every time.

851
01:34:47.970 --> 01:34:49.260
Adam Vallejos: I just say it was because

852
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.690
Adam Vallejos: A bad thing that I was doing that now I need to take this medicine for a while to get better and

853
01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:04.080
Adam Vallejos: Like understand, but I just don't want to.

854
01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:09.180
Adam Vallejos: Do any kind of intro, get on

855
01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So Adam when you know why you did it to begin with. It's going to be a lot easier for you to get more detail to your children because that answer. I did it because I did a bad thing.

856
01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Teenagers will see right through that.

857
01:35:26.850 --> 01:35:29.250
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, and I don't even know why.

858
01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:34.680
Adam Vallejos: I did it to begin with, is because

859
01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:40.140
Adam Vallejos: A friend of mine had and he had a tear in my dad didn't

860
01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:54.420
Adam Vallejos: Because I was already like I was trying pills and I like that feeling of pills. I wasn't doing pills all crazy like once and allowed come across a pill and do it and then

861
01:35:56.490 --> 01:36:06.960
Adam Vallejos: One day, one of my friends had everyone. Also, and I got any venting to be like that. So my dad was addicted to. I didn't think about getting addicted.

862
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:12.300
Adam Vallejos: And I did right away because I do like that.

863
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:16.050
Adam Vallejos: Down and feeling and

864
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:21.030
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I just did it because somebody has

865
01:36:23.490 --> 01:36:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So just imagine it's your son, it's going to see through

866
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you need motivation to really work hard at the self reflection and really understand what was going on at the time that it made sense for you.

867
01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To basically self medicate, there was something going on where it just made sense to want that numbness

868
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To go take a depressant that brings heart rate down, it means you don't have to feel

869
01:36:58.740 --> 01:36:59.220
Yeah.

870
01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: When you understand that more and that's what our discussions are about is really trying to uncover that piece.

871
01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to feel more confident about how to teach your son about how to live his life in a healthy way.

872
01:37:17.850 --> 01:37:18.480
Adam Vallejos: Does that make sense.

873
01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, even for now. If you can't find your own motivation to do it.

874
01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, you're showing up in here. You're showing up anyway. I know it's like probably just want to have it up on our feet and go on with your day. But you, you are changing are making changes even so subtle. When you talk about these difficult things with me.

875
01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But just as you hear your own self, say if someone said, Oh, son. Don't worry about these, you know, it's, I did something bad and

876
01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't worry about it.

877
01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that might have been nothing

878
01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:52.680
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

879
01:37:53.010 --> 01:37:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that I'm going to keep you from the peer pressure of wanting to have friends be like everybody else.

880
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right to address insecurities. I mean, that's what these substances can do if people like family. Mom, Dad, grandparents aren't telling you

881
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you say to people when they say, go do something unhealthy gets cool if a kid isn't ready. They don't believe that the body is a vessel of health and we only put healthy things in it.

882
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it's only about the impulsive moment.

883
01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just the way our brains are, they're not fully developed. We don't have that. Is this good is this bad part of our brain developed yet not at 13 techno

884
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have it till literally two years ago.

885
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.800
Yeah.

886
01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's coming on board now.

887
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So this discovery of really working hard to understand the context of what was going on in your life did it made sense to want to numb out

888
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it isn't the same for everybody. For some people, they're like, I hate the feeling of numbness, I want to be sharp

889
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be able to do this, this, this, and this, right. Not everybody's experiences, the same as yours in middle school, but it was something's going on. Pretty important things going on in middle school.

890
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And in high school.

891
01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It just made sense. I want to not feel what I'm feeling I'm going to feel this downer. I like this down, or I don't want to feel this. I want a downer. The more you know what was going on.

892
01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The more empowered, you're going to be not only for your own recovery. But wait, as a parent, to be able to teach. Hey, man.

893
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're feeling insecure, you feel kind of slight stupid, you know, I mean like everybody look you look around like looks like everybody already knows everything, like what is that

894
01:39:54.450 --> 01:40:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, of course, because everybody's clueless. But it just looks like it, son. This is what you think this is what you do you hold on yourself.

895
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't betray yourself. Don't let go. Don't do something that's outside of our core values here in this House, your confidence around that. It's just going to be so much bigger. Once you know why you did what you did.

896
01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right. Well, you worked hard today and let's schedule another time to meet that works for you and just remind me any big changes around your work schedule that we need to

897
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.860
Adam Vallejos: Still keep this time. If not,

898
01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:40.380
Adam Vallejos: Then

899
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:45.000
Adam Vallejos: When today.

900
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, maybe Wednesday see

901
01:41:14.730 --> 01:41:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday at nine in the morning. Can you get up, put some water on your face. Are you busy right then.

902
01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:26.820
Adam Vallejos: Should be airing

903
01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And on that day. Can you make a note in your phone.

904
01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some

905
01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:35.340
Exercises

906
01:41:36.450 --> 01:41:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: He did in a chair and grab

907
01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Grab a couple of, I don't know that we're going to do the activity. But, see if you can grab a couple of containers and kind of put them right outside the phone so it would look like this.

908
01:41:50.040 --> 01:42:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: On the desk, you'd have a phone sitting here kind of propped up with books or something. So right like that and then next to it would be a couple of tall containers that are about the same height.

909
01:42:01.110 --> 01:42:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be doing anything with them, except if we do the activity, you'd be looking at them. It's an activity. I don't know if we're going to end up doing it, but I wanted to see, see if we can do a little

910
01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: preparation phase. Okay.

911
01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:15.870
Adam Vallejos: All right.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so we are set now for, I'll see you on Tuesday. Do I need to send any slack message to the doctor, do you have enough medicine to get you all the way to Tuesday.

913
01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:32.490
Adam Vallejos: Yeah. Pretty sure she she sent it yesterday. So

914
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:34.050
Adam Vallejos: I
