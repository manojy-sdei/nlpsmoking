Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's it going for you.

3
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.640
Jessica Freeman: Um, I think everyone is dealing with this differently.

4
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.960
Jessica Freeman: Um, I don't know, I guess I'm Comfortably Numb about it. Like I'm choosing not to engage in fear and panic and all that, but

5
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.390
Jessica Freeman: I don't know, this is just the beginning. And I'm curious to see how it plays out.

9
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.340

10
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In that way.

21
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.230
Jessica Freeman: You know,

22
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:51.360
Jessica Freeman: And I got a letter yesterday and yesterday's mail that from the income support division here in New Mexico and they said that I'm approved.

23
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.360

24
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.270

Jessica Freeman: Additional coverage in that limited time frame for if you have like chronic substance abuse or whatever.

26
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:25.950
Jessica Freeman: So I'm going to call them and be like, hey, like my only medical expenses have been for, you know, addiction therapy and blah, blah, blah. So, you know, will you cover that and then see how to go about getting reimbursed for everything that I paid out of pocket.

27
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, which will be cool.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.000
Jessica Freeman: She'd know she's been great. Everything's everything's fine.

30
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How does it feel not having to go to work every day and just be home.

31
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.060
Jessica Freeman: I'm just, I'm trying not to.

32
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.410
Jessica Freeman: To think too much about it. I'm trying to

33
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.080

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.640
Jessica Freeman: Activity as well. So, you know, yesterday was gorgeous and the day before was gorgeous. So to go outside and

37
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:22.830
Jessica Freeman: You know, I mean it's not great. It's not ideal. I don't think it's ideal for anyone. I don't like the fact that I had to go to the store and buy all this shit and like

38
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:31.860
Jessica Freeman: You know, fight the lines and everybody freaking out, like, it's not the virus that scares me its people and what they might do.

39
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.840
Jessica Freeman: Because people get crazy. And this is going to be a huge tech test of character for our country. I don't have high hopes.

40
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.630
Jessica Freeman: Ever country.

41
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

42
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You definitely saw that in the beginning of the of the whole

43
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Panic, you know,

44
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.460
Jessica Freeman: I haven't run the mad toilet

45
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.570
Jessica Freeman: My mom sent me a picture of like

46
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.590
Jessica Freeman: Gollum from The Lord of the Rings and instead of holding a ring. He's got toilet paper insanity.

47
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey,

48
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That definitely is correct.

49
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

50
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.830
Jessica Freeman: Are nuts. I'm actually, um, I think, you know, because I'm alone here with my son and

51
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.890
Jessica Freeman: I think I might borrow one of my step dad's guns like be really careful with it because I am not a gun person. I do not want a gun in the house. I'm not a fan of the whole idea.

52
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:44.970
Jessica Freeman: At all. But, you know, being super, super careful, making sure you know little hands can't get into it. Um, but just, just in case if I would rather have it and not have to use it, then, you know, something happened and then wish that I had it, you know.

53
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.420
Yeah.

54
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.170
Jessica Freeman: My house threatens my family and tries to take what's mine. You know, people are nuts.

55
00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:05.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they really are. Very much so. And keeping yourself safe is going to be, you know, really important you know through this, especially since it is you and your son, you know, by yourself. Yeah.

56
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:18.150
Jessica Freeman: And, you know, my mom and Bob. They have our backs. My mom's going to brave the store today and get me like a gallon of milk and some children's Tylenol, just to have on hand.

57
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:26.010
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, we're make sure I'm prepared because they're saying, I mean pretty much everybody's going to get touched by this at some point. So,

58
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:36.660
Jessica Freeman: You know I young I'm healthy and children are doing really well with it. So I'm not afraid of, like, oh, the virus is going to kill me or I'm it's more like you know people

59
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.010
Yeah.

60
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, is it been like a crazy in your area.

61
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:53.400
Jessica Freeman: I mean, not as crazy as some other areas. But yeah, I mean, I went to the store on Friday. And you know the shelves are empty.

62
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.720
Yeah.

63
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:12.000
Jessica Freeman: Just and I you know I try not to inundate myself with the news and but I do want to keep up on it. So, you know, I look at the CDC website. I look at the, you know, state of New Mexico, Department of Health website just kind of keep up to speed. I've been trying to listen to

64
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.850
Jessica Freeman: You know, the federal government's announcements about protocol and what their plans are some of the press conferences that they are having

65
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.970
Jessica Freeman: And you know I feel okay about it. I'm not, I'm not living in fear here. Good.

66
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good.

67
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I had to tell it, you know, everybody you know yesterday in Group talking about you know where you get your information from is really vitally important and not sitting

68
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:50.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In you know the TV or the internet on it all the time, but really just, you know, check it out, and then get away from it. And, you know, just kind of live your life and

69
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, give yourself permission to keep updated on it but pay attention to where you're getting information from

70
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

71
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.690
Jessica Freeman: Absolutely like credible sources.

72
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.560
Jessica Freeman: And me.

73
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.090
Jessica Freeman: Not Fox News.

74
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes.

75
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.230
Jessica Freeman: Also, I got myself.

76
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.170
Jessica Freeman: A coloring

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.590
Jessica Freeman: And working

78
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.010
Jessica Freeman: Course, I've been working on this used to help me in early recovery.

79
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.670
Jessica Freeman: I could barely sit still through meetings.

80
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, nice.

81
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.950
Jessica Freeman: On that one and finished 1000 piece puzzle. And I have another really cool puzzle they dive into

82
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.930
Jessica Freeman: You know, and I'm also binge watching. I ain't gonna lie.

83
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I did.

84
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:53.310
Jessica Freeman: Well, this season three of Ozark comes out on March 27 so I rewatch that whole thing and I, I always enjoyed like the political drama in house of cards and it's got like

85
00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:04.650
Jessica Freeman: I don't even remember how many seasons, but I always liked it so doing that watched a couple movies. Did you know that the movie outbreak is in the top 10 on Netflix right now.

86
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.740
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I watched it last week.

87
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:17.670
Jessica Freeman: No, they had it like limited to that tiny little town, and then we're going to blow up the town. Oh yeah, see my manager. It's gorgeous.

88
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.870
Jessica Freeman: It is beautiful.

89
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very beautiful.

90
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Purple is my favorite color lavender purple.

91
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.180
Jessica Freeman: For spring to it's like

92
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.820
Jessica Freeman: Easily party now.

93
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:30.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good.

94
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:45.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Over here you know the the ladies at this shop over here, they call it, you're dating nail. I think you're not going to be able to get a man if you don't have the you know that one nail. You know, it's funny.

95
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is. So you started your new job and everything is going good there and you like it.

96
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.070
Jessica Freeman: Well, I mean, I'm working at home. What's not to like you.

97
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:06.630
Jessica Freeman: Know, I've got this really nice monitor and right now. My job is just to get up to speed on the software just learn how to use it and

98
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.490
Jessica Freeman: It's weird. I haven't met the people that are going to pay me, you know,

99
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

100
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.710
Jessica Freeman: We're not going to like, usually we would have like a team meeting.

101
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:33.420
Jessica Freeman: Uh huh, not doing that and I recommended zoom because I have found a plethora of our online. A meetings or recovery meetings. And so I've been. I've been doing that, I'm probably doing two or three a day, which is actually like, this is cool. I get to do meetings and I

102
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so it's kind of filling a need for me.

103
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

104
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.110
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, super good.

105
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:47.580
Jessica Freeman: And plus, like the people in Indy have put together a couple of meeting rooms, so I get to see my friends and

106
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's been. Wow.

107
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is really cool. My

108
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.820
Sponsor

109
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.490
Yeah.

110
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.170
Jessica Freeman: Women

111
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:14.610
Jessica Freeman: Cool. And then, you know, most of the ones that are out there that aren't the ones that I found in Indy they're like open recovery. So, you know, anybody like Na ca ha a and it's kind of secular, you know,

112
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.870
Jessica Freeman: And that's what I'm finding in the group therapy here. I mean, you get that in group therapy.

113
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:30.270
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, you know, people have people aren't working, the steps are not following you know the program, you just get people that are really struggling to try to recover or just there because they have to be

114
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:44.430
Jessica Freeman: Know, which kind of sucks. That's why I like strong a better because that's that's the only thing that's ever worked for me. I tried a bunch of other things and a if you do what you're supposed to do, then it's good.

115
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really good. Yeah, I know people keep trying to find I call them shortcuts.

116
00:11:51.330 --> 00:12:00.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there is no shortcuts. You know, there's one way to do it. And if you're not willing to go you know that path, then you know definitely the struggle is real.

117
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:01.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

118
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.150
Jessica Freeman: The easier softer way right

119
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, supposed to be.

120
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:16.650
Jessica Freeman: Actually this I mean the book. Ah, for me, is the easier softer way all the other stuff was a constant struggle all the other stuff didn't work.

121
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right when it doesn't, definitely not.

122
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:28.200
Jessica Freeman: But it's good that people have, you know, group therapy that they can go to and at least get a little more self aware

123
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:45.330
Jessica Freeman: You know, move closer to the solution be exposed to people that that have it you know that have the solution like me. I'm one of the lucky very blessed people you know a lot of us don't recover most of us most of us don't recover.

124
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.020
Yeah.

125
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:53.940
Jessica Freeman: It sucks, remind me to tell you all about Scientology boot camp. I went to for five months in 2012

126
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.140
No.

127
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:57.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me about it.

128
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:07.560
Jessica Freeman: It was ridiculous. It was well they have this whole routine. So you go and then you're in like the withdrawal unit, but they don't

129
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:15.240
Jessica Freeman: Like if you're on prescriptions, you're not on prescriptions anymore when you get there, they take everything away, even though it's like a risk to some people's health.

130
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:23.370
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, no, you're done, you don't get to take any medicines, not even ibuprofen. If you have a headache. You get sodium and potassium

131
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.230
Jessica Freeman: It's seriously and they they've had some deaths because of

132
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:36.060
Jessica Freeman: medical situations where they've taken people off their meds, they need their men's and then they have serious health problems.

133
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.510
Jessica Freeman: That's happened. There's been a few deaths. In fact, there's like a Dateline.

134
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:57.840
Jessica Freeman: A Dateline episode. That's all about the. It's called Narconon it's an Oklahoma and it's Scientology fucking boot camp rehab is what it is. So then if you survived. You survived the withdraw, then they put you in another physically demanding.

135
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:08.670
Jessica Freeman: Ruling situation where you take mass quantities of niacin, and you sit in a sauna for like five, six hours a day.

136
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:22.590
Jessica Freeman: And they're looking for you to like stop reacting to the niacin. So when they just keep upping your dose. And when you get to like 3000 milligrams of niacin, and you're not turning red then

137
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:30.780
Jessica Freeman: Your system is to text and you're done with sauna, then they put you in class 12 hours a day where you're learning

138
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:42.210
Jessica Freeman: To call PRS I can't remember what it stands for. But try and there's like 12 different things that you gotta learn how to do and some of them.

139
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:55.590
Jessica Freeman: Are like sitting in a chair sitting across from someone sitting in a chair, staring at each other for like two hours. Okay. Not sneezing not scratching not looking away not

140
00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:09.660
Jessica Freeman: You know, no coughing, nothing. You have to sit there and stare for two hours. Okay. And then they have other things where they're trying to teach you how to handle and other person hands.

141
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.360
Jessica Freeman: On like where your try where you're like,

142
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:19.860
Jessica Freeman: Your body language and the way that you maneuver another person is, you know, during control.

143
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:29.880
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, that's, I mean, that's the majority of it right there. And then once you do that, they give you a little coloring book with that with words about

144
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:41.040
Jessica Freeman: Oh, and another thing that they start at the very beginning is when you're reading. If you like mess up on a word. You have to go back to the very beginning and start over.

145
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:48.480
Jessica Freeman: But first you have to look up the word that you missed in the dictionary. And like look at six other words that are like synonyms.

146
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.580
Jessica Freeman: So they understand

147
00:15:50.700 --> 00:16:01.710
Jessica Freeman: That word then you won't slip up on it, then you have to start back at the very beginning and read it and if you slip up at all. I'm a good reader. So I did find that there were people that were in that class.

148
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:11.460
Jessica Freeman: And it's indefinite there's no end to it. You have to jump through their hoops until they're satisfied. I was there for five months there have been people there for longer.

149
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.360
Jessica Freeman: Like there's one

150
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.290
Jessica Freeman: Jimmy has been there for two years. I mean, it's insane.

151
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

152
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.190
So what did you

153
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:27.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What did you learn out of it. Did you, did you learn anything and it did it help you in it with in your recovery.

154
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:37.800
Jessica Freeman: Well, the thing is, all they focus on these drugs they're trying to detox from drugs. I mean even the people that work there drink so yeah

155
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.570
Jessica Freeman: It's backwards.

156
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.910
Jessica Freeman: I mean, L. Ron Hubbard was a big drinker. I don't know if you noticed, but he, you know, L. Ron

157
00:16:46.290 --> 00:17:03.930
Jessica Freeman: You know that every single Scientology facility anywhere worldwide has an office decorated like 1960s style like late 50s, early 60s, like just the way that oh, Ron Hubbard had his office. There's a room in every building that is L. Ron Hubbard's office.

158
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.270
Jessica Freeman: No creepy.

159
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

160
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:15.930
Jessica Freeman: Seriously, what did I take from it. Um, well, I had to fucking finish it. And this was at a time before I learned any of the

161
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:24.360
Jessica Freeman: I mean I I got myself kicked out because I thought if I got home, I had a friend. Get me a bus ticket and

162
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:39.390
Jessica Freeman: I thought that if I got home and I showed my parents all this stuff you know about what it was really like that they wouldn't think we finished but you know I wasn't going to see my son Brendan again or be welcomed back by my family until I finished. So I went back and

163
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.360
Jessica Freeman: I learned how to

164
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:53.640
Jessica Freeman: I learned a lot from the people there because you know if you spend a lot of time with drug addicts or like people in prison, you pick up some skills that you can use. I learned a lot of that.

165
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:05.940
Jessica Freeman: And just like the the will to to finish. I mean, my, my parents let me quit everything when I was a kid, if I didn't like it. If I would rather stay home and watch TV. My parents let me quit.

166
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:13.140
Jessica Freeman: So I didn't have a lot of stick to it Ignis. So that was something I mean I just had to put my head down and get it done.

167
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what was the requirements for graduating for completing

168
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.990
Jessica Freeman: Well, you had to get through all of you had to get through there was like eight courses and sauna was number two.

169
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:31.860
Jessica Freeman: So you got withdraw. You got sauna and then you got six other courses where you know you're doing

170
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.680
Jessica Freeman: The stuff that I described earlier.

171
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any

172
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cognitive thought changing or

173
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.060
Jessica Freeman: brainwashing for sure brainwashing

174
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:57.960
Jessica Freeman: And then they would let people stay and work there that had graduated from the program so like somebody that you were just sitting next to you in class. Okay.

175
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:09.000
Jessica Freeman: Who you know you were in withdraw with, you know, now they're barking orders at you and telling you to look shit up in the dictionary and I mean it was a cluster.

176
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

177
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.990
Jessica Freeman: really sick really sick stuff.

178
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the only time that you went to treatment.

179
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.800
Jessica Freeman: And

180
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:39.330
Jessica Freeman: Residential to detox in 2016 and then I started my life weapon 2016 okay my mom took everything away from me, my boyfriend took my baby and left and I you know I lost

181
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:51.930
Jessica Freeman: My phone my home, my car. You know, I hadn't been working anyway because I was I was living in, you know, lifestyle, but I couldn't keep them at work. Are you kidding me.

182
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.150
Jessica Freeman: Anyway, um,

183
00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:06.600
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, to try to get my life back. I went to fair banks and then when I was in Fairbanks, that's when I learned bit like everything can gone to shit so

184
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:24.390
Jessica Freeman: The next few months where I saw out treatment. I went to this place aspire of Indiana like outpatient stuff. And honestly, if you want somebody to relapse and die. Send them to aspire Indiana. It was really

185
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:36.450
Jessica Freeman: Destructive disruptive. They didn't work with you to help you get better. You know, if you fucked up. You were out just out and it didn't take much. You know, I mean I fucked up a lot when I first came in.

186
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:56.850
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, then I finally I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. And so I looked into the treatment facilities in my area, which would be the best, and I found Midtown and Midtown was amazing. And they had not only like a whole camp, you know, campus for borderline

187
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:13.050
Jessica Freeman: But also they had, you know, dual diagnosis, treatment and they they worked with me. They let me come in, you know what, or not come in, you know, they just they made it so that it wasn't alienating

188
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:13.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was

189
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.690
Jessica Freeman: I knew they were there to help me.

190
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:28.350
Jessica Freeman: And then I still was you know fucking around and unable to stop, even though I was trying really hard and I wanted desperately to stop, but I'm an alcoholic and drug addict. I

191
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:34.200
Jessica Freeman: couldn't stop on my own. So I'm trying, I'm trying to trying and failing miserably. So I get arrested.

192
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:41.130
Jessica Freeman: And then after that I had to go live in a recovery house so like everything that I own went in storage.

193
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:49.800
Jessica Freeman: I WENT TO LIVE IN THE RECOVERY HOUSE. I was there for like four and a half, five months and I worked a program of Alcoholics Anonymous with very strict

194
00:21:50.430 --> 00:22:08.430
Jessica Freeman: Rules and accountability and requirements and curfews and chests and this that the other. And so I was there and I did pretty well. I finally got a hold of the program. I finally learned how I could stop like really stuff like this is how you do it.

195
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:09.930
When

196
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.000
Jessica Freeman: You want to eat.

197
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.300
Jessica Freeman: Name is coming soon. Um,

198
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.180
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, so then, but then I

199
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:36.900
Jessica Freeman: Didn't follow the suggestions to, you know, not date for the first year and then I'd had a little relationship with another guy in recovery and that blew up. And at that point I was out of the recovery house. I didn't have any rules. You know, I had my own place. And so

200
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:43.260
Jessica Freeman: You know that that began my year of relapse where I was sober more than I wasn't

201
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:52.890
Jessica Freeman: But still, I mean, I couldn't make it past. Sometimes it was, you know, three days. Sometimes, there was three weeks, sometimes it was like 33 days but

202
00:22:53.670 --> 00:23:05.730
Jessica Freeman: Going in and out. And then at that point that it became a year since I had started with my stupid revolving door relapse. I was like, This is ridiculous. I know what I want to be doing. And I'm going to do it.

203
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:06.600
Yeah.

204
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.810
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, that's

205
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.770
Jessica Freeman: My story HTTP.

206
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, that's a good story. Definitely.

207
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.820
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, thanks.

208
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's funny because you know we are talking last week about

209
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know service work and getting out of

210
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:41.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yourself and then all of this kind of got tightened up. And you know what kind of service work. Do you think that you can do when you are stuck at home.

211
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:43.410
You know what I mean.

212
00:23:44.970 --> 00:24:03.210
Jessica Freeman: I don't know. I'm trying to be kind to people and I'm attending meetings, but just between you and me. I haven't shared in a meeting, yet I just like leave my video off and except with the indie people I turn my video on there, but I just haven't shared anything

213
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.440
Jessica Freeman: I don't know everybody's in survival mode right now.

214
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.280
Yeah.

215
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:16.440
Jessica Freeman: I don't know. I did write a couple really positive reviews for some companies online. That's good.

216
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:26.940
Jessica Freeman: And I guess I could like call people. I was thinking about checking in on my former spawn see Pamela. I haven't talked to her while I'm not giving her a call even going through the phone list just calling people

217
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.630
Still, yeah.

218
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.310
Jessica Freeman: Listening.

219
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: checking up on people.

220
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Making Connections, you know,

221
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.470
Jessica Freeman: Helping people to feel less isolated. Yeah.

222
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a great idea.

223
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. And being present when you're in those meetings.

224
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.830
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I've been listening but

225
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:58.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You and there's that you you recognize that reservation.

226
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:10.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because here's the thing. You have a lot to give you have a lot to offer people. But remember, you know what a says you can't keep it if you don't give it away.

227
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And so if you're there and you're listening, but you're not contributing your part to that, you know, then you're hoarding

228
00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What other people can benefit from

229
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

230
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:39.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if you just if you did it in a whim all women's meeting and just made yourself you know present and made yourself known and, you know, got your

231
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know experience strength and hope out there. I'm telling you, you be or maybe you wouldn't be amazed. Maybe you know that you know you could definitely help you know somebody know that it's doable, you know. Yeah.

232
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.460
I mean,

233
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:02.790
Jessica Freeman: I just haven't been feeling like I'm in tip top spiritual shape and

234
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.250
Jessica Freeman: You know that makes me have that reservation.

235
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.520
Jessica Freeman: To see what do I really have to offer. Yeah.

236
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:18.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need that is a self defeating self talk you know template that you have got to pull yourself out of because you have a lot to offer people

237
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:38.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what your story. What you've experienced how you got to where you're at, you know what I mean you're a single mom, and you are. You just moved your whole life, you know, from one place to the other. You are strong you are independent and you are full blown in recovery.

238
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:39.930
I

239
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.300
Jessica Freeman: Know that a lot of people

240
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:53.940
Jessica Freeman: You know, could use that kind of link. Hope you know if it works for her because things got really bad, Rebecca, I lost both my kids I lost both of my children.

241
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:55.590
Jessica Freeman: And

242
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.660
Jessica Freeman: Honestly, I think that the only reason I'm alive.

243
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.660
Jessica Freeman: Because I got so

244
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.950
Jessica Freeman: I got so down. You know, like I just didn't even want to like keep breathing. I was so miserable.

245
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.090
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, you

246
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.490
Jessica Freeman: Know isn't their kids.

247
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: is horrible.

248
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:16.770
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

249
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.560
Jessica Freeman: But on the other side.

250
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, and you're on the other side of it. That's what I'm saying, you know, there are women out there that are in that beginning phase you know that

251
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: feel hopeless.

252
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.640
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I, I wish that I could get connected with with exactly those people, you know,

253
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:46.950
Jessica Freeman: I don't know how to find people except to just, you know, cast a wide net, I guess.

254
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:47.700
Mm hmm.

255
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:55.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And you could throw it in the, you know, in the forums and just say, Hey, you know, moms that you know you moms that are struggling with

256
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, losing their children and trying to get their life back on track. You know, I have experience and, you know, hoping that you know what I mean just but really just kind of putting it out there, you could create your own

257
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, women's meeting for women like that you know that have gone through or in the beginning phases of that struggle, you know, to mean and there's the connection. You know what I mean, there's that piece.

258
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.330
Was

259
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.340
Jessica Freeman: Struggling

260
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.820
Jessica Freeman: You think you think it could do them.

261
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I believe you can do that. Definitely. You have a very

262
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.210
Jessica Freeman: I'm just

263
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.050
Jessica Freeman: Going to care and

264
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. I'll wait. I'll wait a second help your mama.

265
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.960
Jessica Freeman: We're just getting started. Okay, thanks for coming.

266
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.520
Jessica Freeman: I'll be fine.

267
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.080
Jessica Freeman: Up. Good boy, Gary.

268
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.030
Jessica Freeman: All right.

269
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.880
Jessica Freeman: Moving it along.

270
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:41.310
Jessica Freeman: So, so what would I do I put it out there like some of my mom's groups like

271
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:51.990
Jessica Freeman: I mean some moms groups and then I wish there was a way I could get recovery and autism moms in the same

272
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bed, too. There's a lot of

273
00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:07.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: moms that are struggling with, you know, with the same thing. And maybe they don't know that that's what's going on with their child. But, you know, definitely.

274
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There is a need

275
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:21.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know somebody else and that just found out that her son is on the autistic spectrum and she's in recovery and

276
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:29.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to learn how to walk through it and deal with it and all the testing and all the doctors appointments that come with it and

277
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the needs of it, and how do you comply with, you know, really giving your child everything that that they need so that the comfortable and they grow and they learn and they, you know what I mean. Yeah.

278
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:55.710
Jessica Freeman: Oh, believe me, I know I've been doing it for years. It's hard. It's, I mean, and they don't make anything. Easy. Nothing. I mean, you have to push and push and persist and call and you have to do the legwork. You got to do all of it.

279
00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of amazing. And with with, you know, moms that don't know or you know don't have that information. You know where to go, how to reach out, you know, being persistent. It's like, you know, they

280
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At least the other person that I know there was a long time where she was just stuck.

281
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I had no idea you know she felt like everything that she was doing was wrong.

282
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then what she learned

283
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:27.750
Jessica Freeman: What she learned

284
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.730
Jessica Freeman: It can be really

285
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:35.040
Jessica Freeman: Overwhelming. When you look for resources because there's so much out there.

286
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:45.450
Jessica Freeman: And then you've got like the super moms who've been doing it for like 20 years and they know every day. I mean, it made me kind of shut down like okay you're speaking a different language.

287
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:52.260
Jessica Freeman: I don't even know I follow you. So I mean, for me, most of it. I've just I've just kind of like

288
00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:00.660
Jessica Freeman: Followed, you know, gone down the rabbit hole with things that I wanted to learn more about and when there was something specific. I wanted to learn about

289
00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:14.670
Jessica Freeman: And then I would, you know, reach out in my facebook groups. And also remember that, you know, for every one piece of good advice that you're that you can use, there's, you know, 100 shitty piece of advice that you don't

290
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:25.350
Jessica Freeman: You don't need to compare yourself to other moms and you should never compare your child to other children because every kid with ASD is 100% unique

291
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, their needs are different, how they respond to things are different.

292
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The routine is different.

293
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:44.490
Jessica Freeman: How they learn you know what their little for lack of a better word, you know, fetishes are because they're all into different things, you know,

294
00:32:45.240 --> 00:33:06.330
Jessica Freeman: All the different things. I know one boy with autism who is obsessed with plastic bottles so his mom's house is covered in plastic bottles. Now, my kid. Oh my god. I mean, he likes. He likes to chew on stuff. So we have a way to deal with the chewing. I mean, he wears a bed, and he has like

295
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:15.990
Jessica Freeman: They call not overlap muslin cloth that are like per class that I can like snap around his neck, you

296
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:28.710
Jessica Freeman: Know, he'll go to town on one. But you know his clothes are fine because it's covered with the bed. Yeah, to swap them out, you know, and he's fine with it and it doesn't make a mess. And he gets his chew on.

297
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This self soothing, you know,

298
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.110
Jessica Freeman: Every kid has a different thing.

299
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing, you know, you have all this knowledge and all this experience and I 100%

300
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have faith in the fact that there are women out there that need to hear

301
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you have to offer.

302
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, tell me a little bit about your spiritual disconnect

303
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:12.060
Jessica Freeman: When it happened up a while back, like probably about a year, not quite. A year ago saying the end of last summer.

304
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:27.240
Jessica Freeman: And my sponsor got cancer and like she couldn't sponsor me anymore. And that sponsor relationship my recovery has never been better like she was awesome. We work together really well.

305
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:39.960
Jessica Freeman: You know, our schedules worked out, just everything just and she you know she worked me real hard, like I had to do a lot of stuff. And it was really good. I'm not great at like pushing myself.

306
00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:52.410
Jessica Freeman: And I, I need somebody who is like not bossy per se because I get enough that from my mom, you know, but somebody who is at least

307
00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:01.770
Jessica Freeman: A little strict. I mean, I do need some some structure. I need some structure I lack self discipline.

308
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, which, you know, a lot of a lot of people really do, but

309
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you could base helping others off of what you got out of that relationship with your sponsor.

310
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I didn't think about all

311
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.480
Jessica Freeman: I was a really good sponsor.

312
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.910
Jessica Freeman: When she was my sponsor.

313
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:39.270
Jessica Freeman: But I mean, I've had like two sponsors since then. Well actually this I'm on my third since then and I don't really like changing up sponsors like this, but it's been it's been necessary like I want to be the same person, but

314
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:45.030
Jessica Freeman: It's just been a necessary evil, and now I'm in a new place. So I obviously was going to need a new sponsor.

315
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:53.310
Jessica Freeman: I got one, it's just cool but she's busy, I'm busy. We don't talk like we, you know, talk very often.

316
00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:02.130
Jessica Freeman: Gets the self discipline thing. It's like making myself do the things that I know needs to be done.

317
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:02.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

318
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.500
Jessica Freeman: Just kind of fall down on that.

319
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.380
Jessica Freeman: It's been, it's been a while. I just

320
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:14.490
Jessica Freeman: And I was like, praying and reading and I've just kind of fallen off and at that

321
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is what about listening to

322
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So uplifting music

323
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.720
Jessica Freeman: I listen to music.

324
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.430
Jessica Freeman: I do

325
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.260
Jessica Freeman: Like pop music I'm a radio show.

326
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:41.760
Jessica Freeman: Hey that's uplifting every Friday. They do this thing called the weekend and blast off. I don't know if I mentioned this.

327
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:55.860
Jessica Freeman: Where they play. They take like you know 10 or 15 minutes and instead of playing like all the stuff that's on the radio, they'll do like throwbacks I still play some old school hip hop. They'll even sneak in, like, a country song in there. They did Dolly Parton last week.

328
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:09.540
Jessica Freeman: Or some old school, whatever, like, just some real upbeat like fun. We can use it and they just play like you know the hook or whatever and then they'll move to the next. It's like, is it always makes me dance.

329
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:18.510
Jessica Freeman: And then it's always fun. And I haven't on podcast, so I can listen to it anytime I want. So I be listening to the weekend last off quite a bit. Awesome.

330
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Good. Anything that's going to bring up, lift, you know, uplift your spirits uplift your, you know, emotions, put you in that happy space.

331
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, because even with everything that's going on out in the world. It's like when you really take a self. Look, it's like things internally and things inside your world are pretty awesome.

332
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.370
Jessica Freeman: I agree. They are they really are.

333
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

334
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:57.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so being able to hold on to that and realize, you know that you have your I think this was the biggest eye opening thing for me was when I realized that I am not controlled

335
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:08.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: By anything that my life and my choices are mine and mine alone. And if I fall down. And if I make the wrong one, I get to get back up and make a different one.

336
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:09.780
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

337
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, I don't have to beat myself down because I make wrong choices because I'm human, and I make mistakes.

338
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:26.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the whole world is like really open. You can do whatever you want be whoever you want you know you're, you're in charge of that car.

339
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's just for me, instead of being afraid of it for you know most of my life. I was afraid of it, and I get to that you got to get to this point where fear is no longer controlling it, and it's just, it's amazing, you know,

340
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:44.490
Yeah.

341
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what you get to bring

342
00:38:48.240 --> 00:39:00.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To other people. You get to bring that you know that freedom and you know that love and respect and all the things that you have to offer the information your hope.

343
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

344
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:17.100
Jessica Freeman: People do need to hear it because that's how they that's how they get hope for themselves, that when they see that other people have done it and are doing it and that it's sustainable, it's

345
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:27.030
Jessica Freeman: I remember when I first came in, somebody said they had two years. I'm like, How in God's name. I mean, you must be lying. There's no way

346
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.020
Jessica Freeman: No, that's not

347
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:29.790
Possible.

348
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here you are. Look at you.

349
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Now you're that person saying that you know what I mean. And that newcomers sitting back there saying, how is that

350
00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How is that possible. You know what I mean.

351
00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:45.300
Jessica Freeman: Yes, I do.

352
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even connecting with people in that way and just, you know, letting them know that you, you know, in the beginning, you felt the same way.

353
00:39:54.510 --> 00:40:07.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you didn't feel like it was possible, and that you felt hopeless. And you know what I mean. You had no idea how it was going to happen. But you're going to give it your best and really talking about what you put into getting where you're at.

354
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:17.070
Jessica Freeman: A lot of it was a change in motives. You know, when I was just trying to get my life back. And I was just trying to get my consequences over and done with.

355
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:26.160
Jessica Freeman: I wasn't successful, but when I started examining those motives and started trying to do the right thing, just for the sake of the right thing.

356
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:35.340
Jessica Freeman: You know, things changed. And I really it doesn't even take that much effort if you just have your mind, in your heart right everything else just falls into place.

357
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:42.060
Jessica Freeman: You know, greedy. That's what I was telling my sponsors, like when they're first starting out, you don't have to worry about this. You don't have to worry about that.

358
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:50.550
Jessica Freeman: All you have to do is just keep doing the next right thing. That's it. That's all I have to worry about today. Okay. And then, you know, we'll talk we'll get there, you'll get there.

359
00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.230
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, that's, I mean, that's what's bottom line.

360
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bottom line, that's right.

361
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.300
Jessica Freeman: For some people, that bottom line includes, you know, just don't drink today.

362
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:09.120
Jessica Freeman: And that's what you gotta do. That's what you gotta do, but it gets so much better than that. It gets easier than that.

363
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.300
Jessica Freeman: That that next right thing is what's vital.

364
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:15.060
Jessica Freeman: When

365
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:16.110
There is your hope.

366
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:23.070
Jessica Freeman: I don't know if you know this might be a surprise to you. I'm actually a pretty good writer.

367
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.290
Jessica Freeman: And a few that

368
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I didn't know that.

369
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.360
Jessica Freeman: I actually really enjoy writing

370
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.940
Jessica Freeman: Maybe I should spend some time doing that.

371
00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why don't you have a blog. Why don't you have

372
00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:53.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something that really talks about, you know, being a woman in recovery with, you know, a child with autism and, you know, you make a connection people's people start grabbing a hold and listening and, you know, learning

373
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From that

374
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.750
Jessica Freeman: Connection. So I would be great.

375
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.370
Jessica Freeman: It would be helpful. I think for everyone, not just me.

376
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.040
Jessica Freeman: I think everyone needs some connection right now.

377
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:13.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. I think that's why it's it's kind of important that the next time you go into a meeting that you turn your video on

378
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you'd be present.

379
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:18.690
Jessica Freeman: And maybe talk

380
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And maybe talk. That's right. Instead of just listening but really

381
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, putting

382
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: putting yourself out there a little bit and saying this is who I am. And this is where I'm at. And this is what I've done. And this is you know how I got here and I think you're going to be pretty amazed on the people that

383
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Needed to hear it.

384
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.

385
00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:58.740
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, but you know, it's, I need to hear it because I I have alcoholic thinking and my brain tells me, nobody wants to hear anything you have to say, you know,

386
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:15.870
Jessica Freeman: They're just going to think you're dumb or, you know, I mean, I remember when I first I didn't want to hear shit like nobody could tell me anything until they could, yeah. So maybe, yeah. If I put myself out there.

387
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.630
Jessica Freeman: It'll help somebody else.

388
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.380
Yeah.

389
00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:31.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely and you know you know that that negative thought process and that negative thinking that's your addiction. What is your one thing that your addiction. It has one job period.

390
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that is to take you out.

391
00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It wants to grab ahold of your back and take it, take it out and it can be subtle with those negative thoughts.

392
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why would you want to go. Why would you want to go into a meeting and turn on your video. And why would you want other people to hear what your story is, you don't have anything to offer them. It's so much crap.

393
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's what it wants you to believe it wants you to be down on yourself. You know, it wants to. It wants you back.

394
00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:03.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it will go to any means necessary to make that happen. You know what I mean. And so when you have those negative thoughts come in your head, you gotta battle them with

395
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:11.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that is crap. I know you're trying to reel me back in, you know, you gotta let go with me because I have came this far. And I'm not coming back to you.

396
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.960
Jessica Freeman: You know,

397
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just about really putting your diction. You know, I

398
00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is my perception of our addiction is that it's that you know we have voices in our head that talk to us. We have, we do battle, and that's one of the voices and when it's in control.

399
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:40.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We are in a negative headspace we believe the lies that it tells us we believe were unworthy. You know, we believe everything that it tells us, because it wants to keep us locked in that dark hole.

400
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.040
Jessica Freeman: No, it's like my voice.

401
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:55.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, I, I got a name to it. I got a face to it. And when I'm struggling with it, I, I've got a big ol huge role duct tape.

402
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I put it over its mouth.

403
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:17.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I tied up in the corner of my brain. I literally visualize doing that because that's what helps me feel that I'm in control and that I know that it's not gonna, I'm not going to allow it to take me out might be something else, you know, and that's fine. But in my mind.

404
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It will not take me out.

405
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.080
Jessica Freeman: That's good.

406
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so you think about that, and you have the power to do that inside your brain, Jessica, you know it.

407
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You do. You're a very strong woman.

408
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:39.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have that power. And that's the great part about it is that you have that power here.

409
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:40.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

410
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.880
Jessica Freeman: You're making me blush.

411
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's true, you know, you can distinguish

412
00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: reality and truth from from the lies that it tells you you can, you know, and there's little, little cues like any negative any negative thought process that tells you you're not good enough. That tells you that

413
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's something better for you that life wasn't so bad.

414
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, when it starts telling you those things, you know, you know,

415
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can identify it.

416
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:25.080
Jessica Freeman: As a drink. Sounds like a good idea, then I know I'm in a bad place.

417
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly, exactly. And

418
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:39.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if your thought process is you have nothing to offer other people in recovery and that you just need to sit back and listen.

419
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The opposite action needs to happen.

420
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.090
Jessica Freeman: I can, I can Chilean

421
00:46:51.270 --> 00:47:01.560
Jessica Freeman: There are several online meetings and the indie one is happening at 430 my time every day. So, and that's a women's meeting.

422
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.840
Jessica Freeman: And honestly, it used to be my home group and

423
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:19.260
Jessica Freeman: I ended up having a lot of like self confidence issues because of that meeting. So maybe instead of going to that meeting, I should start a new meeting. So I got zoom, I can do it. I know how to moderate

424
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can do that. Yeah.

425
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.530
Jessica Freeman: I know how to get it out there. I can do that.

426
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know that there are a lot of women in New Mexico that

427
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:36.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are desperately looking for a connection are desperately needing you know to be in a place of hope.

428
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

429
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:49.350
Jessica Freeman: Yeah and you know with this whole situation that's going on right now. I've been thinking, you know, if I were in active alcoholism or active addiction right now. With all this going on.

430
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:58.950
Jessica Freeman: Oh my god, I would be a mess like it would be really bad. I mean, I would be, you know, probably camped out at my dealers house and like

431
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:13.140
Jessica Freeman: spend all my money all my money on like, you know, drugs and alcohol all this because you know the panic. Oh my god, I'm going to run out and not gonna be able to get what I need drugs, alcohol.

432
00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:19.500
Jessica Freeman: I mean, that would that would be how it is. And when I think about the people that are there right now.

433
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:27.150
Jessica Freeman: You know, maybe I could just kind of ponder that a little bit longer and think how I can what what I could do to help those people

434
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.030
Jessica Freeman: Because this, this can't be easy.

435
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:31.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well gosh know

436
00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.300
Jessica Freeman: That it's miserable.

437
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about the people that are in early recovery and their

438
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:44.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their group that they're so used to go into has been cancelled.

439
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.810
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, that's

440
00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.940
Jessica Freeman: A lot of money.

441
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:56.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so their connection to other people has, you know, in early recovery has just been stopped.

442
00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:05.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, there's a panic that goes there. There's a fear. What am I going to do now, how am I going to make it through this. What am I, you know, how am I going to stay sober.

443
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:07.890
Jessica Freeman: You know not to

444
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.790
Jessica Freeman: Is there. That's a struggle. I mean an early recovery.

445
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.450
Jessica Freeman: Every hour is a big deal.

446
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

447
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:24.060
Jessica Freeman: And the people in the recovery houses that don't have like smartphones or internet and they're just like, stuck there.

448
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.500
Jessica Freeman: Up. Hmm. There's a lot of need out there. There's a lot of me.

449
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.760
Jessica Freeman: There's a lot of me. I need to like sit down and think about it.

450
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just brought something up.

451
00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:36.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Recovery houses.

452
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in the area that I live in. I know that there's a recovery house literally right around the corner and they hold regular meetings regular meetings there all the time.

453
00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:55.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: After this whole thing is over with, that might be something you know for you to consider.

454
00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.850
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, cuz I've been there, man. Have I been there.

455
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:03.810
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I think my story can help.

456
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.240
Jessica Freeman: Those people for sure.

457
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:08.910
Jessica Freeman: And maybe like

458
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:21.060
Jessica Freeman: I don't know, maybe I could call around and some of them to talk about the women's meaning that that that you know i'll do i'm i'm sitting. I'm sitting up a women's meeting and

459
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:36.120
Jessica Freeman: Maybe if there's no you know smart phones or internet or whatever. Maybe the people that run the House would be willing to, you know, do an open forum where people can participate in an online meeting. I don't know.

460
00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:48.360
Jessica Freeman: Yes. Good idea is those people, they need. They need all the resources they can get. And since they're so diminished right now and what what we can do and it's just getting started, it's not getting better anytime soon.

461
00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:55.230
Jessica Freeman: That might be a really good way to go because those people really need it. Yeah.

462
00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. And what you have to offer is huge.

463
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what really really is your mindset where what you think about recovery, how you got to where you're at your story. Everything plays a factor in it you know that you know

464
00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:24.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so instead of sitting in that self doubt that people don't want to hear you and that you don't have anything was saying, You've got to combat that thought and say bull crap.

465
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I went through the bin. SO I'VE BEEN SOBER two years. And what did it take for me to get where on that.

466
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.100
Jessica Freeman: Some of it was mistakes.

467
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.660
Jessica Freeman: Some of that was failure.

468
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:43.410
Jessica Freeman: You know, I learned more from that year of relapse than I, you know, that I have probably in the past few months.

469
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

470
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:54.390
Jessica Freeman: Making mistakes and failing and having to start over, doesn't mean that you're doing it wrong. It's just part of the process.

471
00:51:54.900 --> 00:52:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. And oftentimes, you know what happens. What I've seen happen. Anyways, is people that that relapse and they try to come back.

472
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:10.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Into the same meetings. The first couple times. It's like they're welcome and then it feels like

473
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:21.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From what I've witnessed it feels like all of a sudden, the people that were so accepting in the first, you know, two, and three times that they relapse, all of a sudden aren't so accepting anymore. It's more like

474
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, they're back. I wonder how long this time, that whole judgmental stance comes back in

475
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:34.530
Jessica Freeman: You know, timers are better about that, you know, but there, but they're still like there's a lot of

476
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.060
Jessica Freeman: There's a lot

477
00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:38.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot of that judgmental stance.

478
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:40.350
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I've been there.

479
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:49.800
Jessica Freeman: I collected a lot of starting over tokens at the meetings, but for me I think a lot of the lack of acceptance was in my head.

480
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:56.640
Jessica Freeman: And then part of the process of really doing it for real meant

481
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:04.170
Jessica Freeman: I mean like it contributed to why I didn't want to keep doing that, like, I don't want to keep coming in here.

482
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:07.530
Jessica Freeman: Like that. So that means I really have to do it for real.

483
00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.640
Jessica Freeman: That wasn't my biggest motivator.

484
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:15.000
Jessica Freeman: But certainly was a contributing factor.

485
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, it's humiliating you know it's it's embarrassing and it either will Britt draw you closer or it will push you farther away.

486
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:31.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, where you get to that point where you say, I'm not, I'm not doing it not going back in there and taking another

487
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: toy for our coin. I'm not doing it. You know, I don't want those people to see. You know what I mean, those people

488
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are the ones that in. I mean, this is in my own head, but they're the ones that need to be touched and treated with kindness and realize that they're in this whole process. And please don't give up.

489
00:53:52.440 --> 00:54:12.510
Jessica Freeman: Those when I was in my year relapse. I had some people from, you know, in my recovery group that just hung right hung in there with me the whole time and they would accept me if I was sober or not. And that spoke to me very loudly.

490
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:20.220
Jessica Freeman: And that and it was even more cause to celebrate once things finally did come together, you know. Yeah.

491
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:33.030
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, failure is part of the process. And there are some people like, oh, I've never relapsed good for you. That is part of most people's story most

492
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:41.430
Jessica Freeman: But, you know, it doesn't have to continue. It doesn't have to continue to be part of your story here to tell you that

493
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:42.690
Jessica Freeman: Because

494
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have people

495
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or I worked with people in the past that said, do you know how many times you know I've

496
00:54:49.350 --> 00:55:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Been to treatment and how many times that I've completed treatment and then went right back out used and you know in here. I'm sitting in that same place again and you know I turn around. And my response to them is what a gift.

497
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:19.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What a gift that you're able and that you're here in front of me present, you know, because they're already feeling that that giving up. You know, why am I even try this again. And you know, that's the whole piece.

498
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean that you get to give them

499
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you get to put out there in the universe. You know what I mean.

500
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:34.170
Jessica Freeman: You know, the only difference between what's happened in what can happen is your choices.

501
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:42.420
Jessica Freeman: You know, if it's something that you really want to do then you got to take a look at how far you willing to go right

502
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:53.400
Jessica Freeman: I don't want to go back to that shit ever again. So that means that I have accepted a higher power that exists and

503
00:55:54.900 --> 00:56:02.880
Jessica Freeman: You know, I do the stuff that I'm supposed to do. Not all of it. Not all the time, but I try. I'm human. We don't have to be perfect.

504
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.730
Jessica Freeman: What we really don't

505
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:08.400
Jessica Freeman: I

506
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.710
Jessica Freeman: Repeat that to myself. Yeah.

507
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're and here's another piece you know is that you're perfectly Jessica.

508
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No matter what that that means wouldn't, no matter what that looks like. You are perfectly you

509
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:31.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know you're humble, you're in, you know, you're learning things every day.

510
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, those are the things to keep inside your head. What do you have for me today to learn

511
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is it that I need to be open to today.

512
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:43.110
You know,

513
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just really

514
00:56:46.470 --> 00:57:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, bringing that piece around because you want that connection and you'll get it. If you're searching for it. But if you just accept the fact that you feel disconnected, then that's where you sit right because there's no work in it. Yeah.

515
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.090
Jessica Freeman: The work.

516
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.590
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I need to do some more work.

517
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:17.850
Jessica Freeman: And give it away. Yeah, I think that'll be helpful. I'm not in a bad place.

518
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:28.470
Jessica Freeman: But I'm fine, but I don't necessarily want to settle for the status quo. It's like if you're not growing, then you know you can start withering

519
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:29.100
Yeah.

520
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Complacency

521
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is it is not a good place to be.

522
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.480
Jessica Freeman: No, it's a dangerous place to be. When you're like me,

523
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:44.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. So get rid of those reservations. You know what I mean.

524
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

525
00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:48.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, do what you do.

526
00:57:51.960 --> 00:58:00.210
Jessica Freeman: This is very helpful. I just want you know like I'm taking things from our sessions and it's helping me. So thank you.

527
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:01.500
Jessica Freeman: Oh,

528
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:14.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thank you for being present and i mean i look forward to, to our sessions. I look forward to hearing you know where you're at and and your struggles and how you persevered through them, you know, on a weekly basis.

529
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:22.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because it gives, I don't know, it kind of charges me up for the next person that I see. You know what I mean. And

530
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's what the gift that you give me in these sessions. You know, it's kind of a two, a

531
00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Two way thing.

532
00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

533
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:42.570
Jessica Freeman: You have like I'm not asking any personal information but like are the majority of your patients like

534
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:46.950
Jessica Freeman: What's the word like engaged and

535
00:58:48.120 --> 00:59:01.710
Jessica Freeman: Really trying, or do you get a lot of like ambivalence apathy or maybe just ignorance. When I first came in, it was I just could not open my mind. You know, I don't know.

536
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:03.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that

537
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of fear in the very beginning.

538
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not understanding. I think that self help meetings have really

539
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Been given a label that is inaccurate and a lot of ways. Yeah, and it puts a lot of fear and people you know their Bible thumpers they're, you know, they're cold there this there that

540
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really be able to explain my experience in that manner.

541
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:38.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

542
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:46.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: supported them to be able to connect in their community has made a big difference, allowing them to see things from a different point of view.

543
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:47.370
Yeah.

544
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I really think that it's a lot of is just a lack of knowledge, you know,

545
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:58.470
Jessica Freeman: Like he said like ignorance and not not in a bad way. But it's just, you know, use your whole life.

546
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:12.000
Jessica Freeman: You know as an alcoholic and addict or whatever family background situation you have you've lived your life up to this point, you're an adult. And so, so many things are ingrained in your mind and it can be hard to change that.

547
01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:20.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. And fear, you know, there's also that fear of living without what you've been relying on for so long.

548
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:29.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, there you know and understanding that that's a part of part of the process to, you know, is learning different

549
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:41.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And for me, it's what I hear a lot is that self that self talk that negative self talk and I really try to combat that as hard as I can because I know that we live inside our head.

550
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:50.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is where diseases, you know, and we allow it to take control, then it'll wreck us, and I'll take us right back and

551
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:59.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so I really try to focus on that the power of God, the power that we have, you know, it's pretty amazing.

552
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.040
Jessica Freeman: It is when it's put to good use.

553
01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

554
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:21.150
Jessica Freeman: I was just telling mom and mom yesterday about how when I first got sober. I was like, every day feels like it's a week long like how you feel your time when that's all you've been doing, you know, what am I supposed to do with the days just felt so long.

555
01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:26.550
Jessica Freeman: They don't anymore. It's cool. Although these stayed at home are starting to feel a little long.

556
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:37.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But if you're, you know, you're learning any job right now and it's awesome that you get to do it remotely right in this moment.

557
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.280
Jessica Freeman: That I'm still getting paid. I have an opportunity to work.

558
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:53.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. And you have this time that you get to spend with your son that you normally would be at work. Hmm. You know, there's that. And you have this time that you get to put yourself out there.

559
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really help others in recovery.

560
01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:09.120
Jessica Freeman: I mean, you know, I have some other things that I need to do today, but otherwise I'm made of time so I'm gonna

561
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:17.940
Jessica Freeman: Let me see what I can put together as far as like a women's meeting and maybe putting it out to recovery houses nearby.

562
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:23.190
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. That might be a really good way for me to meet some people with whom

563
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:32.430
Jessica Freeman: You know, mutual connection will be really good because once all this is over, we get back to the rooms, you know, some relationships could have been built

564
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:33.630
Yes.

565
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, very much so. So you have now you have these things, you know, you've got to commit to them and you know really start doing it, even if you make one phone call. Connect with one

566
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Female sober house invite them, you know, you can set the platform up and invite them in

567
01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:01.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if it's by, you know, by phone, you know, on speakerphone.

568
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:03.240
Jessica Freeman: On zoom

569
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.940
Jessica Freeman: Together a short list of, like, best practices you know for how to use zoom

570
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:15.510
Jessica Freeman: And send out the invitations. I mean, the worst that can happen is nothing happens.

571
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:22.590
Jessica Freeman: I still have other places that I can engage and actually contribute so

572
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.310
Definitely

573
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely so alright so you have your week of

574
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Filled now.

575
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:30.960
Jessica Freeman: You know,

576
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:42.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to and I bet you in this process, while you're doing this. You're going to feel that connection again.

577
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because you are getting outside of self and you are, you know, trying to be there for them, you know, the person that needs it.

578
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's going to be huge, you know, and you can specifically put it for your area.

579
01:03:59.340 --> 01:03:59.550
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

580
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, and have it for women that are, you know, close in your area.

581
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that would definitely be huge.

582
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:19.680
Jessica Freeman: I think so, too, because I'm really positive effects, just in so many different ways. So you're doing it, man. I'm going to look. I'm going to do what I need to do.

583
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:23.580
Jessica Freeman: Okay, good organizer, so I can get this done.

584
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:44.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can, and in the process. Again, you're going to be refreshing up on your recovery and filling those you know those spots that you need to feel for you as well. So that's the crazy part is I tell people all the time that this is such a being in recovery is such a selfish selfless program.

585
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That in order to be fed. We have to feed others, you know,

586
01:04:50.760 --> 01:05:01.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And getting that concept, you know, for some people is like I never thought about that, if I'm taking care of myself. I can then take care of others better

587
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:12.930
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, yeah. I had that same conversation with with my little ones dad yesterday. He's like, No, working for three weeks, but I'll send on the money. I can

588
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:23.100
Jessica Freeman: T. Remember we talked about when you're in an airplane and the mask comes out, you put it on yourself so that you're able to help others. Oh, you need to focus on taking care of you.

589
01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:34.110
Jessica Freeman: Were fine, I'll let you know if we're in dire straits. But, you know, take care of you. Really, because he needs to take care of him. Like, that's what he needs to do.

590
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:39.270
Jessica Freeman: He can't take care of key. And right now, he's got to learn to take care of himself.

591
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing that you're able to do that. You know what I mean.

592
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:49.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hmm, have compassion, you know, and give him some hope. Yeah.

593
01:05:49.980 --> 01:06:03.690
Jessica Freeman: Well, I know he's been having a hard time with the move. So you know I encouraged him to like with therapy. I think it's great. I've been doing it for a long time. I sold him because you know there's a stigma. Right. Yeah.

594
01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:15.270
Jessica Freeman: I don't want to. I don't have any issues like okay well maybe you could just have like a disinterested third party who's there to help you, that you can talk to and

595
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:20.820
Jessica Freeman: Maybe talk about those feelings you got going on inside that are causing problems for you.

596
01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:29.880
Jessica Freeman: And to see how it goes. But it's important to find the right therapist because if you're not comfortable with the therapist, then you know you got to find somebody else. It has to be somebody that you can trust.

597
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:41.850
Jessica Freeman: And talk to open up and, you know, listen, and consider the suggestions they give you and trying to implement them. So he's been doing that for a few months now and I feel like he's getting better like

598
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:42.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice.

599
01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:43.980
Jessica Freeman: More self aware

600
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's huge.

601
01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.370
I know

602
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're not you're not only are

603
01:06:53.970 --> 01:07:00.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working on getting yourself healthy but you're also putting these things out there and allowing for other people to get healthy too.

604
01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:09.210
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. I MEAN, HE'S MY SON'S FATHER, my son deserves to have a healthy dad and I want to do everything I can to help that.

605
01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.050
Yeah.

606
01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:12.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty amazing.

607
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:29.340
Jessica Freeman: Well, I wish the Brendan's dad and I were able to do that. But you know, I don't have any control over Scott and what he does. So I just have to do what I can for Brendan and for key. And this is something that I can do, I can help his dad.

608
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:36.810
Jessica Freeman: Just by being compassionate gentle yeah and encouraging and patient

609
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:50.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Patient. That's right. And you know, it's kind of amazing for the people that hold, year after year grudges, imagine what it's doing to their, their psyche and to their emotions to their physical well being.

610
01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:51.060
Jessica Freeman: Oh, yeah.

611
01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:52.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it's sad.

612
01:07:53.190 --> 01:08:02.910
Jessica Freeman: It is said my mom's two brothers are, they're the most grudge holding people I've ever. I mean other than my grandpa. He taught them how to hold a grudge for their entire lives.

613
01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:12.660
Jessica Freeman: Mom's getting better at the gradually that her brothers, like they're both having like health problems, and I mean it's just poisons your whole

614
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:17.130
Jessica Freeman: spirit body mind.

01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:29.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doesn't hurt the other person is it affects you. You know, that's no good, no good at all. Life's too short. You

618
01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:40.590
Jessica Freeman: Know mom's doing much better with it. She gets pissed. But she's, she's more forgiving and she's quicker to forgive. Now then share has been

619
01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:42.780
