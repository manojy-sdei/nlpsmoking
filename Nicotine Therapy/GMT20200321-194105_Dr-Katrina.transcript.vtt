38
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.200
Dr Katrina Groves: How did that go

39
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:59.490
Gracie Chisman: It went really good. I went with my new boyfriend and his nephew and we went down there and set a net and they did their manly eel fishing on the reservation, so I can't do that cuz I'm a female, they don't. Yeah.

40
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.860
Gracie Chisman: Now,

41
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Tell me about this boyfriend. This is good.

42
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:14.370
Gracie Chisman: Um, I've known him since before my brother was killed. I've known him for nearly 30 years he's been married, just like I was all these years.

43
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.020
Gracie Chisman: Um, he's known me since I was a little girl, since I was like years old.

44
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.290
Gracie Chisman: And him and his ex wife split up. He has a restraining order on her and

45
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.770
Gracie Chisman: We started talking in found out that each other was single, after all these years and

46
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.660
Gracie Chisman: So the last month, we've been seeing each other, it's been going great.

47
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.730
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm so happy.

48
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.860
Gracie Chisman: So my for once. Finally, maybe, hopefully.

49
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.580
Dr Katrina Groves: It's all over your face. I can tell. Um,

50
00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:00.090
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, that's, that's really good. Okay, so, um, we have to spend like a half an hour here doing this history thing.

51
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.810
Okay.

52
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Hopefully, neither one of us will get interrupted.

53
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.510
Gracie Chisman: Yeah.

54
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright.

55
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.580
So,

56
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:25.830
Dr Katrina Groves: I know some of this stuff you already think I know but just start at the beginning. And I'm tell about like how old were you when you first started using substances and what was it like a lot of people. It was pot or alcohol or when did you first start

57
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.200
Gracie Chisman: And my first thing I ever tried with cigarettes. When I was nine years old. Wow. The first time I tried smoking pot was when I was 12

58
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.170
Gracie Chisman: Um, first time I didn't mess. I was 17

59
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.530
Gracie Chisman: So long ago.

60
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.680
Gracie Chisman: About them now. Yeah. Now I Vegas. OK, so the pills. We started out, I don't know.

61
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:22.260
Gracie Chisman: Little over five years ago when I started getting surgeries and stuff and realizing I liked them and now my I'm having actually a struggle with something I've never had a problem with in my life. And that's all

62
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.690
Yeah.

63
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.040
Gracie Chisman: I got my second DUI. I'm

64
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.770
Gracie Chisman: Sorry to hear that I was supposed to have court yesterday, but they canceled it so

65
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.100
Gracie Chisman: I don't, I don't know what's going on with that yet.

66
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.010
Gracie Chisman: I lost my job yesterday.

67
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.780
Oh, no.

68
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.430
Dr Katrina Groves: So was that at the casino or where were you working

69
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:55.410
Gracie Chisman: Oh no. So, okay, I left the casino and I went to South and Chevron in Crescent City.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.340
Gracie Chisman: Okay, no, the car wash. And I've been working there for like last three almost four months now.

71
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:10.560
Gracie Chisman: And I got fired from there yesterday for supposedly stealing Mike's Hard Lemonade, and to Danish

72
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:26.220
Gracie Chisman: Danish like cheesecake things. Oh my gosh. When I had paid for them earlier that day and everybody else does this and so i don't i don't know my boss text me like

73
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:38.700
Gracie Chisman: he texts me Monday morning when I was getting ready to actually walk to work. And I'm like, okay, like, okay, and he's all don't come in, you're suspended because of supposedly that FBI

74
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:54.060
Gracie Chisman: Investigation and I text them the next day I was like, you know, it's been 24 hours. What's going on stuff, no nothing, no Kersey tech back. Have I haven't heard anything or none. Then, yesterday I finally a

75
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:06.600
Gracie Chisman: Night yesterday, but by Thursday I text him. And I was like, so what's the news. It's been 72 hours. Now, you know, no response. So when my boss got off work.

76
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:17.100
Gracie Chisman: He got off work at 430 on Friday. And I ended up message or Thursday and I ended up messaging him it like almost five o'clock. And I was like, hey,

77
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:25.890
Gracie Chisman: You know, by law, they have 72 hours to either give me a check. Tell me I'm done for. Give me my schedule back

78
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:41.730
Gracie Chisman: And he's like, I haven't heard anything yet from I emailed him this morning. Hopefully I'll hear back from our morning. And so then yesterday morning came around and it showed my check was on my

79
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.430
Gracie Chisman: My app that I have for my paycheck and

80
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:54.840
Gracie Chisman: But my pay wasn't on my car. Each I text my boss. And I was like, hey, you know what's going on. Do I have a track down or something.

81
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:04.410
Gracie Chisman: Happened before. And then he ended up text me back later that day after I found out my money had gotten onto my card. Finally, that day.

82
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:17.940
Gracie Chisman: But he texts me finally after that it was like, oh yeah, just to let you know this is what they told me that they're laying off because supposedly two dashes and Mike's Hard Lemonade was stolen and all this and

83
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:31.800
Gracie Chisman: Like I didn't reply, I was just, I'm so pissed off and everything, because just like corporate nobody's gotten ahold of me to find out what's going on. What I have to say over the ordeal or anything in like okay

84
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.050
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow.

85
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.030
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're kind of

86
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.090
Dr Katrina Groves: happy that you're not working. There are you

87
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:51.510
Gracie Chisman: Yes and no. Yes and no. I mean, you know, it was a job. I was making more money than I was at the casino in the cage counting hundreds of thousands of dollars a day.

88
00:09:52.530 --> 00:10:02.400
Gracie Chisman: And better benefits and everything. Cuz at the station. They had 401 K benefits that they actually added in where the casino, don't they don't add in at all.

89
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.730
Gracie Chisman: But the only thing I didn't like about was

90
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:25.170
Gracie Chisman: I was doing a lot of housekeeping and cleaning work that I've been saying for years. I don't want nothing to do with anymore. I don't, I don't want to clean. I don't want to do construction, I want an easier easy going job more or less so.

91
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.770
Dr Katrina Groves: So what's your plan. Now, how are you, I know it's just happened. So you probably haven't had a chance to think about it that

92
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.690
Dr Katrina Groves: You ever think about getting on with the school district or doing something else. Yeah.

93
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.880
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, well I was already thinking about going back to college in the fall.

94
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:58.890
Gracie Chisman: Which I'm still thinking about doing that just now it's going to be you know i i gotta find another job. I've had surveillance coming in to the station and stuff like non stop the last couple weeks asked me, you know, like, come back the casino come upstairs.

95
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.450
Gracie Chisman: brainless. Yeah, that does it. They don't have to drive or anything so I

96
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.130
Gracie Chisman: Don't have to have a license for that.

97
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, that'd be cool.

98
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:17.370
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, cuz they're like, What the hell happened to you, you know, I've had two bands come in, they see me and they're like, whoa, that's where you're at, like what happened one day you're at the casino next day you're

99
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.530
Gracie Chisman: Like you know stuff happens. So, yeah.

100
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.690
Gracie Chisman: So,

101
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:31.770
Gracie Chisman: You know, just another step I gotta do, you know, get my get another job again and

102
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:41.850
Gracie Chisman: I gotta wait for court to be rescheduled because I had court for that yesterday for my second nearby or what might be my second UI noise.

103
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:55.380
Dr Katrina Groves: It's kind of crazy how when you have addiction, the brain. If it's not on one thing. It's trying to find something else to fill that spot. You know, so it's very common that people will switch from

104
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.550
Gracie Chisman: Manage

105
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.770
Dr Katrina Groves: Other years. Yeah. So do you think that's kind of what happened this happening with you or

106
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:09.990
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, I'm actually really worried about it. I've talked to Tony about it. I've talked to my house counselor Tina and Katie

107
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.480
Gracie Chisman: Got it. Because I'm noticing.

108
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:29.640
Gracie Chisman: It's just like a revolving door this starting to lead downward. For me, it's like a new addiction and I don't know why I'm turned on to it by so much because I never had thing for alcohol in my life. And all of a sudden it's like bam, bam, bam, so

109
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.790
Dr Katrina Groves: So does your new boyfriend drink.

110
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.620
Dr Katrina Groves: No. Okay, that's one good thing he could maybe help you

111
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.300
Gracie Chisman: Not my booze not

112
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:47.190
Gracie Chisman: He used to, but after his wife and everything. He don't feel like it around him or anything. I feel like I'm a little kid hiding

113
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.730
Gracie Chisman: When I do drink around him so

114
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.350
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow, okay.

115
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.900
Gracie Chisman: So I've, I've cut down the last month just from being with him alone. Um,

116
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.310
Gracie Chisman: Last night I I I BOUGHT A BOTTLE.

117
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.250
Gracie Chisman: I'm finishing it and I told him that

118
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.840
Gracie Chisman: I'm done drinking

119
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:08.940
Gracie Chisman: After that,

120
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:16.470
Dr Katrina Groves: How much do you think you drink before like a fifth day. I mean, how bad was it

121
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.340
Gracie Chisman: Before I started staying with my boyfriend. I was drinking

122
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:32.730
Gracie Chisman: Anywhere from a half fish, two fish today. I would say so. Standing my moms and I was saying my trailer says

123
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:48.600
Gracie Chisman: No is really staying secluded and that's that's another thing. It's not me. I'm not not a closet case drinker. I've never have been, I've always been a social drinker in I caught myself actually drinking by myself sneaking a

124
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:49.410
Dr Katrina Groves: Right.

125
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.540
Gracie Chisman: For no reason, either.

126
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, there is a reason. It's just you. Maybe you don't see what it is at this point or

127
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:06.240
Gracie Chisman: No, it's because of the guilt. I don't want my kids coming over insane. My bottles are seeing me drinking all the time and stuff because

128
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.600
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

129
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:18.120
Gracie Chisman: I'm already going through the same thing with my sister and my oldest daughter them getting pulled over all the times for DUIs and stuff my oldest daughter being in the car and everything and wow

130
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.540

131
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.080
Gracie Chisman: I don't know. Yeah.

132
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.450
Dr Katrina Groves: When did that happen. When did your brother get killed.

133
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.580
Gracie Chisman: That was back in 96

134
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

135
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.960
Gracie Chisman: The guy ID lie and five days didn't go for a DUI. That's all he got and he tried counter cheering them on for damages to spark.

136
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.700
Wow.

137
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:54.210
Gracie Chisman: And like I talked to Tina about that with hast yesterday, I was like, you know, I'm going through all this bullshit. And now I feel like I'm starting to get like a catch to alcohol and I'm trying not to. And

138
00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:07.140
Gracie Chisman: It's just my way of, you know, running away from everything right now it's every once in a while. Just to just catch a break to get on my head everything right have you,

139
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.690
Dr Katrina Groves: Ever been on antidepressants or anything.

140
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.180
Dr Katrina Groves: They're not working.

141
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.880
Gracie Chisman: I don't know, I feel

142
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:26.250
Gracie Chisman: Like my Pro. As in, and all that. It's like, it feels like it's helping, especially the prize. And I'm not having the nightmares I used to have a not so

143
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:37.500
Gracie Chisman: Uptight and sketched out, like, you know, I noticed when people start coming up behind me and I get scared a lot. That's what I'm starting to get really

144
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:54.300
Gracie Chisman: antsy and everything. And that's been kind of happening. But the bad dreams haven't been coming in all out with the class and stuff. But as far as anything else goes, I have no motivation. I feel really, really just super, super depressed right now.

145
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.670
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, I'm trying to come out of in everywhere. I know possible. It's just

146
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.410
Dr Katrina Groves: So you have

147
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:15.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Post Traumatic Stress and and that's part of it and alcohol, you know, makes depression worse. It feels like it lives you lifts you a little but it actually worsens depression. So I don't know if that helps.

148
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.050
Gracie Chisman: Yeah.

149
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.890
Gracie Chisman: See, and that's the thing is, yeah, it lowers it but you know

150
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.180
Gracie Chisman: When you're an addict. You don't really care. You're just looking for that escape.

151
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.990
Exactly.

152
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.270

Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so do you. Who's your doctor now is that Dr Keeter

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.090
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, okay.

181
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:12.990
Dr Katrina Groves: And have you been in it all to the clinic. I mean, I know it's kind of crazy right now. But have you talked to her about depression or alcohol.

182
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:26.220
Gracie Chisman: No, I haven't seen Dr. Peter in probably a couple months now. I have been meaning to go in because I'm having a problem with my left shoulder. I had lifted a bunch of

183
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.040
Gracie Chisman: metal shelves into the dumpster at work.

184
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:38.490
Gracie Chisman: Like three, four weeks ago my shoulders been hurting ourselves. And really, really, really.

185
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Know, yeah, trying to treat it like a sprain ice and

186
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:57.030
Gracie Chisman: Don't use it too much not been, I've been trying to do, but it's not helping. It's like just the little list of moves and stuff like that and certain positions. It just, oh my God sends a shooting pain down my neck.

187
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

188
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.060
Do you have

189
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Do you have ibuprofen to

190
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:10.890
Gracie Chisman: I've been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol by the handfuls every day. Although here. Okay.

191
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:19.020
Dr Katrina Groves: So one thought I had there's a medication called Camp route that works kind of like Suboxone for alcohol.

192
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:27.690
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, that's one thing we could do is, is put you on that medicine. It takes the cravings away for the booze. It makes you feel

193
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.690
Gracie Chisman: Like, I don't really want actually having cravings.

194
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.610
Dr Katrina Groves: That makes sense. I mean you and

195
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.170
Gracie Chisman: I had cravings for

196
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:47.430
Gracie Chisman: Hours yesterday, until I finally was like, I gotta buy a bottle and I told my boyfriend. I was like, this is the last bottle. I've, I got a quick drink and like this is not helping me. I know this, but it's like

197
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:48.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

198
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.240
Gracie Chisman: Your mind I I was at a point I was, I was just fucking I was breaking

199
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:56.820
Gracie Chisman: Breaking

200
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:05.880
Dr Katrina Groves: So one thing I'll do is have you increase that esoterica prem to 20 milligrams a day because 10 is like a baby dose.

201
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.790
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and what pharmacy. Are you at

202
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.080
Walgreens.

203
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:17.100
Dr Katrina Groves: Walgreens. And do you have plenty of them. I didn't see your bottle that do you think your I'll just

204
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:22.110
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, I just got him. I just got him refilled for a 90 day supply yeah that is

205
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.490
Gracie Chisman: Before so

206
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.360
Of course,

207
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:40.170
Dr Katrina Groves: So go ahead and take two and then I'll write a script for you to to increase it when it runs out, you'll be taken to a day or or you can or you just start taking to and next time I see you, I can. You can let me know how it works.

208
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.340
Gracie Chisman: Okay.

209
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Because if it doesn't work.

210
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:52.050
Gracie Chisman: So sure, I tried taking more Suboxone or what Jessica ended up taking four of them all together. And like I was still craving.

211
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.530
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, so you're not craving the narcotics right

212
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.310
Gracie Chisman: No.

213
00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:04.770
Dr Katrina Groves: So that's why Suboxone only fits the Narc if you were craving narcotics like opioids, or heroin or something, then that would be appropriate, but

214
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.560
Gracie Chisman: You're like, I'm having like a craving for Hillary. He is because of how much pain. I'm in

215
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.120
Gracie Chisman: Mm hmm. That's it.

216
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.720
Dr Katrina Groves: And I remember you're paying before he didn't eat take gosh, no. Not Neurontin or you on

217
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.880
Gracie Chisman: Something I don't

218
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.390
Have a pen.

219
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.190
Okay.

220
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:34.320
Gracie Chisman: I can't, I can't remember. We only thing I know that I'm on for pain right now is my marijuana does writing and that's not even helping right now.

221
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:35.220
Right.

222
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:42.240
Dr Katrina Groves: So I think that the shoulder thing you'll have to talk with Dr Keeter as far as

223
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.650
Gracie Chisman: You know it's most likely a

224
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.700
Dr Katrina Groves: Strain or sprain.

225
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.300
Dr Katrina Groves: It'll hopefully get better, but you might need it to get looked at

226
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.690
Dr Katrina Groves: But in the meantime, I think that trying that.

227
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.800
Dr Katrina Groves: Craving medicine.

228
00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:03.870
Dr Katrina Groves: For alcohol. It's called campus can Prowler, it's a longer name, but I can try and prescribe that and see if your insurance will cover it for you.

229
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:09.750
Gracie Chisman: Okay, like if I drink with it. Will it make you detox like a suboptimal

230
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:24.270
Dr Katrina Groves: No, no, no. That's you're thinking of an abuse and that's Nope. It doesn't work like that. You start out taking like one three times a day. And it's kind of a pain. You got to take two, three times a day. Eventually, but that's what you're taking any way with your Suboxone

231
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.320
Yeah.

232
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:38.850
Dr Katrina Groves: So they work well together and they stop the cravings, the same way. And hopefully you'll be able to get, get some counseling and figure out or or hang out with, with your boyfriend more talk with people.

233
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:44.430
Gracie Chisman: No, that's, that's what I've been doing. I've been trying to reach out and everything.

234
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Because you know when you isolate you get word

235
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.580
Gracie Chisman: Yeah we op. And that's my thing is I like to isolate

236
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.480
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, I'm really trying not to do that right now at this point.

237
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.200
Good.

238
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.330
Gracie Chisman: Really, let me not do.

239
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Let me go back to I don't think I got through your whole history.

240
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.320
Dr Katrina Groves: After the surgery, what surgeries, were you talking about the five years ago when you have your sweat surgeries.

241
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.880

Gracie Chisman: No surgery I

257
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:18.960
Gracie Chisman: Never had a surgery on my back, because I know that once you start having a surgery on your back and make so weaker. So I've, I've held off on that one.

258
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:24.450
Gracie Chisman: Okay. But yeah, we don't know how much longer. That's going to hold off.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.550
Gracie Chisman: Because my boyfriend has glasses and I tried on some of his and I was like, oh my god, I can see

363
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:37.230
Gracie Chisman: Like, right now I'm I have my earbuds in my left ear instead of my right ear, because I actually hear better in my left ear than my right year

364
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.990
Gracie Chisman: Which probably has to do with shooting guns a lot

365
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:53.580
Gracie Chisman: So I don't know. I've always had problems with my right ear, though. Ever since I was a little kid, I used to have to always pray and cotton balls and stuff like that. And it was I kid. Okay.

366
00:32:54.300 --> 00:33:00.330
Dr Katrina Groves: So what about your nose and your throat and any problems with sores on your mouth or your lips or your town.

373
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.110
Okay.

374
00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.260
Dr Katrina Groves: And how's your dental

375
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:43.680
Gracie Chisman: And my my bottom case. I still need to go and get those checked out, see if they can do read line or something on my mentors.

376
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:58.320
Gracie Chisman: Because they're still like a when I get stressed out, you know, I get locked jaw really bad. And so then I i clench all the time and my bottom center cuts down into my elite glands.

377
00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.100
Gracie Chisman: Under no well

378
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:08.220
Gracie Chisman: I remember that. Yeah. Yeah. And so then, like, you know, if they irritated. Then when food gets in there, they even get more is so I've

379
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.930
Gracie Chisman: I have noticed just a hint of pain and irritation in the last

380
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:16.140
Gracie Chisman: Two, three days now because of that.

381
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:22.530
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, that concerns me because I remember you had a really bad infection that was actually from this Suboxone

382
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.450
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, and I actually had to have antibiotics for because it was making me sick.

383
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Right.

384
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.280
Gracie Chisman: So how is it taking the

385
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Suboxone with this under your tongue. Now, does that bother you, or

386
00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:40.860
Gracie Chisman: I've noticed it's kind of weird because, you know, alcohol is like almost like a disinfectant, but yet.

387
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:54.930
Gracie Chisman: it irritates yeah thankfully gland, especially if I'm not. If I don't brush my teeth like every day, twice a day or something right yeah you can automatically start feeling just like small up and start hurting a little bit. No, dear. Right.

388
00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:04.200
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, I hope that gets better, because otherwise we might have to switch to to like the the been avail or I mean there's even a shot so box on now has a shot.

389
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.980
Gracie Chisman: Once a month.

390
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.310
Gracie Chisman: It's kind of I was reading about that. But does it

391
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:10.110
Gracie Chisman: I mean,

392
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:12.990
Gracie Chisman: I don't know. I

393
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:23.130
Gracie Chisman: Like in the mornings when I get up and I before I take my absolves like I can, I can feel a difference after I take my absolves like

394
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.940
Gracie Chisman: My pain and everything subsides enough to where I can like, deal with it. Right.

395
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.370
Gracie Chisman: So this is a little bit

396
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:41.370
Dr Katrina Groves: Back and it's a little different, like right now you're doing this, you're going up and then they don't like you take it and it feels better. And then it drops down and then you have

397
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.210
Dr Katrina Groves: Another one.

398
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:48.540
Dr Katrina Groves: So what's the sublet Kate is actually starts out higher and stays higher longer

399
00:35:49.500 --> 00:36:00.840
Dr Katrina Groves: So it's not so much up and down. But, you know, you'd have to try it and see how it worked for your body. Some people even they do the sub blockade and they take a little bit of sub solve on top of it when they need to, if the pain is bad.

400
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.190
Gracie Chisman: So really,

401
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:06.690
Gracie Chisman: You know, it's a possibility. Okay, well, to look into that. Then

402
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.050
Dr Katrina Groves: I mean it's kind of night with your, with your tongue like that.

403
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:20.460
Dr Katrina Groves: That you may not tolerate this for years and years and years. That might be a good idea. Oh, yeah. Talk to Daria because she's signing people up that wants to buy

404
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:26.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Some blockade and like I said it's a once a month shot and then you don't have to mess around with stuff onto your tongue and

405
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:43.590
Dr Katrina Groves: And so you would have to try it out. I would suggest at least two months because the first month is kind of stabilizing you the second month is really good. And then you decide after that, if it's good or not good. You can go right back on this on the sub solve if you wanted

406
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:57.780
Gracie Chisman: Yeah yeah cuz he usually what I do is I take to my sub solves every day, at least, and then throughout today if I if I feel like I need to all either take two more.

407
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:15.570
Gracie Chisman: I'm dear. Yeah. Because like I i usually only take two at a time to where if I need to take two more. I'm able to. Otherwise my prescription last me longer than ways, it should anyways because I'm supposed to be taken three a day, but I will take two at a time.

408
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.740
Dr Katrina Groves: So there's some days that you take to and that's all you need.

409
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:20.760
Yeah.

410
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:29.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Because it must I'm trying to figure out how that last year. If you're taking for a day, sometimes, but I guess that's because some days you take two and some days you take for

411
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:38.040
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, I mean, there's there's days where all I'll take actually three. But yeah, it's either two or four that I usually take. Okay.

412
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:47.130
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm okay. Do you have any trouble with your, your neck. You were talking about your shoulder. But do you have neck pain and as well.

413
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:55.710
Gracie Chisman: Yeah. Yeah, like when I moved my shoulder certain ways, like I have this pain that comes down here in my neck and goes down my shoulder so

414
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.320

Gracie Chisman: Yeah. Well, I thought it. I thought it was you know a UTI, and I didn't think that I had gotten it for the second time actually. And so I thought was just a UTI. And then finally, I mean it just got unbearable and then come to find out. Yeah, I was dirty.

493
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:35.130
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, oh yeah cuz I was seeing a guy at Keller lifelike.

Gracie Chisman: Actually, dear, the mechanics there. And yeah, when I told him about it. He was like, oh, you probably had it in your system. It was probably hiding for the last year's something I'm like dude.

495
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:55.920
Gracie Chisman: No, it just got tested, because I just went through this just couple years ago and everything, and he wouldn't even go and get tested too.

496
00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:00.240
Gracie Chisman: Dark or anything. And so that's why I ended that relationship.

Dr Katrina Groves: Well, maybe he did later, who knows.

501
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.020
Gracie Chisman: I don't know if it was later it was too late.

Dr Katrina Groves: But he went down to visit my sister and

519
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:42.420
Dr Katrina Groves: Didn't come back yet. And now the virus has gone on, so I don't know when he's going to be able to come back.

520
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.030
Gracie Chisman: I know that's just missing everybody up

521
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:48.030
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, are you panicked about that. Are you okay

522
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.410

523
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Isolate. I mean, seriously.

524
00:46:55.350 --> 00:47:00.630

525
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.920
Gracie Chisman: Just be a clean person, not a dirty person.

526
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:19.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Your lungs are a little bit of a weakness for you. Gracie, so I'd be really careful and cautious. If you don't have to get a job right away. Great. If you do, then make sure you get yourself isolated like not with a bunch of people maybe the surveillance would be a good thing.

527
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Now, since I'm going to say

528
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.300

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:56.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and that's fine. I just need to what what day would be better for you. I'm doing two groups. Now I'm doing one group. It's like this telemedicine with all the people from clinic or, you know, several

627
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:25.830
Dr Katrina Groves: I would love that. Right now I'm we're trying to do more of that with the virus. So I'd rather do be unsafe in my house and talk to people, then

628
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:29.610
Gracie Chisman: Writing it. Yeah, how's the virus girl, where you are.

629
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:39.600
Dr Katrina Groves: There's all two cases right now, but nothing widespread yet, people are doing pretty good about isolating and not going out next

630
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.040
Gracie Chisman: Chair and a king and stuff.

631
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:54.330
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, exactly, which is nice. You look like you're not either. So, and you know what people that are panicking that we've talked about, you know, you've been through chaos before in your addiction, you've been out of control.

632
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.410
Dr Katrina Groves: So you guys

633
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.620
Dr Katrina Groves: You know how to do this. You've been there. You've done that so

634
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.960
Gracie Chisman: This just feels like a fake

635
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:09.390
Gracie Chisman: Phenomenon that's happening just kind of like, wait for it to actually happened. But it's like not really happening to us. It seems like

636
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:10.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

637
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:16.410
Gracie Chisman: It's kind of not real. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Because the other bullshit so much more real than it

638
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:26.580
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. Well, it'll probably hit Crystal City. Eventually, I think there was a couple cases in humble, but, you know, pretty much. Everyone's just going to get the flu and then they're over it and then they're fine. It's the

639
00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.420
Gracie Chisman: People

640
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:33.810
Dr Katrina Groves: The old, old people. And the really young people with bad immune systems and that's who we worry about so

641
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:44.880
Gracie Chisman: Yeah, so that was the thing that I was kind of worried about was because the last time I had that STD and all that was just a few months ago. And so they had me on three different really strong.

642
00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:50.220
Gracie Chisman: Antibiotics for that and stuff, because then I ended up having ammonia also

643
00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:56.190
Gracie Chisman: Oh, wow. Yeah. And so I'm still trying to like re gather from that and everything.

644
00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:57.000
Yeah.

645
00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:10.080
Dr Katrina Groves: All right, well I'm gonna let you go. And I have another call. So I will see you on. And if you need to call me sooner you can, but for now I got you on April 9

652
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.110
Gracie Chisman: That's, I was just thinking, Okay, we're gonna try this.

653
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:55.740
Oops, sorry I am

654
00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:02.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so, of course, the other ones were half an hour. And this one was an hour. She had a lot to talk about.

655
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:19.260
Dr Katrina Groves: psych impression. So do my normal template. Except her level of stress was quite high. She smoked three cigarettes during that time that we are in our visit

656
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.950

Dr Katrina Groves: Some helplessness.

660
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:49.080
Dr Katrina Groves: Um, but then she rallied and was more positive. By the end of the session. And she had a full expression of our feelings during them.

661
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:54.810
Dr Katrina Groves: During the process. Otherwise, everything was normal with that.

662
00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:02.970
