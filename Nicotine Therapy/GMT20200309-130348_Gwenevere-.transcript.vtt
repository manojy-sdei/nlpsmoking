Hello.

2
00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.559
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning. Hi, I wanna, I had some audio problems. This morning I want to make sure they're good.

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.340
Christina Haro: I sent you. I sent you. I sent you a message. Did you get it.

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to see and hear me okay

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, okay. I had some audio problems this morning. It sounds like sounds like I fixed it. That's good. All right. Um, you sent me

7
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.140
Christina Haro: Yeah, I told you, can you give me five minutes I needed the bathroom. Oh, don't worry, you're fine.

8
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It worked out because I had some audio issues that worked out just fine. I'm okay. So you're my first client this morning, so I don't have my database open yet. I'm going to do that and

9
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to

10
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of check in a little bit with you. I noticed right at the end of the session

11
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That there were some sort of big feelings coming up for you.

12
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we can kind of explore that a little bit further.

13
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.340
Christina Haro: Okay.

14
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you may have more feelings and you're letting on in here.

15
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a little

16
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Alright, so tell me a little bit about the dynamics going on at home. Well, I pull up a note here.

17
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.410
Christina Haro: Um, everything's been pretty quiet. I went to church yesterday so

18
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.160
Christina Haro: That was a big step for me that really good

19
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. And what did it happen to be that one of the sermons was something you liked hearing. I mean, how did it land with you.

20
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.140
Christina Haro: Oh,

21
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:58.440
Christina Haro: Actually this the sermon yesterday was kind of weird. He spoke about material things. And, you know, but not being greedy and stuff. So it's kind of like

22
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:15.870
Christina Haro: Different yeah but you know it was it was it was nice. I mean, I saw a lot of the people you know cuz I go to the same church, which is down the street from my house like a block. So all the neighborhood people that haven't seen in a while, you know, and it was nice.

23
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Who did you chit chat with people.

24
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:31.230
Christina Haro: Yeah, yeah. Because you know when you walk in, you greet each other. Usually people are waiting around before they sit down. So everybody is, you know, greasy to their handshake.

25
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Any nervousness about going

26
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.440
Christina Haro: Oh yeah, I had butterflies in my stomach.

27
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know what's interesting about those butterflies is

28
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That stress and excitement. They feel the same.

29
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.140
Christina Haro: Yeah, they do.

30
00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to use our mind and say, wait a minute. There's no threat, there's no danger. I'm excited. And it feels the same. Notice you use the word butterfly, but it was

31
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That you were afraid of something you might have said I had a sick gut or a sinking feeling, you know, so, so, so we've got to kind of us use our mind as well. Pay attention.

32
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

33
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice that you were kind of listening in for opportunities to maybe participate in some groups, some volunteer activities for you, keeping an eye out for that.

34
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:44.400
Christina Haro: Then, actually, I did. I read the bulletin boards tiptoes anything up there, you know, didn't see anything but there is numbers that you can call for, you know, different stuff women's groups and stuff like that so

35
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I like it women's groups.

36
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a change for like

37
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.510
Christina Haro: Anger actually having a woman's retreat. Mm.

38
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

39
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.360
Christina Haro: So I don't know. I don't know.

40
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a big commitment hanging out with a bunch of women and are some of these women you know from years ago and they're all kind of like new. You think it. Well, you don't know who's in the retreat. You wouldn't know. Yeah.

41
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.500
Christina Haro: Really don't until you show up. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

42
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and see how we doing on the I'm looking for a job. How are you, how are your spirits. Are you feeling encouraged or discouraged.

43
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.970
Christina Haro: Um, I encourage you to encourage I did this week's gonna be busy for me. That'd be busy for me because

44
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:49.170
Christina Haro: Well, me and my daughter were kind of sharing a car. Your car broke so last week was kind of hard. You know, it's kind of limited last week this week is going to be a lot better to go to practice. So now she's on her own, and I could do my own thing and I got to get it going.

45
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And and this hotel work with your son is it's set in stone. Are you still trying to get connected

46
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:11.610
Christina Haro: I'm actually, I'm still waiting. But you know, I asked him yesterday. And then he said, you know, Mom. He says, I wouldn't. He says, I wouldn't get upset, he says, or think they're ignoring you. He says, because there's there's gonna be a lot of openings and I think they're just waiting to have

47
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.930
Christina Haro: To fill the openings altogether. He says, so I think he says that they're going to give you a call soon. Okay.

48
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you're feeling optimistic that's

49
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.840
Christina Haro: Good.

50
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.360
Alright.

51
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: See, um,

52
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: How have you been feeling around kind of talking a little bit about self worth, things like that. I noticed right it and right near the end, when we were talking, you had some cheerfulness. Thank you. It actually walked away from the screen but you had been you had stayed on there.

53
00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't logged yourself out. And that can be kind of a tender moment but I happen to see that you were still quite upset I'm. Do you remember what was going on right at the end, I can read some notes to bring us back or maybe you remember

54
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.390
Christina Haro: I know we're talking about my mom right

55
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.370
Christina Haro: That was the whole topic. Yeah, I remember

56
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.900
Christina Haro: Okay.

57
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.260
Christina Haro: Yeah, it's, you know, I'm

58
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.060
Christina Haro: Gonna sign if you want to discuss it further. I'm fine. Okay.

59
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how to do every phone is different. Do you know how to put it on. Do Not Disturb so we don't get the

60
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Vibration TV.

61
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what I do is I, I go to, I think, well, I have, I have a little button here that I can just do

62
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This little sleep thing and then I hold it and it says wait for an hour.

63
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a setting, maybe under Settings to say, hey, do not disturb mode so that you don't get a little blessings

64
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't disrupt you because it will throw you off if you and I are doing any kind of concentrated work and sometimes it completely knocks out the audio. I noticed for people

65
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.030
Christina Haro: That's pretty common. Yeah.

66
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.250
Christina Haro: I'm looking

67
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time. I'm reviewing right right at the tail end of the note, just to see what what exactly we were saying

68
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:36.540
Christina Haro: That I can do, I can give me a second. I'm going to grab my glasses. I just remembered I didn't get my glasses. Give me a second.

69
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.100
Absolutely.

70
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.180
Alright.

71
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

72
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.890
I'm

73
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Helping able to

74
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.860
Christina Haro: I tried, but I don't know if that's gonna be okay.

75
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:25.890
Christina Haro: To mess with it.

76
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Will notice if someone text because it'll vibrate a little bit. Okay, so let's say right near the end what you were sharing was this actually said quite some powerful things I'm

77
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of dive in right near the end, Mom.

78
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Was always angry at dad's family. She would tell me I look like his family and would tell me I should go live.

79
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Across the street.

80
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that painful almost painful for me to hear. I know my heart ache to hear that.

81
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Go live across the street with a paternal uncle. You don't belong here mom passed away five years ago of terminal cancer. I took care of her.

82
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The last four years, brought her to live with me, nobody wanted to take care of her. She said, I'm sorry. I know I never treated you right we became best friends. Right, yeah, there it is. That's the one.

83
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what do we have in common with mom, we both like to cook when she lives here we would cook together in the kitchen.

84
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it's about that moment, Christina. Maybe it's about

85
00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting in touch with what those last few years with her really connecting with those years instead of right, all of this pain that history right it's so unpleasant and I can feel that myself. Even as I start to read some of it.

86
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what's coming up for you. I'm focused on myself.

87
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.710
Christina Haro: You know, my kids tell me the same thing. You know, they told me, don't

88
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:33.930
Christina Haro: Don't live in the past, you have two great years with Grandma You know those last few years with great know we were all happy.

89
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's something else behind that there's like a grief. It almost looks like something else can you do you know what the words are

90
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:59.100
Christina Haro: I don't know. Sometimes I feel angry, I feel angry because she just did a lot of ugly things, you know, and

91
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.410
Christina Haro: She really never

92
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.490
Christina Haro: You know, she never really came out and said, I'm

93
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.370
Christina Haro: I guess you really never came out and really said the things I wanted to just say, okay,

94
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we do a little work around that today we

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.540
Christina Haro: gotta explain

96
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.250
Christina Haro: Why

Christina Haro: So,

114
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So today what I'd like to do is I'd like to do a little bit of desensitization to to one of those events where we're going to do what's called

115
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of this really narrow EMT our work, which means we're not going to go expansive to all of the times that you've been hurt. We're going to go to one.

116
00:14:54.420 --> 00:15:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I might do some desensitization where there might be a little increase in the distress, but by the end of today, it should be definitely a decrease. And I want to include some of those positive images.

117
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't work on

118
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: FUZZY. FUZZY. Let me see on your phone will kind of, do you have an Android what you got.

119
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I go into settings and then there should be a little thing that says

120
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like Do Not Disturb see if under Settings. There's a Do Not Disturb. What do you think

121
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Cutting sometimes looks like a little

122
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A little cog, like a little

123
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A little wheel.

124
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, if something happens just log back in. It's no big deal.

125
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this work might be distracting if you get buzzed on

126
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.550
Christina Haro: Okay, hold it.

127
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.770

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you just learned

134
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.470
Christina Haro: Skill. I'm so old school that it's so sad.

135
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.160
Christina Haro: No.

136
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Not feel bad. These kids, I'm telling you there. It's just a completely different.

137
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.750
Christina Haro: Let me tell you, I'ma tell you something really quick.

138
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:47.160
Christina Haro: Ago. A couple of years ago my granddaughter was probably like but well maybe like three years ago. She was like six

139
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:56.490
Christina Haro: And I was having problems with my Direct TV. So she's sitting there and I don't know what happened. I just could not get that remote to do anything that like kind of just

140
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.040
Christina Haro: So she knows me, she says, What are you doing Garner, because she can't do it to call me Garner.

141
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:18.510
Christina Haro: For some reason, that was my nickname, and as a permanent fix this thing and then she says, oh, give me that she says if she gets her. She's six years old she gets to pushing buttons and she fixed it. And then she tells me she says do not know how to do anything. What's wrong with you.

142
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh how funny.

143
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: out of the mouths of babes. What do you

144
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.920
Christina Haro: I tell you these kids, they know it all.

145
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

146
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.650
Christina Haro: Like you

147
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And we just, you know what, we're so behind don't even judge yourself because we're so behind, they're just they're born with this and we're not so whatever we learn as we go.

148
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like you to do is I'm going to bring us. First, let's get into sort of a grounding resourcing space so that you can kind of move between that distress you were feeling a moment ago.

149
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then remembering these positive images. So let's just take this morning for just a little bit and I'll do with you.

150
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a nice exhale just sort of let it all out.

151
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let all your. Yeah. Have a nice deep breath. Okay, just to sort of mark the intention that we're going to do something.

152
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That is work. There's no question. This is hard and it's work and what I'm going to be asking you to do today is not only incorporating some positive resourcing images but also

153
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Remembering some stuff that's kind of unpleasant, but just so you know by bringing up those memories you are changing them.

154
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're changing the relationship. You're changing how your body feels when you pull them up to a working memory, which means we're actively thinking about it.

155
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because we can only hold a couple things in our, in our consciousness. At the same time, you're not thinking of your entire childhood right now.

156
00:19:49.020 --> 00:20:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we can only hold a little bit in working memory. Okay, which means that it's our hippocampus and our prefrontal cortex are working at the same time. That's exciting. But it can only work really well. If we're just kind of focused on a small chunk of information. Okay.

157
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, whatever comes up, that's fine. I want to know about it. But as far as what you're going to bring up. It's just we're going to pick one to focus on today because there's a lot of targets that we could focus on

158
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So first, Christina. I want you to kind of close your eyes with me and I want you to just get in touch with that quality of your protective figure your dad always really strong a hard working, man.

159
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Really be just the quality of it just that.

160
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He really knew this concept of protection and really embracing and being surrounded by that quality.

161
00:20:50.220 --> 00:21:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then bring into that space and have them interacting. The Guardian Angel unconditionally loving being white ghostly figure

162
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Years ago when married the first husband, you're hurt. Can you remember you remember this, this figure right this guardian angel.

163
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconditional love

164
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: beside you at all times.

165
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We have incorporated this

166
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of protection and unconditional love that wants your growth and development.

167
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring your self.

168
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Insightful

169
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Independent

170
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Smart

171
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see them all interacting to see their faces.

172
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. And notice how that feels in your body just pay attention.

173
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: To where that land that imagery

174
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a part that's tense. Is there a part that just relaxed as that imagery became solidified

175
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.940
Christina Haro: I just feel relax.

176
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I made the assumption that you had those two containers there in front of you so that we could do the bilateral stimulation. Did you happen to get those by that you do look, you're so good, you got them. Okay. And they're about shoulder width apart.

177
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.540
Christina Haro: Yes, yes.

178
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So what we'll do is we're going to do a really slow iteration, which means we'll do some bilateral stimulation and I want it just to install that positive imagery, so

179
00:22:49.290 --> 00:23:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to direct the pace, you just hold, just as you were holding those images in your mind. Okay, then at the end, I'll ask you to inhale exhale let your mind go blank and see what comes up. Okay.

180
00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold them.

181
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective nurturing and wise got it in your mind.

182
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, nice and slow. Let's look at the top of those containers, very slowly, left and right.

183
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's have a deep belly breath. Inhale.

184
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale out the mouth.

185
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let your mind go blank.

186
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:09.930
And see what comes up in your mind after you go not forcing anything to see what you notice

187
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: No censoring actually want to know anything that happens.

188
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.060
Christina Haro: It just feels like the room got really quiet.

189
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.020
Christina Haro: Is really really quiet.

190
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha. Nice.

191
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little bit

192
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, but what's the emotion that you're feeling Christina because I sent something else going on. What's the label that emotion.

193
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.270
Christina Haro: Happy

194
00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:05.520
Christina Haro: They're happy because I felt like the whole time I was doing this. It was like I was concentrating on my dad.

195
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:07.590
Christina Haro: Felt

196
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.370
Christina Haro: Yeah, good good emotion that

197
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.290
Happy. Okay.

198
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to know, anytime you want. You don't have to wait for me.

199
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To bring his presence into an image. Notice how when you concentrate on something. It calms the body and it also gives you a positive emotion that's how powerful our working memory is. It's amazing.

200
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good creative mine too. So I do want to do some desensitization which can be activating we won't get really high on the distress level.

201
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll be checking in on that here and there. Okay, so I want you to think about

202
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That sad. I saw earlier, an anchor, will you look sad and you named it anger.

203
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Without treatment, why don't you pick one. I can take your time. I want you to what's usually the most hopeful, believe it or not.

204
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't have to tell me the story. So that's a nice thing if you don't want to tell the story, what you can, because that's you've labeled maybe maybe telling someone might be part of your healing process but

205
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to think of the most intense right

206
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on wanted that one right in there and less than something else. I think that might be a core target and try and picture the worst.

207
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Image of that event. Usually it's the most intense one in our life going back. We were nine or we were eight or we were seven or we were 15 where it was a very intense realization of that belief. I'm not wanted. See if you can

208
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of identify one

209
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know when you have it in your mind. Take your time. Okay, there's no rush.

210
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:38.310
Christina Haro: OK.

211
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I will. How will ruin this image.

212
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.920
Christina Haro: Oh, I think I was like, bye.

213
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and how kind of zero to 100 how distressed. Are you right now.

214
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.670
This is like 70

215
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am.

216
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.140
Christina Haro: I don't believe like

217
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.700
Christina Haro: At okay

218
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

219
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm gonna go up here to at. And so I do want us to come down a little bit. That's a little intense. So before we do some of the work I wanna let's do a little bit of

220
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Re grounding with some positive imagery. Remember that happy feeling. We're going to do that again. Okay, so now I want you to

221
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull a net positive imagery, just for a moment just to remember you can come back down. So let's do this together really picturing dad.

222
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is being

223
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: All that big white guardian angel that sense of protection.

224
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And that he is there by your side at all times.

225
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.160
Okay.

226
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's not anger. That's sad. Christina, isn't it.

227
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't it feel sad.

228
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking

229
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.260
Christina Haro: Just think about right there.

230
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're being sad because, why do you think

231
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.030
Christina Haro: Because I was so

232
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.650
Yeah.

233
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right now, what you get to do is really be present with those qualities and it might be a good idea to also acknowledge them in you.

234
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Really acknowledge that you have those same qualities inside of you.

235
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't you pull up this self image you and your ad. Can you put them together.

236
00:29:51.480 --> 00:30:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and I'm going to do an iteration. Now I want you to pull those in your awareness qualities of guardian angel protective nature always they're always together.

237
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, together with those images. Breathing into it.

238
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You share those qualities

239
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Provide those qualities

240
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.820
They're yours forever.

241
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself unconditionally loving

242
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, felt unexpressed

243
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Safe

244
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

245
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on the image of yourself, the quality unconditional love.

246
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Safety

247
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And wisdom.

248
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing.

249
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Together right into the belly. Nice big belly breath.

250
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

251
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your stress level at this time.

252
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.640
Christina Haro: About a 40 that's a little more

253
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're going to do a little bit of work around that image, you had earlier. Do you remember what it was.

254
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. And it gotcha up to an ad pretty quickly. So notice how you do have some influence right

255
00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You have this magic inside of you that you can turn your attention to a beautiful Quality Protection nurturing and safety and you can bring your distress level down you can pay attention to breath.

256
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, if you want to stop. You can do this. You can always just say stop. I absolutely if it's too much or you want more, you can always go more I like what what's coming out of my young

257
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: My memory, right, because some things can emerge and that's what this does is it may make it fragments may come up

258
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is going to be desensitisation so the I'm moving. It's going to be faster and there may be a period where it gets high but we're going to persevere and then it should get lower. Okay.

259
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:40.800
Christina Haro: Okay.

260
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at beliefs. So this image that you have the worst picture of that image that memory.

261
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your belief about yourself at that time.

262
00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:02.610
Christina Haro: Was at that age. I felt like I didn't belong there. I felt like

263
00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't belong. Yep. I don't belong. And that was a very early age. Typically people can remember h5 sometimes age for this is like earliest memory and this I don't belong has started.

264
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so early in your life. I got you. And you can hold that image. And let's do the positive cognition at age five, right, what would have been nice.

265
00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Well with a positive thought, what would have been nice to have have a belief about yourself, what with a positive one. I wish you had this one I am what

266
00:34:49.560 --> 00:35:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it wasn't there, but we're going to get there. Christina. Just trust the process. Okay, I know it's painful even think about it because you think about what's not right. I know it's hard, honey. I know.

267
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what this is going to do. Okay. Because we're going to get they're

268
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.460

Okay.

275
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now I don't have waterproof mascara on. You can't be making me cry. This Martin.

277
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.490
Christina Haro: Okay.

278
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have to say it quickly.

279
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have liked to have thought at age five. I am

280
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.280
Christina Haro: Loved, I guess.

281
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Yeah, I kind of figured that was it. Okay, now

282
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the past and remember because of all this trauma, it's probably not in the past, it keeps getting re experienced in the present. And so it's info. So let's go to

283
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Recognize that this is going to

284
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Do is going to, it's going to reset so that that said in the past. It's not relive that pain in the present moment.

285
00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So the I Am love for a moment. I want you to think from a scale of one to seven seven being absolutely true. I am loved this is present time. How true is it right now. I am loved

286
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.460
Christina Haro: So good.

Christina Haro: About an eight.

290
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay.

291
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is the desensitization part. Okay. What this is going to do is, there's going to be a distraction with the light. Well, there's no light, but you're going to be looking at

292
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The top. So these two containers. Give your mind a chance okay to desensitized to it here with me.

293
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It might bring up some intense emotions get all the way through it if you want to. You have an option you can talk while you're doing it. If something big comes up, you can otherwise you can share up after the

294
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Bilateral stimulation comes to a close. Okay, so you're going to do two things number I was telling you about working memory.

295
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's reset that image back in the past. So what I want you to do is pull up that WORST piece at age five that worst image that she had and

296
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't belong. Okay. And so it's going to be a little faster.

297
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it in your awareness.

Gwenevere Abriel: Your body. You're here now you're listening to me and that imagery of that negative experience.

415
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is moving away.

416
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Cars outside and people moving around.

417
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:16.950
Christina Haro: That's fine.

418
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:19.110
Christina Haro: But that

419
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not nearby.

420
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's further and further away. Do you see it.

421
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:27.810
Yeah.

422
00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you still see it or is it getting tiny

423
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.090
Christina Haro: It's getting time it was

424
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Really hard work today. I know this was not an easy thing for you to do.

425
00:58:51.150 --> 00:59:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That was in the past, and this is the kind of work that will get it lodged in the past so that you don't have to keep reliving it or hide from it. Does that make sense so it doesn't

426
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Know where

427
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be a piece of where the big anger was coming.

428
00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:08.400
From

429
00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the healing piece you're doing some great work. I want to know what else you're going to do today is just, just like your dad would want you to do today. What can you do that. It's just, just just too cool just too sweet for you. What could you do

430
00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:35.280
Christina Haro: Well, I have to check my car, my dad always showed me how to check my own cars. So either good

431
00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:37.590
Christina Haro: Stuff so

432
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That is so great picture. His presence right in teaching you how to please be present with him as you do check your car. I would do it right away.

433
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:49.470
Okay.

434
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm very proud of you, if something else comes up, if this feels overwhelming or anything like that, we can meet again.

435
00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is, this is what may it may get worse before it gets better. That's we just kind of got in that neural network, it might pop in on a dream that would be typical. This means the treatments working so

436
01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.150
Christina Haro: Don't

437
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Write me off. Okay, hang in there for it to get to

438
01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:15.150
Christina Haro: The end.

439
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I will get to the other side. Okay.

440
01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but you can text me, call me don't don't isolate yourself. I notice you don't ever reach out to me. But you can

441
01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, I'll try and find time to meet with you.

442
01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you ready to face your day. What are you going to go do

443
01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:35.310
Christina Haro: I'm going to go check my car.

444
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Talk to you later.

445
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.200
Christina Haro: Okay. Bye bye.

446
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

447
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.680
Alicia Noedel: Good morning. How are you

448
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Quiet this morning it was

449
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.060
Wanted to be really careful right near the end. So I apologize for being late.

450
01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:05.580
Alicia Noedel: Sorry, just get your

451
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.890
Alicia Noedel: Event for morning so

452
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You've had a wonderful morning or not so

453
01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.320
Alicia Noedel: An event for one

454
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my

455
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.630
Alicia Noedel: I would just want to check on

456
01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Elisa right

457
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.010
Alicia Noedel: Yes, ma'am.

458
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to just say, I say it correctly because

459
01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:24.750
I'm working on that.

460
01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:28.350
Alicia Noedel: Again, I don't mind. Either way,

461
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no, no, no, it's really important that that people hear their name, the way

462
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.850
They

463
01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So, at least. Yeah, there's so many different directions. We can go at any given time, take, take some quiet introspection for just a moment, it just as I'm going to pull up a note, you can just sort of turn inward and I want you to register.

464
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want to come away with today.

465
01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I invite you to consider. Is it a feeling. Is it new thought, is it change.

466
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Something more

467
01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.920
Alicia Noedel: For something less than

468
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:08.460
Or maybe

469
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You experience inside and seeing you today.

470
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.500
What you want

471
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: To see if we can make that happen. You know what you want.

472
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.030
Alicia Noedel: Oh,

473
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:31.110
Alicia Noedel: I, I suppose. Yeah.

474
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me maybe I can help.

475
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:36.960
Um,

476
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:43.200
Alicia Noedel: I think maybe just a better under because already you helped me

477
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:55.920
Alicia Noedel: Understand certain reasons why I do things and open my mind like I had kind of like a not a, not a break. But like I had kind of like a

478
01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:12.810
Alicia Noedel: An eye opening experience the other day when I was thinking about you talking about how my life and things that I do. Okay, or, you know, can be directly routed back to my childhood.

479
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh you have so many amazing experiences ahead of you, if that tiny little featherweight peace affected you boy you are really going to benefit from therapy.

480
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:32.190
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. Well, I mean, just like it made me think, you know, how many things all these years. I thought you know that I was okay.

481
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:44.460
Alicia Noedel: And that I didn't need any kind of help. I didn't need anything. I was fine. I coped fine with everything that ever happened to me. And I realized, you know that I wasn't and I, and I'm not

482
01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You know why.

483
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.620
Alicia Noedel: It kind of, you know, made me really emotional but

484
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So another way. So I want, I don't want to miss the first part.

485
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want out of today.

486
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.430
Alicia Noedel: Have more understanding into myself.

487
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it more understanding my understanding of how a childhood can shape our beliefs, our feelings. Our expectations or relationships or confidence or self esteem, those kind of things.

488
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.830
Alicia Noedel: The way I see the world. Yeah.

489
01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, how I oh

490
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: My are my favorite places to work.

491
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:23.730
Happy to go

492
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, very complex and it is not the same for everyone, but I got lots of cool little theories. I can share with you, but they're still many of them are based in psychological theory and also

493
01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Psycho biology, there's also lots of new evidence now that we can measure things a little better. We can look in the brain, whereas the blood flowing and things like that. We're actually learning quite a bit more

494
01:04:51.090 --> 01:05:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's exciting. You're, you're learning about psychology right in a time when we actually have real measures and tests that we can sort of prove all that theory that you know that Freud was was talking about and things like that. So it's kind of neat.

495
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm happy to do that with you.

496
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: One one caution is this. I'm happy to do that. I just want to say that

497
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It is one thing to understand it. So for example, I believe, as I have met some of them that there are plenty of psychologists and psychotherapists out there.

498
01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That have a real understanding of why they behave the way they do. Why they interact with people in the world and they are still on happy.

499
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.720
Alicia Noedel: It is another thing. It's less like about

500
01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.840
Alicia Noedel: I don't know. Okay.

501
01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me say the other

502
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The other part.

503
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: At least. Yeah, this is understanding and this one we were frozen. Can you hear me.

504
01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I froze.

505
01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:55.380
Yeah.

506
01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so the second one. So this is understanding and if it was understanding in and of itself a self help book would work or right. It's not quite the same as experiencing healing.

507
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand it's one thing to read about it and intellectually. Oh, I know. And you did have an aha experience you started to connect some dots and really feel maybe validated like that explains why like you had this

508
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost like a full circle experience of understanding and the brain gives you a tiny little rush of Adobe when you get to the end of a story.

509
01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you have understanding whole your brain loves it. It's like, oh, we know what's going on, and it wants to reinforce that it loves that. But there's another thing that happens in therapy which is experiential

510
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And that can happen through a different kind of exercise. It's not me regurgitating things I've learned academically.

511
01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's actually experiencing something with me. Does that make sense.

512
01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, different and you can have both, but today you want to kind of have some more understanding right

513
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:10.530
Alicia Noedel: I mean,

514
01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:24.990
Alicia Noedel: I don't. I've never done this before, you know that so i i don't know what direction is the right direction, you know, who does. I mean,

515
01:07:26.010 --> 01:07:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Well I typically do

516
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm yeah

517
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:29.100
You do.

518
01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also like to pace what people want. So I'd like you to come away today, right, with a little bit more understanding of the connection between what happened and maybe how your relationship with the world.

519
01:07:42.180 --> 01:08:02.460
Alicia Noedel: How was I, I noticed, like when you were telling me when I was telling you about how my dad used to, you know, basically treat me like psychiatry, when I was very young and tell me all of his problems. And I realized, you know, when I was having that like you know epiphany basically

520
01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:11.820
Alicia Noedel: That I am doing that to everybody around me. Yeah. Now like I and you know my partner, my boyfriend.

521
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:25.440
Alicia Noedel: You know I'm constantly, you know, getting upset with him for not understanding and being able to help me with like problems that I'm having psychologically when in all reality that's not why he's here.

522
01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:30.030
Alicia Noedel: And so I you know I I felt really really bad.

523
01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no, no, no, no. This is the piece. And you mentioned this earlier and I meant to say. It's hard to say two things at the same time. Yes, there was probably that I use probably that word of parental education.

524
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably last time, very common with the folks I'm working with, but I want you to add this additional thought, if you can, which is I did the best I could.

525
01:08:56.430 --> 01:09:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning with the information that you had available to you. I did the best I could. And you're doing it now to you didn't have this information and the new stuff that you're going to learn in here. You didn't have that either if along the way you are going to be whipping yourself.

526
01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This may not get learned as quickly. But if instead you say I'm learning new things I'm doing things I learned

527
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What I didn't

528
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Know back then I did the best I could with what I knew back then. Okay, it's, it's not about shaming yourself.

529
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice how you were like, Oh, I feel bad that I I'm asking. No, no, no, that that's that's you longing to be healed. You're wanting someone to meet an unmet need from childhood.

530
01:09:50.640 --> 01:10:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: A big piece of it, like I was saying will happen here. But you'll learn some different ways to get it from your partner. Okay. You'll learn some ways to get that done.

531
01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But first, it's kind of along the way. I really invite you to not hurt yourself with shame. Like, I shouldn't have done this, we can usually find them if we have one of those shifts in there. I better, I must if we have any rigid thoughts like, I'm not supposed to

532
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah if you if you have one of those.

533
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: They can be a shame activating and that's not the goal. The goal is to have a tender sort of compassionate witnessing of it just just just saying okay

534
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how I now want my my sweetheart. To understand me to try and heal me. Look, what I'm doing. How interesting. I will talk to my therapist about that.

535
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, not the layer on top which is on a turkey for doing that now or what do you do you swear words are not in your head. I don't know what

536
01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That layer, I strongly invite you to do what's called thought stopping as soon as it comes up. If you have a negative appraisal of yourself a negative name.

537
01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm selfish and greedy I'm undeserving I don't know what's your, what's your, your sound like just you take it you say thank you for sharing.

538
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for getting me as far as she did, but I'm working with a therapist right now around this and she told me not to be mean to me.

539
01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:26.940
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

540
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.960
Alicia Noedel: I think I'm, I'm probably my worst critic I'm harder on myself than anyone ever could be.

541
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I know. And I can explain psychologically why you did that. Okay.

542
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get back to making the most out of today.

543
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you let me go in your note here. I want to make sure we're doing all these sort of preparation pieces for some of the experiential work, we're going to do. Let me just see what we've done so far. Okay.

544
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we have none of them. Okay, can we do this, can we develop a

545
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This is on the right side of the brain. So you kind of get like did you get the brain can be divided in a lot of different ways. Actually, but one of the bigger ways is to say, the left side.

546
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right side of the brain. You know, they kind of operate a little differently.

547
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now I'm going to be asking you to go to the right side which is it's actually where all of the emotions are. It's where creative mind is it's were

548
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:36.150
Alicia Noedel: Imagining

549
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:36.990
Things going to be

550
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I like you right now to go to that side. And I want you to tell me real or

551
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:44.460
Alicia Noedel: An

552
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: image that comes up for you that pro text is figure or quality real or imagined. So first thing that kind of comes up and and believe me there's no wrong way to do this. So,

553
01:12:58.650 --> 01:12:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be anything.

554
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:04.410
Alicia Noedel: In myself or like in

555
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.940
Alicia Noedel: Any real world.

556
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what's interesting, so notice the invitation is what comes up for you. When I say real or imagined quality of protection, a figure and I might end up moshing putting multiple other could be animal could be from a movie.

557
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be from your real life because the

558
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Quality of

559
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The protective quality.

560
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.680
Alicia Noedel: My dad. Okay.

561
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, is there any what's called ambivalence around that sometimes

562
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: People have a mixture of things with real people. When you think of because I'm going to need to resource. This

563
01:13:49.830 --> 01:14:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly down the line when you, you may be in distress, and I'm going to want to really tether to this quality and psychologically. I'm not going to want you to be having to question whether it's true. I want it to be true.

564
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the quality of dad that protect

565
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:09.600
Alicia Noedel: Me anytime we have sorry she's

566
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:11.850
Alicia Noedel: mad because she has to be with her daddy.

567
01:14:13.890 --> 01:14:14.370
Alicia Noedel: Um,

568
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.790
Alicia Noedel: When I was a kid.

569
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:29.730
Alicia Noedel: My dad, he wouldn't he wasn't like constantly abusive, but like there were times he had really bad anger issues that he would, you know, that's when he would get me.

570
01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:41.670
Alicia Noedel: But most of the time she was like my Savior and I you know everything about him felt so protective and, you know, he never wanted anything to happen to me.

571
01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:55.680
Alicia Noedel: And so, you know, when my mom would go and her like rages, and she would, you know, start trying to, you know, do whatever you know mean or, you know, violent whatever my dad would step in

572
01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:15.450
Alicia Noedel: Or there's been times where I've got any school and he wouldn't tell her, and he would, you know, keep it a secret because he didn't want me so like get in trouble with her, he, you know, I felt like a protection shield, you know,

573
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.450
Alicia Noedel: But if dad was there, everything was OK.

574
01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, there is a piece of it and I can see I'm really glad that he was there at times, but there's also an abuse of history.

575
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stretch a little further out from there, you recognize it. You saw pieces of it inequality with dad, but let's go into

576
01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.220
Other

577
01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:41.400
Alicia Noedel: Maybe other people you

578
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, and you may have only known him for a little while and there wasn't a flip side of a coin. There wasn't there also violent. Just say, Okay, this, this, there's no rush.

579
01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be so I'll give you some examples. The whole

580
01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: One person had Tony Stark.

581
01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people have a spiritual sort of

582
01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of God that kind of kind of picture. Okay, that's perfect. There's no i bill, it's about that they might picture. Some people go to a nature space they go to a mountain.

583
01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really different for everyone that's why or an animal. They might say a lion.

584
01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how giving yourself permission to depart from real people really expands the imagination. Give yourself permission to do

585
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's perfect in its protective quality.

586
01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, listen, there's no wrong answer to this.

587
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.450
Alicia Noedel: One. The first thing I thought about was, could we do

588
01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay, so we've got

589
01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can you picture him protecting who and what was the protecting kind of give me that snapshot. So I can bring us back to me to Scooby Doo.

590
01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:26.130
Alicia Noedel: His friends.

591
01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:28.740
Alicia Noedel: Monsters.

592
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. His friends for monsters, beautiful, I love it. Any ambivalence about that. Did he ever do anything need Scooby Doo ever do anything mean

593
01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:39.900
Alicia Noedel: No.

594
01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I know right.

595
01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Fantastic. Okay, so now, nicely done. And this may change over time. But for now, we've got something that that is very linear in its in its protective quality. I'm not going to use the one with with your, your parents. Okay, I

596
01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Think there might be some challenges down the line for that.

597
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, doesn't mean that we can't. There's a way we can get pieces of what your dad was doing. We can we can get that integrated, but we'll do that a little bit later. First let's we've got two more to do, just on this.

598
01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking about a nurturing figure. Now, now, nurturing, real or imagined nurturing is someone something that wants for you, your growth your full potential doesn't want anything in return this again no mixture.

599
01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Only want you to develop into the person

600
01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That you want to be wanting your growth your development that is a nurturing quality, sometimes there's affection associated but I don't typically mentioned that

601
01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's more about wanting you to develop into the woman that you want to be.

602
01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes out real or imagined.

603
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.380
Alicia Noedel: Something I've never thought about before.

604
01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I know. And this can feel wildly confusing.

605
01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know. It can also include, you know, this is an interesting point because for some people, they've they've come to find I it's me.

606
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:48.660
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, because I've never felt like anything like that run anybody okay

607
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, alright. So, I will say, Elise yet some people's landscape of

608
01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Scarcity neglect and abuse is so profound that the relationship here and I don't want to create long term dependence on me. But for a moment when we don't have someone else to work through this stuff. It can be me.

609
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what happens it's gets integrated into you. You don't need me anymore because I'm definitely in the business of putting myself out of business.

610
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you end up having everything that happens here. You have an inside the cells and then you go about your life and you think, hey, I came up with this. I don't even remember going in here that's fine with me.

611
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So for a while, you may start to recognize if you want to. You wouldn't be the first one that

612
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.240
Alicia Noedel: You might see something here with

613
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Us. Or maybe you might see something in your doctor, you might see something in a friend, you might see something on in a movie.

614
01:20:54.660 --> 01:21:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to know what I'm going to do with these pieces. The important part right here, at least, is that it's hard for you to see that there's been someone that just pure and simply wants for you to be everything you want to be.

615
01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and that's kind of hard to think about

616
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:21.660
Alicia Noedel: I just feel like, like I've never had anyone who's ever had that kind of

617
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.470
Alicia Noedel: Interested in me like only my interest that hasn't been selfish.

618
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.770
Alicia Noedel: Like selfish intentions are like, you know, whatever it may be.

619
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: They want something in return.

620
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You got one hand out and the other ones doing this.

621
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.280
Alicia Noedel: Right, like I'm

622
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.450
Alicia Noedel: Like ulterior motives. That's right.

623
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So play with this for a second. So that's why I want to introduce this concept of therapeutic relationship. Just, just as a point of departure. If you don't stay here and you're like, No, it doesn't work for me. We can go somewhere else. But just try it on, watch, watch. With this is

624
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that you don't know. Do I Have Children do I not have children. Do you know if I have a trauma history. Do you know if I'm an alcoholic. Do you know if my house is in foreclosure. You don't know anything.

625
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

626
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.910
Alicia Noedel: Hmm.

627
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and it's for a reason. There are a lot of people that will sort of share their stories.

628
01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't and that's because I want my clients to know, truly. This is about you.

629
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, the thing I get is, I get compensation.

630
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a professional

631
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What isn't paid for is the fact that I care that happens as soon as I meet a client, I just do I care.

632
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.430
Alicia Noedel: probably hard to

633
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you came over to my side there for a second, stay with you.

634
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I've worked that out.

635
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to take care of me.

636
01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, that's why not hearing about all my stories etc etc keeps it so that you have a safe space to take from me to be a taker.

637
01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.330
Alicia Noedel: Reporting concept for me.

638
01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how for a second. You went over to. Oh, that must be hard for you.

639
01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: All work that out. You're in the habit of worrying about other worrying about, you know, someone else's feelings. You don't have to do that here.

640
01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.170
Alicia Noedel: A lot. Yeah.

641
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.420
Alicia Noedel: I know I can. Yeah, I think about nobody else well for myself.

642
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, play with that. And just imagine that there might be safety in a professional

643
01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.340
Alicia Noedel: Relationship where

644
01:23:56.370 --> 01:24:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's literally unethical. See, it would be unethical for me.

645
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:04.140
Alicia Noedel: To take from you. Right.

646
01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't

647
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Make everybody cry.

648
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: One skill set.

649
01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what's so unique about this, it means you don't take care of me. It means you don't protect me.

650
01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to

651
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Worry and be concerned about me.

652
01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You can show up angry. You can show up disappointed at me. You can, you can, you're going to be working through a lot of the stuff that's happened to you in in your life if you

653
01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you trust enough in here, it'll show up in here. There might be times you're even irritated and angry with me you won't be about one of your

654
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be about maybe old, old, old, old disappointments and resentments. And my job is to not take it personally, which I don't

655
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that is a space where I want for you, your development and growth.

656
01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need you to teach me how to grow and develop. I don't need you to take care of me. This is a space where you're a taker.

657
01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:27.990
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

658
01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now. Do you recognize it in yourself. Have you seen glimpses in yourself.

659
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the potential to really blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I really want to develop in a way, blah, blah, blah, blah. Do you have a sense even if you saw it for a little bit like Oh, I'm really good at it. I want to do that. This is exciting. She catch any of those throughout your life.

660
01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Where was it. What's a little story.

661
01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:07.590
Alicia Noedel: I think I was in seventh grade. And my teacher invited a poet, writer to come in and I'm

662
01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:23.010
Alicia Noedel: The first time I discovered, like how to use your, you know, brain to write poetry was so you know intense for me because it finally had some kind of outlet

663
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:31.290
Alicia Noedel: To, you know, express how I was feeling and that's been my coping mechanism for years.

664
01:26:32.010 --> 01:26:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. So I'm wondering if what you found was

665
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A way to channel the intensity of your pain.

666
01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You found a place for it.

667
01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's neat you transform something maybe dark and you made it beautiful.

668
01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.100
Yeah.

669
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's

670
01:26:55.890 --> 01:27:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good for me to know too because maybe there'll be some journaling or some poetry writing or story writing or something that could be a part of.

671
01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Your relapse prevention plan.

672
01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:08.160
That's good for me to know

673
01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in seventh grade.

674
01:27:16.410 --> 01:27:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you about that teacher or that poet, the canyon. Did it seem like

675
01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone ever saw that

676
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Strengthen you saw those poems and thought, wow, you've got you've got you've got something inside to give

677
01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:40.950
Alicia Noedel: Anytime I ever showed anybody, something like that. It just felt like, um,

678
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:46.920
Alicia Noedel: I thought we were good. And so I was really excited. Um,

679
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:53.850
Alicia Noedel: But it felt like they you know you care. Oh, okay.

680
01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So we don't have a lot of people on the outside, but what about in seventh grade, there wasn't even that one that notion of the quality that was it a visitor that came into the cloud.

681
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:13.200
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. Mm hmm. He said that I was unnatural because he told us, you know, a good way to do it is, don't think about what you're writing

682
01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:20.250
Alicia Noedel: Just put your pen to the paper, pencil to paper and just let your brain go

683
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:21.120
Alicia Noedel: Just do it.

684
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:23.430
Alicia Noedel: Snatcher handle. Yes.

685
01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You that poet.

686
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That that visitor. Did he was it he or she

687
01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:32.370
Alicia Noedel: It was a he.

688
01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Did he say, Now tell me how great my palms are

689
01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:37.560
Alicia Noedel: No.

690
01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Did he take anything from you.

691
01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:41.460
Know,

692
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do recognize it. You see it. There it is. That's what it feels like. And we'll take it, even if it was that glimpse in seventh grade.

693
01:28:51.210 --> 01:29:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: My hope is you'll see it here. My hope is time after time after time, you will recognize yourself around people that nurture that okay that really pull that out in you that want your growth potential. And you start to gravitate towards those people over time, but for

694
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

695
01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll take that little flash

696
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.170
Alicia Noedel: And so

697
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: All this nurturing figure. What should we call them. We use this one for a while.

698
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:19.830
Alicia Noedel: I don't even remember his name.

699
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You can make up whatever you want. There's no rules in this

700
01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:24.990
Alicia Noedel: John

701
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was gonna go poet guy, but we'll go with john

702
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We say john oh it

703
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.260
Sure.

704
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You change it when you want to. Okay, if it gets annoying or you think it's something else. I don't get angry. I don't get irritated at least. Yes. So you can say, you know, I want to change this, you just tell me

705
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know you'll be inhibited doing that, but I'm going to keep inviting those things so strong, the poet for now and then, because I have a really strong personality and I just keep rolling and moving along, and

706
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but it'll be an opportunity for you to push back at me a little bit. Alright, so this the experience you had was

707
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: An invitation around

708
01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't overthink it just it's a natural flow from your brain and you just put it from the the uncensored maybe up here, put it to paper from from thought to papers out about it.

709
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:29.940
Yeah. Okay, there we go.

710
01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I got another one for you. As if that one wasn't hard enough.

711
01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So the third figure. There's only three. So you're, you're almost done. The third one is

712
01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A wise figure. So think about real or imagined.

713
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A character can be even some people go spiritual on this one.

714
01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That you know without mixed feelings about it. It's just unambiguously

715
01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise.

716
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To have this quality about them. Maybe it's scored knowledge. Maybe it's like

717
01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Life Skills or something like that, but they

718
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:21.120
Alicia Noedel: All merge intelligence, maybe, but they

719
01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Have this wise quality who who comes to mind or what comes to mind.

720
01:31:51.090 --> 01:31:51.690
Alicia Noedel: Hard

721
01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Really hard. I ask hard questions tonight.

722
01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, picture, picture a movie.

723
01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a TV show or a book or someone seemed wise they just seemed Oh, knowing you know they didn't doubt themselves. And it was just like

724
01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:46.830
Alicia Noedel: Oh, sorry.

725
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, it's okay.

726
01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no buzzer that's going to go off.

727
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.230
Alicia Noedel: There's don't want to waste time is my brain working

728
01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel like you're wasting your time.

729
01:33:06.570 --> 01:33:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, then take take as long as you need.

730
01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: These are worth it. These are things that will be weaving in throughout our work together. They're important so

731
01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It means something that you just tenderly and gently at its own pace.

732
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: just wander through because now you know you don't have to get something done by a deadline. You just wander through maybe picture some movies. Some, some religions or images.

733
01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe someone else's wise hero.

734
01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I can help brainstorm with some people say Gandalf

735
01:33:52.380 --> 01:34:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The Buddha, they say, Jesus Christ. They have said gray haired old lady. Those are just a few right

736
01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll

737
01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:08.460
Alicia Noedel: I guess. Yeah. Jesus. Jesus

738
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Will see if there's ambivalence, because notice how you said, I guess I pay close attention to people's language and the words they choose it represents what's going on inside their, their minds. It's all I've got. Are these these words.

739
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: See how it's not Jesus just for a second indulge me. How is it not Jesus if

740
01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:31.770
Alicia Noedel: It is

741
01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It is there's no ambivalence. It's Jesus. He's wise.

742
01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

743
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:39.240
Yep.

744
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have that and just so I understand what's the Jesus you know him, describe

745
01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:53.970
Alicia Noedel: Like physical attributes.

746
01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: However, you think about. I'm just now. And you thought Jesus as a wise figure. How did it come up. What were some imagery

747
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:05.100
Alicia Noedel: Like Passion of the Christ Jesus. Okay.

748
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

749
01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that bit self sacrificing

750
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.560
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

751
01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.640
Yeah.

752
01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And since it's about wisdom. What was he sacrificing for

753
01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:25.620
Alicia Noedel: Everyone else

754
01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I once got me a little concerned not that Jesus is a problem, but only because it's your I think I've got to correctly. It's a bit of a default for you to do this already, which is to sacrifice yourself.

755
01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right

756
01:35:54.630 --> 01:35:55.110
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

757
01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:56.370
Yeah, so

758
01:35:57.510 --> 01:36:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to it. I wrote it all down, it's it's really beautiful.

759
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so not he's not a protector, but definitely wise. So, but let's hold on to that a little longer because I might be wrong.

760
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If generosity.

761
01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right is

762
01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the ultimate wisdom right if compassion and gratitude.

763
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the ultimate wisdom that there's there's real wisdom in giving

764
01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I could see that.

765
01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:38.490
Alicia Noedel: About another one.

766
01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.760
Alicia Noedel: Felt like was more

767
01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:46.230
Alicia Noedel: Tedious Tupac Shakur

768
01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:47.220
Yeah.

769
01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: All that, but I should know as music

770
01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:55.950
Alicia Noedel: PAC as ha

771
01:36:56.190 --> 01:36:56.940
Alicia Noedel: OK, you are

772
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you, ma'am.

773
01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Okay.

774
01:37:01.290 --> 01:37:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice, um, let's do sort of this screen was to pop

775
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And Jesus what it. What's the, what are some things that are not the same. If you split the screen. One is to proxy core and the other one is Jesus. How are they different like in their

776
01:37:21.450 --> 01:37:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Treatment of the self.

777
01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:42.240
Alicia Noedel: I feel like I just, to me, I relate more to it's harder for me to relate to Jesus.

778
01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.780
Alicia Noedel: Okay, because, I mean, you know, not perfect. Nobody's perfect. He wasn't perfect but

779
01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:54.270
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

780
01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

781
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: In my mind, and you'll have to tell me what's true for you. When I think of Jesus.

782
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: He didn't buy material things for himself.

783
01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.900
Alicia Noedel: Right wasn't selfish.

784
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.630
Alicia Noedel: Right. Was it

785
01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.760
Alicia Noedel: Wasn't like I don't know how to say

786
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not materialistic

787
01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.270
Alicia Noedel: Right, yeah. Yeah, but there's a

788
01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Secret seek

789
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: An audience for print like for his ego, whereas maybe to pop. He did videos to maybe earn money right he took what he was doing, not in and of itself to help others but

790
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: One was sort of a profit and one made a profit.

791
01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think are we are we at the core of the difference or now.

792
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.230
Yeah.

793
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:55.650
Alicia Noedel: Okay, yeah.

794
01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there might be more in there. And so maybe you can spend some time thinking about

795
01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Yeah, because all right. But for now, I've got to park and

796
01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:08.460
Alicia Noedel: Me some nose wiper please. Thank you.

797
01:39:08.850 --> 01:39:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to lose this

798
01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Piece with Jesus, though, because it

799
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be useful down the line, too, but having

800
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:22.110
Alicia Noedel: I mean, they both do things for me in different ways, you know,

801
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What is to

802
01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Those okay well what is to pot. I know you relate to him more. What does he do for you. What do you think

803
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:33.990
Alicia Noedel: I know this. This is funny but um

804
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:40.650
Alicia Noedel: I see. He was very wise to and

805
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.920
Alicia Noedel: Never said self doubt.

806
01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:46.920
Alicia Noedel: Or um

807
01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:52.710
Alicia Noedel: Was so sure about everything you're saying and assertive.

808
01:39:57.450 --> 01:40:00.030
Alicia Noedel: I think it's just all the things that I wish I was

809
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And what's interesting is, he's a he's a poet.

810
01:40:07.410 --> 01:40:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And he really so now he's

811
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.320
Alicia Noedel: Got yeah

812
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like this nice combination you've put

813
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That poet, right, the one that came to the classroom that flash

814
01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Around nurturing and now we've also got this piece of this

815
01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: songwriter.

816
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:31.110
Alicia Noedel: Yo, I wrote for that like class I

817
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:36.000
Alicia Noedel: I went into a creative writing class after that and

818
01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:41.250
Alicia Noedel: Really final piece of that class was about Tupac Shakur

819
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:45.660
Alicia Noedel: And just because he's always been such a

820
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:48.060
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

821
01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:55.740
Alicia Noedel: Figure a figure of like idealization to me.

822
01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: An idol.

823
01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:58.740
Yeah.

824
01:41:03.330 --> 01:41:08.220
Alicia Noedel: Sorry me scared my baby in her sleep, my boy, you're bringing

825
01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:11.100
Alicia Noedel: She's so cute.

826
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: may look a little puzzle.

827
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:21.900
Alicia Noedel: Mercy and then look at her little feet or shoes.

828
01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see. Oh.

829
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No you didn't.

830
01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right hand like this one's still like flexed.

831
01:41:32.970 --> 01:41:40.230
Alicia Noedel: She goes like this all the time. Or she goes with a little pinky and she does their pinky out she's funny.

832
01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Precious so

833
01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Short version. I'm going to take what you said here will refine it over time, but I want to

834
01:41:58.290 --> 01:42:03.240
Alicia Noedel: Get a better understanding of of it, it'll be easier to do that to refine it

835
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But believe it or not, the fact that you did this work today, it'll get in there. You'll, you'll kind of go, huh. All right. Okay.

836
01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:15.750
Alicia Noedel: I stay reflecting on things a lot after we talked to

837
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll give you a short version of what we may end up doing with this first of all the years, you can do whatever you want them. But those are your team.

838
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your resource team.

839
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's going to be times when you're going to have

840
01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotions

841
01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Or memories will come up and you're not interested in

842
01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Processing them in the moment you know how you've had some times and you do some self reflection. Maybe it'll be inconvenient for you and you don't want to

843
01:42:49.650 --> 01:42:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You might want to feel better. You might want to feel more confident

844
01:42:54.690 --> 01:43:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe before you were sending you were running a network and neural network right was basically a chunk of thoughts that sort of sit together.

845
01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are reinforcing those negative ones. Yeah, I'm a real Turkey I'm going nowhere. Whatever the negative you're feeding and feeding giving it more and more evidence. And you remember that we develop this resource team.

846
01:43:14.010 --> 01:43:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead, because remember, we can only be thinking about a small chunk of information at a time.

847
01:43:21.450 --> 01:43:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't think about all of our childhood memories all at once we pull up a memory. We're only thinking about one piece of it.

848
01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you could do is you could say, Okay. Yeah, that's what I was doing before. I'm going to deliberately be thinking about these images, all in the same room together with me all of us went around, interacting

849
01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do I feel when I'm around them. How does my body feel, what are my emotions. What questions might I ask them what might they asked me.

850
01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Having to pop right picture his confidence.

851
01:43:58.470 --> 01:44:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe john the poet comes in, or maybe that starts to change and you'll informed me, the next time we meet, or maybe you'll do some writing about that and how would to pocket interact with Scooby Doo.

852
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You could see that. I mean, that's a fun image to be, I think,

853
01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.050
Hey,

854
01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And how will it morph and change. How will you interact with them. Think about how much

855
01:44:27.690 --> 01:44:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: more pleasant. Your mind will be if you spend time feeding it with more images more analysis around that team.

856
01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Whereas minutes ago you were feeding it with. Yeah, you're, you're no good look at where you came from, you are spending on instead you push that one aside and call it thought stop you push it to the side and you literally work.

857
01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard at pulling in more imagery around this team you interacting with this team that's just one way that we're going to use it. There's a lot of different ways. We're going to use it.

858
01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want to give you super short version.

859
01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you said I want to walk away with a little bit understanding. So I'm just gonna throw one thing. Gotcha.

860
01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I did it. I did a group topic. Once

861
01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll try and find the little write up for you at some point. But the short version is this

862
01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people present as self identified

863
01:45:35.250 --> 01:45:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: procrastinators or perfectionist.

864
01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Obsessive Compulsive or

865
01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, controlling however they identify right what they've done and and also a piece of that is self sacrificing or shame activating I it's my fault. I'll default to

866
01:45:57.390 --> 01:46:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What have I done wrong. Many, many, many, many, many people do that. Which one of those or any of those kind of sounded like you

867
01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:20.970
Alicia Noedel: Were me myself for everything, taking the blame and anytime anyone's upset or anything. I think that it's because of me so I try and fix it or you know

868
01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so notice that you cultivated that adaptations. Probably when you were five. I mean, we're talking probably very, very early on, but just imagine that a five year old has developed a brain that is so underdeveloped compared to the brain that you have right now. Your brain finished developing

869
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, I have an air condition have to tip my head up and down.

870
01:46:48.150 --> 01:47:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: At about 2625 26 so just imagine that this little five year old adapted to her environment, the best that she knew how with the developmental brain that she had which was how long way to go.

871
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine that the way that she decided to feel safe in the world was in looking around, let's say, a neglectful or abusive or scarcity environment and thought, well, I can't control this. Look at these big people I know what I can do, I can control myself.

872
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I blame myself for everything.

873
01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.290
I can have control.

874
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that gets installed, you're five years old, but look how much that's probably still with you, it's the solution of a five year old. Isn't that amazing. But you know what's beautiful about it, Elisa is a kept you alive.

875
01:47:46.440 --> 01:48:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Bravo. And we're not going to throw it out. It's just an over adaptation you did the best she could with what you knew, you're going to know more, you can do better, but she you don't know what you don't know.

876
01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay, we're not going to get rid of it. It's one adaptation. It's just that you may have been over adaptive so your self sacrificing blaming yourself it served a purpose that kept you alive before

877
01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's more ways to interact with people than that.

878
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And just imagine that that's a solution.

879
01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a very young girl, and you're a woman.

880
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.390
Alicia Noedel: That thought about it that way. Yeah.

881
01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very, very common and people that

882
01:48:36.570 --> 01:48:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Can identify as

883
01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame activating where they say, well, it's my fault. And we default to that.

884
01:48:46.290 --> 01:49:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that is what kept you alive, back when you were younger. Because to get angry or act down against people that were taken care of. You might have meant abuse harm neglect and so we don't do that. We turn inward to control what we can, it's just a survival mechanism.

885
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:02.550
We have

886
01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: In the world. And so we just blame ourselves up for some people in perfectionism, because then if I don't get it right. I won't be accepted.

887
01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it stalls up doing anything because we aren't perfect. And so now we're right back to where we started doing anything so it can feel pretty pretty hopeless inside of there.

888
01:49:28.410 --> 01:49:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's a way out.

889
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So you wanted to understand the blaming do you kind of see how what I just did is I didn't give you the cycle analysis of object relations, which is this is what it's based on it's you know me the object.

890
01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's everyone else on the outside. I didn't give you the analysis of that I just gave you just sort of a basic explanation about why you may be doing that blaming you, would it was a wise adaptation

891
01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right to an environment that may not have been available to you in the way that you needed developmentally okay you did the best you could

892
01:50:10.530 --> 01:50:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way. There's no bad label. It's you did the best you good. I mean, I would have done it, he would have done it, she would have done it many have done it, you're going to see them in group who do the same thing. Okay.

893
01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might be outdated, because I know you know a lot more than a five year old.

894
01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't. Well, then you will. Okay, but you can't know it until you learn it. And that's what we're going to do.

895
01:50:36.090 --> 01:50:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That sense

896
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:38.670
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, okay.

897
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So as we come to the close. We've got four more minutes here. Would you share with me a little bit about what you noticed that was important for you in here today.

898
01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:57.660
Alicia Noedel: I think that um

899
01:50:59.490 --> 01:51:14.250
Alicia Noedel: You've given me like another way to like a more healthier way to cope with everyday stresses that I might feel are really intense but aren't that bad, and to

900
01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:20.880
Alicia Noedel: You know, use a healthy way to deal with them, rather than, you know, getting upset or whatever.

901
01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:22.590
Alicia Noedel: Would do

902
01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What you described.

903
01:51:25.410 --> 01:51:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Was called the

904
01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.150
Top down

905
01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: coping skill top down, meaning from our brain that's taking, you know, we're having a negative thought and then we do

906
01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We push it aside with another thought which is thank we say to ourselves, thank you for sharing kept me alive when I was young. Thank you.

907
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I know. I know I'm blaming myself, but I learned that when I was very little I'm learning new things and right now what I want to do is I want to spend my energy

908
01:51:56.190 --> 01:52:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: My mental energy. I'm going to create new tissue. We're literally creating new tissue. When you spend time thinking about the

909
01:52:07.050 --> 01:52:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective nurturing and wise figures. You're literally generate synaptic connections. That's amazing. That's exciting that area of your brain will grow.

910
01:52:19.410 --> 01:52:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And the likelihood that your mind will go to them instead of the negative ones increases, just by doing it today. Do it again later 10 times a day.

911
01:52:30.570 --> 01:52:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a top down intervention, the belly breathing right the diaphragm breathing. That'll be a bottom up intervention, the bright, the one that comes where we tell the message up the Vegas nerve. Hey, we're all right now, get off brain.

912
01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You're overreacting.

913
01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's there's different ways to cope. Lots of them. Those are two

914
01:52:55.710 --> 01:52:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I taught you the belly breathing last time. Correct.

915
01:52:59.130 --> 01:52:59.430
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

916
01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you remember to do it even once.

917
01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:04.200
Alicia Noedel: Or forgotten. It's okay, I've done it a few times.

918
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. Yeah. And the key part is the belly and if you can do that in through the nose right feeling it full belly whole whole whole exhale

919
01:53:19.050 --> 01:53:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: For that hold even for a couple seconds, you can do that couple of those three 510 cycles, even five

920
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you noticing that your stress level comes down a little.

921
01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:49.800
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I think that not only is the breathing help, but it also with like you're, you know, coming your body to calm your mind. But I it's also like the counting it gives you something else to like think about in that exact moment right to, you know,

922
01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It refers

923
01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:53.070
Alicia Noedel: To whatever was stressing you out.

924
01:53:53.340 --> 01:54:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It does two things. It's so great. It's so difficult when you're trying to do with fidelity that it gets your mind on that your mind wants to do one thing. Well, so let it do that just focus on that one.

925
01:54:07.290 --> 01:54:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what, now you can put these two things together when you're doing the breathing. Now, now, right. So right now I'm picturing yours.

926
01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I can totally see Tupac hanging with Scooby.

927
01:54:28.590 --> 01:54:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Was too easy. Right.

928
01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've done imagery that gets linked with a relaxed.

929
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Far out talk about mind body connection right, everything is OK. You are not in danger. Right now it's just a perceived threat. I can change my awareness body. I can focus on developing the symmetry, put those two things together that might be some

930
01:54:59.010 --> 01:54:59.700
Alicia Noedel: More to play.

931
01:55:00.150 --> 01:55:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It and see what you come up with. See how it feels.

932
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to ask you something.

933
01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's up to you, it's, it's a, you could go either way on this. Do you want to meet twice a week or continue with once a week.

934
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:17.520
Alicia Noedel: Oh,

935
01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.940
Alicia Noedel: I think right now, once a week is ok but it should be twice a week, I could do that too.

936
01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's up to you. What will stay with this because sometimes people are like, yes, I want to get to this, I want to move forward. I've got time, and they're going through such intense

937
01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Distress and they really want to expedite stuff I'm fine with once a week. Clinically, I think you're okay you're showing up. You're not coming in here. You're not telling me.

938
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: My life is just blowing up out of control. I'm cutting myself I'm burning myself, I'm thinking of using all day I slipped when we start to get into those suicidal and

939
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm just letting you know will create time to need a second time.

940
01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:07.410
Alicia Noedel: During the week okay you

941
01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You can tell me

942
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:14.940
Alicia Noedel: To me it's just more I have our Taiwan's handling, you know,

943
01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:26.820
Alicia Noedel: My, my own but ever, you know, oceans, whatever, sometimes, but you've already, you know, I've only met with the three times and you've already helped me a lot. So

944
01:56:29.610 --> 01:56:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe it's about taking these these nuggets and implementing them because honestly, you could get one that really works for you and it could work for the rest of your life. There's no

945
01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it's going to be 15 are going to be whatever you know your own recipe of healing is going to be unique to you. So take what you thought.

946
01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Apply it apply it again and again soon as you wake up having those mindfulness practice picturing the imagery that you're surrounded and immersed.

947
01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: With that team while doing the breath work to it a few times when someone sort of activates you emotionally. Give yourself time to breathe put in that imagery and maybe that's what this is about is giving that week to really practice the new skills.

948
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:17.010
Alicia Noedel: Okay.
