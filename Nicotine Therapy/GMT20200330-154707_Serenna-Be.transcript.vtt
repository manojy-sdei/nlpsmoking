125
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.460
Modoc County: That's true. Now, those people often just don't do anything at all please don't let one finger technical

126
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.440
Modoc County: I got time for

127
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.450
Modoc County: You know the world.

128
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:53.970
Modoc County: Moves too fast. Those in water to help out and pick up a shower. How about dignity, health and not be on the same key.

129
00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:09.480
Modoc County: But it was more time work on Maya my town electronics controls the whole body is it says filthy things before it's kind of working on my mouth or some when I say now how I represent myself.

130
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.930
Modoc County: How am I add to some stutters and

131
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:19.950
Modoc County: Not being bipolar and also staff. I'm stressed out. So always your screen and just

132
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.660
Modoc County: Relax.

133
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.960
Serenna Beers: Okay. So sounds like you're speaking of specific skills that I can think of.

134
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:44.040
Serenna Beers: Would be dialectical be Hey girl skills which include emotion regulation. So it's how you work on having a balance of, you know, it's fine to be upset we we we all get mad.

135
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:59.700
Serenna Beers: But it's what you say it's the delivery of how it comes out there is a way that you can mean what you say and say what you mean without saying it mean and a lot of folks struggle with, with that, especially when our emotions are heightened and then you put trauma on top of that.

136
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:15.720
Serenna Beers: You're triggered. So then it only you know exacerbates the already emotion that you're struggling to keep kind of regulated. So, so those are great, great things. Um, I don't think I missed anything, do you have any questions for me.

137
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.310
Modoc County: No.

138
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:20.670
Modoc County: Well,

139
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.490
Serenna Beers: I appreciate your time and I will. I've got you on the phone. Let me just take a look at something really quick.

140
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:33.960
Serenna Beers: Because I feel pretty confident than I am your therapist and the reason why I'm going to check is because there's times

141
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:47.490
Serenna Beers: When I do someone's bio psycho social just to help out. And so I don't want to say, I'll see you next time. If actually, I am not your they're your therapist, so give me one second here. Well, I double check.

142
00:13:49.350 --> 00:14:00.450
Serenna Beers: Because Whether I am or whether I am not. I think for your PTSD eventually down the road, you would be an excellent candidate for em, Dr. Have you ever heard of that.

143
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:16.860
Serenna Beers: So em dr is used as a evidence base. It's very, I mean it's not recent but it is cutting cutting edge but it's called I movement desensitization desensitization. It's where

144
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:30.540
Serenna Beers: I use a wand and it has a a light at the end of it, and I stimulate your, your eyes, going back and forth, which is left brain right right right brain.

145
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:45.390
Serenna Beers: And what that does is it initiates REM sleep while you're a wake and when we're in REM sleep, that's when our brains shut down and they kind of restart and we're at our most relaxed state. So when trauma.

146
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:52.020
Serenna Beers: Specific trauma happen you know when a trauma event happens, it gets stuck in our

147
00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:05.640
Serenna Beers: Nervous system and it just gets lodged there. So the EM Dr. What, what, what that does is it brings it from your nervous system, which is right in here and it brings it up to your

148
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:14.520
Serenna Beers: Working memory and you process it from start to finish with which is where your brain was initially intended to to do

149
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:22.860
Serenna Beers: And it helps you to basically it desensitizes you to the pain doesn't mean that you're never going to think of those pain. Pain painful.
