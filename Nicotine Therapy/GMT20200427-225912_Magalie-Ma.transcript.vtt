38
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.830
Kelley Briscar: I had to settle. But I guess I figured it was better than nothing. You

39
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.720
Kelley Briscar: Know,

40
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.290
Magalie Marcellus: I guess communicator.

41
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.700
Kelley Briscar: Not really.

42
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:53.160
Kelley Briscar: I just talked to her today regarding and she called me the other day, but it was regarding my own family, you kind of trying to get out of pain cheered me to pass it back.

43
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:10.710
Kelley Briscar: So I had this thought in regards to that. But otherwise, I really have some calls I just really don't feel like often and really now after all this, you know, I just need a little bit of a not

44
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.520
Kelley Briscar: An old things like a

45
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.310
Kelley Briscar: timely topic really hurt my feelings installation. When and how did you handle that.

46
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.040
Kelley Briscar: You know, and it's just not necessary to go and do that me without my knowledge and

47
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.200
Kelley Briscar: The whole thing. We already been

48
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:40.110
Kelley Briscar: Stopped. It's just really got me. And there's a few mistakes in the real time I'll get over it, you know, but I just need a little bit of time and

49
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:55.230
Kelley Briscar: She knows too worried about it anyway. Like reason I heard from her was because of the lamb or the necessary as opposed to them because they live far away. When we moved in.

50
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:14.610
Kelley Briscar: An office, the whole thing. But that's another the basement house you know we paid off the least half baths and her already. So really I don't see where she think she told us about that in the first place, but I'm not about getting into an argument with her over that. So,

51
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:26.070
Kelley Briscar: Anyway, that's my day been handling it because, you know, for that reason, but she needed my input on something for that. Why should you know

52
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.280
Kelley Briscar: Otherwise, I probably felt

53
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.750
Kelley Briscar: I could be wrong, but I, I don't think so. I think I probably still be in here and whatnot.

54
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.880
Kelley Briscar: So,

55
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.050
Magalie Marcellus: Then the extra money she gave. So how did that come about. Did you talk to her.

56
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.590
Magalie Marcellus: She just reach out to you. You texted

57
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.600
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, and I you know I know my mother. And so I pretty much for that. So if you would at least give me half of

58
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.980
Kelley Briscar: It.

59
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.140
Kelley Briscar: To know

60
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.210
Kelley Briscar: You know,

61
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.400
Kelley Briscar: Well, for one. Now, last then I got a text message fast and that's

62
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:29.460
Kelley Briscar: Not about money, but it's just amazing how when it was no higher amount. I wasn't getting any response at all. The moment I lowered it in half.

63
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.560
Kelley Briscar: And then all of a sudden

64
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.580
Kelley Briscar: She's finding my you

Kelley Briscar: And I wouldn't have been in this predicament.

68
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.870
Kelley Briscar: You know,

69
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.480
