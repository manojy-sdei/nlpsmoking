Dr Jameson: Have you looked, I mean, are there any Methadone clinics around now that their insurance or

409

LG Harmony 3: Insurance does not cover. Yeah.

410
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.970

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:18.870
LG Harmony 3: Of all

421
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.440
LG Harmony 3: It was

422
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.250

00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:07.800
LG Harmony 3: won't mess those first. I never. I mean, I never went back and forth. So I was at the clinic and then I started seeing the primary care physician, which was a pain doctor to help

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.510
Dr Jameson: Sounds like that's a

436
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:39.930
LG Harmony 3: And he knows me out in any name he wouldn't have any problem, you know, help me, but he's just, he's not he will fight you like

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:18.480
LG Harmony 3: Yes, ma'am.

626
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.550
Dr Jameson: What kind of work.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.570
Dr Jameson: Oh, OK.

629
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:28.350
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

630
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.730
Dr Jameson: It's a shame.

631
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.750
Dr Jameson: And then I did you say you're in a relationship. Now, or it's off again on again.

632
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:40.260
LG Harmony 3: Yeah, I was.

633
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.660
LG Harmony 3: Somewhat

634
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:44.610
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

635
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:47.220

LG Harmony 3: To be strong and be as

637
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.610
Dr Jameson: I say this again after in recovery or

638
00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.590
LG Harmony 3: Yeah, she's, she's

639
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.540
LG Harmony 3: Covering

640
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.230
Dr Jameson: Okay. And then, what's your support system like

641
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.240
Dr Jameson: Your brother.

642
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.110
LG Harmony 3: Well, I get my brother.

643
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.800
LG Harmony 3: He said years old and a

LG Harmony 3: doggone

645
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.560
Dr Jameson: Thing here by

646
00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:32.670
LG Harmony 3: Mean, he's an Oregon, which is like 27 miles away coast 30 miles away. But, but he still has to come to you see the hell name.

647
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:40.650
LG Harmony 3: Is overdue saying no groceries. I mean, as long as I have dogs.

648
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:43.650
LG Harmony 3: I can

649
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:48.450
LG Harmony 3: Okay.

650
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:50.880
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

651
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.360
Dr Jameson: You've got you've been on this Suboxone in Tennessee.

652
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:00.000
LG Harmony 3: I

653
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.470
LG Harmony 3: Mean some, some places.

654
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.190
Dr Jameson: Have universal stuff, I guess, right.

655
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.120
LG Harmony 3: Ma'am.

656
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.740
Dr Jameson: The Bonneville stuff.

657
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:09.240
LG Harmony 3: Okay.

658
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:21.000
Dr Jameson: So my concern is sometimes insurance has like that, you know, to a day is kind of the average dose and then some places, they don't seem to be too.

659
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:26.340
Dr Jameson: keen to prescribe to have people take more than that.

660
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:43.650
Dr Jameson: So I'll write for three a day. But often, that means we need to get like a special form filled out. But prior authorization. It's called. And sometimes they'll they just deny any more than two a day. I don't know if this has ever happened to you before. Do you know

661
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.140
LG Harmony 3: As well.

662
00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:48.840
LG Harmony 3: As

663
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:57.420
LG Harmony 3: Like in mail, you're probably rambled go see the doctor and

664
00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.750
LG Harmony 3: Everything. So the dishes.

665
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:09.540
Dr Jameson: Every day, at one point, is that what you're saying.

666
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.090
Dr Jameson: How did that go

667
00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:14.430
LG Harmony 3: I mean,

668
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.320
LG Harmony 3: When I was a kid, my

669
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.160
LG Harmony 3: Relationships and I ended up leaving Arkansas.

670
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.790
LG Harmony 3: What I'm sorry what I'm asking. It did you

671
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.540
Dr Jameson: Feel did. It did it. Keep your, your withdrawal symptoms.

672
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:35.610
LG Harmony 3: It did help definitely all day. That was after all these

673
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.000
LG Harmony 3: Views and like, like the oxy

674
00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.590
LG Harmony 3: Drinking much though. I mean, yeah.

675
00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:58.980
Dr Jameson: So, you know, as, as time goes on. The longer it's been since you've used opiates your, you know, your tolerance comes down. So sometimes you don't need as much Suboxone now you know at that point as you once did when you were first coming off of whatever heroin or

676
00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.310
LG Harmony 3: I mean I can be started off with G. But I mean,

677
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:03.390
LG Harmony 3: It's so

678
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:09.510
Dr Jameson: Yeah, let's let's try that. And then, did they explain to you. So do you have any questions about how the medicine works.

679
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:14.640
LG Harmony 3: Um, I just know that, you know, leaving under much on or until it dissolves.

680
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:18.300
Dr Jameson: And you know what it does, though, and you're in your body.

681
00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.630
LG Harmony 3: I got a pretty good idea

682
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:23.970
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

683
00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.500
LG Harmony 3: Read stuff about it.

684
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:30.090
Dr Jameson: Okay, I didn't make sure you you don't have any questions about that. Yes.

685
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:37.080
Dr Jameson: And then do they explain to you how are how our program works with the weekly groups and then

686
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:42.120
LG Harmony 3: Nine 9am or Wednesday. You don't mind my schedule.

687
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:46.380
Dr Jameson: Or you central or Eastern

688
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:50.130
Dr Jameson: Central okay it's 11am actually

689
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.720
LG Harmony 3: Okay, live are gonna

690
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:54.810
LG Harmony 3: Be okay. Yeah. That's better. Okay.

691
00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.480
Dr Jameson: So you don't want to get up so early.

692
00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.130
LG Harmony 3: Well,

693
00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:00.690
LG Harmony 3: Anyway,

694
00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:01.650
LG Harmony 3: Yeah.

695
00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.310
Dr Jameson: Well hopefully you'll be sleeping better once you're back on medication.

696
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:14.520
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'm going to send enough medicine to get you through through Wednesday.

697
00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:24.600
Dr Jameson: And then on Wednesday we have group again, I'll be there and I'll write you that we usually start out with a week at a time, but I just want to check on this dose and see if we see how we see how we

698
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:33.390
Dr Jameson: Got to do it enough to get to group and then it'll be a week. So between groups group to group I'm using the Kroger right

699
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.690
LG Harmony 3: Yes Man Kroger on Frasier Boulevard.

700
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.320
Okay.

701
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.510
Okay.

702
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:58.440
Dr Jameson: Now they get sometimes the farms and maybe it won't matter right now because of this pandemic and there's some lifting of some of the usual rules, but you know our company is headquartered in California, you maybe you know that maybe

703
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:09.030
Dr Jameson: So the prescription has a California address on it. And sometimes the pharmacists get upset about that and we have to call and explain how this all works.

704
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:25.590
Dr Jameson: So what I would suggest is after we hang up. I'm sending it right now. But after we're hang up. I would just give them a call. Make sure, first of all, they received a prescription for you occasionally things disappear and Internet. Internet land somewhere.

705
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:32.640
Dr Jameson: And then makes you know just ask any idea what time they they can

706
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:47.820
Dr Jameson: They can estimate what time it might be ready. And that's a good way to find out. Well, there's a forum. We need to get for the insurance or we have a question for the doctor or, you know, they may, if you get any sense that there's anything like that happening.

707
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:57.780
Dr Jameson: Give us a call. You can go back to the virtual clinic and just give them a heads up so we can try to either call them or watch for the form

708
00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.190
Dr Jameson: To get it filled out more you

709
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.630
LG Harmony 3: Should never any insurance. Insurance probably

710
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:08.070
Dr Jameson: Well, the insurance can sometimes require this prior off.

711
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:22.170
Dr Jameson: Right. And so, and I don't know until we try different insurance are different. But part of the reason why I wanted to start you on two days because it usually that's less problematic than the higher doses are with insurance.

712
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.100
Yeah.

713
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:31.080
Dr Jameson: So, but I cannot tell you what what your insurance will or won't say and I can't tell you what the pharmacist will or won't say and again

714
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:45.930
Dr Jameson: The one good if there has to be some anything good about this COPPA at 19 thing they're allowing telemedicine now. No, no questions asked. So that helps us not have to try to

715
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:52.200
Dr Jameson: Sweet talk the pharmacist as much as we sometimes have to before, so

716
00:55:53.520 --> 00:56:03.360
Dr Jameson: Hopefully, that won't that won't raise any eyebrows for them, it's still, it's still so new that there's quite a few places where the pharmacist.

717
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.760
Dr Jameson: You know, look at us funny.

718
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:19.290
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, so the the rules for group. I'm going to assign you to that Wednesday group at 11 but we'd like you to try to check in early. I think

719
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:30.120
Dr Jameson: Probably checked in early today, too. But it's even more important or either it's even more important when there's like seven or eight people all checking in at the same time that we get get

720
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:41.220
Dr Jameson: A head start. So if you can check in at 10 or even earlier. And then once you've got your code for the for the meeting. You can go do your own thing and then come back at actually at

721
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.210
LG Harmony 3: 11 same

722
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:47.490
Dr Jameson: Know it's different every week.

723
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.540
Dr Jameson: So yeah, so you have to check in, so that there are some

724
00:56:52.650 --> 00:57:07.710
Dr Jameson: There are some surveys that they send you by email that they double check to make sure you filled out and if you were do for your drug screen and hadn't done it, they would have you do a drug screen. So there's different you know they've sought to make sure every all your

725
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:12.720
Dr Jameson: Pieces are all your ducks are in a row, so to speak, you

726
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.520
Dr Jameson: Did they did you figure out what their plan for your labs.

727
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:22.350
LG Harmony 3: Man.

728
00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.950
Dr Jameson: Do you know where you're going to do them that they

729
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.050
Dr Jameson: Okay. Nobody said anything to you about doing blood work.

730
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:34.380
LG Harmony 3: And it won't work.

731
00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:37.410
Dr Jameson: Typically we do that. Yeah.

732
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:40.890
Dr Jameson: Let me see if there's an order in here.

733
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:49.080
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it looks like they sent an order to quest, you know if there's a quest labs nearby.

734
00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:56.820
LG Harmony 3: Oh, look it up, it seems that sounds familiar. I think we probably a few of them around.

735
00:57:57.450 --> 00:57:58.770
Dr Jameson: Yeah, we have to

736
00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:12.000
Dr Jameson: Make sure they have an order for you in their system, and also because of the weirdness of the world right now. Sometimes they're not just double check that they're letting people walk in there right now. They may not be doing things normal

737
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:24.540
Dr Jameson: So that once we have your event. So the general the general plan is that people get their blood work. They go to the lab within the first week get

738
00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:33.870
Dr Jameson: blood work and then a urine done and then after that we just do a monthly drug screen urine, which you can do at home because we mail you a cup.

739
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.290
Dr Jameson: Okay, though it's not too difficult.

740
00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:46.380
Dr Jameson: And then you're going to meet at will make an appointment. Not yet. But we'll make an appointment with a counselor to have a an initial

741
00:58:46.950 --> 00:59:03.570
Dr Jameson: Evaluation with one of our counselors and either you can either be meeting with a counselor with us, or you can leave meeting with a counselor nearby where you live, sometimes you know someone like you, who has kind of several levels here layers of things.

742
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:06.360
Dr Jameson: Not just the addiction, but also

743
00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:07.920
Dr Jameson: Mental illness.

744
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:09.840
Dr Jameson: It may be that you

745
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:11.580
LG Harmony 3: Guys go from

746
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:19.860
Dr Jameson: Sure, but it may be that you meet with more than one counselor, depending, you know, one, one that talks more about addiction and one that talks about, I don't know.

747
00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:27.960
Dr Jameson: But that's part of what the initial evaluation with the counselor will determine what the plan will be what the, what the recommendation is

748
00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:30.510
So then

749
00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:37.350
Dr Jameson: A couple little things about group on do you have headphones or earbuds or something.

750
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.580
Yeah.

751
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:41.640
LG Harmony 3: Well,

752
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.380
LG Harmony 3: Okay, we just

753
00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:50.280
Dr Jameson: We require those in the group because there's other for privacy, there's other people talking and we we don't want

754
00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:57.030
Dr Jameson: What somebody saying getting, you know, sent out to your roommates or whoever else might be in within earshot, so

755
00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:13.530
Dr Jameson: If you can just have your phones or headphones or something in place one year come in a group, that would be great. And we asked people not to smoke during group because some people are either quitting or have recently quit and we don't want to aggravate you make things uncomfortable.

756
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.880
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I sent the prescription for you.

757
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:27.480
Dr Jameson: You do need to be a group to get a refill. Okay, just to be very clear.

758
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:40.890
Dr Jameson: If you're unable to something comes up, you have an appointment or you're throwing up or something happens, just give us a call. Just know what's going on, ahead of time so we can plant make an alternate plans or

759
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.960
Dr Jameson: Just

760
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.540
Dr Jameson: Me, right, we need to hear ahead of time, as opposed to after the fact.

761
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.220
Dr Jameson: You okay

762
01:00:52.200 --> 01:01:06.870
Dr Jameson: And then attendance and you know getting labs done and doing drug screens all those things, you know, are sort of like expected as part of the deal here like, you know,

763
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.230
Dr Jameson: You got to do your part. And then we'll do our part.

764
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:26.760
Dr Jameson: Over time, when you're coming to group every week for a couple months, and you've done your visits and you're keeping up with everything. We'll start sending prescriptions for two weeks at a time. So you do get sort of graduate to to even as much as a month at a time. If things are really

765
01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:37.620
Dr Jameson: Nice and level so that that is that is the goal, but we need to make sure that we're, we're all on the same page at first.

766
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:43.200

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:10.530
LG Harmony 3: At one point, yeah.

772
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:21.090
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, and in this case it's kind of, you know, can be really on the spot because we can just like call you up to be like, Okay, let's see here. You don't have to, you don't

779
01:02:48.600 --> 01:03:00.510
LG Harmony 3: Mean I have a regular doctor and I mean I could see about getting into seeing a counselor at my regular doctor, too. So I guess I could just like not not worry about so

780
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.770
LG Harmony 3: You can clap my primary care.

781
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.090

Dr Jameson: OK. OK.

783
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:18.840
Dr Jameson: OK, I will probably request some records, just to kind of make sure you seem like you got

784
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:35.010
Dr Jameson: Your medicines and all that does is right on the tip of your tongue. I'm not necessarily to worry but just to make sure there isn't any important information that I didn't ask a question that you know something I would be helpful for me, you know, or vice versa. So

829
01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:08.730
LG Harmony 3: My mom. Maybe that's why she doesn't know just to have time with my son.

830
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:13.680
LG Harmony 3: And she will see me and that's my only possibility to

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.510
Dr Jameson: Okay, do you have any questions for me. I've asked you about a bazillion so

835
01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:31.110
LG Harmony 3: Oh, I guess you say you've already

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.130
LG Harmony 3: type stuff in, or whatever. Yeah.

837
01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.050
LG Harmony 3: Yeah.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.710
LG Harmony 3: Oh, right. Well thankfully insurance.

839
01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.090
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Well, usually they do. I know.

840
01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.730
Dr Jameson: I know that they

841
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:57.780
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, usually they cover. It's just, it's just an answer the question is more. Do they need make us for fill a form out first, or they just

842
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:00.090
Dr Jameson: Pay for it so

843
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:08.400
LG Harmony 3: Yeah, that, that, that they covered that. But

844
01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:10.620
LG Harmony 3: That stuff.

845
01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:14.790
LG Harmony 3: really nasty. I don't know what's a different

846
01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.380
LG Harmony 3: Combination of ingredients in there.

847
01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:26.370
Dr Jameson: Well, I think it's the same ingredients. It's just a different formulation. So yeah, things like taste and smell.

848
01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:29.190
Dr Jameson: That sort of thing are different, but

849
01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.010
LG Harmony 3: Like sale feeling go but

850
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:37.860
Dr Jameson: Ok, alright. So, we will see you on Wednesday and

851
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:44.550
Dr Jameson: Yeah check in around 10 the the way the group works. We have a counselor named Michelle.

852
01:08:44.880 --> 01:09:01.410
Dr Jameson: And she runs a group. I'll do like a quick check in with everyone as they as we when we first start to see who needs refills, and who, you know, that kind of thing. And still, usually I know we've been talking about quarantines and pandemics a lot lately here but

853
01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:10.680
Dr Jameson: We will usually there's some sort of topic about recovery skills or something.

854
01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.990
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and then

855
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:24.420
Dr Jameson: We go around the room. So you're invited to a quarter to contribute or participate if you're not really comfortable, especially in your first week.

856
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.540
Dr Jameson: That's okay, too. So you just say

857
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:28.710
Dr Jameson: You know,

858
01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:43.800
Dr Jameson: And then we usually I think she's tends to open with everybody going around saying something they're grateful for. I think my other cancer ends with bad. So that's the one time we probably would ask you to find something to say.

859
01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:48.930
Dr Jameson: But other than that, it's meant to be sort of a supportive

860
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:56.130
Dr Jameson: Connection, you know, to other people that are, you know,

861
01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:10.920
Dr Jameson: Struggling with similar issues sometimes there are similarities. Sometimes there are not but but the point is that everyone kind of just has an understanding on some level of of of one another and

862
01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:19.590
Dr Jameson: Hopefully it's a it's an uplifting, sort of, you know, experience. So that's the goal anyway.

863
01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:21.210
LG Harmony 3: Sounds good.

864
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:30.240
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we will see you on Wednesday. But be in touch at the virtual clinic. If there's any problems with pharmacy or

865
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:33.510
Dr Jameson: Have it in stock or something like that.

866
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:36.390
LG Harmony 3: I call me now.

867
01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:41.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I would just, just give them an apology to ask

868
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:45.630
Dr Jameson: Emily. How's it going,

869
01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:51.720
Dr Jameson: See, see how they see, what they say. Make sure they sound like everything's on on track.

870
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:53.520
Dr Jameson: OK. OK.

871
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.200
LG Harmony 3: So,

872
01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.300
LG Harmony 3: My next point was, you read this, I do meeting.

873
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:16.740
Dr Jameson: Or so I just I come to the group. So I usually we just see each other within the context of the group unless there's some other issue, but you have another doctor that does all your other meds. So it's usually it's not so much of an issue when

874
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:29.790
Dr Jameson: When you've already been on a medicine we kind of already know what your doses and you know how it works. And when someone is brand new. And we're just starting and having to like adjust the dose and all that. Sometimes we do more individual

875
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:32.640
LG Harmony 3: That make sense. Yeah.

876
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:37.530
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'll see you on Wednesday.

877
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:38.940
LG Harmony 3: Okay.

878
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.830
Dr Jameson: It was nice to meet you.

879
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:42.270

880
01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:46.290

Dr Jameson: Use starting back in high school.

908
01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:47.760

Dr Jameson: Patient has previously.

964
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:20.880
Dr Jameson: Benefited from him at and continues to have withdrawal symptoms which

965
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:29.040
Dr Jameson: Put him at high risk for relapse period. I think he's a good candidate for Suboxone

966
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:42.750
Dr Jameson: Given its safety profile. We will start with eight flash to two a day as it's been some time since he's use an opiate

967
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.640
Dr Jameson: For his report period.

969
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:16.710

973
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:45.870

974
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:55.890
Dr Jameson: He'll definitely benefit from counseling. I'm a little concerned about is
