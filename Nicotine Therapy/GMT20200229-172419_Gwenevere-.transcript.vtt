Psychosocial

2
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to open up a know for us and we'll get started. Um, but before I do, can I just kind of do just two minutes introduction. So at least you know who I am.

3
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.640
Sure.

4
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Seems reasonable, doesn't it.

5
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm here in Florida, and I have been a Licensed Marriage and family therapist for over 20 years I've had my license in New Mexico. I

6
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Your June will be three years I specifically to do the tele health with them for bright heart and

7
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Have been interested in substance use addiction chemical dependence sense get go. As soon as I was working with clients I was noticing it was either with directly in my client or there was addiction and substance use somewhere right there.

8
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: In the fam. Yeah, a lot of it and very curious about it. So basically, most of my career, whether it was doing felony drug court or whether it was being an EP or

9
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.880
Alicia Noedel: Working

10
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In a substance use treatment agency just just really have immerse myself in it. So although my formal training is marriage and family therapy.

11
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been working with substance use for the whole time.

12
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So really love it. And what else. Let's see. Oh.

13
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.690
Alicia Noedel: Really quickly, sorry.

14
00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The phone super cool technology, love, love, love it for things like what we just did, where I was like, Okay. Let's confirm tomorrow and you say yes or notice hi at a little opening at 830

15
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll throw that out there. Sometimes they'll say last minute opening, but I'll send it out to several people say, hey, if you get back to me right away asap or soon you might be able to catch an earlier appointment might be something that you would prefer

16
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.990
Alicia Noedel: And you can either

17
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Ignore it. Or you can say no, thank you. We'll stick with the one we have something like that. But what I don't do is I don't do therapy through texting.

18
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you guys are welcome to send me messages you can send me because I want you guys to feel like you're, you're not alone. Um,

19
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's one thing to be have this experience of suffering, in a sense, I feel sad, I feel angry, I feel afraid. I feel uncertain.

20
00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then to be able to text your therapist and say I'm going through something right now I'm starting I'm having my stinking thinking I'm thinking it using you send me this message, and I would write back when can you meet in zoom

21
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm going to want to be

22
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.030
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, that makes more sense than a text message. It's kind of hard to counsel someone through a text message.

23
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I've tried it and it is an epic failure. It's awful.

24
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.610
Paragraphs

25
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Words, literally, each one of the ones that you have come to know and love and use and defining your personal experience are different than mine. So I don't take a chance. Every little text can feel cold, it can

26
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't take that chance to important

27
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.870
Alicia Noedel: I really don't have the voice and the facial expressions mean a lot.

28
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, and it does

29
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.030
Alicia Noedel: Me no

30
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Body language.

31
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: No amount of emojis. It's going to cut it. So we've got

32
00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to get in here and be. So I just want you to know that you're welcome to say to me, I'm going through something. And I'll say, Oh, dear. When can we next meet and that's that's what I'll do. So I like to say that ahead of time so people aren't offended by that.

33
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.320
Alicia Noedel: Okay, okay.

34
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so we will be diving right in. As soon as I get a note. Let me tell you a little bit about what we're going to do, it's going to feel contrived, because this is a structured interview, but later on when you and I need on our next session. That's when

35
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.760
Alicia Noedel: We can slow

36
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Down.

37
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.950
No problem.

38
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So probably let me get in here, get a notice the first part of its going to be getting a history of opioid history. And then I'm going to jump into some other substances, then we'll get into

39
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Mental health will get into family history and I really wanted to find some goals that you want to work on. That's how I will end today. Okay, so I'll be moving very, very fast.

40
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is short answers later on when we meet, that's when I get these expansive stories and your history, but really it's just going to be. This is the date. This is how old I was. This is how much this is

41
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It was it was Fred. It was my uncle. Nope. It was short and then we'll move on to the next question.

42
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Otherwise, we'd be here for three hours. Otherwise, yeah won't work. Okay, so let me get open up and I'm going to be quiet for just a minute, cuz I gotta get this database to wake up.

43
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.810
Okay.

44
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you hear about us.

45
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.790
Alicia Noedel: I was trying to find some kind of

46
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:50.460
Alicia Noedel: On the phone you know way to get my medication, just because I have a newborn and it's hard for me to get to the doctor because my husband has the car. Most the time

47
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

48
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.230
That really makes sense. Absolutely.

49
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.740
Alright. So today we've got we're doing

50
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.160
Your time your time 1030

51
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll always 99.9% of the time talking your time. If ever sounds weird to say, hey, is that my time or your time, but I'll always speak or make an effort to say it in your time so you don't have to. You don't have to think about it. Okay.

52
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.060
Alicia Noedel: Are you both ahead or behind there.

53
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I am ahead. So it's 1234 here.

54
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.960
Alicia Noedel: Oh wow, that's

55
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.470
Alicia Noedel: Too bad.

56
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Well, what it means for me is when you got when when let's say you worked as a nurse or something and you're like, Oh, well, my shift starts at seven. I'm like, Okay, I'll meet you at five in the morning because to me it's seven in the morning. I don't care. I'm up. I don't care.

57
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You got an epic five but

58
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. For me, I can make it happen. So in other words, I can really carve it deep into the morning for people that have that that work schedule, but I can't go late. That's the challenge with

59
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.570
Alicia Noedel: Working with me.

60
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's dive right into it. Here we go. So the first piece is, were you already on buprenorphine through a doctor or were you getting it off the streets when you came in the door here.

61
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.330
Alicia Noedel: It was already on it through a doctor.

62
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How many years have you been seeing that doctor

63
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.330
Alicia Noedel: Only like a year and a few months.

64
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the name of the program.

65
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.910
Alicia Noedel: It was the la familia Medical Center just through their care.

66
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many milligrams. Were you on there and for how long.

67
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.790
Alicia Noedel: I was on two and a half. Eight. Eight milligram pills a day. Hold on.

68
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Two and a half. That's 20 milligrams. Correct.

69
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.270
Alicia Noedel: At 16. Yes, ma'am.

70
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you want now.

71
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.760
Alicia Noedel: To okay

72
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.750
Alicia Noedel: 16 sorry. Yeah.

73
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha. You're also going to hear me say some funny funny sounding stuff because I'm getting some help, which is fantastic.

74
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, is this transcription. So you're going to hear me say things

75
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Like please transcribe planted nice lifetime history of dub, dub, dub, remember. So that's what that is.

76
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So it makes it possible to really

77
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Get through a lot of information quickly. So I want you to think about now really focusing just on your opiate history.

78
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: buprenorphine is a long acting opiate and I distinguish it from all those other ones which are the short acting heroin is short acting oxy cotton shirt outtake Roxy set hydrocodone

79
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All of that heroin too short acting, which means it doesn't stay in your system very long. You don't have that euphoria. The analgesic effect doesn't last very long. Where's the buprenorphine can last on papers supposed to be 36 hours, but what you guys report is about 24

80
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so, um, long acting opiates, you're gonna hear me use that a lot long acting buprenorphine short acting the rest of the stuff

81
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When you first started using short acting opiates. Was it a broken ankle. How did it get started.

82
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.030
Alicia Noedel: Um, I was in an abusive relationship and

83
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How old were you

84
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.360
Alicia Noedel: I was

85
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.890
Alicia Noedel: I started when I was about 16 okay so

86
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Age 16

87
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.230
Alicia Noedel: Have you seen it.

88
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Was, was this a male

89
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. What's he giving it to you, forcing you to do it.

90
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:49.140
Alicia Noedel: We he was doing it and I you know when you're in a relationship with somebody that's doing a drug. It's kind of hard not to, especially when they're abusing you because you use it to cope

91
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What was, what, what drugs are we talking about right now.

92
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.690
Alicia Noedel: Heroin and

93
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.690
Alicia Noedel: prescription pills. I got it.

94
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you first used. Did you heroin first time or did you first snort on oxy or how did it first start

95
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:16.710
Alicia Noedel: Um, I never snorted anything. It was always I'm smoking heroin and and taking pills Orly okay

96
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.260
Alicia Noedel: I never use it intravenously or anything. Okay, so

97
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see the heroin as well. You never did it being use drug use. Got it. All right. And you were you snorted, the heroin, you were saying.

Gwenevere Abriel: And at its worst, how much heroin, were you doing at its worst, a day.

103
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.610
Alicia Noedel: I would say that if we had money.

104
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.310
Alicia Noedel: We would do probably

105
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.680
Alicia Noedel: All day

106
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: One more time. The real I got broken up. What happened, say, one more time.

107
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.570
Alicia Noedel: About 100 to $200 a day when we had money okay

108
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:29.220
Alicia Noedel: And then he would still his grandparents prescription pills. When we did it. And that's how we substituted that okay

109
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And at its worst, how much of the I

110
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what you were taking when it came to the prescription opiates.

Gwenevere Abriel: And now it's worse. How many milligrams a day.

115
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.690
Alicia Noedel: I'd say close to my worst

116
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.180
Alicia Noedel: Of 150 milligrams a day.

117
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.000

122
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So history of some nodding. Now, any intentional.

123
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.390
Overdose

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Denies lifetime history of intentional overdose.

125
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you will get into treatment labor. First, we're really going to zero in in the substance use history. Any intentional or accidental use of fentanyl

126
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.470
No.

127
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.840

133
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so at one time use teenager makes you

134
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.940

Alicia Noedel: And that was the last time I probably drank yet.

198
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And you drank to intoxication.

199
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.630

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:59.310
Alicia Noedel: I have probably about two or three times before in my life. In my young teenage years okay us in

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Last us teenager right

238
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.970
Alicia Noedel: Yes. Last year's team.

239
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That that PCP was the only time

240
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.920
Alicia Noedel: Yes. Okay. Alright.

241
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got one time use that was age 14

242
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Was unintended unexpected and a negative experience.

243
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I talked about everything.

244
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.540
Alicia Noedel: No. Have you

245
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, either. I didn't using any structure on this. I'm just going from my memory. I hope I covered it something comes up, you'd be like, Oh, we forgot to talk about, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

246
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.030
Alicia Noedel: And I'll be like,

247
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, whoops. Can't believe I forgot that. Okay, so let's talk about treatment history. Um, let's see if we can separate it can't be separated, that's okay too. I'll just adjust

248
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they are Corbin. So, substance use history treatment versus mental health treatment.

249
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been in residential which most people call rehab where I stay overnight for 30 days.

250
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Never clients denies residential treatment history. Any hospitalizations for substance use denies hospitalization history. What about intensive outpatient, that's where you sit with someone like me go to grow for like three hours a day, but you do get to sleep in your own bed.

251
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

252
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.410
Alicia Noedel: Okay, I've heard

253
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

254
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Denies intensive outpatient to

255
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What about outpatient, which means something like love Amelia maybe where you sit for an hour once a week. Individual therapy talk about underlying feelings beliefs and thoughts.

256
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.480
Alicia Noedel: Oh, I've probably seen like

257
00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:02.610
Alicia Noedel: Two three psychiatrists in my life one session for each of them. And it never progress from there.

258
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:03.390
Okay.

259
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:17.970
Alicia Noedel: And I felt like they didn't understand me. They weren't really listening to me. And you know, I don't, it's hard enough to open up about things when you just feel like, you know, yep.

260
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: very vulnerable and they're moving on to something else. Yeah, I hear you. I and that may, you may end up having that feeling in here and I wish I could protect you from that this is a questionnaire. I've got to ask everybody and I'm so

261
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.010
Alicia Noedel: You're extremely sweet and you showing that you care.

262
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.520
Alicia Noedel: So that

263
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't seen anything yet, girl. You're going to feel cared for in here believe

264
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the work we're going to do, because I'm hearing. It's really on the surface and you're starting to almost relive it in here. So we'll be real careful with those feelings. All right.

265
00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So many psychiatrists, not a good fit. So really haven't had a chance to to to address the substance use, nor the common history so

266
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so really this is your first treatment.

267
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotcha.

268
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So did those psychiatrists, we're going to move into the that section, we're now into formerly what's called the psychiatric history.

269
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And, um, they're just labels, all they are is point of departure.

270
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: They're just a label. And that's where we depart. It's just a way to for professionals to communicate with each other. But that's not who we are. All right. There's just a clustering of symptoms.

271
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When your psychiatrists didn't meet with you. Did they ever say, Boy, you, you really meet criteria for depression for like you mentioned ADHD or for an anxiety disorder. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder eating disorder skittle affective disorder, bipolar.

272
00:26:50.460 --> 00:27:03.150
Alicia Noedel: A anxiety and PTSD. I have not officially diagnosed, but I'm, you know, I'm sure that will probably change that pretty soon. Okay. I gotcha. Okay, sure.

273
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, here's some history and I've got a really, really great questionnaire that zeroes right in on how present those symptoms are is really good questions like,

274
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:23.820

Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we go and so

279
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.180
Alicia Noedel: Does that also mean

280
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have not had any psychiatric medication. So the psychiatry. Was there enough where they actually gave you a medicine and you try it, you're like, man.

281
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.350
Alicia Noedel: Never no

282
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No, never.

283
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:19.230
Alicia Noedel: Okay. I mean, I know that I have something, you know, like anxiety PTSD, but I don't feel like I need

284
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:31.320
Alicia Noedel: A medication to fix it. I feel like I cope. Okay. But, you know, maybe, maybe I'm wrong, because sometimes I do get really like, Okay, uh, but yeah.

285
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try a new skills that all teach you. Okay. You'll, you'll learn those skills. They work right away.

286

Gwenevere Abriel: And there with you forever. And you don't have to go to a pharmacy forum and we can teach them to our children to these are things that are wonderful for just our regular daily living. And they're great.

287
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of in that self healing to and there's stuff that hey, be kind of cool. Everybody knew these things. Okay.

288
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.630
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it will learn them.

289
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I want everyone to have those right away. So those that'll be our focus is getting those in place people see a change immediately with that.

290
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Let's go back in here. Just make sure I'm not missing anything when it comes to psychiatric what else they got we will nothing in here for the treatment will go down.

291
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. I do need to get pretty clear history in here when you so think your whole lifetime that includes being when you were younger. Was there ever any suicidal ideation.

292
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.200
Alicia Noedel: Yes.

293
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How old are you,

294
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.800
Alicia Noedel: 13

295
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and did it get beyond

296
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking, sometimes we get to planning, we get to intent. I want to die. And we actually take action on it.

297
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:56.880
Alicia Noedel: I would cut myself but not like in a place where it would be fatal.

298
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this so I pulled these two things apart and you tell me if they need to be.

299
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.570
Alicia Noedel: Self harm and suicide attempts are okay.

300
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.680
Yeah.

301
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.620
Alicia Noedel: What do you think ever tried to kill myself.

302
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I would cut myself. Now, where were you cutting

303
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.440
Alicia Noedel: Like on the eyes.

304
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Okay. On guys. Yep. And they were superficial or do they ever need stitches.

305
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.520
Alicia Noedel: Never needed stitches. Stitches okay

306
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And that started at age 13. Was there a period of time without was like more frequent

307
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.310
Alicia Noedel: Like 13 to 1513 to

308
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: 16

309
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:50.670
Alicia Noedel: I only ever did it then because I went through something that made me really suicidal. So I got that one time. Okay. Just that one time that one year, I would say I did it a few times that one year here.

310
00:30:51.990 --> 00:31:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you. Alright, so now let's go back to so client is denying recent current self injurious behavior. So there's no recent burning cutting

311
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Self injurious behavior.

312
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And most recently, people have been identifying that they're tattooing counts for them that they almost do that. Think about it, right, because it's painful, so it fee. It's like they're kind of getting away with it in a socially acceptable way. So, but they're endorsing it

313
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:25.680
Alicia Noedel: Hmm.

314
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.020
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I have a lot of tattoos and I've had

315
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.340
Alicia Noedel: Quite a few piercings. So, I mean, it makes sense.

316
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't it. Yeah.

317
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I didn't come up with that my clients on an interview, just like this, or like, you know what I do.

318
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:44.640
Alicia Noedel: I feel better when I get tattoos. It makes me feel like I'm getting a release.

319
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that something

320
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.100
Alicia Noedel: It's strange.

321
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it

322
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:48.870
Alicia Noedel: I never thought about it.

323
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I know my clients taught me that, too.

324
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So that might be going on something for us to just take a peek at

325
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. All right, let's go back to that other question.

326
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to just we pulled aside the, the self injury and now we're just going to look at the member I said the intent, this really something different with, I don't want to live anymore.

327
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's different than I need relief from this psychic pain. So, was there ever a time we literally did not want to live and you took action to take your own life.

328
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.380
Alicia Noedel: never took action. No, but I have had suicidal thoughts before

329
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And about how often in your life have you had those thoughts.

330
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.060
Alicia Noedel: Oh god.

331
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:40.560
Alicia Noedel: at different ages several times probably once at probably a young age like 789

332
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.630
Alicia Noedel: Again, as a teenager, probably about four times.

333
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:56.760
Alicia Noedel: But I haven't had any of those thoughts since I was probably like 1717 was the last time when my father died. That was the last time I felt that way.

334
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.050
Alicia Noedel: Last time when father died and that was age 17 yes

335
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And you remembering back 789 and i and i hear you. So that was present their clients denying lifetime. You got to correct me if this isn't true client tonight's lifetime history of suicidal plan.

336
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Intent inaction. So yeah, okay, I got you. And what was the most recent timing was it like last week, anything or no just 17 was most recent

337
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.420
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. When my dad passed away.

338
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, last was at 17 thank you for that. And now, same kind of questions except homicidal

340
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

341
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the back your way okay so clients and eyes lifetime homicidal ideation intent plan and action.

342
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.370
That's all medication stuff, which we can skip, skip

343
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:14.160

Gwenevere Abriel: DON'T KEEP IT UP HERE TIGHT, we want to get that air down in the bottom of the long. Take a nice deep breath and just sort of look around.

347
00:34:55.890 --> 00:35:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And realize you're actually not in danger. Right now, right.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And where you grounded as discipline hit with a belt with a fist slapped are

529
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.590

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.270
Alicia Noedel: Granny spanked thank

531
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.910
Alicia Noedel: God, they would have ground me every now and again, but it was more like it wouldn't last like

532
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.990
Alicia Noedel: Because I was too hyper

533
00:51:53.220 --> 00:52:00.660
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, they were just be like, All right, well just go watch TV, nevermind. You know, because I was very like restless.

534
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And would you will you ever physically abused.

535
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.710
Alicia Noedel: I separate

536
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, sexually molested from just physical abuse who ever hit and sort of where it left an injury will say yes on that was that.

537
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there any when you were little. Do you know if you are touched in appropriately by anyone.

538
00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:23.550
Alicia Noedel: Yes, that was okay.

539
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So there is that piece. And we've got any neglect where you are left alone to fend for yourself, way, way, way, way, way too early.

540
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:36.750
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

541
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.340
Okay, yeah.

542
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the molestation, was it family member, friend partner stranger. Probably not partner, obviously, but

543
00:52:53.730 --> 00:53:04.110
Alicia Noedel: It was a stranger, but it was because of a family friend. Okay, I think I get that makes any sense. So when I was babysitting me

544
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: babysit having people come

545
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.730
Alicia Noedel: Over and then they would give her money.

546
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:18.300
Alicia Noedel: Okay, let's do some breathing. She never physically touched me, but she

547
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know yeah I got it. So this is the time to do the breathing. Right. And if you have something next to you like a little pillow or something.

548
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to grab that and just feel the changing texture temperature just sort of feel it just pay attention to the tactile experience just to get back in the body. So we're not overwhelmed with the emotion. Okay.

549
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we've got that now. Oftentimes people that experience that violation and they're survivors when they were little. They also experience sexual surviving traumatic events as an adult, they have raped experience and things is that part of your history, too.

550
00:53:58.530 --> 00:53:59.670
Alicia Noedel: Yes. Okay.

551
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's pretty common, and was that from a partner, you were dating or a stranger or family member.

552
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.640
Alicia Noedel: Is from that blackout. It was, um,

553
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:13.140

627
01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:53.010

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:04.710
Alicia Noedel: Of zero to 10 okay

631
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Zero to 10 okay we are done with the formal part and you did great.

632
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: A really important piece of this is that we

633
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Identify goals that you have

634
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.490
Alicia Noedel: Now,

635
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to change as you change and you grow and you start to sort of unfold the things that excites you, maybe it'll be school or maybe it'll be

636
01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you, you know, eat, or maybe it'll be asleep thing or it will be an activity, whatever it is. There's we can talk about and work on whatever you want to

637
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But first, let's talk about the substance use just that as sort of this

638
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: big goal to to work on. When you think about something you want to do more of or something you want to do less of when you

639
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hold in your mind, your substance use, what's your goal.

640
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.990
Alicia Noedel: So you're very good back to where I was.

641
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:08.130
Alicia Noedel: In a minute when I call you can you bring the baby because I want to show

642
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.300
Okay.

643
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's a beautiful goal you just stated the challenge for me as someone who will need to measure that is I won't be able to know what that was. And I won't be able to

644
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What is let's keep refining it, I want to what

645
01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.360
Alicia Noedel: I'm I don't ever want to do heroin again.

646
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you're not doing heroin right now.

647
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:39.960
Alicia Noedel: Okay, what

648
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to do.

649
01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:49.170
Alicia Noedel: I want to be able to cope with my trauma and

650
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:51.180
Alicia Noedel: Future.

651
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.000
Alicia Noedel: Problems better

652
01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Better. Yeah, there we go. Now we got one. So I want to be able to cope with my trauma. That's the past and my future.

653
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You said problems better. So I'm assuming we're talking about. I want to gain some coping skills and I'd like to maybe be able to use those skills, instead of reaching for substance to cope

654
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:18.600
Alicia Noedel: Right. Okay. Absolutely.

655
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we got some really good goals in here.

656
01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. See if we can. I want to be able to cope with trauma and future problems better. So we'll put that in quotes, please and and that we will I'll probably do a roll out for now have

657
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A post traumatic stress disorder. We'll just do a real loud. At this point, and I'll look into it further later.

658
01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

659
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And look what you did. You did all of that in an hour. That's amazing.

660
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.780
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. Not too bad.

661
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That was outstanding. Typically I have to call people like with another 10 minutes like well what are your hobbies. And if you ever been arrested.

662
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.420
Right.

663
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's really

664
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a difficult assessment because there's not a lot of time to get into why it's this way.

665
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:08.460
Alicia Noedel: And

666
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, yes, it's this, but it's also this right because rarely are things just one thing or

667
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:14.580
Complex.

668
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk about on the next time we're going to meet and it's going to be so different. It's going to be a nice and slow.

669
01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:30.120
Alicia Noedel: Hey, bring on a saucy on here, you bring the baby.

670
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I always thought if I had a baby girl. I would, I would name her to Lula

671
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.600
Alicia Noedel: That's a pretty name that name before

672
01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Or right

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:46.200

683
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.330

684
01:06:45.720 --> 01:07:04.440

686
01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Together and you'll decide your progress. Well, do I have enough coping skills. Maybe I need some more. Let's keep talking.

687
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're going to need to sort of develop trust with me, we're going to get into to skill building, but there's also this big trauma work that I will want to do with you.

688
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not going to get into that until you're prepared, which means developing those skills. First, whether it's imagery, whether it's the somatic soma is the body sort of preparing

689
01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And making sure that you're ready.

690
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's going to be a very important

691
01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:47.730
Alicia Noedel: Thing wrapped up with the sorry I'm listening to you. Sorry.

694
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.850
Alicia Noedel: So I understand. Okay, good.

695
01:07:54.300 --> 01:08:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will go at your pace. I know this is new for you. The psychotherapy in general is pretty new. I, I am someone who can hear things like

696
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scared I'm nervous. I'm not ready I'm angry. What did you mean, what's that mean. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm not going to get upset with you.

697
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a really important thing for clients to understand because a lot of times our trauma was interpersonal and our healing.

698
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Needs to be in her personal and so if you are worried about, well, what were one of your think how will she react well she really traumatized me, but she led me down hurt me.

699
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: yell at me criticize me those kinds of things. You may not be feeling safe enough to stretch and go into the sort of scary places in your mind right

700
01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just want you to know I don't get upset with

701
01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: People, you may end up feeling like I am, but i'm i'm not intentionally going to criticize. I'm not intentionally going to try and let you down. I'll probably do it by accident because I'm human, I might. I might accidentally say something, but I want you to know. You can tell me

702
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say, Boy, I was pissed at you have group you you do. Did the double bubble. I'll say okay well let's talk about it.

703
01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is a really unique kind of relationship. Most people don't get these they you know they they got a tiptoe around and they people, please. And they protect the other person so conflict doesn't happen, but in here. You get to just be you in any shape, form you want. Okay.

704
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's pick a time that we're going to meet next week okay um

705
01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how

706
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I I don't tend to see people in the latter part of the day because I have these other sort of commitments that I'm obligated myself to

707
01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do see people in the early morning and in the first part of today. What's the earliest time that we could get away with this. I know you have a baby. So I've got to kind of be mindful of that. But how early, could we get away with it.

708
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:20.850
Alicia Noedel: She's up you know she has me up early, so I'm, I'm pretty sure you know I could probably do like at earliest 830

709
01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:31.170
Alicia Noedel: Because she goes back to sleep around five or six. So like, it gives me a little bit of time to rest before she wakes back up at like eight

710
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: At night. Okay, so she's a good little sleeper.

711
01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:43.260
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, she she yeah she has like little periods, but like she sleep from, like, six to eight o'clock in the morning and then she's like

712
01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh I see, I see. I see, I see. Okay, so you want to get your, your sleeping right there. I see. I know we got to really protect sleep because when she's sleeping mommy needs asleep.

713
01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:54.030
Yeah.

714
01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Otherwise, you'll never get any

715
01:10:56.790 --> 01:11:00.360
Alicia Noedel: Oh, I'm exhausted. I have like a pound of concealer on right now.

716
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see, we've got looking at ideal is 830

717
01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's probably the progression of our scheduling will go. I'm really booked up right now, which means we'll have to kind of like kind of

718
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.350
Alicia Noedel: filtering through

719
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, work through the next couple weeks. But then I'll carve out a really great spot for us. And then I'll protect it and we'll talk each week, we'll try to get that same sort of timing.

720
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:34.560
Alicia Noedel: All right, well, I'm very flexible. Okay, so whenever is good for you is probably good for me. Unless, I say otherwise, pretty much.

721
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, it's taking me so long. It's

722
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.040
Alicia Noedel: You're fine, no problem.

723
01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll tell you what I'm going to do two things. Number one, we're going to pick a time

724
01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's probably going to be in the afternoon. But then I'd like to put you on I'm experimenting with it this month to see if it works. It worked last week fairly well I've been creating an odd call list, which means in here. There's no drive time so on call looks like this.

725
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: About 10 minutes after the top of the hour because all my appointments, although you wouldn't know that because it's a hell and a half hour that on Saturday. But anyway, they're always on the hour. It's always nine o'clock 10 O'clock 11 o'clock.

726
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I would message you on a text. And I'd say, Oh, real quick. If you're free. Do you want to have the individual therapy right now if the baby happens to be with mom or it's like the planets align and you can actually create an hour to meet with me.

727
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we would meet if you're like oh my gosh now getting my my literally the dentist is in my mouth.

728
01:12:59.490 --> 01:12:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

729
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel like now I don't take it personally. It's all I'm doing that with other people too. I'm sending it out really quick just to see if anybody wants to

730
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Fill that appointment because someone may be was hospitalized or something happened and no one's there I earn my living by meeting with people face to face because I'm, I'm an independent contractor. So I very much need to have my hours filled

731
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to put you on an on call list. But I also want to pick a time that no matter what we're going to need if we can't sort of squeeze you in the morning hour

732
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, how would you feel about meeting on a Wednesday.

733
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: At one

734
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: March 4 at 1pm

Alicia Noedel: On. Yeah, no, that's the time that my

737
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:57.660
Alicia Noedel: My baby starts getting ready to go to work, but I can like, that's when he's like, I'm about to leave so that that can probably work.

738
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll only probably be this one time.

739
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.710
Alicia Noedel: That's fine. And then

740
01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:15.450

776
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might come into the room and you'll see it kind of like, oh wait for host waiting for host waiting for host it might be five minutes after but I can actually see your name in in this little waiting area. It's pretty cool. And I might

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I might text and say be right there. Or you might text me and say, I'm here, but I can see you there because it makes this little thing and you're there, but sometimes

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to. I need to kind of gently close out of session.

781
01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:00.240
Alicia Noedel: I completely understand

782
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not intentional, you think, how can you not be on time you're in your own home, but

783
01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be because I'm really being careful with someone's feelings. Okay. Mm hmm. So I do apologize in advance for that, but I'm not bad. I'm at the most typically two minutes late. Three minutes late. That's my typical is just those couple last minutes

784
01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:23.550
Alicia Noedel: Okay. All right.

785
01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.590

789
01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But otherwise we'll be able to really slow down and see see kind of where we're going to get started here next time.

790
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.270
Alicia Noedel: I'm not very sensitive, so I don't take things the wrong way very often.
