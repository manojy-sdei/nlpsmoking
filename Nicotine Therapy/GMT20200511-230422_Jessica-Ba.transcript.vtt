00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:24.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. Okay. And so help me to recall, do you are you a resident of New Mexico. How often do you go to Mexico.

20
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.600
Ryan Morrow: About once a week on the weekends.

21
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, you pick up your medication from the Mexico.

22

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.110
Ryan Morrow: I just work here in Texas.

24
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.010
Ryan Morrow: I have been apart. I have an apartment here.

26
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.130
Ryan Morrow: And then I stay at my mom's house and close

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.730
Okay.

28
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I'm just doing. I just want to make sure I can verify where patients are located. When I do a session.

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So have you been what's been going on with you.

30
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.590
Ryan Morrow: Well,

31
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.580
Ryan Morrow: I guess the same as last week.

32
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.880
Ryan Morrow: I am still laid off from work, so

33
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.400
Ryan Morrow: It's kind of waiting for

34
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:18.330
Ryan Morrow: Everything to open back up so I can start going to the gym and I still haven't heard anything about when I'm going to be able to go back to work.

35
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:32.370
Ryan Morrow: And so I've just been trying to stay busy doing other, I don't know, run errands doing things that I need to do in between.

36
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.770
Ryan Morrow: But mostly just staying home, to be honest.

37
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.890
Ryan Morrow: I try to find excuses to go to Walmart and go shopping and get out of the house.

38
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.320
Ryan Morrow: Yeah. So yeah.

39
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.760
Ryan Morrow: But I think next Monday the gyms are opening back up so

40
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, how did it turn out if

41
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The woman that you were speaking to. And where was challenges with the communication.

42
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.250
Ryan Morrow: Um, well, we talked about a week later, and

43
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.370
Ryan Morrow: I, you know, I apologize. And she apologized and

44
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.830
Ryan Morrow: We're, we're cool. So

45
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.930
Ryan Morrow: So, yeah.

46
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any recent conversations tuitions that you want to process during the session.

47
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.730
Ryan Morrow: Um,

48
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.940
Ryan Morrow: Well, yesterday was Mother's Day. And I got to see my mom through video

49
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.270
Ryan Morrow: It's called duo

50
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.840
Ryan Morrow: It's an app. And so I saw my mom and my sisters, they were all and me and my sisters, got my mom a necklace and some flowers.

51
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.100
Ryan Morrow: For Mother's Day so I wasn't able to, I didn't go home, but I did spend some time with them on video so

52
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.070
Ryan Morrow: So,

53
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.850
I know, yeah.

54
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.220
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I didn't want to go home because my step dad and my brother in law are still kind of mad at me.

55
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.770
Ryan Morrow: And so I didn't want to cause any problems. So I just stayed away.

56
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what are the, the ending terms that they're still upset about.

57
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.910
Ryan Morrow: Just the fact that I was doing drugs again and and hurting my mom and my sisters and

58
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.800
Ryan Morrow: I guess line. I don't know. They're just they still have

59
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.020
Ryan Morrow: They're just still upset with me so

60
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.660
Ryan Morrow: They're not. They're not very forgiving kind of people

61
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.710
Ryan Morrow: I don't know if they believe in grace or not.

62
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is your mom's

63
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Her husband, but

64
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.730
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, my sister's husband.

65
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:26.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like they're like kind of taken on the role and like your stance is interesting that the relationship most valuable to us their spouses don't don't want to speak with you have any interaction with you.

66
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:37.470
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, yeah, they will they've seen me do a lot of damage to my sisters and my mom. So I really can you really can be mad at them.

67
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.830
Ryan Morrow: Or I really can't.

68
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.140
Ryan Morrow: Logically, like think that they should be happy with me and be happy for me right now.

69
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.360
Ryan Morrow: Because I have a, I have a long history of

70
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.490
Ryan Morrow: This

71
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.200
Ryan Morrow: So it's going to take a while.

72
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.120
Ryan Morrow: It's going to take a while to rebuild the those trust you know getting Silver's just the

73
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.400
Ryan Morrow: The first part.

74
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:22.590
Ryan Morrow: staying sober and, you know, you know, your family, I get tired of hearing you say you're going to do at this time. They want to see action and I hear words.

75
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.920
Ryan Morrow: So,

76
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.100
Ryan Morrow: I just have to, you know, look at from their point of view.

77
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.770
Ryan Morrow: And be understanding

78
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.800
Ryan Morrow: So,

79
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.430
Ryan Morrow: You know i doing when you're on drugs. That's not really the problem.

80
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

81
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.970
Ryan Morrow: You know, that's just the cover up

82
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.670
Ryan Morrow: So when you so when you get sober. You know, you got to deal with whatever you got to figure out what made you

83
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.410
Ryan Morrow: You know, start doing drugs again or start doing drugs, period.

84
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're happy found out in that in that reflection.

85
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:20.370
Ryan Morrow: Um, I mean, I guess the only thing that I can figure would be the maybe I have a lot of shame and guilt for not being a father to my kids.

86
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.370
Ryan Morrow: And

87
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:37.710
Ryan Morrow: My dad was really hard on me growing up and he always spoke a lot of negativity into me. And I think that that had a huge effect on you know

88
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:48.390
Ryan Morrow: The outcome of my confidence and my security and me loving myself and accepting who I was as a person.

89
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: shame and guilt associated with things. Please pass

90
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:06.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then, and then the parallels of your father and how disciplined you so was

91
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:13.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That abuse aspect, but then the shame that you dealt with it more. So a neglect.

92
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With your children and not being present.

93
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.340
Ryan Morrow: Right.

94
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.310
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

95
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.530
Ryan Morrow: So,

96
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:33.030
Ryan Morrow: There's a lot of things that happened when I was younger I had my kids, when I was like 1415

97
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.720
Ryan Morrow: They are they are biracial

98
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.540
Ryan Morrow: And so

99
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.570
Ryan Morrow: I'm mean, my family's not prejudiced. But I think the fact that I was 14 and 15

100
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.960
Ryan Morrow: That didn't really help me but

101
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.290
Ryan Morrow: My mom and dad, his mom especially my step mom and my dad.

102
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.380
Ryan Morrow: They, they had my daughter move to club as and help her get into nursing school and stuff so

103
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.990
Ryan Morrow: I don't think it was really a racial issue. I just think it was the age and

104
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.490
Ryan Morrow: The circumstances.

105
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:13.860
Ryan Morrow: So,

106
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.360
Ryan Morrow: My daughter is absolutely beautiful.

107
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:25.230
Ryan Morrow: My son, they're both really good kids and their mom pretty much raised them.

108
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.230
Ryan Morrow: By herself, because they moved away.

109
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.150
Ryan Morrow: After

110
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.580
Ryan Morrow: She had her second kid.

111
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.970
Ryan Morrow: And so I didn't really get to be a father to my kids.

112
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.120
Ryan Morrow: So now our relationship is more of like a friendship relationship.

113
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.540
Ryan Morrow: I don't really try to be a father figure so much because I don't feel like I deserved that.

114
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.520
Ryan Morrow: Position.

115
00:09:52.590 --> 00:10:01.590
Ryan Morrow: But they both love me and they both call me dad and they don't really have any grudges. They understand, you know, the circumstances.

116
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have

117
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any

118
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the mom.

119
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He didn't hear you.

120
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:27.330
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I mean, a little bit. I've talked to her on the phone, a couple times in the past couple of years, and I mean we get along, like she has sympathy for me because she knows that I've had problems with drugs and stuff.

121
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.670
Ryan Morrow: And so she hasn't really she filed for calls for like 10 years ago.

122
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:43.890
Ryan Morrow: And so I owe a lot of back child support, but she doesn't really like she could really like she could have my license suspended, you know, she could really pressed to have

123
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.370
Ryan Morrow: You know things done to me the would be she'd having put in jail probably

124
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:58.020
Ryan Morrow: But she doesn't really press the issue. She gets my income tax return. She got my stimulus check

125
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.280
Ryan Morrow: I pay as much as I can. When I can

126
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.440
Ryan Morrow: If they're not garnish my wages.

127
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.910
So,

128
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.050
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, it's kind of a, it's kind of a

129
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.530
Ryan Morrow: Mess up deal all around.

130
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.330
Ryan Morrow: One side of me. I don't think that she needs it because they're both over 18

131
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's what I was wondering.

132
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What those last loss. I'm shocked that you're still going to leave it.

133
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:35.550
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, well, okay, so since I wasn't a, you know, I didn't help raise them.

134
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:50.700
Ryan Morrow: I guess she was able to file even and I don't even think she was on welfare, but I think he went to the child support division and was able to file for back child support payments, just because I'm the father and because

135
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.760
Ryan Morrow: I didn't help raise them. And so I have like $70,000 in back child support.

136
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.200
Ryan Morrow: So anytime the IRS sends me money. It goes to her.

137
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:14.370
Ryan Morrow: And so I mean it. One side of me kind of it kind of pisses me off that she's, she's still does that because she knows that my life's been kind of rough

138
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.030
Ryan Morrow: And she really doesn't need the money and I'm pretty sure that when she gets the money she doesn't give us a guy or Jocelyn.

139
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.180
Ryan Morrow: I'm pretty sure she keeps it for herself.

140
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:31.020
Ryan Morrow: And so I it kind of upsets me that she still is pursuing

141
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:38.130
Ryan Morrow: And she wants told me a couple of years ago that she was going to drop it after I started being in their lives more

142
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:58.500
Ryan Morrow: And then she changed her mind after she got divorced, because she said she needed the money. So she went back on her word. And so now it's like, I understand. She raised them and she probably does deserve. But it's 400 a month. And it's like,

143
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Asian or

144
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.080
Ryan Morrow: combine both

145
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.640
Ryan Morrow: For both of them.

146
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

147
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Red pain restitution then child support.

148
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

149
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.670
Ryan Morrow: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

150
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:32.280
Ryan Morrow: So long. I mean, my license is suspended. I don't have any benchmarks out for it. So I guess she's okay with you know whatever she gets once you can get it.

151
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is

152
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:50.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The balance of kind of reaping the consequences of, you know, the past things that you've done.

153
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And finding

154
00:13:52.020 --> 00:14:00.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Finding avenues to have forgiveness and understanding. So the situations are that with

155
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:08.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your children's mother, and then also with the spouses for your mom and sisters

156
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.330
Yeah.

157
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.640
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

158
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which parts of you feel as though I'm

159
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If any that

160
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't need to understand

161
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.500
Ryan Morrow: Which part so me feel like I don't need to understand

162
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, when it comes to

163
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The relationship.

164
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The stepfather.

165
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The brother in law and then it's working.

166
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.330
Ryan Morrow: Well, I mean,

167
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.950
Ryan Morrow: I can't. I have no control over how people

168
00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:57.060
Ryan Morrow: Their perception of me or their outlook of me no matter

169
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.700
Ryan Morrow: How good I do or how bad I do

170
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.950
Ryan Morrow: You know i i can't control.

171
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.250
Ryan Morrow: What they're thinking or feeling

172
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:13.620
Ryan Morrow: I guess all I can do. From this point is, do the right thing and let them know

173
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:32.760
Ryan Morrow: The side if they want to forgive me and accept me or you know just totally like cut me off and look at me as the black sheep of the family and not really, you know, it's something that I don't really have control over. Yeah.

174
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.820
Ryan Morrow: I mean, I don't think they want an apology from me.

175
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.720
Ryan Morrow: I don't think that, you know. Apologies are kind of bullshit.

176
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.150
Ryan Morrow: At the end of the day.

177
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:50.940
Ryan Morrow: Or the everyone. Nobody wants to nobody wants to hear. I'm sorry. People want to see like your, your actions.

178
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:59.100
Ryan Morrow: If you're really sorry for something, then you know you change your, your ways and your behaviors.

179
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.590
Ryan Morrow: And and then everything follows

180
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.370
Ryan Morrow: So if I

181
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.540
Understanding

182
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.150
Ryan Morrow: Do what

183
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When did you come to this understanding of, you know, what

184
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm that I'm not in control of their actions and just

185
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.870
Focus on these

186
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something that you just

187
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: wake up one morning and figure out

188
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:39.930
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I mean I think pretty logically and so I don't really expect people to be like, Okay. Ryan sober. Now, so, you know, you know, let's

189
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.970
Ryan Morrow: Go all in and and be his know be his friend again or or whatever.

190
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.260
Ryan Morrow: Have a relationship with them or be nice to them or

191
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.700
Ryan Morrow: Accept him or

192
00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:18.060
Ryan Morrow: And so I've, I've always had that outlook where. Look, I know that I did wrong and that because my dad's always told me, you know, words are just words, your actions are what. And so I've never really expected them to have been forget about what I did and just forgive me, and move on.

193
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:20.970
Ryan Morrow: So,

194
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So because you're a

195
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Logic logical person I can imagine, have you come up with different

196
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.280
Ryan Morrow: Steps

197
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To get to kind of like what your ultimate goal is

198
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:42.600
Ryan Morrow: Um, well, I think the more I get my life together. The longer I stay sober, the more responsibility I show

199
00:17:44.460 --> 00:18:03.990
Ryan Morrow: Them, the more maturity and responsibility that they'll start seeing that. And after three or four or five years of sobriety and doing the right thing. I think that, you know, they might have a different outlook and be like, oh Ryan's really changed this time.

200
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what has worked this time around for you.

201
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this isn't your first rodeo.

202
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.050
Ryan Morrow: I'm just staying in contact

203
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.980
Ryan Morrow: With the people that I'm close to

204
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.660
Ryan Morrow: taking advice from people and

205
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.000
Ryan Morrow: Actually making an effort and honest effort to

206
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:39.510
Ryan Morrow: Follow up on my sobriety like like going through the steps in the motions, not just

207
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:53.610
Ryan Morrow: Thinking about it or do or, you know, writing it down on a piece of paper. But actually, like, you know john doing my meetings like I'm supposed to

208
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.600
Ryan Morrow: taking my medication. The way I'm supposed to

209
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.590
Ryan Morrow: I'm just stuff like that.

210
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This time around, don't

211
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Feel as though you're going through the motions, what has been

212
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What has been helpful for you in group individual study

213
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Meaning this program.

214
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:40.590
Ryan Morrow: I said, I think I just finally came to a place in my heart, my mind where I was tired, I'm done being sick and tired like i i'm done hurting my mom. I don't want to have to go back to rehab anymore. I just, I'm done with it all. It's not worth it.

215
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:50.910
Ryan Morrow: And so this time I'm, I'm really trying to stay stay on top of my sobriety.

216
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:58.170
Ryan Morrow: Instead of putting work in the gym and my social life in front of it.

217
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the internal work that

218
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:10.020
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, because you know if you keep doing the same thing over and over again, nothing will ever change.

219
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.540
Ryan Morrow: So,

220
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm doing the work.

221
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:24.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What triggers. Have you identified that have led to your relapse in the past mentioned

222
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The trauma.

223
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anything else emotion associated with

224
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.590
Ryan Morrow: Um, I don't know, anytime life starts to fall apart.

225
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.580
Ryan Morrow: I started so self.

226
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.700
Ryan Morrow: You know, being negative

227
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:55.680
Ryan Morrow: And speaking death over myself. I guess like life's never going to change. I'm always going to be the same.

228
00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:02.370
Ryan Morrow: And and then eventually it leads to, you know, forget it. I'm just gonna

229
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.980
Ryan Morrow: Just going to finish, you know, and go back to what I do best.

230
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:25.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that always never is the defense mechanism we all have different irrational thought processes that sort of assumption for us. Well, we're in a matter of conflict.

231
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:39.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For disappointment. And so what I heard you say is like a lot of people, the black and white thinking serves you in those moments. So I'm actually going to share a video that

232
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:52.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For other patients that depicts what black or white thinking looks like and to help teach a lot of that self sabotage spirals, that when things go wrong, you kind of gravitate towards

233
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:53.970
Okay.

234
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.100
Ryan Morrow: That sounds cool.

235
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.520
Ryan Morrow: When I realized for my 34

236
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:33.540
Ryan Morrow: I went to sleep with gum in my mouth. And now there's gum in my hair. And when I got out of bed this morning I tripped on escape wasn't by mistake. I dropped my sweater in the sink, while the water was running

237
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:40.050
Ryan Morrow: And I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible mill. Good. Very bad day.

238
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:49.860
Ryan Morrow: Everything is Alexander and the terrible, horrible middle good very bad day. Well, it's a perfect example of black and white thinking

239
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:11.280
Ryan Morrow: So what is black and white thinking black and white thinking is a pattern of thought characterized by thinking in the extremes. Everything is always the worst day ever. For

240
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:18.600
Ryan Morrow: The very best day ever. You know, we think of things in their absolute. It's a polarized way of thinking.

241
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:28.470
Ryan Morrow: And it messes us up because it makes our emotions, more extreme than they need to the black and white thinking is also known as all or nothing thinking

242
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:38.250
Ryan Morrow: It interferes with our ability to have healthy emotions and relationships signs that you might be using black and white thinking is, if you use words like always, never

243
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:45.930
Ryan Morrow: Terrible ruined furious or you try to make things out to be worse than they were like, I mean, you might have actually had a bad day.

244
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:56.820
Ryan Morrow: But it was the worst day ever. Or, so things might have gone wrong. And you might say nothing when. Right, right. So we're taking something and we're making it out to be.

245
00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:06.750
Ryan Morrow: More exaggerated than it already was now why does black and white thinking mess us up. Well, the way we think affects our emotions.

246
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:18.840
Ryan Morrow: And if we're thinking in an exaggerated manner then our emotions are going to swing rapidly from one extreme to the other people with anxiety or depression tends to think in extremes.

247
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:27.270
Ryan Morrow: And we can combat anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses by having more realistic honest or moderate thinking patterns.

248
00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:38.820
Ryan Morrow: Black and white thinking makes the problem worse than it already was black and white thinking creates helplessness. If my husband is a complete jerk the biggest jerk in the whole world.

249
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:45.570
Ryan Morrow: Then makes no sense for me to try and change myself or improve myself because nothing is ever going to work.

250
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:53.730
Ryan Morrow: See that black and white thinking in there and how that's going to contribute to problems in my relationships. Another reason black and white thinking messes us up is

251
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.740
Ryan Morrow: It invites defensiveness, and others. So if you say to someone, you never do the dishes.

252
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:07.560
Ryan Morrow: They're going to feel attacked, because that's not quite true. You're exaggerating how bad they are sure they might miss doing the dishes and they might have forgotten to do the dishes and they might have

253
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:19.170
Ryan Morrow: Intentionally not done the dishes that day or multiple days, but to say never exaggerates how bad they are puts people on the defensive and it just invites arguing and debating.

254
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:28.980
Ryan Morrow: And fighting the more extreme of statement, the more likely the other person is to feel attacked if black and white thinking is so awful than. Why do we do it now. I

255
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:36.840
Ryan Morrow: Need something that everything we do serve some kind of function right even if it's dysfunctional in the long run we do it for some sort of reason.

256
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:48.030
Ryan Morrow: And black and white thinking does serve a function. It just doesn't work very well. So black and white thinking helps us feel like we're the victim of our circumstances.

257
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:54.420
Ryan Morrow: Which is kind of comforting. Right. Isn't it nice to think, well, poor me you know everything's out to get me.

258
00:25:54.810 --> 00:26:01.950
Ryan Morrow: And black and white thinking excuses us from having to do the difficult work of taking action and changing ourselves so if

259
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:12.210
Ryan Morrow: My job is the worst job ever or my boss is the meanest guy ever excuses us in our mind from having to take responsibility for our part of the problem.

260
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:21.720
Ryan Morrow: And working hard to fix it black and white thinking helps protect us from feeling guilty or accountable for our own actions, and this might feel more comfortable.

261
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:31.260
Ryan Morrow: But in the long run, creates more problems, black and white thinking also protects us from feeling vulnerable. So if we're thinking in extremes, like everything is awful.

262
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.060
Ryan Morrow: Then we have more excuse to just kind of hide in bed, you know, pull the covers over our head and

263
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:46.710
Ryan Morrow: And you know wallow instead of actually experiencing those tender feelings that we might be having like hurt or sadness. Perhaps we're feeling guilty or

264
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:56.760
Ryan Morrow: You know, uncertain about the future black and white thinking is also very simple. It gets rid of the complex nuanced reality that we have to face every day.

265
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:05.910
Ryan Morrow: And it gets it gets rid of that complexity that we experience when we're interacting with another person because every human being is a combination of good and bad.

266
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:17.280
Ryan Morrow: But if we just glue you know label them as being completely bad, then we don't have to manage a lot of that complexity that's involved in in relationships.

267
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:24.720
Ryan Morrow: Now while these are some of the functions of black and white thinking and it does you know work in the short term to relieve us of a little bit of that.

268
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:34.830
Ryan Morrow: discomfort in the long run. It's going to make us pretty unhappy if we consistently use this pattern of thinking in our lives, the more extreme our thinking.

269
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:43.620
Ryan Morrow: The more likely we are to be depressed. So saying things like, I'm a terrible person or wow she has it all together. She is such a saint.

270
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:50.610
Ryan Morrow: Or no one's going to ever like me. No one wants to be my friend. These are simplistic statements.

271
00:27:50.820 --> 00:28:02.280
Ryan Morrow: That feed those negative emotions and create that feeling of helplessness, that is associated with depression. The reality wife is there is no perfect job perfect marriage, no perfect person.

272
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.710
Ryan Morrow: And by telling ourselves that someone is either perfect or awful.

273
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:16.710
Ryan Morrow: We're creating more problems for ourselves than they need to be, if we want to improve our emotional control. We need to challenge our black and white thinking

274
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:22.290
Ryan Morrow: So how do we fix it if we catch yourself engaging in some of these thinking patterns. What do we do about it.

275
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:35.250
Ryan Morrow: Well, number one, start to notice the signs of all or nothing thinking so look out for words like we talked about always never any type of exaggeration, what I like to call horrible ization

276
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:47.190
Ryan Morrow: Or trying to make someone else out to be perfect number to challenge your thoughts. Just because you're thinking, it doesn't mean it's really true. So look for a more truthful and more moderate

277
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:59.490
Ryan Morrow: Way of thinking about each situation or person so that takes us right to number three which is we need to replace those thoughts with a more moderate view of the situation. So back to the dishes situation.

278
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:08.010
Ryan Morrow: Instead of saying you never do the dishes you big jerk say something like, okay, it bothers me when you don't do the dishes.

279
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:14.280
Ryan Morrow: And I know that I also miss my chores. Sometimes, how can we work together to solve this

280
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:24.570
Ryan Morrow: Number for an essential part of resolving black and white thinking means we have to increase our capacity to experience ambiguity think we need to increase our tolerance.

281
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:35.820
Ryan Morrow: Of complex situations, our ability to hold on to a little bit of discomfort, while we while we wrestle with a situation or a problem. Remember, life is beautiful.

282
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:48.570
Ryan Morrow: Difficult complicated joyful painful. In order for us to be able to fully live and and appreciate and enjoy life. We need to embrace all the complexity that is involved with it.

283
00:29:49.080 --> 00:30:06.300
Ryan Morrow: If we want to get healthier. It's not about just feeling better. It's about getting better at feeling so consider a couple of these questions. Can someone love you and still be insensitive. Sometimes, can you be basically intelligent and still do something dumb.

284
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:16.230
Can experience be really hard, but still be beautiful, in some way, remember one of the main reasons people get depressed is because of how they perceive reality.

285
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:24.300
When we change the way we look at things, the things we look at change when we're able to be more flexible and intentional in how we think.

286
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:33.450
That depression is going to be more likely to lift and will start to get feeling better, depression, often centers on one incessant thought

287
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:38.910
Like no one likes me when we replace those negative thoughts with healthy thinking

288
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:47.730
Then the depression has nothing to feed on changing the way we think is really quite difficult. We might not even notice that we're doing it. So try to reach out for some help.

289
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.860
Ask others for their perspective on how you talk about yourself, or how you talk about situations.

290
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:59.790
Watch yourself for signs of this negative in black and white thinking or work with someone like a mental health professional.

291
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:09.240
To change the way you think, by reducing or eliminating black and white thinking we can live much healthier lives. So I hope this was helpful. Thanks for watching, and take care

292
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.540
Ryan Morrow: That was interesting.

293
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.570
Ryan Morrow: And

294
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.780
Ryan Morrow: I can, I can relate to that.

295
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.400
Ryan Morrow: In a lot of different ways.

296
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.330
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, when when life gets a little difficult. I see the

297
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.700
Ryan Morrow: The

298
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.730
Ryan Morrow: The worst in it.

299
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:42.750
Ryan Morrow: And

300
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:49.200
Ryan Morrow: You know, always knowing that there's a blessing. At the end of of hard times and hardship.

301
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:50.820
Yeah.

302
00:31:52.080 --> 00:32:03.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the emotional treasure. I heard you identify was like disappointed when things aren't working well and I get disappointed you know the emotional trigger issues I despise

303
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so before regulations.

304
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:13.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, things don't work well and you said the word the negative than positive

305
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is the

306
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:27.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Pandemic I have seen some things. A DIFFERENCE RIGHT. IT SAYS, I'M IN THE BAT initial impression when we met, and you were a container really in despair, but everything that was going on.

307
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:35.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then there's a shift. So it's almost like I got a visual of what wine looks like the matte black or white.

308
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But then the next session, there was a shift.

309
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From curious to know what changed what help you to get out of that mindset.

310
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:56.490
Ryan Morrow: Well, trying, I'm trying to learn to love myself again and

311
00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:08.670
Ryan Morrow: I know that there's light at the end of the tunnel. I've been through this before and I've made it through it before and I've and I've had a lot of good things happening.

312
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:18.720
Ryan Morrow: So I know that it's not the end of the world. And as long as I keep doing the right thing and making you know good choices to get things are going to happen.

313
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.190
Ryan Morrow: So I just started

314
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:31.620
Ryan Morrow: talking to myself, you know, positively and being optimistic about the future.

315
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:42.660
Ryan Morrow: And not thinking that my life's over I'll never be able to be successful. No lie says what it is, it's always going to be this way.

316
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.250
Ryan Morrow: You know,

317
00:33:46.920 --> 00:34:00.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For catching that that that language. You know when you find yourself. All right. If the point is a trigger for like if I start using always or never. I realize now that it's now not

318
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: emotional trigger

319
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:03.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I am adapting to

320
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My rational thought patterns.

321
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of all or nothing.

322
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:13.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And from there, and her history repeating itself up at the relapse kicks it

323
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:26.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so talking with this thing and also identifying the thought of really capturing if I use the word always by use the word never, I need to challenge and spot right away.

324
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:36.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, put that thought on trial. If you have those situations where you say, Well, things never work out for me, you know, you could use the scenario with the pandemic.

325
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:44.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: While we were down my love for you to know what was happening. And then within about two weeks, turn around, you have purchasing a vehicle.

326
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:55.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you can use those examples, I know it's doesn't always happen to me, he said, I do always it's always a light at the tunnel. I always find a way for it to work out.

327
00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's something that you can apply whenever you notice those

328
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: patterns within itself.

329
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.090
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I've always been pretty good at getting myself.

330
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.990
Ryan Morrow: Situations.

331
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Slow resourceful part

332
00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:22.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Comes in handy. Are there any family members that also have that we've been a black or white.

333
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.620
Ryan Morrow: Now my family there. They're pretty stable. I mean, they're

334
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.170
Ryan Morrow: very down to earth and they think very logically and

335
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:42.630
Ryan Morrow: They're just they're just great people. I mean, they're very loving, caring and understanding

336
00:35:44.820 --> 00:36:06.270
Ryan Morrow: And so, you know, whenever I was using, you know, they had to cut me off and and kind of show me tough love so that I would, you know, know that they weren't going to accept me as a drug addicts and that I'd had to get help. And in order for me to have a relationship with them.

337
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.420
Ryan Morrow: So,

338
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That worked well for you, having guns strict boundaries.

339
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In place by your family's work well please do yourself in force found to be

340
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With others.

341
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.540
Ryan Morrow: To do one

342
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:33.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yourself because I'm encouraged that your family having their boundaries in place.

343
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is helpful for you to keep you in line with the change that you want to see.

344
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.660
Ryan Morrow: Oh, yeah.

345
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:48.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are, you know, are you able to execute boundaries or create boundaries within your own personal relationships.

346
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.780
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I mean, if

347
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.040
Ryan Morrow: I'm if I'm in a bad situation.

348
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.950
Ryan Morrow: Where I say I show up to a dinner day and

349
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:14.910
Ryan Morrow: Our I meet a girl, you know, on a day she tells me that she does drugs or he's drinking excessively then I separate myself.

350
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.220
Ryan Morrow: That's just one example. But I try to stay away from

351
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:32.280
Ryan Morrow: I'm pretty aware of my surroundings and I know when I'm in a good or bad situation. And if I sense that I'm in danger of, you know,

352
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:45.330
Ryan Morrow: Self Harm where I could be vulnerable to, you know, do something that I shouldn't do. And I'm pretty good at, like, you know, getting out of that situation.

353
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.540
Ryan Morrow: So,

354
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you highlighted your strengths and capabilities and

355
00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:05.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know your relapse prevention. What areas do you need assistance with you have challenges. So I can work with you to kind of support.

356
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.910
Ryan Morrow: I don't know. That's a good question.

357
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.220
Ryan Morrow: I'm not really sure.

358
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:27.270
Ryan Morrow: I know like going back to Clovis is kind of a trigger for me because I know like

359
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:29.670
Ryan Morrow: Where, where to go and

360
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.270
Ryan Morrow: You know you're, you know, spiritually, I believe it's a spiritual battle.

361
00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.340
Ryan Morrow: And

362
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:45.300
Ryan Morrow: Like I think going to clovers sometimes makes me vulnerable to make a bad choice.

363
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.630
Ryan Morrow: And so

364
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.550
Ryan Morrow: I'm kind of optimistic about going back on often

365
00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:05.700
Ryan Morrow: Because I don't know if you know I don't really have someone with me to keep me accountable. It's easy for me to sneak off and go do something if I want to do it.

366
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.690
Ryan Morrow: So,

367
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.520
Ryan Morrow: I, I have to come to a place

368
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:20.520
Ryan Morrow: Where, you know, if somebody puts my drug of choice in front of me.

369
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.900
Ryan Morrow: I gotta come to a place where I can walk away from it.

370
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.670
Ryan Morrow: And right now I don't know if I'm strong enough to do that.

371
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Acknowledgement is the best thing that you can do for yourself.

372
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:51.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thinking that you have that strong willpower and control is almost naive, so it's good. Honestly, it's not a weakness, not a vulnerability. It's actually a strength and she can identify

373
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:57.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That, yes, and the more control when I'm away from the way from

374
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Actual location of why knows

375
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How to actually

376
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.520
Yeah.

377
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:23.070
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, like being here, loving, I don't know where to get it so it never crosses my mind like um you know today. Sounds like a good it would be good to get high and just, you know, forget about everything and you know escape, where if I were in Clovis, and I was having a bad day.

378
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.920
Ryan Morrow: It would be a lot easier for me to say.

379
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.320
Ryan Morrow: I could just go get high, you know,

380
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:31.260
Ryan Morrow: And so

381
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:42.360
Ryan Morrow: I got it you know get myself strong enough, mentally, spiritually physically to where I can say no, no matter what the circumstances are

382
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:49.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That may look like you know making

383
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:59.550
Ryan Morrow: Oh yeah I don't plan on going back to Clovis unless it's just for a daily visit

384
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.620
Ryan Morrow: Anytime in the near future. There's no opportunity there for me.

385
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.990
Ryan Morrow: So that's not really even an option in my mind.

386
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:22.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So resources and just creating a location and chat right there is relaxed, because you're reducing your

387
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:22.530
Job.

388
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:34.470
Ryan Morrow: Right, I'm just thankful. I'm not an alcoholic because alcohol is every corner store every restaurant. It would be so easy to relapse.

389
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I

390
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:41.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Met with a patient that you know alcohol is unless you

391
00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:53.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know it's because of legal, you can go to the restaurant, you can drink and it's socially as that's why watch shows like alcohol is everywhere you know

392
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, but if you go to the rest of my you

393
00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just start shooting up heroin. That's not socially acceptable.

394
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:07.650
Ryan Morrow: rials and the crazy thing is is alcohol is deadlier than arrow and

395
00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:14.520
Ryan Morrow: If you look at the statistics. Yeah. And the withdrawals, or worse.

396
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.970
Yeah.

397
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.480
Ryan Morrow: So I'm you know

398
00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:31.050
Ryan Morrow: I'm not saying the heroines any better than alcohol, but it's just crazy to me that alcohol is legal and even cigarettes and they kill way more people than some of these other drugs, too.

399
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:40.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But yeah, and being aware of that to that not identify other drugs.

400
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As a response to the point, isn't it.

401
00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:44.340
Right.

402
00:42:45.870 --> 00:43:05.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So looking at mobile things which I call a red flag box that kind of give you another side of things that feel to the land so that you can say, well, it's not too bad. And then from there you spot the negotiating phase and then negotiating a fast when the adjustment range of pixels.

403
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:13.230
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, and you met yourself you can be very vulnerable. Whenever you get inside your head and you start rationalizing

404
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:14.700
Ryan Morrow: Like

405
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:26.040
Ryan Morrow: Oh, you know, I could go get high today and you know be okay and just not not do it anymore. Yeah. You know, like your brain, your mind is your own worst enemy. A lot of the times.

406
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:33.750
Ryan Morrow: So I think it's really important to stay busy, you know, doing positive things throughout the day.

407
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:38.430
Ryan Morrow: To where your mind can never wander off into that negative place.

408
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:45.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It sounds like you got a good hold of, you know, everything that you need to do.

409
00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.080
To stay on the right.

410
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In our meeting to really to identify

411
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:58.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That I think that you need assistance with, you know, continue to strengthen the genesis already working well for you for the

412
00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: School, some of the underlying things that you may not have identified that was actually a

413
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:03.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Trigger

414
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.100
So there's no recognizes

415
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:09.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's see.

416
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Next week, Monday, I already have all my clients getting my group.

417
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I open to do on a bi weekly schedule with that.

418
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And bi weekly. I'm going to be optimal one

419
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.420
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, just. When's your next available.

420
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.130
Ryan Morrow: It doesn't have to be Monday, it can be Tuesday, but

421
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.310
Ryan Morrow: Monday works pretty good or

422
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.720
Ryan Morrow: I like to keep it a day away a day, apart from my meeting on Wednesday, if possible.

423
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.420
Ryan Morrow: Like Friday or Monday.

424
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I can do Monday the 18th

425
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And set up at five.

426
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.900
I should do that for

427
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.380
Ryan Morrow: That's for her mountain

428
00:44:58.830 --> 00:44:59.400
Yes.

429
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Does that work for you.

430
