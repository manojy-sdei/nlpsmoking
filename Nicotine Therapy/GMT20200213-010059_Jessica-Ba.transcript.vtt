00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.120
Misty Moncada: Yes, yes. So I'm really happy about that. Like, I'm happy, I'm I think it's cool.

30
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, how are you, how, how have your interpersonal relationships like interactions with other people.

49
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:40.980
Misty Moncada: What some of the best qualities I did I put I wrote in my journal right here. Um, I put like my best qualities like I like to see organize. I'm very encouraging and positive I'm nice to others.

50
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:54.630
Misty Moncada: I like to clean iron read books. I try to be positive for others. I'm a leader, not a follower and I'm just Claudia. I've been praising God lately on the church and

51
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.360
Misty Moncada: My joys are my kids, my grandkids. My mother, my church.

52
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.280
Misty Moncada: Books good movies good friends positivity and encouragement getting great joy.

53
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So as you continue to keep busy.

54
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.300
Misty Moncada: And

55
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Avoid the boredom.

56
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This week I've been talking about interpersonal relationships with patient. So we're going to share

57
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.590
Misty Moncada: A discussion.

58
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The interpersonal relationships.

59
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is identifying those relationships that are nurturing to you.

60
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.020
Misty Moncada: versus the ones that are

61
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Depleting and typically, you know, which relationships are nurturing because you feel it, you feel good net present easy to talk to. You feel like you feel understood and you fill up

62
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The one fest depleted.

63
00:07:52.170 --> 00:08:06.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You sometimes question. He said the wrong thing you're doing the wrong thing and you feel more comfortable. So I'm going to share my screen so that we can watch a video but also I want to share some skill that

64
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:25.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: helpful in identifying those healthy relationships. So, and identifying the healthy relationships, you want to increase your exposure to those relationships, but the one fest depleting typically in a normal situation, I would say, okay, reduce your exposure to those environments.

65
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:32.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But for some people, those depleting relationships are actually relationships, that's hard to get out of

66
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:46.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For some people it's the spouse. It's their children if their current dynamic would be in a caretaker, it may be their employer. So you have those relationships that may not be nourishing to you.

67
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Finding ways to negotiate that company.

68
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Developing boundaries.

69
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.380
Misty Moncada: Yeah.

70
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.960
Misty Moncada: So like for me. I'm I just been having more of a relationship with

71
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:14.400
Misty Moncada: My like I don't go anywhere anymore except to celebrate like I go like, you know, I go to Celebrate Recovery to church and

72
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:25.470
Misty Moncada: I went to, to celebrate recoveries and well last week I to a new one on Thursday, and I went to another one on Monday night, and then I had appointment like therapy.

73
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:40.590
Misty Moncada: And stuff like that. Like other than that, I don't go anywhere else. I don't hang around anyone I met a stage right now where I just want to be around my family and my grandchildren, like so that the thing for me right now is just

74
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.880
Misty Moncada: Like rebuilding a healthy relationship with them. Yes.

75
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.610
Misty Moncada: Definitely makes

76
00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:02.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Also smart when you're in the beginning stages of really making sure that you're committed to your recovery and just being in those familial relationships.

77
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.670
Misty Moncada: That

78
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We know

79
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make you feel comfortable that no, they're not going to be a distraction or

80
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.980
Misty Moncada: Yes.

81
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.820
Misty Moncada: My name is flashing Goldstein, I'm creator of a course and mindful living

82
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:48.360
Misty Moncada: And today I'm going to give you three simple ways to strengthen relationships. Okay, so the first way and maybe the most obvious one. Be kind.

83
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:55.230
Misty Moncada: One more kind to others, it sends the signal to them that they're cared about their there's a sense of

84
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:10.200
Misty Moncada: Understood sense of being safe and when this happens, there's a greater sense of connection that occurs and connection is the epicenter of us feeling well them feeling well and then we can imagine the emotional contagion, and the ripple effects taking place. Okay, number two.

85
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:18.540
Misty Moncada: We want to take an inventory of our relationships. Take a get a sense of who's nourishing to you. Who's depleting to you.

86
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:24.720
Misty Moncada: See if you can spend more time with the nourishing people make more connect strengthening the bonds with a nurse.

87
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:33.060
Misty Moncada: A little less time of the depleting people, but let me just say this. If someone's depleting and you can't spend less time with them family members co workers, that kind of thing.

88
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:49.320
See if you can change your relationship to them a little bit. In other words, play with and this might sound strange play with recognizing that there may be some instability with them as well. And if you send them some kind intentions, meaning maybe happy maybe healthy may feel safe.

89
00:11:50.910 --> 00:12:01.650
Misty Moncada: Maybe balanced. See how that feels internally to relax your shoulders and sending that out. The third thing practice just like me plenty of people around us that we feel different from

90
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:09.360
Misty Moncada: DNA. Research shows that no matter your gender, ethnicity, or anything like that. We're 99.9% the same

91
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:18.240
Misty Moncada: And so see if when there's people around you that you feel disconnected from because you feel that they're different from you. See if you can just say, internally, just like me, just like me.

92
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:27.780
Misty Moncada: Just like me and then see what you notice this can happen, enhancing the fact of feeling connected. Okay, so those three things. The first thing the kind

93
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:39.630
Misty Moncada: The second thing, identify nourishing and depleting relationships and more time of the nourishing less time with the depleting or changing your relationship to the depleting relationships in your life. Third thing.

94
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:50.880
Practicing just like me with people that you feel disconnected from are different from. Okay, that's it. Practice this play with it. See what you notice be curious and we'll see you again.

95
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What were your thoughts on the video.

96
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:15.000
Misty Moncada: And I like it because you know that's what I've been trying to do is just practice like you know I'm doing a pretty good job. I also noticed like

97
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:23.790
Misty Moncada: Now my sobriety, like I'm trying, I'm doing my best to with my relationships with everyone. But I noticed I'm getting irritable lately.

98
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:38.610
Misty Moncada: So I explained that to my therapist on Monday, and she thinks, maybe they need to up my dose of medications, but like, now that I'm sober. A lot of things are like irritating me yeah they

99
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:50.670
Misty Moncada: That's another thing I'm trying to cope with and not and be a little bit more understanding with people. I'm not be so awful towards anybody you know are jumping at anyone

100
00:13:51.420 --> 00:14:01.560
Misty Moncada: Like, that's what I'm working on my relationships, like, you know, not just me. So like if they say something. I'm just like, cuz I noticed I just been getting irritable and out like that. Yeah.

101
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, but I'm trying to tell me about that.

102
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.130
Misty Moncada: Was it what was going on. Um,

103
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:27.720
Misty Moncada: Um, I just out of nowhere, because I was diagnosed with bipolar. Mm hmm. So like, um, I take circle and like for me. I can't like I'm trying to get, get my mood stabilizers were like, I'm not just really angry, not just really sad.

104
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.900
Misty Moncada: So I don't know, just

105
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:39.960
Misty Moncada: Just trying to like work on things because I'm feeling so many emotions right now and everything. So like for me.

106
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:55.710
Misty Moncada: It's kind of a little bit, a little bit overwhelming in my head because I, I mean, I'm starting to think too much and feel too much, but I'm on anxiety meds and I'm on meds for my bipolar disorder, but I don't know just

107
00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:06.120
Misty Moncada: I don't know. That's the only thing that stresses me out about relationship wise like rebuilding relationships. I don't want to be rude to people are hateful. Yeah.

108
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:12.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So some of these takeaways were being unkind and the connection and I can get that will be challenging.

109
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:29.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you're frustrated irritable and I want to address something else that is something I initially thought when we first met, having all of this going on and multiple, multiple check ins and checkpoints, I'm

110
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:29.940
Misty Moncada: Like

111
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is this beneficial coming to me for individual when you have group, you have a therapist that you're seeing

112
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.750
You have Celebrate Recovery.

113
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And something else that you mentioned.

114
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.500
Misty Moncada: I'm on. Okay, I have. I see my therapist and mental health every other week.

115
00:15:50.370 --> 00:16:01.860
Misty Moncada: I have to have group every Tuesday with mental health for three months. Then for with your program. I see you. Every, every other week. And then I have group every Friday.

116
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:09.570
Misty Moncada: And then I've Celebrate Recovery every Monday night, and then there's a new one. I'm starting to go to on Thursday nights.

117
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:19.200
Misty Moncada: I just barely went last week for the first time and I liked it. So those are all things I want to do. I had been job searching, but um

118
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:36.450
Misty Moncada: It's kind of hard because I have my grandson right now and I really can't afford like childcare like there's so many things I have to balance and right right now it's i don't think i think if I get a job. I've tried relapse, because I've got so much on my plate right now and

119
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:46.200
Misty Moncada: I couldn't deal with that. Like, I probably freak out, or I just not ready to overwhelm myself with that right now so I'm

120
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:59.940
Misty Moncada: I'm okay with everything that's going on like I'm okay. I don't. I feel like a bit overwhelmed, not by all my groups and stuff. But when I get home. I understand my mom, you know, she can

121
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:09.300
Misty Moncada: It can be testy at times here but you know that's what overwhelms me because I feel like I'm caring for my mother. I'm caring for my grandson.

122
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:24.720
Misty Moncada: And then I my 20 year old sons here, but he takes care of itself. Like you know he does everything is self, he cooks the self and everything, but it's just like, by the end of the day, I'm just blah but i i wouldn't change anything, to be honest.

123
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:33.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But that's a good way to check in. And the reason why X is because I didn't want you to have the wrong impression of what's

124
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Required. So yes, the

125
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.750
Misty Moncada: Group is every yeah

126
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:43.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To seeing me is an added bonus, you know, but because you're seeing your therapist.

127
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:43.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Already

128
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:52.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I would be okay if you want to meet once a month, if you didn't want to keep the vibe. But I'm also open

129
00:17:52.440 --> 00:18:01.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It official let's keep the bi weekly but I just wanted to share that information, because I don't want you to be under the impression that this is a requirement.

130
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:03.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because

131
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:14.100
Misty Moncada: I like okay I like being. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I like like I liked your group. I think that you have good things that I could benefit from

132
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:21.570
Misty Moncada: And I like my therapy mental health because I feel like I could benefit from her so like I don't get overwhelmed when I see you, or her

133
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, great, great. Just wanted to check in with that.

134
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's, that's good.

135
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, and, you know,

136
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It makes sense.

137
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:32.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Why you would be

138
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.930
Misty Moncada: Irritable because you're

139
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:39.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Caring for so many people right and it went back to what we're talking about what the nurturing versus depleted.

140
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So every time. Some that hat.

141
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As CARETAKER FOR YOUR MOM. YOU KNOW CARETAKER FOR YOUR GRANDSON

142
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:47.940
Misty Moncada: Yes.

143
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:57.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All these things while they're fulfilling and love your mommy love your grandchild. It's still putting out energy out of you still responsibilities.

144
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:05.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when those things and you don't have any relationship or anything that kind of pores back into you.

145
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You do feel blah.

146
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And this

147
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is a perfect example. That's exactly what you said about the end of the day, I'm

148
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like if I

149
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Had a sound that's probably what it would

150
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sound like

151
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:31.590
Misty Moncada: You know, it's funny, like it but I guess, you be careful what you ask for. Because like I i was like for me. I was like,

152
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:43.080
Misty Moncada: At first, I'm like, I'm so bored, like this is idle time. I don't have nothing to do. So then it's like, boom, all these things start coming. And I'm like, I like I would sit there and say, I wish I had something to do

153
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really cool.

154
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.830
Yeah.

155
00:19:49.680 --> 00:20:03.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it's not. I don't take it as you complaining or being ungrateful. I just see it as a very transparent moment of sharing this has been my experience and some people may not understand it. Some people may not relate to it.

156
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:11.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. And you have to do that sometimes you have to do those mental check ins, like you did you assess everything like you had going on.

157
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:21.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I'm still good. I liked your Nice, nice. I want to do those things. So that's growing sense that you're doing things that you enjoy that keep you busy.

158
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But in the balance of being perfect but I

159
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.370
Misty Moncada: Guess.

160
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:35.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm thinking what promises you over the edge and makes you irritable when it's both interpersonal relationships that require just a little bit more

161
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.500
Misty Moncada: And so on.

162
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The cusp.

163
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And someone asks us a little bit more. It's

164
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like, come on.

165
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.540
It becomes too much.

166
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:54.480
Misty Moncada: That's the way I feel like, um, I think that I get a little bit stressed with my mother because she's really stubborn.

167
00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:02.640
Misty Moncada: And for me, like, I try to make her feel as comfortable as she can. But she's stubborn about things. I shouldn't even be angry about like

168
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:10.620
Misty Moncada: You know, like, the other day I had to push her because somebody has trying to somebody had got ahold of her bank account number was getting money out and

169
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:16.680
Misty Moncada: She's stubborn, like she wouldn't go to go, you know, to the bank to get all this figured out. And I'm like,

170
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:25.560
Misty Moncada: I'm calling all the places to have her bills paid immediately. So the money is taken out. So nobody steals her money. And I'm like, You gotta go. So like

171
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:41.100
Misty Moncada: I had an order for her to go. I had to go with her to make her go. You know, so it's just little things not like a big things that overwhelm me just like like things like that like things that I push her to do to make sure everything's okay for us or

172
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:49.650
Misty Moncada: I tried to help her, so she doesn't have so much to do, because she's 65 so I don't want her to overwhelm herself and

173
00:21:50.790 --> 00:22:02.910
Misty Moncada: You know and i think i think it's so hard, because my kids, my baby. You know, my youngest to I don't have, but my babies 20 the ones that I do have the three oldest

174
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:14.520
Misty Moncada: And like, I'm so now I have my grandson. He's a handful like he's all by itself. So he's he's he's just a baby cry because he spoiled. So like

175
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:22.920
Misty Moncada: He's a handful for me. And then he has a problem like sleeping at night, so I get kind of overwhelmed. But that, you know, so

176
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:33.780
Misty Moncada: Other than that, like everything's okay I kind of, I like the feeling at the end of the day, because I feel accomplished like I've completed everything I had to do, and I love it.

177
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:42.120
Misty Moncada: Like, I'm like, wow, I could another day down, bam, you know, like today's 41 what like

178
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:43.830
Misty Moncada: See

179
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:51.480
Misty Moncada: Cuz I had 32 days sober off of heroin.

180
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:59.370
Misty Moncada: 42 days today and I am in like faithfully like I have not looked back and I'm just, uh,

181
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:10.470
Misty Moncada: Just excited about that as well. I feel like everything is paying off for me. So that's what makes me want to keep going. I feel like groups are paying off. Celebrate Recovery.

182
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:18.420
Misty Moncada: All the time that I'm so busy. I feel like it's paying off because I'm not, I'm not like board and don't have idle time. Yeah.

183
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:39.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm asking because I'm also looking at your survey your band survey that you do. Um, and for counselor and for physician support you put a tube. So I'm wondering what, what else can we do Mimi, and the doctor do support.

184
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.840
Oh,

185
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.050
Misty Moncada: I meant to put that in the middle.

186
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.700
Misty Moncada: Oh, I put two

187
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:54.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and it's okay if it's a tool, but I want to know as you're there, because what's the best way I can support you, Lynn, and I'm pretty sure that the I want to know also

188
00:23:55.590 --> 00:24:03.750
Misty Moncada: It was supposed to be three in the middle. Okay, I must actually was going too fast. I feel like I'm in the middle like kind of a

189
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:21.810
Misty Moncada: To me that in the middle is just agreeing with things right now. You know, that's the way I felt in the middle with both my therapist with you and with Tyler Brett, I feel like I'm, I'm in the middle with you guys. I feel like everything's kind of focused on

190
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.380
Misty Moncada: Like we're doing a good job so far, you know,

191
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:37.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just wanted to check in. So yes, about the irritability and different things that may be brought up in relationships that kind of send me over the edge.

192
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is helping you to identify your style.

193
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:41.580
What

194
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:48.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How you deal with conflict. How do you negotiate conflict when you're stressed.

195
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:57.240
Misty Moncada: Oh, I'll tell you this. Okay. I went to prison twice the last two times behind a girl in this town.

196
00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:04.950
Misty Moncada: And I like hate her guts. Like I never snitched on her. I never told the cops. That was her is. It wasn't me. Who did the crime.

197
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:15.900
Misty Moncada: And so like with this girl like I wanted to beat her ass so bad. The other day I seen her at our, our dryer broke so I had to go laundromat and dry the clothes.

198
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:30.810
Misty Moncada: And a friend of mine dries up, and has her in the car and I want to beat her ass so bad, but it took me everything to remind myself that I'm doing so good right now. Yeah. And I need to not mess up. So, um,

199
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:41.280
Misty Moncada: I knew that if I stayed outside talking to my friend, I would have did something stupid. So I walked inside in my friend got out of the truck and he came inside to talk to me and

200
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:50.700
Misty Moncada: He's like, I'm sorry. Like, I know you don't like her. I said, You know what, I'm not even go out there and ask dumb. I have accomplished so much in life and I'm doing so good.

201
00:25:51.060 --> 00:26:00.330
Misty Moncada: And that's the last thing I need is bullshit or to go back to jail because I'm on probation. So for me, I was the old me. That wouldn't happen.

202
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:08.280
Misty Moncada: I would have thought her I would have ran on the other side out. I would have opened the car door either jumped in the car. That's how crazy and stupid. I used to be.

203
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:24.210
Misty Moncada: So like for me to walk away or to stay in there, knowing and I thought before I reacted. I was so proud of myself because I am. That's like a great example like I stayed inside until they left well because my clothes were still drying.

204
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:29.820
Misty Moncada: Yeah. For me to walk need for me to walk outside because I would have just acted out of character.

205
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:47.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, that's good, that's good tracking those moments and being able to measure your progression is key. You know situations where you do that self check like man. Oh, misty what a pull her up a car and be her down and now

206
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:58.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm able to regulate myself and what is regulation for you. Is it just self talk to you breathing. What else helps with the regulation.

207
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.140
Misty Moncada: self talk I'm breathing doesn't help me because I'll be so pumped up at the moment.

208
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:14.190
Misty Moncada: Breathing any type of counting, anything like that. No, don't work for me because it'll just pissed me off, but the talking to myself in my head like, don't do it. And before you wrap

209
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:24.810
Misty Moncada: Is a big factor for me right now. And it helps me realize like, I tell myself, you've come so far already 4042 days. Like, look how far you come

210
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:41.460
Misty Moncada: You're on probation. You don't want to go back to jail. You know, like all these things like my probation officers really cool with me. As long as I don't cause problems. He's really awesome. So for me, like these are things I don't want to mess up. So I just tell myself. No, don't do that.

211
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:52.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because do that self talk, you are stopping the other negative thoughts from the internet, you're able to reframe your five

212
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And replace them with positive coping so

213
00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:04.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's good, that you've identify what helps to regulate the quickest and unlike other people. You don't have to go through the process and figure out what works.

214
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.720
Misty Moncada: Because in the midst of crisis.

215
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:12.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know someone that wouldn't know what works. They may have tried to do reading first and that doesn't work, and they're already

216
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Up in the car about the fight.

217
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But because you had enough awareness to say

218
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.480
Misty Moncada: All right, that's not gonna work. That's

219
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:27.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not gonna work. I need to start talking to myself immediately. That was good that you had that awareness to see what's the best coping mechanism for me.

220
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And to activate it immediately.

221
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.400
Misty Moncada: Right, right.

222
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm gonna share my screen. So again,

223
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because there's on. Oh, go ahead.

224
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.650
Misty Moncada: Are you talking. I'll be sharing my screen. No, no, no, I'm just listening to you.

225
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, this this checklist is about identifying

226
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What your style is as far as

227
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With when there's conflict that arise or interpersonal relationships.

228
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.260
Misty Moncada: Okay.

229
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:09.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because in this checklist. You don't have to write down the questions. But what I would encourage is to just if it applies to you to write the number

230
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.280
OK.

231
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.200
Misty Moncada: OK.

232
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:26.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the first one says, I go along with something, even if I don't like it. So if this applies to you right number one on your paper.

233
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.240
Misty Moncada: Can I pick more than one of these

234
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:38.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, we're gonna keep going through all of them. So if you write it down.

235
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.200
Misty Moncada: Okay, so

236
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:55.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm only if it applies to you. So there's actually there's 10 questions, I believe, so I'll read each one and if it applies to just write the number and from there we'll figure out what your style is so too.

237
00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:01.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I push people to do what's right, even if there's an upset that applies to you write down. Number two.

238
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.340
Misty Moncada: Okay.

239
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:15.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, number three I try to be pleasant and easy goal going no matter what people do are saying

240
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:17.730
Misty Moncada: Okay.

241
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:34.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Number four, I give people a piece of my mind when they deserve it. So this is the person that navigates conflict by addressing it. They don't wait to see if someone's going to ask them anything. They just come. They're very direct.

242
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:43.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By I always try to be sensitive to what other people need and feel even if my own needs, get lost in the process.

243
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:56.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is what I call the servants, they, they like to help out. Um, they're always willing to help, they don't really question how inconvenient inconvenient them. They're just their

244
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.290
Misty Moncada: Number six.

245
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know what I want and insist on even if it means having to get angry.

246
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Seven when there's conflict.

247
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I tend to give in.

248
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And let things go the other person's way.

249
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.150
Misty Moncada: Okay, I put 134 and five. Okay.

250
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So here we have eight

251
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.210
Misty Moncada: Oh, we have. Okay, we have

252
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:30.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Eight when people don't do what's appropriate or reasonable I don't let them get away with it.

253
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:36.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So these people, they'll stick up for other people. If right is right, wrong is wrong.

254
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:44.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Line I'll pull away from a right relationship, rather than saying anything that could be upsetting.

255
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:53.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They don't really address the conflict, they'll just leave or they'll avoid the situation without

256
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: These are people that like in relationships and people may not even know why the relationship ended.

257
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.520
Misty Moncada: Okay 10

258
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.140
Misty Moncada: You can't let people

259
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Continue being selfish or stupid, you have to shake them till they see what they're doing.

260
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: These other people that hold you accountable.

261
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.690
Misty Moncada: Yeah, okay.

262
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: 11 I leave people alone. Let them be whatever they are.

263
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.730
Okay.

264
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:34.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, if people ignore my needs on system things that don't work for me. I get upset.

265
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.000
Misty Moncada: When they pay attention.

266
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.090
Misty Moncada: Okay, so I chose

267
00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: More I've numbers or more even numbers.

268
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.480
Misty Moncada: I have three even in three odd.

269
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:57.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, you're the first so far. Okay, so you're right down the middle. Okay, so the

270
00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:58.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Numbers.

271
00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are the ones. Let me go back to the first one.

272
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The I numbers.

273
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:07.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are the personalities that they were is it

274
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:18.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: These are the personalities that are very passive. They are the ones that avoid conflict or not confrontational. And this is the friend that

275
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:29.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People call when they want someone to be on my side, I guess an issue they call this person up with this person is going to sympathize with them, they're going to take their side.

276
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.880
Misty Moncada: They like for me. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

277
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, go ahead. Go ahead. I

278
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:40.740
Misty Moncada: Haven't I've just said like, for me, like, some of them that I chose like I go along with something, even if I don't like it.

279
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:51.000
Misty Moncada: For me is kind of like usually I'm pretty stern in my wording and if I feel uncomfortable about something I have no problem expressing my feelings are addressing it.

280
00:33:51.270 --> 00:34:06.270
Misty Moncada: Like, I won't sit there and just like let it go. But I know like in any type of employment or stuff like that or like a boss. That's why I chose one because if I mean like employment. Employment asked atmosphere like at work or something.

281
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:16.230
Misty Moncada: If I'm not don't agree with something, but I'll still do it. Like if my boss is screaming about something or. That's why I chose that because I have went through that before, like a boss.

282
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:25.860
Misty Moncada: And then like three I tried to be pleasant ongoing, no matter what people do or say because I try not to let people ruin my day like

283
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:35.850
Misty Moncada: I'm not gonna allow people to stress me out, you know, I'm just not going to deal with it. I chose for because I give people a piece of my mind.

284
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:45.060
Misty Moncada: And I don't mean when they deserve it, but I'm just trying to say like, I'm pretty stern in my word. Like, I'm not gonna let somebody tell me something like this is the way it goes. And me not express myself.

285
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:53.100
Misty Moncada: So like, I'm going to tell them. If I feel comfortable with it or not. And then I chose like 810 and 11

286
00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:13.890
Misty Moncada: And so like for eight when people don't do what's appropriate reasonable I don't let them get away with it because I'll to all explain to Mike. That's not the right way or why are you doing it that way. Or if it's the wrong way or like I said all all address the situation 10

287
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:24.990
Misty Moncada: Yeah, he can people continue to be selfish. You're stupid like someone's being selfish is stupid. To me, I'm just like, look, do you know, see what you're doing wrong. Like, I don't have no problem addressing that.

288
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:31.950
Misty Moncada: I think like this is my little model. Somebody needs to tell you might as well be me. That's the way I guess to be

289
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.260
Misty Moncada: Like out there. My drug addiction. Somebody needs to tell you that might as well be me and people get mad because I would say that

290
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:50.310
Misty Moncada: I'm 11 I leave people alone. I let people be comfortable for who they are, like, if that's what they want to be. That's what they want to do. It's not my problem is not me. So that's why I chose 11

291
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.280
Misty Moncada: So I have three odd and three events. I don't know. Yeah.

292
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there's bad

293
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that

294
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:09.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That Conflict and the conflict, what I hear is that the quarter view is probably more of the dominant

295
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:27.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Problem Solving style that's more direct and that addresses things but a year so sober awareness and a you China taper down how direct you made me or even confrontational for lack of better word. You're trying to temporary it down. And so that's

296
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Why the odd numbers are coming up, but the

297
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:45.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Core of who you are is one that deals with things directly had on they address issues. And the way I know is because even when you gave the example for number one. I'm trying to go back to one.

298
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:52.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One, you made it. Um,

299
00:36:53.220 --> 00:37:02.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was solely based on the work style. I'm working environment. You didn't address relationships. So when work.

300
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:21.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It seems that you would be more obliging a more accommodating. But how would I would even challenge to think that if it was something that you felt like really wasn't right. Or there was a better way to do it. You might offer your suggestion or you may get feedback.

301
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:36.510
Misty Moncada: Yes, and that's that's a problem with me when I have employment and like my boss. Like, I don't agree with something that I i have an issue with like addressing stuff then because I don't want to like lose my job, or I want to just do what's right.

302
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:44.580
Misty Moncada: And I shouldn't be like that because at home around my friends or anywhere else. I am studying my word, I that bothers me. I don't do that.

303
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:56.730
Misty Moncada: But when it comes to like having a boss. I'm like, okay, whatever, whether I agree or not and and and i think you're right. Like, I should be like with the way I'm with everybody else. I shouldn't just allow something like that to occur.

304
00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.520
Misty Moncada: That's a conflict because

305
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:07.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Also, I hear in your stores as someone that's really just trying to restore the time of all the crap that you went through.

306
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:26.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All the pain all the violence, all that experience and make a better experience and be happy and be grateful. And so what I want you to recognize is that being direct doesn't necessarily mean that you're not grateful. It doesn't mean that you're confrontational.

307
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a balance and

308
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:28.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Everything.

309
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.090
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't show any

311
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nature into the eyes because you

312
00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make you a better person.

313
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:41.640
Misty Moncada: Okay.

314
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:54.360
Misty Moncada: Yeah, I sometimes I do things to just make other people happy. And then some. But like, I don't know, it's just, I don't know. I'm like, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

315
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:57.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's

316
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:08.580
Misty Moncada: Like there's so many things that are going through my mind now that I'm sober and I don't know how to like cope with everything right now like my mind feels

317
00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:19.740
Misty Moncada: Like, I feel kind of like lost like I know everything I have to do every day but like my mind just like why am I feeling this, why am I doing this. Why you know certain things.

318
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:21.870
Misty Moncada: So,

319
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:36.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's an awareness, it's not it's not Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is your awareness, it's now being in tune with your fans. And so when you notice a fight you identify it and then you assess

320
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:45.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Why is it up here. What am I experiencing right now on this way, what's going on in my environment, what can I adjust. That's good.

321
00:39:47.880 --> 00:40:00.420
Misty Moncada: Right, right. That's what I'm doing. So I just try to balance everything out. Another thing I started doing I forgot to tell you is, I've been trying to go to the gym every day for 30 minutes I'm starting out with 30 minutes because I feel like

322
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:16.020
Misty Moncada: I found there's a gym in our town that's for free. Roy Walker. It's a free community gym. I've been going for 30 minutes so I could relieve stress and just kind of ease my mind that's been helping good as well.

323
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:25.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's talk more about the odd numbers. You said you go along, something even if you don't like it.

324
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, to be pleasant and easy going no matter what people do are saying

325
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.820
And what was the other one.

326
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:34.290
Misty Moncada: Was

327
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.920
Misty Moncada: Three and 11

328
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And leave people alone. Let them be whatever they are.

329
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:56.790
Misty Moncada: I like to leave people to be I think that you shouldn't change anybody because, to each their own. We're all different.

330
00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:12.510
Misty Moncada: So like if someone wants to act dumb. I'm elected Magnum. Go ahead. That's you. Not me. If someone wants to break the rules and I know we're not supposed to do it. I don't care. It's not me. Like, I know that kind of sounds rude. Like I'm

331
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:20.460
Misty Moncada: Just like whatever, you know, like all you do what you do. Let me do what I do you kind of feeling. Yeah.

332
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so with the evens you pick a

333
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:32.730
Misty Moncada: Yes, yes, when people don't do as well. I don't let them and

334
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.630
Misty Moncada: And that I feel like I'm contradicting myself.

335
00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:38.370
Misty Moncada: Because I say

336
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:43.530
Misty Moncada: I leave people alone. Let them be whatever they are, when people don't do it's appropriate or reasonable

337
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:57.960
Misty Moncada: I don't let them get away with it. I don't know because they both like I feel like I'm both because I can let people be whatever. But then I have no problem addressing things to people if if I feel like that's not right either. So like

338
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right guys tuition, would you let

339
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:11.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People be you wouldn't be wouldn't address if it was appropriate or reasonable and what situations do you just, it is what it is. I let you do you

340
00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:25.470
Misty Moncada: Probably if it was to my probation officer or courts or a like like the judge or probation or or like employment. Those are things that are just like, um,

341
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.030
Misty Moncada: I won't. I don't speak up as much as I should.

342
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.460
Misty Moncada: And that's something I want to do.

343
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:41.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Though you see the odds are it's house to authoritative situations employment probation officer.

344
00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:49.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because one you said with work 11 you said if there was Judge probation.

345
00:42:55.470 --> 00:43:01.320
Misty Moncada: Like authority figures and stuff like that. Maybe because like I don't know, that's my story.

346
00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:12.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that could be the conflict because in situations and make sense when you have a lot. You have a lot that you're trying not to lose.

347
00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.190
Misty Moncada: A lot of rules.

348
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or regulations. Now, right, you have to

349
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have to walk the client and arrow.

350
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:31.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All these different stipulations to avoid any type of consequence. So no number one, I go along with something, even if I don't like it. That might be the publishing terms.

351
00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:43.170
Misty Moncada: Right, right, right, right. And I think that's like the old like the old probation, like the old times, because now with my probation officer. Now, like we have such a cool

352
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:56.190
Misty Moncada: You know client relationship like a he understands things and and he's pretty open to my suggestions. So my Opo was not like that. Like, it was like

353
00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:02.370
Misty Moncada: This is the way it is and that sat and even though I didn't agree with it. I had no choice. I would just follow through.

354
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:06.480
Misty Moncada: Like my new peel. It's, it's awesome because I'm like

355
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:14.730
Misty Moncada: Hey, like I'm doing this, or this, or and we could talk really great with each other. He's like, Whatever makes you feel comfortable if you want to go to this group. Then you go

356
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:19.680
Misty Moncada: Because you know they have group three times a week it mental health, and I have to go to one a week. And he's like,

357
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:28.500
Misty Moncada: I said, what day. Do you want me going. He's like, Whatever makes you feel comfortable. So we both, you know, we're in the middle like whatever, you know, and I like how that is but

358
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:41.700
Misty Moncada: Um, I don't know, it's just some authority like where I can speak my mind because it's I feel like it's not going to matter or employment like bosses, it's not going to matter because they're going to do it their way, kind of thing.

359
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, so when you feel

360
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you're an eight.

361
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you feel that

362
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:58.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I'm still gonna let you know what's wrong, and I'm not gonna let you get away with it.

363
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:08.490
Misty Moncada: What, what's the difference in those situations. Um, I think that goes with like friendships, or my family.

364
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.380
Misty Moncada: I think like, I'll just be like, hey man like

365
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.650
Misty Moncada: What are you doing, that's not right or or

366
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:23.700
Misty Moncada: I don't know. I speak my mind more with my family and friends like I have no problem addressing something with them because

367
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:34.080
Misty Moncada: I'm comfortable with them. And I feel like they'll listen to. Yeah. What I'm saying, or they won't or who will disagree or agree. Doesn't matter. But, you know, I'm more comfortable with the situation. Yeah.

368
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:51.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you have both styles, your, your style can be passive when it's something that requires rules and regulations and 40 and when it's a more personal relationships, you are more problem solving direct

369
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.240
Misty Moncada: And it makes sense in

370
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:58.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your personal life where you would be more direct because you're in so many

371
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.210
Misty Moncada: Caretaker role.

372
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:01.140
Misty Moncada: Or you

373
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:02.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have to be a leader.

374
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:04.470
Misty Moncada: You can't be passive

375
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you have so many responsibilities at

376
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.100
Yes.

377
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.510
Misty Moncada: Right.

378
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:22.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we'll just see identify when that conflict comes up, you know, the next time there's a situation where you can

379
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:30.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where you could let people know that what they're doing is appropriate or but instead you choose to leave them alone. Thank

380
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:48.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Why did I choose the younger what works. What's going on because the core at the core of everyone. There's a dominant style. So right now you have the equal numbers, but it's because there's a conflict.

381
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:56.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm thinking whether, when you get more comfortable and things aren't as intense

382
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:01.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With all the rules or regulations, maybe the more dominant style, you'd be more present

383
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.420
Misty Moncada: Okay.

384
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:12.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For right now, you would have to have that conflict because you're a caretaker your leader, you're going to be singing in the church choir.

385
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.220
Misty Moncada: I one side

386
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:22.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know someone extra to lead a group for addicts on one side, but on the other side is also

387
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Happening through the regulations that are

388
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.830
Misty Moncada: The Agency.

389
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:39.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That dominant direct style rose to the surface when you saw that girl in the car, the laundromat.

390
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:40.560
Misty Moncada: Mm hmm.

391
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you wanted to address the

392
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.670
Misty Moncada: Situation that you had

393
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:45.780
Misty Moncada: Let go for a while.

394
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You saw an opportunity you wanted to address it, but you had to self talk

395
00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:51.960
Misty Moncada: To go into a

396
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: relaxed state because again.

397
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, you thought of yourself talk was the consequences.

398
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.210
Misty Moncada: Right, yeah. And you know, I thought about it like I mean this is like my worst enemy like

399
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:13.710
Misty Moncada: A there's one time in my life I wanted to kill her like that and didn't care if I went to prison for it. So like

400
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:36.150
Misty Moncada: It took a it's crazy. Out of all the people that I could see that I've had issues or or any disputes with i happen to see my worst enemy. And she wasn't rude to me. She just. Well, I mean, I'm not to like brag about my lifestyle, but I was known as a girl that you just sit mess with because

401
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.160
Misty Moncada: I would get you before you got me kind of thing.

402
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:46.410
Misty Moncada: So like for her, she was, she tried to talk to me and I just like was like, hey, just walked away because she wrote down the window.

403
00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:52.830
Misty Moncada: So my thing. I had to think right away like walk away, missy. Because I know I'm going to do something stupid.

404
00:48:53.220 --> 00:49:00.600
Misty Moncada: And I don't know, she was just trying to be kind, so I would be kind of her, but am I didn't care. At that moment I was just like, I gotta get away. So when I'm

405
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:15.750
Misty Moncada: I'm really proud of myself because this is somebody I be looking for for a while like and I can't find her anywhere so me running into her and me doing what I did I get myself a big pat on the back for that. Yeah.

406
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:38.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's good that you found that balance of when to filter down the dominant problem solving style and went to adapt to. I need to. I need to just kind of mellow out the bad side, you know, they all require balance because the passive personalities are easy going. These are the

407
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:40.230
Misty Moncada: People that you want to go to

408
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:41.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you're stressed out.

409
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you just need someone sympathize with you and I'll for comfort.

410
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.050
Misty Moncada: Night.

411
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:53.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The dominant personalities are the one that you want to go to when you really need some advice. You don't want someone to just want someone to say

412
00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.860
Misty Moncada: Hey, Jess, you should be doing.

413
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:56.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A, B and C.

414
00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:03.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or no, she said this, but remember when you did that you're contradicting yourself you need

415
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That balance of both friends.

416
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.570
Misty Moncada: Right.

417
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.960
Misty Moncada: Okay.

418
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:12.660
Misty Moncada: Yeah, because I know

419
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:26.010
Misty Moncada: It. No, it was just funny cuz I noticed, like when I said when I when you mentioned eight and then I seen that I did 11 so I it was funny how I felt like I contradicted myself with those two. Yeah.

420
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.370
Misty Moncada: But it's

421
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Funny that you caught it because I was going to say it, and then

422
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:31.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have that awareness to say

423
00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:31.710
Like

424
00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: contradicting myself.

425
00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:47.160
Misty Moncada: Yeah, that's funny cuz we never realized, I see. That's why I like having group with you and I like having group in my therapist or, you know, or therapy with you guys because I'm learning things

426
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:54.000
Misty Moncada: I'm learning things about my mind what I don't learn from her I'm learning from you, but I don't learn from you learn for her. That's the way I feel so

427
00:50:55.020 --> 00:51:05.460
Misty Moncada: It makes me feel better about who I am, what I'm becoming or how I'm finding myself because that right there just showed me like the things I'm doing, you know,

428
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:10.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. Well, good, good. I like that you're noticing some things so

429
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:17.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The next time we meet, I want you to, like I said, analyze that conflict. Right, so

430
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not so right now all of these, but that's because

431
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Eight and 11 really stood

432
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:30.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Out so for eight. Think about times when people do, don't do what's appropriate a reasonable and you won't let them get away with it.

433
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.590
Misty Moncada: Okay, I'm gonna write this down real quickly painful don't

434
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.410
Misty Moncada: Do what's appropriate

435
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.390
Misty Moncada: What's appropriate or reasonable

436
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.140
Misty Moncada: Okay, and then 1111

437
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.400
Misty Moncada: Yes. Okay.

438
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.150
Misty Moncada: Okay, so just

439
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:34.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: analyze those two dynamics, maybe do a check in every day, every other day, and think about the events that unfolded and identify you know

440
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was I was

441
00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Aggressive problem solving style, did I call people out and what they did, that wasn't appropriate a reasonable or was it more we was I'm more like half of that.

442
00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:52.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm going to leave people alone that can be whatever they are.

443
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:55.200
Misty Moncada: Yes. Okay.

444
00:52:55.230 --> 00:53:01.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then do like a little tally to to identify how many times did I do eight this week. And how many times that I do 11 this week.

445
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:15.060
Misty Moncada: Okay, okay, okay, sounds good. And then join me. Go ahead and schedule for a week. Another Yes, my man. Hey. Yeah, so

446
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We can meet

Misty Moncada: The 2626. Okay, same time

Misty Moncada: Okay.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sounds good.

Misty Moncada: Okay, Jessica.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, take care.

453

Misty Moncada: Okay. Bye bye.
