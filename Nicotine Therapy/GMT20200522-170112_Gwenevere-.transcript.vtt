00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. You know what I forgot to ask you how your beard was doing in group, the other day.

3
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

4
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.020
Nicole Roybal: Honestly, like this past week and a half. I've been hearing like I don't like reading again.

5
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.920
Right.

6
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird, huh.

7
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.850
Nicole Roybal: Like when I'm just like laying down. Like, I don't know, it's weird. Like I feel like I hear like

8
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:05.520
Nicole Roybal: Like static radio or something like, oh, here, like, I don't know, it's weird. Like I was feeling suicidal and I feel like I'll hear like only I tune into like the stations or something.

9
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.220
Nicole Roybal: Right, like you would be weird.

10
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, um, do you, you're saying it sort of casually. Is there any distress about it, or you've kind of come to terms that it's just in the healing process. And you got to wait it out.

11
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.930
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that's

12
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.120
Nicole Roybal: Fine better I can actually hear what people are saying it just sounds like it's like far away.

13
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.550
Nicole Roybal: Okay, really try to hear. I'm like laying down on my left ear or something.

14
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get a note open on Nicole, do you have a sense of what you want from today, you kind of have an idea of what you want.

15
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.290
Nicole Roybal: No not really, you know,

16
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to do

17
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.780
Nicole Roybal: That too. And really, honestly, I'm Daniel. He took his

18
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:09.990
Nicole Roybal: He took his chili sauce. If quarantine lever to do it if they wanted the time off, he's often well five years I've known him but so he's here right now. So I just want to let you know I have the door closed and everything. Okay.

19
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it affect you. Is there something you kind of might be shy about sharing a little bit

20
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:32.580
Nicole Roybal: No, I just feel like whenever there's someone else in the house in the apartment. I should let you in case they might be a little standoffish. Because of that, maybe I might not able to open up as much as I know someone else listening.

21
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it.

22
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.720
Nicole Roybal: Right. That might be what it is. I'm not sure.

23
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah, we'll see. Right. If you notice, oh, I want to say it, but I'm kind of inhibited. That would be the feeling is, I really, I'm afraid they'll be listening years so

24
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know if you can tell me, that'd be great. So that I can kind of

25
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of know that but if not, that's okay too. But I appreciate the heads up.

26
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so overall, um,

27
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Has there been a sense of I don't want to get out of bed and excessive sleeping, that is even more than

28
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Matches everybody's lump it because we're all on quarantine. Right, so that is above and beyond that, that it might be sort of a sign of depression. Is there any of that going on.

29
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.910
Nicole Roybal: I do find myself not wanting to go to bed, a lot. Just like I just don't want to get up.

30
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:41.100
Nicole Roybal: And I'm like, not even tired, no more, but I still want to lay there. It's like, what else do I have to do. And I do have stuff to do like clean the house, apartment and everything, but I just, I don't want to get up.

31
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So what ends up happening.

32
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you end up doing with that day.

33
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.360
Nicole Roybal: Well I lay there until I have to get up and make Daniel his lunch whenever he comes home from work, but I was not working, but

34
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:04.620
Nicole Roybal: That's only been two days, but um but no usually or I'll have to get up to go with my mom to my grandma's so like I always still have to get up, usually it's a little my grandma's every other day.

35
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:13.140
Nicole Roybal: Okay, but I'm on the days. I don't have to do anything. I kind of, I'm just yeah I'm pretty lazy and I don't really

36
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This is kind of what you were going through before ever since quarantine. I've been so lazy to get up. I know I don't have anything much to do except go to grandma's

37
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So that is kind of the same as as last week.

38
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You said resumes up today, but I feel, everyone will need to wear masks for a long time. I can't work with that stupid mask. I go crazy. Go to the store for 10 minutes and my whole face is drenched, I can't stand being caught every time I feel like I'm withdrawing

39
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. What's it like to hear that explanation back out. You just know

40
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.140
Nicole Roybal: It sounds

41
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.380
Nicole Roybal: Ridiculous.

42
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, I mean, it might. What if it's a little bit of both. Who knows but you really don't like the sweating, that's for sure. That's one of those symptoms that you just, just don't like

43
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.820
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I can't, I don't know why I'm here.

44
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So the only flaw in that is this

45
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what I i'm guessing about your character. I think

46
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I think if you were in an apartment. I think if you had a child, I think if you had a car payment. I think if you had a commitment to going to school or a job.

47
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you get it done.

48
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.680
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I know. I would too. But

49
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.070
Nicole Roybal: It's just like the steps of getting there, and then

50
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:12.540
Nicole Roybal: Actually doing in and plus i guess transportation is always a problem, but I don't. And then that also. I don't want to drive because I'm scared of driving like that. It's just so I have to take the bus, no matter what.

51
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, do I know why I'm the, I don't want to try. I can't remember if that's is that because of a car accident.

52
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:35.220
Nicole Roybal: Um, well, that is, it adds to the anxiety I already have. Yeah. But yeah, I've had cracks in it. I've got a DWI.

53
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:43.260
Nicole Roybal: And but I luckily got away with it ended up getting dropped because the state doesn't know how to do their people were

54
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

55
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.070
Nicole Roybal: So that was like, God bless you mean I

56
00:07:48.270 --> 00:08:05.070
Nicole Roybal: Was like, don't do it again. So I know not drinking now by just hit really bad anxiety of like all the other drivers and plus i'm i don't know i get scared of myself driving choose. I'm like, I get like I get exactly. I mean, then I'll start like being scared of staying in my lane and then

57
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.010
Nicole Roybal: Yet cars are crazy and yeah

58
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so there's a lot of em pockets of where you get anxious. There's a lot of places where that happens. And one of them is

59
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.070
Nicole Roybal: Counting just talking about

60
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

61
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, how is it. So, for example, since I'm here.

62
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think the rest of us do with those bad drivers. Right, so there there were out there, driving

63
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But what are we doing, you guys know how to drive.

64
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:43.980
You think

65
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: User

66
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.440
Experience.

67
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:47.790
Nicole Roybal: Well,

68
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Not forever.

69
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:59.070
Nicole Roybal: Their parents taught them young like for like 15 or even a little bit younger. They always taught them how to drive. I never was taught how to drive every

70
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.000
Nicole Roybal: Time I drove was when like my friends let me drive their car.

71
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. I think I get it. So here we go. It's I got my license. At what age I

72
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.190
Nicole Roybal: Never had a license.

73
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so it's more than just a deja vu why you were driving without a license.

74
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:21.660
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, and without any, anything like insurance registration.

75
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.160
Nicole Roybal: Was my sister's car and I told it to get her new one.

76
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Nicole.

77
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.940
Nicole Roybal: That was like right before I started my therapy.

78
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.630
Yeah.

79
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any part of you that wonders if this time might be a good time for reflection and really thinking through what your next step is like the next big step like you know that left right side of the page. I'm wondering if one of them might be

80
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting a driver's education, like, you know, they're not too, too expensive.

81
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Learning how to drive and then a driver's license. Maybe you end up not driving, whatever, but you have a license because oftentimes, whether it's ID or its license having it is, it's a responsible thing to do. It's like a real grown up thing to have. Right. Yeah.

82
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.880
Nicole Roybal: Well, I have an idea.

83
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.410
Nicole Roybal: I know. And honestly, right, like my grandparents live when I was going over there without my mom.

84
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.070
Nicole Roybal: Would be like they wanted me to go to the store for them in their car.

85
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.730
Oh, yeah.

86
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.590
Nicole Roybal: Right. Like, that's another

87
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.700
Nicole Roybal: Reason why she get it. She was like little things like that.

88
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that the activity that I was, um, I was doing in group about picking something that

89
00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of keeps you awake now what you shared was it's my alcoholism, that I wonder, will I always have these thoughts will right

90
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.970
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that was one of them.

91
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, do these ever keep you up at night. Like, I wonder if I'll ever get a job I wonderful have a career wonderful have a house, I want

92
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonderful get my license. I wonder if I'll ever be comfortable in a car. I wonder if all have this and this. Do those like everyday kind of things ever come in, they're

93
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.520
Nicole Roybal: Not all of those are mainly like the one about am I, is my life ever going to be like

94
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.010
Nicole Roybal: More than is like, AM I EVER GOING TO HAVE A JOB. And I'm going to be successful.

95
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.710
Nicole Roybal: And I ever going to be able to

96
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.100
Nicole Roybal: provide as much is provided for Daniel as much as you provide for me.

97
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.270
Okay.

98
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

99
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you answer yourself.

100
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.050
Nicole Roybal: I don't, I kind of just

101
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.080
Nicole Roybal: Think of something else or just, I don't know. I guess I just, I kind of block it out.

102
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Just makes me sad. It makes you sad.

103
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.040
Yeah.

104
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.080
Nicole Roybal: Even

105
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.610
Nicole Roybal: Close.

106
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.110
Nicole Roybal: Don't even know what I wanted to be this year like more frustrating.

107
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um,

108
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's go back to remember the discussions that we've had about identifying who you are, that a lot of what we've been doing very recently has been looking closely at identity.

109
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know, first figuring out

110
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Who you are

111
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it turn out that you can think you're pretty awesome.

112
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:05.250
Just

113
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Say the first part again.

114
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm not doing anything with myself. Okay.

115
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I've

116
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.710
Nicole Roybal: Been saying for a long time. A really good

117
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.990
Nicole Roybal: Move already and I

118
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:26.490
Especially

119
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.140
Like

120
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That right there that second part.

121
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how you lie to yourself just that second for

122
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It, it's happening to all of us.

123
00:13:50.700 --> 00:14:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that you probably just don't trust that whatever it is that you pick that you're going to do just for that day. That's, that's enough. It just have to be any big thing, it's just

124
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to go on the internet. Do this writing a list of those things that you only do that's why that

125
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Constructive worry guys was was important.

126
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sitting still.

127
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not doing anything. You said

128
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But there are things that you could be reading learning and researching

129
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, instead of snoozing

130
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to have it all figured

131
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.690
Nicole Roybal: Out, you're

132
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You're right at the right age when you pick up, pick something you're not late

133
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To know that

134
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.990
Nicole Roybal: I don't feel that

135
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.070
Right.

136
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So the Mr review with you guys to

137
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Contention for

138
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The development of the brain doesn't

139
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean women about 26 right about right now.

140
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And for men, especially if they have any kind of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and finishes at 30

141
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Literally, we're still like in our brain. We're still a kid, we're not finished developing

142
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So as far as I'm concerned, when I see your age. I'm I bet she's kind of on time she's about ready to kind of figure out a direction she wants to go. It doesn't have to be the only direction, but it could be one one that interest her

143
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, for some people.

144
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And coal and I wonder if this is what will work for you. For some people it gets bad and then they get out there, but

145
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people, they get arrested. Some people, they get that actual DUI. For some people, their parents kick them out or break up with a boyfriend. Like for reals. Like there's nowhere like I've got to actually start doing

146
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.530
In the

147
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:32.430
Nicole Roybal: Lake with me. It was like it to an extreme for me to actually do something

148
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a good thing to know. Oh.

149
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:49.290
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so he has made me, notice that they're going to do that like okay him so matched to the point where he's not taking out and and funny, Alex. Firstly, calming down and listening and stop fighting with me. You know, so

150
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a hard thing to overcome.

151
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you know i know

152
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty common.

153
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're patient with

154
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Tolerate

155
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Things kind of know it's not perfect, but I can put up with this if you've been doing that for a while.

156
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not keep doing it.

157
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what the mind does just like No, let's just keep whatever there's no pressure. There's no deadline number I've talked to you about what procrastination thing is there's no one pushing no deadline. But when Daniel says you're about to get kicked out or something, then you see it.

158
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. So notice right now. No one's telling you get a job, go to school, get your license. Notice that there's no one really telling you what to do. It's just you.

159
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.130
Nicole Roybal: push myself.

160
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to tell you

161
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so easy to say, oh, I have to push myself.

162
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really hard to do. If you don't commit

163
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So for example, let's say,

164
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say there was no real commitment in in bright heart right at bright heart said to you know what you show up when you want to

165
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.700
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

166
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Come on, really think you'd have to

167
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Have

168
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you would have a consistency and group attendance that consistency showing up for individual therapy if they had said, Well, just just show up when you want to

169
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.840
Nicole Roybal: Probably not.

170
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I'm making a commitment and hearing what the

171
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.230
Consequence.

172
00:18:59.340 --> 00:18:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Helped

173
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Organize day

174
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:12.930
Nicole Roybal: Oh no, definitely. I see that a lot of people to you tell them you don't you don't do medication. So I noticed that people like when you tell them that they started showing up more

175
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.790
Nicole Roybal: Like you know

176
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.940
Nicole Roybal: Waking up at seven in the morning. It's like

177
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're, you're, you're attending a nice

178
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And then is it that you go right back to sleep.

179
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.630
Nicole Roybal: What

180
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you go to sleep right after

181
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:55.140
Nicole Roybal: Sometimes. Sometimes it'll stay up for a little bit and then I'll usually have been falsely probably an hour. Just because if not by like two, three o'clock. I'll be sitting there like falling to sleep. I'm so tired.

182
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.370
Nicole Roybal: My boys.

183
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just look and see

184
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so maybe having a piece of paper and just sort of picture, you know, drawing a line. And here's today's date over on kind of towards the left today is 522 20

185
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.460
Nicole Roybal: And I was actually I was writing notes and stuff that we're talking about. So I have my head down.

186
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:23.880
I'm writing

187
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: About your notes. What do you think

188
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.600
Nicole Roybal: I was just reading what you're saying. Like a license, get a job, figure out what kind of job I want

189
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.730
Nicole Roybal: You to draw a line where how

190
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Middle, you know, just like a Horizontal. Horizontal line. And what I wrote was so kind of like this.

191
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, today's do

192
00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a timeline and sort of picturing that over on the right.

193
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

194
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say a year from now, so that would be 522 21

195
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the half mark.

196
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be at six months. So that's 789 10 1112 so that's Christmas.

197
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Ish right 678 910 yeah 6789 1011 that would be 1122 so that's like Thanksgiving.

198
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Six months from now is Thanksgiving.

199
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So just look at that and just think

200
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let your mind wander to some of the things that you could do in those six months.

201
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And where does it wander to what are some ideas that you get

202
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.930
Nicole Roybal: Over

203
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.850
birthday is in between.

204
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. When is that

205
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That is

206
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: August 23 yeah

207
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then there's

208
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Eight.

209
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be 28

210
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's that it's that reaction that makes me wonder if you

211
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: If what is defeating you is some expectation of what you're supposed to be at 30

212
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.310
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, we've talked about it. I really do have

213
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:52.470
Nicole Roybal: This like thing in the back of my head. Why aren't you, where do you have a job and you're both very soon. Then I know I saw two years like a lot can happen in two years, but

214
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

215
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.130
Nicole Roybal: So far away.

216
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep keep looking at the list.

217
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this. This is just

218
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: 12 months.

219
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't 30. This is just 12 months so

220
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that you said, I'll be 30 I don't have. Now what I should have. I'm assuming that's how your mind works. I don't like it because you've got to put in there, but my guess is

221
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:25.650
Nicole Roybal: That

222
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're comparing yourself to someone

223
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You should be and have and

224
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the problem you

225
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:40.140
Nicole Roybal: Know that like has their life or anything like that. That's my age well

226
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.470
Nicole Roybal: Again. Well, I don't know, my friend, Tiffany. She, she had like

227
00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.170
Nicole Roybal: Four kids.

228
00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:58.470
Nicole Roybal: Good a really good job really good and she was like she was like with like a hospital or something. And she like

229
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:08.220
Nicole Roybal: Something on the computer. If the patient or what she does, but she didn't really good money and she just got that job just just got it finger school nothing

230
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and she's making

231
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:20.700
Nicole Roybal: Tapping and I'm like, How the hell. Well, these people, they just get the jobs. I went to school and everything. I mean, I don't want to be in that field. But like, how do they get the job or even having to go to school, you know,

232
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Nicole.

233
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I will tell you.

234
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If you spend time thinking about

235
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What she has

236
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That kills your creativity.

237
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: All you're doing is comparing

238
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: look crazy.

239
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The way out.

240
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Just look at your own timeline. This is all you have.

241
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: There is nothing

242
00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: About some people have good jobs.

243
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they can afford fancy, fancy clothes fancy, fancy, fancy, but it's not who they are. It's just a job, maybe this planets align and they got lucky, whatever, but

244
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: To get that

245
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: make you sad.

246
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Care. So don't do it.

247
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at your own timeline. I'm excited because right here in front of me I have here.

248
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's lots of opportunity.

249
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

250
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.740

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What you think maybe

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: In a year.

254
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Put on that timeline. I wrote

255
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What's something you'd like to put on there. You want to get done over a

Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why do you need to what's different about now.

267

For now.

268
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.380
Nicole Roybal: Nothing, I just I can't go like this without money and, like, just like

269
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:28.560
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, I just was like, I'm going crazy always asking everyone else for money for cigarettes and stuff. And I'm like, I have. I do like I have enough money, that money and to be working with them but

270
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:38.280
Nicole Roybal: I'm not like I'm always bugging them asking them for money is my money, even though it's my money, but I don't know, I just, I'm all over the place today.

271
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.400
Nicole Roybal: As I needed to

272
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.560
Nicole Roybal: Thousand dollars a month. And I'm not healthy.

273
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.540
Nicole Roybal: Food

274
00:27:54.450 --> 00:28:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So look at your at your timeline, notice what happened to you just now really pushed back at me around the six month mark.

275
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a real

276
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost strong sense of a job. I then

277
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice that in yourself.

278
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:10.920
Yeah.

279
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see where you want to put a little line.

280
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to give yourself a deadline.

281
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You keep it you don't keep it, whatever. It's just between you and this piece of paper.

282
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Where would you, where would you put that

283
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.170
Nicole Roybal: At

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see. Um, July.

288
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: July 31

289
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

290
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

291
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's it like to see that date on the page that you put have job.

292
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It gives you a little anxiety.

293
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're afraid.

294
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have to be social. I don't know how to be social without alcohol. But the big one.

295
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:33.030
Yeah.

296
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So the difference people

297
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't realize

298
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That you you're in a relationship with people in group and you're in a relationship with me you didn't have this before.

299
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have a clear thinking head.

300
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have someone that you could say to

301
00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: There was this customer, and he was a realtor, and I didn't know what to say, and I got scared and I just said, excuse me, and I went to the back and I cried.

302
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you came to me and you told me, and we role played and we came up

303
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.460
With

304
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right self regulation skills and then some cool ways to speak to angry customers.

305
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you went back

306
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: To work and then you did those things and it was easier and you felt confident

307
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not going to believe what I'm saying.

308
00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing you're going to believe

309
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is when you're there doing it.

310
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't believe me.

311
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all philosophical

312
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All you're remembering is I used to. I thought I needed to have alcohol. I thought I needed it.

313
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have the modeling someone to kind of teach you about your value right about

314
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your right to speak, how to speak.

315
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have this relationship. You're forgetting that

316
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You have everyone in group everyone in there. If there was

317
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Any wanted to. Or you could go to more groups or you could see me more off.

318
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this guy said this, she said this, or I want to do.

319
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But it was hard and I didn't know where to look and you could talk to people, you weren't doing that we didn't have this before.

320
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.780
Nicole Roybal: Yes. True.

321
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:43.650
Nicole Roybal: It's like, it's like it's like I could just, like, yeah, working, they'll pop into a group of crazy or something.

322
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.260
Nicole Roybal: It will pop into zoom room look

323
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What you can do

324
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You can remember, you're not alone. And we're here you could send me a message and say, my boss is doing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

325
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, maybe I'm available.

326
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I, and I thought we could meet

327
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I might remind you of something we'd already talked about. But let me tell you something, just the feeling of knowing you're not going through this alone has powerful impact.

328
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think practicing the skills. Now before July might be a good idea.

329
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like I

330
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe in you.

331
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.070
Nicole Roybal: Believe that you believe me.

332
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.150
Nicole Roybal: It is hard to believe in myself.

333
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay for a while, you can borrow my confidence about you just borrow it.

334
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's supposed yeah I mean it's supposed to their supposed to be doing.

335
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that, right.

336
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're busy doing the best they can.

337
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So I often take on this role.

338
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't believe in you, Nicole. You just don't realize how bright are. There's not one thing that you have set your mind to do that. You knew you already knew who to call, where to call what to do, knew exactly what the steps where no one has to tell you, you are a very bright person.

339
00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that also

340
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:05.760
Nicole Roybal: Right.

341
00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You think I'm full of shit. And I tell everybody that

342
00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.090
Nicole Roybal: No, I know that you

343
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:28.770
Nicole Roybal: Will advocate, it's your job to make us feel better about ourselves. But I think that you truly do care. We do it because it's your job yeah and central banks as a lot of responsibility on you.

344
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:33.660
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

345
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So look again at July.

346
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And look at it.

347
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: all you're gonna do is this is just just

348
00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A way to put a

349
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Deadline. It doesn't mean anything bad will happen if you don't get it, but it might

350
00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of it.

351
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you're out of bed might get to the internet. If your internet we might be able to do some search snooping around

352
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

353
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess what I'm trying to say.

354
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that you're never going to feel like it.

355
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

356
00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.980
Nicole Roybal: That what you

357
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're, you're probably not going to ever feel like doing this stuff.

358
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what this deadline is supposed to do is to be the kick in the butt.

359
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that says okay

360
00:35:46.770 --> 00:36:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I picked a date. What do I need to do in order to achieve it. I will break it down in a tiny little bite sized pieces. And that's it. Don't overthink it. We picked a deadline. We've got the end of July, July 31st. We'll just take off so

361
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We can start

362
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now take a look at it. What would you

363
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.010
Nicole Roybal: Write for next one June.

364
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

365
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:24.870
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I put just start getting up read by then I have to be getting up in the morning like eight or 9am every morning. I'm not sleeping all day.

366
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if, what if you said

367
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what by 830

368
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you have a silent by 830 because you were saying eight or nine. So maybe then you just compromise and just say 30

369
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if you can see the screen. This is kind of random, but I've heard this from people

370
00:36:53.670 --> 00:37:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this thing called Pima Community College and I'm not saying this is the bee's knees for you, but it's

371
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: More than what you were doing earlier this morning, so we can just look at it so arts and humanities. Now, have you been interested in

372
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Business already like hospitality health, you want to work as it like in the dental field or the medical field is that interest you at all. I didn't seem like it did, but maybe it does. I don't know.

373
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.140
Nicole Roybal: Like all that stuff.

374
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let we're just looking at it for inspiration. So for example, when you see our arts and humanities various arts. There's English and communication fashion design language Visual and Performing Arts degrees, you can get

375
00:37:51.630 --> 00:38:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Sign Language Arts general concentration communication English fashion music theatre translation visual arts. So what about you know how you said you want to be a caregiver. Is there a part of you that wants to go into the health

376
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.890
Nicole Roybal: Know what actually

377
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.300
Nicole Roybal: I saw was business.

378
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me

379
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do that.

380
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so there's. So here we go.

381
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is um business information system and hospitality. So this is our business information system hospital or shares common goals teaching students to communicate effectively.

382
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Work as part of a team, whether it's a faulty spreadsheet formula. A bad line code or a menu that's not coming together, learning how to identify diagnose and fix problems will be the underlying goal of your studies.

383
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When you successfully complete your program you'll emerge with skills to enter employment in a variety of fields. So here's all hit business.

384
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So if your goal is to lead others in business penis flexible business degrees and certificates to provide you with leadership skills you need to get started in the field. Most programs can be completed entirely online or in person, making them ideal.

385
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see listed degrees, you can get an A.

Gwenevere Abriel: In associate of Business Administration.

387

Gwenevere Abriel: So it's the right here.

388
00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you already have some education. So you probably can, you know, transfer that stuff to not that this is the place you want to go. But this is just to get your brain going

389
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:43.200

Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. Yeah. So when you are working on your degree. Um, what, what were you taking business classes to get that far.

393
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.970
Nicole Roybal: No.

394
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.660
Okay.

395
00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.600
Nicole Roybal: Classes to

396
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.060
Nicole Roybal: For a medical assistant. It was just like a vocational school

397
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:30.750
Okay.

398
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't sound like it's something you want to do, though.

399
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:36.840
Nicole Roybal: No, I thought it

400
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:46.110
Nicole Roybal: Was because I wanted to, like, I figured. Okay, let me get one step closer to having some beer, I thought I'd end up putting in and Megan.

401
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, we got you. What was it, can I just ask what parts you didn't like because if you rule, some things out. Then you go kale steer clear. For example, did you have to touch people and that's the part she didn't like

402
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.510
Nicole Roybal: No, I didn't like the people

403
00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.000
Nicole Roybal: The work environment.

404
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:16.620
Nicole Roybal: The doctors anyplace to doctors. It's like, I don't know. She just like shit. Like, I don't like the nicer. Like you could tell if they think that they're like better, because they're

405
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.620
Nicole Roybal: Like I don't need to tell us like walking up noses up

406
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.590
Nicole Roybal: Folks, and even like the other

407
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.180
Nicole Roybal: Whatever it is, and stuff like that, too.

408
00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so, um, but that has nothing to do with

409
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Most, most doctors have what's called literally a God Complex that's so frequent Nicole. There's a term for it.

410
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not kidding.

411
00:41:52.620 --> 00:42:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So right, you're either kind of okay so but now we know you don't want to be around those people. Well, you're gonna run into them in business to

412
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:01.740
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

413
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.900
Nicole Roybal: Everywhere, no matter what. I just, I don't know, I don't

414
00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, let's see, academic

415
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:12.540
Option.

416
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright program requirements for 2021 this section list general education requirements that are not fulfilled by one by core or support courses so general education communication requirements.

417
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: When I one 154 arts and humanities requirement bubble up required core financial accounting managerial accounting introduction to business e commerce ethics in the workplace mathematics of business DID THESE ARE THEY sounding interesting, you know,

418
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if there's a syllabus and

419
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, let me show you this. Ooh, I'm going to wait. No, I don't.

420
00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see this just open or no little one.

421
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be a different

422
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:02.550
You

423
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.640

Nicole Roybal: At the college, not in high school. Whenever we had to do math. Everyone was like stressing like, Oh, I can't do numbers. And I'm like, it's so easy.

436
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:50.850

442
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.240
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, exactly.

454
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapy.

455
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you freaking out right now.

456
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

457
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.030
Nicole Roybal: So,

458
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So what does it say Asset Management provides reports to aid, which means help in tracking that means watching

459
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Organizing

460
00:47:49.320 --> 00:48:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: See, here's our assets you already have a new word right here, reconciling just kind of means organizing asset transactions. So that's just fancy talk Nicole for inside an account in a in a banking account if I'm moving my savings over to another savings account over to a 401k over to

461
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Some stock option.

462
00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All that is, is I'm just moving my money around this is just fancy talk for I just moved my shit around

463
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Reconciling organizing money transaction transactions are. When did I do it, how much was it that's it transaction. Sounds like a big word. But it's this is a transaction right now you're getting a service.

464
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And your insurance is going to bail for this is a transaction, you and I, there's a good. There's a service that's happening right now. And that's all it is. No. Yep.

465
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:54.780
Nicole Roybal: And all this

466
00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:05.310
Nicole Roybal: What she had spent and all that kind of them getting an idea, but I have an idea of what you're talking about. Just a little bit. My girl teaching me that

467
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's it. And, and, or let's say you decide you want to be a lawyer. Let's say you say, Well, you know what I want to be on protecting the rights of vulnerable adults. And in fact, maybe you want to protect the rights of the elderly and you fall in love with it.

468
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, then you would pursue that.

469
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.110
Nicole Roybal: That's a big one. That's wrong.

470
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, whatever. But

471
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's let's just stay here with where you're feeling optimistic. Okay, I think.

472
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you can do it. But let's let's just stay here. So we have

473
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Depreciation, that just means the value of something went down.

474
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: My house the value went down as soon as coven occurred it depreciated

475
00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

476
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I so basically

477
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All this was was exposure therapy exposing you to the very thing that maybe you were thinking it's going to overwhelm me if I go online, I don't want to get out of bed. So, now look at your look down at your timeline.

478
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you feel inspired to write something else.

479
00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And give it a date something you'll research something you'll learn some some help.

480
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You can ask for further research or learn something else you can add to this timeline, which gives you a constraint which we all need in order to get on deadlines are very helpful.

481
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this connection today is the real stinker. I'm going to say

482
00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:08.880
Okay.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: By the end of May, it will be

495
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:17.790
Nicole Roybal: Very, very good. In the beginning, I hate talking about my life and what I have to do with being responsible and goals and I don't know. I don't like it. I get so defensive or you have to like me to ease into it.

496
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.340
Nicole Roybal: I don't like talking about that.

497
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You did great. I didn't find you defensive

498
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.330

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

500
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:35.160
Nicole Roybal: Another word, but I'm sorry I did.

501
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I know Nicole, you are. You're just fantastic.

502
00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.520
Nothing.

503
00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: These are these are big scary.

504
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

505
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: This hard for everybody to do

506
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're you're actually you're in, you're in group with people that are doing the same thing. It's just you guys don't talk about it.

507
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, some of you want to restart. Some of you, you know, pick something now you don't do it anymore. You're thinking about changing careers. You want to shift.

508
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone. But she feel it because you guys aren't get maybe it's because I always have a group topic or we're talking about coping skills or something but

509
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You can literally say, is anybody in here trying to switch up a career, are you, you know, are you, you're scared to go back to school. Anybody else kind of going through that you can take the lead. You don't have to wait for me.

510
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.140
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

511
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but I like to throw it out there. So, I still have it typed in yet so research business, I put accident.

512
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.400
Nicole Roybal: Accounting

513
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. And we said by 531 20

514
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. That's exciting. Whoo.

515
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:01.680
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

516
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Scary. Yeah, but so if so, but here's the thing, if all it is is you research it. And guess what, it's, it's a line through it, meaning

517
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think this is what I want to check out then you said another one I want to research and business administration, maybe I do want to be a manager, maybe I want to be more around organization I want. I've seen bad management. Like, that's where I like to be

518
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see problems way in advance, and I think I've got a good idea. And so I went into industrial psychology organizational psychology, because I can see large systems.

519
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can see, oh, this is going to be a problem, this, this, you know, I can kind of consult on like I have an analytical mind. Right. You can hold lots of different parts

520
00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can say, oh, if this goes here this will work better and I can, I kind of think like that.

521
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But then I went and did some of it as an EP, and there were pieces of it. I didn't like the traveling

522
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I then I but I liked working with the clients themselves. So I liked when they would meet with me one on one, and I like okay so yeah I like the business part I didn't like it.

523
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because it's a lot of trainings, I have to get up a bunch of a bunch of group people I got slides and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, you know, I'd rather I'd rather talk with you guys directly. So I found out, but I didn't know that until I did.

524
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.130
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, and

525
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the part that you don't quite know yeah

526
00:55:53.880 --> 00:56:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but it's not it's not just empty rhetoric. It's not just talk. What I'm saying is, that's what we're all doing. It's not just you. We're all doing that, we go along. We think I want to be this.

527
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I like this. Oh no, but

528
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody does that. That's why people change jobs. That's why whole careers, they go, Oh, I'm sick and tired of this. I want to go over here and going to go back to school and go check this out. It's not just one thing. You're like, because

529
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:35.910
Nicole Roybal: A lot of those people started college younger they're younger 20s. I'm barely I really want to slow at 26 and then

530
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:40.980

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:40.590
Yeah.

553
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not

554
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not behind there are people that have your story that are in jail right now.

555
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're going to be in there for a while.

556
00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I supposed to judge them as less than

557
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you judging them as less than

558
00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Then stop the judgment of the self, be nice, be kind to you.

559
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just look at your piece of paper where you've done all those other tasks, because once you put your mind to a call even sitting there waiting for 45 minutes. I know you you get it done.

560
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You rock okay if you tell me that you're going to go online and before 531 you're going to research business,

561
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Business and accounting classes, you will

562
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It will help you to tell people you're going to if you keep it our little dirty secret. You might wiggle out of holding yourself accountable. But if you go into group and you say, I'm terrified to tell all of you.

563
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm good. I set myself a deadline and I'm going to get done my research something and you guys asked me about it and see if I do it. You don't have to do that. But you can tell you to tell your grandma. You could tell, Daniel.

564
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Asked me

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to commit to something that is my research business and accounting by 531 and

566
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I promise I'll do it.

567
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very that's an actual commitment is when you tell another because you don't. Right. We don't want to let them down. We wanna disappoint them.

568
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I just realized I have to jump into a group. Whoops.
