James Gonzales: My dose of little bit so

15
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.610
James Gonzales: Because I was kind of going it we're kind of wasn't enough through the night, and so

16
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.830
James Gonzales: But so today was the first day I got to try. You know what I mean, God God and I fully where

17
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.510
James Gonzales: I feel real good and then

18
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.920
James Gonzales: I had a good day yesterday, too, because I went back to

19
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:16.950
James Gonzales: You know where I was staying before. And guys, I had to get my birth certificate and my, I had to add Mike a briefcase, you know,

20
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.680
James Gonzales: And I had to grab a couple close and

21
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:43.920
James Gonzales: That went well too. I mean, because I all I really wanted was my you know my credentials and I was able to get that and get out, you know, in, get out of there before you know temptations got over me. You know, I guess I could say, oh, cuz yeah that's the spot that's fine but

22
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.000
James Gonzales: But you know, I mean, that's why I waited. I waited until our stabilized on the on the Suboxone so

23
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.340
James Gonzales: It wasn't hard at all. I was just

24
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.460
James Gonzales: But

25
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:11.070
James Gonzales: You know there's everything else, or the women and everything out, you know, but I just did my thing. I had done my stuff's at hiring, whatever. And I left you know right away, but I had my reg waiting for me so that helped to, you know,

26
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.840
James Gonzales: Um, and then

27
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.030
James Gonzales: And then I have all these papers I'm going through and which is good too, because I found, I found

28
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:33.120
James Gonzales: The phone number because he always having problems with one of my, my goal was for my cuz my license, you know, remember that, how, how am I the cops took my license.

29
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.020
James Gonzales: Yeah. And that was one of my goals to get, you know, remember to give

30
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.970
James Gonzales: I had to get obtain that so I had to get the proof of residency and then to get my physical, but I think I might

31
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.020
James Gonzales: And even though I have my papers that still everything is still working out. I'm just waiting on the residency papers, but

32
00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:02.220
James Gonzales: I found a paper when I got arrested. They gave me a, I guess they took my license into evidence. I don't know why, you know, they took my wallet into evidence. So I'm hoping

33
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.710
James Gonzales: I'm so I'm going to call tomorrow and and I'm hoping that they give it back to me, you know, because it doesn't expire to the end of this month.

34
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.600
James Gonzales: I mean the end of this year. And so I will. I'll just be able to invite to do that, then I could just start a job, you know,

35
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.700
James Gonzales: Immediately, and

36
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.310
James Gonzales: Yeah, so I'm hoping for that.

37
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.620
James Gonzales: Song.

38
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.010
James Gonzales: Yeah, I mean everything's kind of falling into place. And basically what I

39
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.450
James Gonzales: Mean, you know, I mean, trying to say.

40
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.570
James Gonzales: But, um, I just had to be a little patient

41
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.400
James Gonzales: You know, because

42
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.650
James Gonzales: It didn't seem like it was

43
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.890
James Gonzales: Going to have first, you know,

44
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.900
James Gonzales: I had my doubts, but

45
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.980
James Gonzales: I think this and you guys helped me out the most you know

46
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.850
Made it must

47
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: First showed up group like even your physical state you look healthier.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah livelier you look hopeful.

49
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.330

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.830
James Gonzales: Yeah.

51
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.170
James Gonzales: Yeah, thank you.

52
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:13.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Decide that you were able to put some things in place and to communicate to the doctor, you know, some of those triggers and strong craving so that she can also support you.

53
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And put in place.

54
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.220
James Gonzales: Yeah, the group didn't go so well again yesterday. There's only us to two of us.

55
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.940
Yes.

56
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She told me ahead of time.

57
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I don't, you know what, I'll just, I'll just use that extra hour to just chill out.

58
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.950
James Gonzales: Yeah.

59
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well hopefully the group gets bigger because I paint.

60
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.780
James Gonzales: Is it because there's

61
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that because, sorry. Is it because there's no

62
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.310
James Gonzales: You guys don't need more customers or is there is there actually people to

63
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: China. Yeah, we have several different groups in New Mexico that run multiple times throughout the day.

64
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:08.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Monday through Friday. Okay. Um, and so we establish a new group to create a new candle and I but

65
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.920
James Gonzales: Because I already have those patients establish

66
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This group is going to be based on new patients so we

67
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.470
James Gonzales: Don't have much

68
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:24.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: New admissions. I'm definitely I'm busy. As far as clients go but it's the group. So we have

69
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.060
James Gonzales: Three or more

70
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.610
James Gonzales: That's kind of good though. I kind of

71
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.290
James Gonzales: liked that idea better because

72
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.200
James Gonzales: You know, I'll be able to start new know getting to know people or whatever, and they won't be so

73
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.550
James Gonzales: You know, I mean like

74
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.770
James Gonzales: I won't be such the new guy.

75
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.630
James Gonzales: Yeah, you know, I mean,

76
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think it's going to be really exciting.

77
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:52.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And really good once we develop the group. I'm excited to to be able to just, you know,

78
00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:00.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Create a platform for all of you guys to share your experiences and helpful solutions for your triggers and your cravings.

79
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:11.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What worked well which relies doesn't work well for you because the therapists and the doctors perspective is important, but you guys perspective is equally important, too.

80
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that peer support has shown

81
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Successful in addiction, so

82
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.790
James Gonzales: Once

83
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.140
James Gonzales: Once we get started.

84
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know it'll continue to to succeed, just, you know, get a more participants.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:30.240
James Gonzales: I'm about to get, you know, an apartment and all that stuff, you know, and you know, at least I told her, you know, I'll always be there for, you know, and I won't ever lie to you so

126
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.780
James Gonzales: That's pretty much what she had a few questions about some things that had happened, you know,

127
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.410
And

128
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.540

James Gonzales: She also talks to her older sister.

134
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.440
James Gonzales: Which I raised since she was five. She's 18 now so

135
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.360
James Gonzales: Eight years apart.

136
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:00.870
And

137
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.540
James Gonzales: They used to hate each other, but they, you know, they're really they're real close now.

138
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.380
I know

139
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.680
James Gonzales: You talked to every day. She's a good, good, too. So she's a good influence on

141
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.760

James Gonzales: Came into her life. And she's like, for

144
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.650
James Gonzales: Eric gathers data ready so

145
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.130
James Gonzales: She called me fat and everything passion.

146
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.770
James Gonzales: So I raised it up until I guess 1616

147
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:41.010
James Gonzales: So,

148
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.370
James Gonzales: You know,

149
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.260
James Gonzales: Because it's been a couple years now.

150
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:47.880
James Gonzales: And

151
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.660
James Gonzales: I mean, they didn't used to hate each other, but they, you know,

152
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.800
James Gonzales: At that age where one on one. She was just always bothering her or whatever but

153
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.380
James Gonzales: They were, they were they were really close to them, especially, especially after

154
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:12.420
James Gonzales: The initial breakup. And then, you know, then they move together to a different place. But I think that's when they got a little closer.

155
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.500
James Gonzales: You know next stop fighting so much

156
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.700
And

157
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:19.950
James Gonzales: And then

158
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.990
James Gonzales: And then I think that they, I think they kind of lost contact for

159
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.480
James Gonzales: A little while, like a good, a good

160
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.750
James Gonzales: At least say about eight months or something. And so

161
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:42.750
James Gonzales: You know, and now they're they're back in their closest ever so she'll probably there's, I don't know what should probably show up. She has a car and everything. No, she

162
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.850
James Gonzales: She even picked her up one time she stays with

163
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.280
James Gonzales: With my ex is ongoing empty in Edgewood

164
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.540
James Gonzales: So she she

165
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.160
James Gonzales: Yeah, she even came and picked her up one time by yourself. In general, you know. So I think that was a cool

166
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.200
James Gonzales: Cool thing for both the moon, you know, they got to like kind of like a

167
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.220
James Gonzales: Little a little growing up kind of thing. And they were using today, you know, she got to but

168
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:28.410
James Gonzales: Yeah. And then my other sister is moving back from Washington. She has three kids and she's a

169
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.970
James Gonzales: She's a really good influence on on her too.

170
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:34.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She's

171
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.840
James Gonzales: She's real

172
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:45.420
James Gonzales: Like hyperactive. I guess like proactive, like, you know, like, Mom, and everything like well balanced person.

173
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.050
James Gonzales: And she's got will

174
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:56.460
James Gonzales: I'm sorry, her oldest daughter Isabella, she's just a year younger, but she's

175
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:14.970
James Gonzales: She's everybody's not her age. And you know, I mean, and it's it's it's it doesn't work like you know

176
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:24.600
James Gonzales: But I think on and so she with her moving back like she's moving back Sunday. Actually, the day after her birthday song.

177
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.990
James Gonzales: I think that's going to be a really big thing for the future for to, you know,

178
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.070
James Gonzales: That last part.

179
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.300
I was

180
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:41.550
James Gonzales: I was just saying, I think that's gonna be another good, a good thing for her in her life. You know, I mean as far as

181
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.940
James Gonzales: Because, like, oh, you know, I was getting worried about her, like, just because she's starting to roll up the neck have each her baby boys is gone, you know, and she can be a living soul and

182
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.390
James Gonzales: Like I was worried because she's like me with her. I could choose she has an addictive personality, you know,

183
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.570
James Gonzales: Like someone says like almost

184
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.610
James Gonzales: Like my little you know

185
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:03.870
She's

186
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.960
James Gonzales: Real athletic and she's just like exactly like me, it seems like enough.

187
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:29.040
James Gonzales: So I was like, read about her that she's you know going to have hard times this early childhood and then and then because I've seen people, you know, you might have to, like, you know, any every single age, they could, you know, they could turn in and go the other way. You know it.

188
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.130
James Gonzales: Doesn't matter how old you are, what you don't know your life or if you're a doctor or business owner and you know

189
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.470
James Gonzales: So,

190
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.560
James Gonzales: It doesn't always have to happen when you're young, you know, I mean, or any particular age song.

191
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.060
James Gonzales: But

192
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.620
James Gonzales: I was, I was just worried that it was going to happen or, you know,

193
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.500
James Gonzales: Another

194
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:54.540
James Gonzales: Another

195
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:57.960
James Gonzales: My

196
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:09.450
James Gonzales: My, my mom's my mom's brother, my uncle, he had a granddaughter. I guess that's his granddaughter. Yeah, and she

197
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:19.530
James Gonzales: Got she she sort of her parents, you know, we're separated kind of way and kind of similar to what's happening to my daughter.

198
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.860
James Gonzales: And then night and she said she stayed with

199
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.500
James Gonzales: My uncle and id like to her, you know, childhood and then

200
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.460
James Gonzales: And then when she you know

201
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.440
James Gonzales: came again and stuff like that she

202
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:47.130
James Gonzales: Just she just went off the deep end. You know what I mean, like, I guess like like lightning. That's what I did, too. But let them. I mean, she she died. She died. She didn't make it past 21 you know

203
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.810
James Gonzales: She died until

204
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:58.980
James Gonzales: She was to see me and I know she didn't have the seals beat her up or something like that. She died, but because she was so, so far gone already. You know,

205
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:12.540
James Gonzales: It just like you said, I'm just comparing it to what I what I see happening. You know, I don't want to hop into my daughter. Yeah.

206
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:20.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you have that fear and that concern that a lot of parents that have addiction have

207
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Seen

208
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And just really assessing some of my business precipitated factors.

209
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And things that might be

210
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:35.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Precursors a wow I don't want my child to have mile, you know,

211
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so

212
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:46.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With that while it can be a lot of guilt associated with that a lot of shame. It also gives you opportunity to position yourself.

213
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:58.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To be an effective parents in the fact of communicating spending time with your child education because you can have that live experience.

214
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:07.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in a child development way when it's appropriate of really being able to share these were my struggles, and this is why I know

215
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:19.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That drugs is not the answer. This is what my experience was. And, you know, really preparing them for that it gets a lot of patients that share that same concern.

216
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:32.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And to me, that's, that's always a positive thing because that's an indicator that one you're highly motivated to remain sober, because you have a strong connection and protective factor for your child.

217
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:44.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And children are just known to be strong motivators for parents and so with having a whenever you think about where you see different things that may be a concern for you.

218
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:57.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You remind yourself that. Okay, this is my silver brain that speaking. That's really encouraging me to be a better parent to get involved to speak to my dormitory for each nurture attack.

219
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.070
James Gonzales: Exactly. That's exactly I feel because like I told you before,

220
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.900
James Gonzales: I was

221
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.540
James Gonzales: No on my little

222
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.070
James Gonzales: strung out mission of, you know, in my 20s or whatever.

223
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.230
James Gonzales: It kind of just happened to me like

224
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:25.920
James Gonzales: But a time like I told you I you know I did it on purpose, almost, you know, I knew exactly what I was doing.

225
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.940
James Gonzales: And and then

226
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:40.830
James Gonzales: And yeah, I just, I used to look back, I used to look at the other people like when I was in the lattice. And I felt sorry for those people that have kids, you know,

227
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:48.900
James Gonzales: And I'm like, How could I was like, Well, I don't have no kids human I wouldn't let that happen. You know, it's the inner self doubt.

228
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.220
James Gonzales: I couldn't let that happen but

229
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:56.190
James Gonzales: And and well yeah that's what kills me the most, you know, pretty much that.

230
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.450
James Gonzales: Because I didn't have to happen. I mean, I didn't get I didn't happen until

231
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:20.520
James Gonzales: After the whole breakup and everything. You know, I just, I was just stripped down to nothing and and i just i that's when I just I just didn't give before you know I mean because my whole reputation was messed up my job, my, you know, and then I got charges and

232
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.940
James Gonzales: You know, I mean, I just lost. I lost everything. So that's when I just

233
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.750
James Gonzales: might as well use

234
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, so

235
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.150
James Gonzales: Cuz

236
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.830
James Gonzales: That and I really actually used it to cover up all that, you know,

237
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:43.560
James Gonzales: And I know exactly what I was doing. And it worked. It worked. They did it covered up pretty good. I'm good for me. No.

238
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.930
James Gonzales: I don't know much about a year and a half or two years is for

239
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.370
My girl last

240
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.320
James Gonzales: Mission worse.

241
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:49.830
Well,

242
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:51.330
James Gonzales: Um,

243
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:58.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well you know that this because you said, you know, that kind of what led to that spiral that loss of that.

244
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:15.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relationship and then here in the net you have with your daughter, and even the examples that you want us to be through your steps are is, you know, the shows that you really value relationship. So that's going to be something to keep in mind in your sobriety.

245
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:34.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What relationships are my invited into my life. So really increasing your exposure to those relationships that work well for you and being able to assess some red flags and things that in relationships that might not be working so well and disconnecting yourself from

246
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:42.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This will be part of your relapse prevention plan. So right now, you've identified another sister.

247
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Identified your daughter, who else do you

248
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Establish as a healthy social support.

249
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:54.960
James Gonzales: Um,

250
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:06.960
James Gonzales: I mean I have many others but it's just realistically anymore, especially with the call did but since my grandparents died, you know that.

251
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.060
James Gonzales: The jammy the family doesn't

252
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:09.990
Even really

253
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.260
James Gonzales: Like they're not as close as it used to.

254
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.180
James Gonzales: Because like I said my mom's my, on my mom's side. She's one of seven.

255
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:26.730
James Gonzales: And she's got five brothers and a sister and my auntie her younger sister. She's. She's good. She's a, she's a really good

256
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:37.500
James Gonzales: Role model, I guess, for you know she she was for, I don't know, like my sisters and and for she's actually my godmother, but for

257
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.180
James Gonzales: My other cousins, you know, this my other cousins.

258
00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.510
James Gonzales: You know, which are females that you know as they grew up. She was like, really close to them, you know,

259
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

260
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.820
James Gonzales: It would be

261
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:58.290
James Gonzales: It would be, you know, if things were the same, but really you know about everything everybody that I've

262
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:07.320
James Gonzales: That I mentioned, I think, is probably pretty much pretty much it realistically that she's going to be exposed to me.

263
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.720
James Gonzales: Um, but

264
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.150
James Gonzales: No.

265
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.070
James Gonzales: And

266
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.440
James Gonzales: And I'm also

267
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:19.830
James Gonzales: I'm also

268
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:34.470
James Gonzales: Have a check, but I'm estimating that little housing vouchers going to be ready, probably at least it's within the next week or two.

269
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:35.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's

270
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.400
James Gonzales: Another thing, I'm going to be up against because

271
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.760
James Gonzales: You know, I'm gonna have to

272
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.960
James Gonzales: Be alone, and I'm gonna have to put up with them.

273
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.080
James Gonzales: deflecting

274
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.330
James Gonzales: You know,

275
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.600
James Gonzales: We're men's be you know addictive behavior. That's the hard part. You know, because

276
00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.870
James Gonzales: It's hard. I'm just going to concentrate on being alone, but

277
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.000
James Gonzales: The Albuquerque socks all everybody's asked all the chicks new drugs.

278
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:27.450
James Gonzales: Is is. And while that's the reason why my last one started out really good beats because we're both on common ground.

279
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.400
James Gonzales: As you are or sobriety.

280
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.360
James Gonzales: You know she was on the same page. And we're both

281
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.350
On

282
00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:45.390
James Gonzales: Well, I was two years clean but you know she was like, you know, I don't know, six months or whatever, but she had a, you know, so it was easy, then you know i mean i was like

283
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.620
James Gonzales: At the time,

284
00:24:46.890 --> 00:25:03.540
James Gonzales: You know, I have got out of a two year program and and and you know so which I wasn't allowed to, you know, be in a relationship for nothing. So I was going on, you know, with all kinds of different chicks and they all did jobs, except for her, you know,

285
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.240
James Gonzales: And that's why, what

286
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:13.170
James Gonzales: Made me stick with her and then I mean were together for like 11 years, you know, um, but, uh,

287
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.120
James Gonzales: Yeah, I mean,

288
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:23.970
James Gonzales: It was it was we didn't even fight for like six, seven years, like, ever. You know, like it was really good until

289
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.410
James Gonzales: Until you know started drinking and

290
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.060
James Gonzales: And partying and little by little, yeah.

291
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:39.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so it because she was newer in her sobriety six months and so

292
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, the station of those things. And those lifestyles probably hard for her to resist it, and

293
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The next wall.

294
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.660
James Gonzales: Well, I mean, all by the time

295
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.500
James Gonzales: Well, I guess you could say. But like it. It already been like, you know, eight years like

296
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.540
James Gonzales: For her and and

297
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.350
James Gonzales: You know,

298
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:09.990
James Gonzales: I think I was always coming up on like 10 years, you know, and it was then she was, she was still at like, you know, I was two years ahead of her book.

299
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:10.890
James Gonzales: But he's

300
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.440
James Gonzales: Still liquor, it was still a long time you know

301
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But, but, you know, let me take that back because it really does it

302
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even matter how long, or how short

303
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because sobriety is

304
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not daily commitment you know you have people

305
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: over decades, and it can be a trigger.

306
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That leads

307
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To such emotional distress that a relapse. So

308
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it a golden number

309
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That equates to sobriety is just a

310
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.850
Commitment.

311
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:43.860
James Gonzales: Right, yeah.

312
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And, you know,

313
00:26:45.240 --> 00:27:03.360
James Gonzales: Like I said, and I knew that. And you know, I never would. I never would, you know, chant my my my years or whatever, you know, some time will tell. Some people are sometimes if if they needed to hear it, you know, and, and as

314
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.760
James Gonzales: My I used to even go to like

315
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.530
James Gonzales: The middle schools and stuff and do speaking engagements and

316
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.900
James Gonzales: Such a

317
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.530
You know,

318
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.970
James Gonzales: What do you call it success story. You know, I guess you could say.

319
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.460
James Gonzales: I was but um

320
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:28.500
James Gonzales: Yeah, after a while, like, you know, I was, I am. I'd like to be that guy that always that's all he talked about and then so

321
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.600
James Gonzales: I never really, I never really

322
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:47.250
James Gonzales: kind of stopped counting, pretty much. You know what I mean. And then, like I said, little by little, you just started from the with drinking and then, you know, and then I think, yeah, then just getting getting stressed out work, you know,

323
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.510
And and

324
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.120
James Gonzales: That's so

325
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.440
James Gonzales: I don't know because like I i got to a point where

326
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.040
James Gonzales: Where I wanted to be like, I mean hours.

327
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:07.290
James Gonzales: You know, I had, I was buying a house and big huge house. I had a bunch of cars I hadn't motorcycles. I had everything I wanted to me.

328
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.290
James Gonzales: But my job started getting so stressful.

329
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:11.490
And

330
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:34.500
James Gonzales: And then that's right when right when we started like fighting a lot too. So, and it really song with both of them like like they were just everything was you know tensing up around me. So I almost I almost did it like I had do it. I almost did it on purpose, you know, will kind of, I mean,

331
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.380
James Gonzales: It was it was already happening. But yeah.

332
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.310
James Gonzales: I was like,

333
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.440
James Gonzales: Man, I'm gonna have to and

334
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:50.640
James Gonzales: Actually, I kind of had to to get away from her, like, I really do. Because I wasn't gonna she's gonna let me go. If I unless I didn't have anything really.

335
00:28:51.120 --> 00:29:06.930
James Gonzales: And this always down to zero. Like, I was like, you know, and first she she like she took all my clothes she took all my briefcase, so I couldn't even get like an ID or not the issue to my my license. She took my wallet. Like, then she

336
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:14.250
James Gonzales: Knew she did it in a way where like when I wasn't there. You know, when she was when she was moving out and she

337
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.200
James Gonzales: Took all my stuff that just to like to help sabotage me know me and know

338
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:20.490
James Gonzales: And

339
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I wanna backtrack. Just a bit because you

340
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Said it was almost like self sabotage. That's what I heard.

341
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because yeah, just ship just was no longer working

342
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:36.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's like, you have to have nothing for it. Finally, and so

343
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:49.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What that tells me is that it may may have some difficulties with creating boundaries or with any in a relationship, just by you verbalizing

344
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:54.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can rather than yourself so that you don't have to deliver the message.

345
00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we can work on building up those skills to know how to how to navigate

346
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: healthy boundaries communication skills so that you can get a place

347
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:11.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nice, the relationship isn't working. Well, you don't have to self sabotage.

348
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.630
James Gonzales: So that the relationship

349
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is going to crumbles.

350
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can just communicate them. This isn't working for me.

351
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:18.780
James Gonzales: Yeah.

352
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:27.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In there are several people that have that that challenge with being able to express those limitations. It's all about just communication. SIGHS

353
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:29.850
James Gonzales: Yeah.

354
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.700
James Gonzales: Yeah, I mean, I'm I tried that. Believe me, I did.

355
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.880
James Gonzales: Not one point. I mean, I just

356
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:55.830
James Gonzales: Down to, you know, I don't want to be with you in the world like this, you know, but she was just, it was just sort of like we're still playing house because we had the kids and everything so was everything. And then it was sort of like, and then it was sort of like seemed like she would

357
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:06.720
James Gonzales: You know, I don't know, like, it will just sort of work for a while and then I mean, and then by that time we were already you know on drugs and everything June's drinking a lot

358
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:18.150
James Gonzales: And doing, you know, Coke and math and stuff. So it was like our where our brains and we're gone. Or, you know, I mean like our I was I was driving myself crazy just trying to

359
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:27.660
James Gonzales: You know, come up with my before thousand dollar overhead for to run my house and pay my bills and everything.

360
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.770
And

361
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.800
James Gonzales: And she wasn't helped at all.

362
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.980
James Gonzales: I mean like if she was a stay at home mom for

363
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:42.540
James Gonzales: You know 10 years and and it started with because you know my kids and stuff. And I didn't want them to have, you know, go to

364
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:51.210
James Gonzales: Like get care, nothing like that. And it was okay because it could afford everything was fine and dandy intervene and then like shooting.

365
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.230
James Gonzales: And she couldn't find a damn job she was looking for a job for like the last

366
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.720
James Gonzales: The last three years that I mean

367
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.180
James Gonzales: At the end, the last three years of the, the whole thing and

368
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:12.390
James Gonzales: I don't know. She was just faking or or she are pretending shoes filling out applications, but she couldn't find a job for like three years.

369
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like four years like

370
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:15.300
James Gonzales: I don't even

371
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.800
James Gonzales: Think she I think she still hasn't done

372
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:25.140
James Gonzales: Because my mom told me that she was lying shows lies about about her jobs. I was like, nah, I told you she's liar everything she says

373
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.050
James Gonzales: But, um, yeah. I mean, and

374
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.850
James Gonzales: Yeah, but, um,

375
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:45.270
James Gonzales: But yeah, oh yeah. So, and, and it was crazy, because even when even when it was at the very I guess it's a very, very end.

376
00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:57.690
James Gonzales: towards the very end and like within the last six months or a year. Um, cuz I mean like I was doing so good. It took me like two years to fall to three years. You're mean. And, but, uh,

377
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:05.940
James Gonzales: She wouldn't even because of course. I would never, I wasn't like eligible for food stamps or anything like that but

378
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:17.190
James Gonzales: At the end she she easily could have went and got them and everything like that. But she would just leave it all up to me. You know what I mean like when we're doing really fashionable didn't even

379
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:25.530
James Gonzales: Get the pinky to try to you know get any assistance anything and and you know there was there was a few nights where

380
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:40.470
James Gonzales: You know, like that they were waiting for me to get home for the interview NEED TO BRING DINNER. Like there's absolutely nothing. You know, and that was that was the hardest part for me but I made it happen. You know, I mean, they never went without but

381
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.510
James Gonzales: There was just like wow, why didn't you do anything you don't have too much pressure.

382
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And she was fresh

383
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.980
James Gonzales: Can't you do anything. Yeah, she and

384
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.340
James Gonzales: She was just watching me go crazy and you

385
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.390
Know,

386
00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:01.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So our next question, I would want us to have some

387
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Very interesting videos that I usually add

388
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:05.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I

389
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:10.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think that the one that talks about relationships and boundaries.

390
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:19.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would be good because I'm hearing. There's a lot of things that like happening for us and a good positive things and I want you

391
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:35.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To go through this journey of sobriety, just like with the new lens and the perspective of like really just looking out to see what is going to contribute to my sobriety and then have a separation of what will not and being able to operate in those

392
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Channels so that your emotions. Yeah.

393
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:49.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't get, you know, involved in your processes at the beginning because I know in the course of a relationship. It's hard to not allow emotions.

394
00:34:49.890 --> 00:35:04.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But your assessment in your judgment is going to be most important at the beginning stages of the relationship because you can go in it with that perspective. Oh, really soon. You know, through those compartments. And then from there.

395
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Being able to now involve other characteristics of your well being.

396
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.750
