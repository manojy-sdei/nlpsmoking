Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You hear me.

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.780
Donna Jochimsen: Yep, I can hear you.

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.219
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you this morning.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.330
Donna Jochimsen: Pretty good.

7
00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. Do you feel better today.

8
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.560
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, I do feel better today.

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.000
Donna Jochimsen: Michael

10
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.470
Donna Jochimsen: Finally, gone away a little bit

11
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. So today we're planning. It's just talking about what are some of the things that you want to work on while you're working with bright heart.

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And in our individual sessions. So if you think about some of the things that

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're going through that you think you could

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Learn or develop better coping skills for what would those things look like.

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.630
Donna Jochimsen: Ah, probably self esteem.

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.510
Donna Jochimsen: My

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.240
Donna Jochimsen: And I don't know how to put my emotions control me and I'd rather not do that. That's dangerous for me.

18
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.980
Donna Jochimsen: I'm

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:19.530
Donna Jochimsen: Just personal growth. I'm stuck. I feel stuck is what I feel I can get clean i i got i was clean for a year and a half, and then I relapsed

20
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:32.370
Donna Jochimsen: For about a month before I got a hold of bright heart. So it was a short relapse I I soon as I did it. I knew I didn't want to do that did not want to go back to that.

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.870
Donna Jochimsen: I

22
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:52.800
Donna Jochimsen: I feel like I need to grow, I feel, I feel that all the years that I use. I stayed the same. I didn't grow. I, I didn't become myself and I feel I need to do that now. Or I want to do that now.

23
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so what do you think that you're

24
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think that that self would look like.

25
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.930
Donna Jochimsen: I think it would look like a happy person that got him was involved with with life and

26
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.300
Donna Jochimsen: And and even my kids lives and and and loved life again.

27
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.310
Donna Jochimsen: I I isolate. I'm a terrible isolator

28
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:41.820
Donna Jochimsen: I'm perfectly happy. Well not perfectly happy but perfectly willing to just, I live alone. And I just, I can be alone all the time and be and not I'm not happy that way. But I don't know how to say that

29
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.960
Donna Jochimsen: I do it, but I know that if I'm not really happy.

30
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's comfortable, they're

31
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:59.070
Donna Jochimsen: Comfortable. I guess that would be it. I'm I'm terribly uncomfortable around people. I am i did not feel comfortable and I'm put in Scituate situations with people.

32
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.870
Donna Jochimsen: Especially that I don't know but but even people. I do know I don't feel like I have anything to say.

33
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.760
Donna Jochimsen: And probably because I don't do much. You know, I don't have an interest in life. I don't have a lot to I don't feel I have a lot to contribute.

34
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:33.600
Donna Jochimsen: And I know that's what gets me in trouble that I've clicked using three times and I've got a pattern, about a year and a half. I all three times. I was clean. A year and a half on relapse.

35
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:51.600
Donna Jochimsen: That's a, that's a point for me. But that's because I i can quit. I can do that part. But I don't I don't keep going. I don't grow up, you know, I don't grow. After that, I, I'm still the same.

36
00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think your barriers are to making the changes that you want to see in your life.

37
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.390
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know.

38
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.620
Donna Jochimsen: Fear. Fear of not being successful at it a fear of being rejected.

39
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.360
Donna Jochimsen: I don't, I don't know, I'm not sure exactly what my barriers are and and just not not knowing

40
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.790
Donna Jochimsen: Not knowing how to

41
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.520
Donna Jochimsen: Do to go about it. I, I know how to be a drug addict. But I don't know how to not be

42
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

43
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.150
Donna Jochimsen: It's different.

44
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it is different. And, you know, one thing that I know is successful people had to fail at something several times before they became successful at it.

45
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

46
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.340
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I do know what you mean.

47
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:13.380
Donna Jochimsen: I've been. I've been looking for an online group to join and I found a couple that I'm that I'm really interested in, they're not in a but I found women for sobriety.

48
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.470
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, and smart recovery.

49
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.060
Donna Jochimsen: Time.

50
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:26.820
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I haven't decided I'm going back and forth between the two. But they seem to be more more in tune with personal growth.

51
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.370
Donna Jochimsen: Rather than rather than what you've done wrong. You know how you got here. I know how I got here that I know.

52
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.130
Donna Jochimsen: But but moving forward from here. That's, that's where I feel stuck.

53
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that joining a a women's group is really powerful because what happens is that we uplift one another. Right.

54
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And build on our qualities and you know help

55
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:10.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: support and help each other, become successful and overcome the barriers and, you know, it sounds like some of the things, just so that

56
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can get this on record is that you need to develop self esteem.

57
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do and emotion regulation.

58
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.160
Definitely

59
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And to getting outside of your comfort zone.

60
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

61
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: trying new things.

62
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, I would

63
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What on some of the goals for each one, you know, building your self esteem, you know, your goal would look like stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying new things and trying new self care techniques for you.

64
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Putting affirmations up in your room.

65
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Things that you have to repetitively say to yourself about yourself that are that are positive.

66
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Changing your mindset about who you are.

67
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, is a big one.

68
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And definitely emotional regulation would be one and so that you can

69
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: React, you know, in a confident manner.

70
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not devoid of emotion, but have them a piece of it intact, you know,

71
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.840
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I let my emotions run me and instead of just, you know, having emotions.

72
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.130
Donna Jochimsen: And dealing with them. They like overtake me

73
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:50.070
Donna Jochimsen: Part of it. Part of it, I think, is my bipolar. But I know that there's, I know I can do better. I know that there's ways to control that I just don't know what they are.

74
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

75
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you came to the right place.

76
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:16.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but definitely to start working on building self esteem, it's about doing things for you and it feels it can feel selfish, at times, especially when we have a life of caretaking for others.

77
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:29.730
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it's really hard for me to even carve out time right now, actually, right now. My dad is staying, my brothers, because I was sick, and I am so hoping that that works out and he stays there.

78
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:39.510
Donna Jochimsen: He doesn't want to my brothers willing. So I'm just praying that that he would that he wants to stay

79
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.600
Donna Jochimsen: It would be so much better.

80
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:50.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if you could have part time part time part time. You know what I mean, that would be better.

81
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:59.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, because you would be able to have that those days that you can focus on your recovery focus on getting outside of your box.

82
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:10.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing and exploring new things that have always made you feel uncomfortable because that's a piece of it is being comfortable in the uncomfortable blip comfortable ability. I can't say that word.

83
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:16.560
Donna Jochimsen: I know, but I guess you would do that by doing over and over again. Right.

84
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like

85
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:27.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The first time you ever got a Medicare. The first time we ever got a pedicure it's embarrassing, you know you you really didn't want to go in there, you know, your toes look like like

86
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Crap, and

87
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:37.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't want other people to see your feet and you know all these reasons not to do it. And so it's about changing that mindset of saying, giving yourself all the reasons to do it.

88
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:51.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, and just really that self talk inside your head that says I am good enough. You know, this is what they do for a living. This is how they make their money. You know, I'm no different than anybody else that walks in there. You know what I'm

89
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just Riley for

90
00:09:52.590 --> 00:10:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Building those positive thought processes and combating those negative ones. And the more you combat those negative ones aren't. You know, I'm not good enough. Why would I want to do this, you know,

91
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:17.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The more you combat those, the better you start feeling and then you see when you get outside of your comfort zone that it's really, it's tough at first, but it's really not that tough.

92
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.500
Donna Jochimsen: One, because

93
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.640
Donna Jochimsen: my comfort zone is comfortable but up but I'm lonely. I am

94
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's really

95
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.600
Donna Jochimsen: It's a very lonely place to be.

96
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:36.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really, honestly. In early recovery. What are the, you know, things that we have to watch out for is angry hungry lonely and tired.

97
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.720
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

98
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that puts us in a risky slip, you know, slippery place and that could possibly lead us back to

99
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:52.080
Donna Jochimsen: Well, one of the things is, is that I used for so long that everybody that I know uses right so yeah

100
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.870
Donna Jochimsen: I have had to cut up all of my friends.

101
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.980
Donna Jochimsen: And I'm not very good at making new friends because I am not very available.

102
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.120
Donna Jochimsen: You know,

103
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's why it's good that you're looking at these groups online, too.

104
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:16.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that gives you a whole nother outlet. You start out small you start, start out with small baby steps, you know, checking out them checking out those meetings.

105
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:29.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you find one that that interest you engaging in that meeting. Yeah. You know what I mean. And then checking it out again and then doing it again. And sometimes it just takes one

106
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: foot in front of the other.

107
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.460
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

108
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:38.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I have to do this for me. I have to do this for me. I am enough I am good enough.

109
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.750
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I'm 62 i don't i don't get another i mean

110
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:52.500
Donna Jochimsen: This is it for. I mean, I feel like this is it for me. Yeah, I need to do this. And now I don't want to live the rest of my life. Like I have, you know,

111
00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:02.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, understandable and what a great what a great place for you to be right now to be able to build off of that desire to want something different.

112
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have to know that up.

113
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um,

114
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:16.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What will it take for you to be able to get active in your with your children and your grandkids well

115
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:26.640
Donna Jochimsen: You know it's it's really weird. I am a little bit, but I always wait. I always wait for them to call me.

116
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.040
Donna Jochimsen: And invite me. I know I

117
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:40.740
Donna Jochimsen: almost feel like I don't have I been such a crappy mother and grandmother that I don't have a right to be be the one that calls them and says,

118
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:51.840
Donna Jochimsen: Hey you know that malls, some of them, most of them live out of town. But there are a couple that are nearby you know and i don't know i i just feel

119
00:12:52.590 --> 00:13:02.580
Donna Jochimsen: Like I don't have the right to insinuate myself and in their life. And I also don't feel like when we talk. I don't have a lot to say. Because I don't do a lot

120
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:23.220
Donna Jochimsen: And they don't want to hear about about, you know, my groups and the things that I do with recovery. So I will that they do a little bit. But that's, I don't have a lot to say if I suppose if I got more active that I would feel a little differently about pad.

121
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And getting active, but then it also calling to listen is another thing and not worrying so much about what you have to say but worrying about what you have to listen to. That's another piece of it. And that's the beginning, you know,

122
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:47.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, one tool that you can do is get your kids all in a group chat on your phone.

123
00:13:48.780 --> 00:14:00.720
Donna Jochimsen: They have a group chat, but they don't involve me and I you know I know why because half because partly because they use it to talk about me but you know i mean they're concerned about me, they are

124
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:11.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what a great step to make to be able to say, okay, we're starting something new. I want to even having daily

125
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:20.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Text messages back and forth. I love you. Good morning, kids. I love you. I hope you all have a great day period, you know,

126
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At the end of the day, something simple like I hope your guys's day went great. You know,

127
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

128
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: will talk to you tomorrow. You know what I mean. But really just putting yourself out there a little bit with them.

129
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:40.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and letting them see that you're making these efforts to do things different you know

130
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.910
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, that's good, I guess.

131
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:56.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just little things just small little things, you know, daily just daily texting. I love you guys, I hope you guys have a great day. You know, shows that shows them that mom's doing something different. She is reaching out

132
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:13.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, and not holding not having any attachment to the outcome, like not getting hurt if they don't respond. That's okay. This is something new for you. And so just putting it out there today so that they know I'm thinking of. Yeah, I love you.

133
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:21.480
Donna Jochimsen: But that's a good idea. I, I feel, I feel bad about how I've been with my kids I've, I've not been the best mom.

134
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think

135
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.340
Donna Jochimsen: I've not been the mom they deserve. Let's put it that way.

136
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:37.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, well, you, you think about your addiction and how it takes it takes right we have this miss concept that what we're getting out of it is

137
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is good but in reality it's a taker. It's not a giver and

138
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:44.640
So,

139
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:52.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Knowing that piece and knowing that you're trying to do something different and also realizing that you can't go back and do anything about the past.

140
00:15:53.100 --> 00:16:09.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and letting go of some of that guilt, around, around the past but just putting yourself out there to be present today because you're right. What we have is today. I think when I realized that I had been on this planet, longer than I'm going to be on this planet.

141
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, that was

142
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:20.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A mind blowing concept to me cuz I was like, I gotta get busy with life right i and

143
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.380
Donna Jochimsen: I feel that way. I do you know

144
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.330
Donna Jochimsen: Now's the time

145
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. And there's nothing wrong with setting you know boundaries with your dad. And again, coming with that compromise, saying, Dad, I need to get, get my life together to so

146
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:51.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know brothers going to keep yet you know even half time I'll keep you, you know, or even you keeping them for a day or two and then letting your brother happen for the rest of the time I leave it so much pressure and stress for you and allows you to be able to build yourself up.

147
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.260
Donna Jochimsen: Dementia is a horrible disease.

148
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is a horrible disease.

149
00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:16.260
Donna Jochimsen: It's it takes. I mean it. It took me a while to to find my patients with them. I, I finally realized that he's like a two year old kid again yeah and and when I thought about it that way. I came very patient with them, but it's frustrating. It's hard.

150
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:24.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and to be you know somebody that takes care of apparent like that can be overwhelming.

151
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.900
Donna Jochimsen: It can be overwhelming. There's no doubt about that.

152
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:37.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, I'm glad that your brother's a willing. You know what I mean to step in and take over some of the responsibilities and

153
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're willing to let him do that too.

154
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:54.720
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I'm more than willing to let him do that and the reason that I ended up being the being his caretaker is because my brother, where he works if I didn't. And so

155
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:03.390
Donna Jochimsen: I just by default became the care caregiver and my brother was doing nothing, really.

156
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:17.550
Donna Jochimsen: He would call him, maybe a couple times, who he was, he was on his way to work and so he'd left it all to me. So it would only it would only be right if my brother has him for a while.

157
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:28.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. That way you can start working on you a little bit and get a little bit out of your comfort zone. And again, it'll be baby steps, not any huge

158
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:35.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Things right away. You know, you want to make sure that you get comfortable in each step before you take the next one.

159
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.600
Donna Jochimsen: Okay.

160
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:51.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's really kind of how we build our self esteem, how we let go of, you know, the guilt and the shame of the past, but really just starting one little baby step at a time and getting active in these groups that you found

161
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:59.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And making you know connections with your kids by putting yourself out there in the again in the morning, you know,

162
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:11.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting up and reading a daily meditation is so important to, you know, putting positivity in your head when you get up to start your day, but also before you go to bed.

163
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:25.290
Donna Jochimsen: I do before I go to bed. I do, I do, gratitude that my what I'm grateful for and I discovered that I'm grateful for a lot of lot more things than I would realize if I hadn't thought about it.

164
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:33.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, which is really, really good. And so adding to that that gratitude list. What are you grateful for about you.

165
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.350
Donna Jochimsen: Well, that isn't usually on my list.

166
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.230
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I'm grateful that I'm here.

167
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.270
Donna Jochimsen: I'm grateful that I'm that I'm trying to do to do better.

168
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.360
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know.

169
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:59.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or even just, you know, writing in in an affirmation and putting it on your mirror that says I am enough

170
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That, to me, that's such a powerful statement, you know, because we, you know, throughout our life as women. We've always low self esteem, YOU KNOW, SOCIETY plays a part in that. But relationships that we've had plays a part in that.

171
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:28.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, think guilt and shame you know never feeling good enough, as a parent, or as a partner, all of that plays into our self worth, and our self esteem and if we if we could get to a point where we are telling ourselves you know that we are good enough and we are enough

172
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And acting in that manner.

173
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: By making sure that our self care is handled making

174
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:41.910
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

175
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.120
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, I think you froze.

176
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.760
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know if my Internets having problems or wet but

177
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.680
Donna Jochimsen: Come on.

178
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.890
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know if you can hear me, but I can't. I've lost you.

179
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.110
Donna Jochimsen: Let me see.

180
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.920
Donna Jochimsen: I'm not sure what to do about that.

181
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:08.700
Donna Jochimsen: Yep.

182
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.150
Donna Jochimsen: And I lost you there.

183
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't know zoom hasn't been my friends. The last couple days.

184
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.020
Donna Jochimsen: The weather really sucks here too and that it could be my internet also

185
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:32.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So okay, so we're going to build on self esteem and emotional regulation and getting out of your comfort zone.

186
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

187
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And learning different things, different techniques to help build your self esteem.

188
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let's see, we will put a
