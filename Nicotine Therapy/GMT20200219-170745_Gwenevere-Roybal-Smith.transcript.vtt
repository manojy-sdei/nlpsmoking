00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.129
Gwenevere Abriel: Should be Nicole Royal

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

3
00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.200
Hi.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I am and walked away thinking you were going to take a few minutes and I grabbed a salad.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't want you to have to see me chomping

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.760
Nicole Roybal: On your fine. I was saying instance like 1001. I don't know. Yeah.

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: In here in my role.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.120
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.510
Nicole Roybal: It was instead of the normal little screen, it gives me whenever I'm waiting for you. It said like

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.590
Nicole Roybal: That wait for you to open up the room, but then it also said if I'm the host for me to sign in and it's never

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.320
Nicole Roybal: Right. As soon as you texted me. I had left the room and went back into it and then it said it the right way that it always does. So I don't know, but like glitch Jeffers

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, something went sideways on that.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.570
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, my bad. So, so that you didn't see that I was there.

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, but if you I think you test yourself with reaching out and finding a primary care. Did you have any success.

16
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:20.760
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. Well, I haven't chosen yet. I kind of want to talk to you about it before I chose. I was in a call them back after this meeting and choose, but so I got three names like you told me to.

17
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.640
Nicole Roybal: And one is that unit medical group. She has a weird name though it's sorcery posturing.

18
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:41.160
Nicole Roybal: Okay. And then there's a David striker and he's at infectious diseases in internal medicine. So I don't think I want that one. So I want to be around people that have infectious diseases.

19
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.910
Nicole Roybal: And then there's a Jeffrey Stephen, which is at Southwest medical associates.

20
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.720
Nicole Roybal: And the inner medical group. I mean, I think that'd be probably easier to really get there.

21
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.430
Nicole Roybal: Is here.

22
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.430
Nicole Roybal: Tonight, but that's a weird name, but I'd rather have a woman than a guy, honestly.

23
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

24
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.310
Depends.

25
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: On this is just the start. We've got

26
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Nearby

27
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in your network, maybe

28
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.340
Nicole Roybal: Associates is in my area to like I could get to there. Okay.

29
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

30
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You're identifying some things your own preferences about stuff.

31
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So that's great. Now, you don't know how the office is going to be, you don't know their availability, any of that. So,

32
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.420
Just

33
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick one you call you see when their next appointment is to get just a basic, you know, physical, to see how you're doing and

34
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And and that's that's kind of initially right is we kind of hit or

35
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Miss unless you're talking to someone who you know who has a physician safe and because nowadays. I mean, it used to be. We had a family physician. This is someone we grew up with. And that just isn't the way the world anymore.

36
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.950
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, the my family physician. I had growing up, he ended up opening. He's on methadone clinic.

37
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.480
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so I was like, oh, that's not what the services I need. Sorry.

38
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.840
Nicole Roybal: But I guess all of them are like easy to get to all three places are easy to get to.

39
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So which one do you want to and maybe I'll try all of them. Maybe I'll call and see which one has the soon as the appointment. Maybe that will be the one that tips the scale for you. Is there anything you wanted from me.

40
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.140
Nicole Roybal: Well, I guess not. I guess I just wanted someone else's opinion. I guess.

41
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't have one. I'll tell you.

42
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what people do.

43
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is they have a specialty and then they have

44
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say they have some some area in the hospital. They have some admitting privileges for a hospital, but they also have a private practice. So I wouldn't get too distracted with infectious disease that part of I get your whole fear piece on that makes sense.

45
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't get too distracted by their specialty. Sometimes people specialize, but they also have a general plaque practice as well.

46
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.620
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that's what the girl told me she's like, that's what the internal medicine parties. That's like support that you'd be there.

47
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.880
Nicole Roybal: How's it going to separate rooms. You put them all together.

48
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.760
Nicole Roybal: That's my question.

49
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.250
Nicole Roybal: So she wouldn't know that doesn't work there.

50
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.130
Nicole Roybal: But I was thinking of like looking up like reviews online and stuff, too, because that's always like a big thing that people say how, you know,

51
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it a smart.

52
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.700
Um,

53
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.500
Nicole Roybal: I love the internet because of that.

54
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that's accomplished.

55
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.140
Nicole Roybal: So happy. I finally did it, I was like, Oh my God, now I just gotta go ahead and do that part now.

56
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you pick one. You mean it's still a step you you just schedule an appointment. So the next one.

57
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.770
Yeah.

58
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so once you set yourself a deadline for that.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.950
Nicole Roybal: By the end of the week.

Nicole Roybal: Just to give me time to look up everything and all that. And then right after this. I have to go to my grandma's so

61
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to make a little note, hold on. Yeah, there we go. Okay, so

Nicole Roybal: Yeah, there's hot beer cans everywhere and people drinking around me.

94
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:57.330
Nicole Roybal: But those are things I have to like get used to access the world you know and that's, I know. Like, I'm still married early stages. I just feel like I gotta get used to being around people drinking

00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.160
Nicole Roybal: Everywhere.

96
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:09.180

Nicole Roybal: I can stop yawning my eyes water.

101
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna make a little note on because I'm just now remembering

102
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think yesterday you said something about that you were at 1600 milligrams of the gabapentin. Is that right,

103
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.810
Yeah.

104
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.780
Nicole Roybal: That's interesting relate them. I wasn't supposed to go down till

105
00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:04.110
Nicole Roybal: You realize like, Oh, crap. I was supposed to done Thursday, but I think it was just like Monday is easier for me. I guess because it just helps my brain. Remember the beginning of the week. Okay.

106
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to share my screen. Now this is something that the transcription is types based on what we were saying, but right here I thought

107
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So on 13th, you were taking 1800 I thought it on the 17 on the 25th, you'd be down to 1700

108
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.830
Nicole Roybal: Oh, crap.

109
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.400
Nicole Roybal: I am

110
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We went down.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.760
Oops.

113
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But I could be wrong. I thought it was, um,

114
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought was every week. Right.

115
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.430
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. Wait, so today is the ninth team.

116

118
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.690

119
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. That makes sense. Okay.

127
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:21.870
Nicole Roybal: And I've always had that like even when I was younger, I always hold up in the middle of the night. It's weird. I can't like stays with the full eight hours that waking up one

128
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.580
Nicole Roybal: I'm kind of some nights all like night before last. I slept through the whole night I didn't wake up one sale surprise.

Nicole Roybal: Normally like

136
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.080
Nicole Roybal: I don't eat three times a day. I usually eat in the morning and then like a snack in the middle of the day and I'll eat dinner.

137
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:21.120
Nicole Roybal: I've been. I've been eating. I figured out that I was, I couldn't eat before because I need to smoke.

138
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:36.270
Nicole Roybal: We literally be able to eat like even here. I was trying to eat, and I was just making me feel nauseous. And so I asked my boyfriend. If I could take a hit a block. So, Dad. And he's like, Yeah, go ahead. And then once I took that dad. Oh my god, I finished my plate like there's no

139
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.540
Nicole Roybal: But it sets that I need that to be able to eat but I figured out that I don't have an appetite, unless I smoke.

140
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:45.780
Nicole Roybal: So,

141
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You started smoking it 12 as well.

142
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:50.370
Yeah.

143
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.140
Nicole Roybal: Like 12 and a half, almost 13 but whatever. Yeah.

144
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

145
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't go into a big long spiel about it. But eventually, that is going to be a part of the discussion because you're just swapping

146
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: One substance for another you're not as interesting, because you'll you'll use the phrase.

147
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm clean and sober.

148
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.450
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

149
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You are not

150
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.470
Nicole Roybal: Mean, off, off.

151
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And and proud of it. I hope you're very proud of it.

152
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.610
Nicole Roybal: But I am

153
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That that I'm clean isn't isn't really

154
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:46.950
Nicole Roybal: True, yes. Oh, well, I don't know. I guess I feel just because I've smoked weed my whole life. It's not really something that I've ever

155
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:59.670
Nicole Roybal: Used as a substitution. It's been something that's always been there. So it's like, just like even if I was drinking, if I was doing other stuff about the really bad stuff I was still always smoking meat on the side like it wasn't something that was just

156
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:08.160
Nicole Roybal: Added don't know just I'm kind of sick. It wasn't something that guy. It's just something. Is there something I've always smoked. It's something I've always needed, I guess.

157
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.840
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I guess I do need it. Yeah, I just needed they needed to eat. So yeah, I needed.

158
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.050
Nicole Roybal: That and I get that don't look at it, something that access to other drugs with because

159
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole. Do you know

160
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.710
Nicole Roybal: Part of my life, you

161
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that there are, there's a large population of families that there's 1213 year old drinking and smoking marijuana is an urgent problem to be addressed.

162
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:53.490
Nicole Roybal: Why not, like, now that you taught me that about like how it stops the development of your brain and stuff. And so, like, yeah, I don't want to see kids smoking and drinking stuff, obviously, now that I know that, but I already did that with my life.

163
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.770
Nicole Roybal: So I'm already like

164
00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.400
Nicole Roybal: What are you trying to say by that. I'm sorry.

165
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not fucked.

166
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain changes and grows, thank goodness you're not fucked. But what you run the risk of doing

167
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that 13 year old.

168
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: In some ways,

169
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the one making decisions.

170
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the one that problem solves

171
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

172
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the psychological and emotional development that you're stuck at

173
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A 13 year old 13 year old making career decisions relationship decisions.

174
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.110
Nicole Roybal: Wonder. I get so overwhelmed with everything.

175
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: 13 year old.

176
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not a 13 year old, but

177
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.100
Nicole Roybal: I know, but my brains.

178
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not. You're not giving your brain a chance to grow. It's just keeps every time you kind of get some new information. It just sort of lets it go, it's not sticking

179
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:09.600
Nicole Roybal: It's very true.

180
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're not fucked. That's not know what it is, is for you. It's normal. You have had substance use normalized a neighbor.

181
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Down the street would be shocked.

182
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: How could you let this happen. How could you do this. How could you let your children.

183
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Put poison into their body.

184
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Not your family you adapted to your family environment.

185
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: There are large populations of people that just don't have the same thing normalized that you do beer cans around not normal.

186
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: For them it was for you though.

187
00:17:59.370 --> 00:17:59.820
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

188
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mother saying, well fine as long as your grades are good enough because she didn't know how to parent. Yeah. She didn't know what to do.

189
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.370
Nicole Roybal: I think it was just, I was going to do to their ways. She was like, Okay, no.

190
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.530
No, that's not that's not true.

191
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: She's your parent. She did not know what to do.

192
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: She decided to say

193
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep your grades up and I won't give you a hard time about smoking.

194
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.960
Nicole Roybal: I guess.

195
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: She didn't know what to do.

196
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.440
Nicole Roybal: Was also crazy cycle, kid.

197
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.100
Nicole Roybal: So I think I went, I would just

198
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:52.410
Nicole Roybal: If I she said, no, I would have went psycho on her and she knows a cyclic be so I think she was probably just like you're right, not being a parent just giving in

199
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

200
00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you guys get to be psycho. You get to want to do all kinds of things, but you're not psycho out of the blue, you, you were trying to adapt to an environment, trying to make sense of

201
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Growing up school band. A girl teenage girl. What, what's this, what's that you are doing your thing being a kid her job was to shape.

202
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The values that were important to her and the family.

203
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What she's

204
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing she's, she's drinking yourself what she going to do tell you to not smoke. She couldn't do it.

205
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:39.840
Nicole Roybal: I know that's what I think why I never even if she told me not to. I would just be like, oh, whatever you do it to like, why you can't tell me not to do this when you're doing it.

206
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But she did have the power, Nicole. She could have done.

207
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She got and

208
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.680
Nicole Roybal: That's and that's why I never respected what she said because of that.

209
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:50.880
I understand.

210
00:19:53.190 --> 00:20:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But you track it all the way back. And you may be tempted to want to make excuses for her and you are intelligent. So right, you've got that analytical mind, you can say, I wouldn't respected her. And so we had this agreement.

211
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.780
Yeah.

212
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.660
Nicole Roybal: But I guess I just said, No one likes to hear anyone talk crap basically about their mom.

213
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm comfortable

214
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.300
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, but you're right, though, so that's where I'm just like,

215
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I get

216
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.460
Nicole Roybal: Actually, though. You know what I mean.

217
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I do, I do. So the same thing that I'm saying to you, you did the best you could. So did she

218
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: She literally. And that's why I keep saying she didn't know what to do. She didn't say, oh, I know the right thing to do. And I just choose not to do it. I don't think she knew what to do. I think if we analyze and kind of go another generation back or three or five or 10 generations back

219
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it ever taught

220
00:20:52.020 --> 00:21:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: About how how to raise children. We don't get this stuff taught to us. And I don't think she hadn't either. There's a reason why she's drinking

221
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.100
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

222
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And come out of the blue.

223
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: She's got stories. She's got her history that she's self medicating and it's been doing it for a while.

224
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.070
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that's very true. Well, you can hold two things at the

225
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Same time stops talk talking smack about my mom is disrespectful. You can hold that one. And you can say,

226
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.920
She failed.

227
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: she failed to be a parent at times for you.

228
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.760
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

229
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's both. It's, it's, maybe, maybe it's even something. The third thing we're forcing

230
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:51.600
Nicole Roybal: And shows like many of us. I said, I understand why it was hard for there was five of us, not for us all together all kids going up. So she's probably just overwhelmed and my dad doesn't help. So it's just

231
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.030
Nicole Roybal: I guess I get

232
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.940
Nicole Roybal: That she's she still should have tried harder. But then she's drinking. So it's just like

233
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't have to do it. So notice that you're wanting to fill in the gaps for her and give a story for her but

234
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not here in therapy. She's got her life. This is a chance for you to be able to talk smack. All right, about mom and it doesn't get back to her. I don't call her up. And so you can't believe what she just said about you.

235
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:32.010
Nicole Roybal: Know, that's the one good thing I like about being here at the apartment is not my whole family is hearing all this

236
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Good point. Oh, yeah.

237
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.880
Nicole Roybal: He did that so much.

238
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's going to inhibit you from being candid and open

239
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.250
Um,

240
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's flip it around. What are you grateful for your mom for let me hear the stuff that you're grateful for.

241
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:59.370
Nicole Roybal: I'm grateful that she didn't shy. I mean, she had all of us kids and I'm grateful that she did at least try to raise us and try to make sure we had food and stuff like that.

242
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.690
Nicole Roybal: Uh huh. And

243
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:09.180
Nicole Roybal: She didn't have to. She could have just been one of those drunk moms that just don't even care. You just here's 20 bucks, my pizza or like, you know what I mean.

244
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:17.310
Nicole Roybal: But no, she would still try to make us dinner or breakfast or lunch or whatever it was, you know, but I would cook a lot too. And once us

245
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:26.340
Nicole Roybal: Older kids got a little bit. I can to our teens, just like, Okay, you guys help out cook like I'll put the main dish you put the sides are sometimes we get cooked dinner.

246
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stick with things you're grateful for.

247
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.270
Nicole Roybal: Shit, I'm sorry.

248
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:51.180
Nicole Roybal: Oh my god, I don't know. I do that okay I'm grateful for her always shine and her making us food am grateful for her working on the shimmer worked. Growing up, my dad worked. I'm grateful for her just dealing with me. So I was the worst time

249
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. We tell me what that means.

250
00:23:55.050 --> 00:24:02.880
Nicole Roybal: I'm good are dealing with my attitude going to all the time as a school. I called her because I gave some teacher and attitude.

251
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so slow down on that one.

252
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a story. I remember when she had to come to school or I was sent home and my mom did this and this is an image I have of my mom.

253
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Dealing with my attitude.

254
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear that that story.

255
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.630
Nicole Roybal: In the school.

256
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are just now you had stuff going on in your head. I want to hear one on

257
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.000
Nicole Roybal: Whoa, okay. So I would say that

258
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:45.360
Nicole Roybal: Jojo my attitude and especially because I always have my attitude at school teachers. And so she got called to the school multiple times.

259
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on, hold on, hold on, that's a general one let me have one story about where that happened. I remember when

260
00:24:54.570 --> 00:25:06.990
Nicole Roybal: I remember when okay I got in trouble. And she. This isn't the last time I got in trouble. This you showed up with crazy makeup and like she was wearing these like ugly purple like

261
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:18.390
Nicole Roybal: Are they calling one Baker pants and then should I put like a bag in her but maker, but look all funny and big does she look like a clown like shatter hair up all stupid like this.

262
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.960
Nicole Roybal: And you just and there's a copy

263
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.380
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I'm

264
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:35.370
Nicole Roybal: embarrassed me. And because she got tired of being called to the schools are like this time last year. And so after that I didn't trouble at school.

265
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I never

266
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I've never heard anybody do that parenting techniques.

267
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta put that in my arsenal of options. I'd like

268
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.740
Nicole Roybal: Crazy.

269
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go to one, the one before that. Let's go to the one before that.

270
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.200
Nicole Roybal: You're done with my attitude, a story about that or yeah

271
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.530
Nicole Roybal: We think

272
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:24.000
Nicole Roybal: Many times. He's like, Oh, I didn't arguments like a good one. I don't know. Okay. So me and my friends were trying to leave and it's not nighttime or daytime, but my mom said I couldn't leave and i'm just like No, blah. Yeah. And she's just like,

273
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:34.860
Nicole Roybal: Timing I can't leave. And she grabbed me by my arm and she's pulling me like don't like you're not going to leave and she does her nails into the back of my arm, and I felt the pain and just

274
00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:50.910
Nicole Roybal: By reaction like reflex I slapped her. And I was like, I just stopped in my tracks null sec okay i won't leave and make her dealing with me and like I went into the room. Later, and like, like a letter and told her I was sorry and everything and

275
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:58.680
Nicole Roybal: Just her dealing with me. Like what stuff like that all the time like me acting crazy and wanting to leave in her not letting me and just

276
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.300
Nicole Roybal: We had to talk after that we will just I cried and apologized and

277
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.960
Nicole Roybal: Just like little moments like that like her.

278
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:19.710
Nicole Roybal: Accepting me and my craziness and then both of us apologizing for it later. You know, like just the little moment of us coming back together. I appreciate it and love. I will always remember that, you know, okay.

279
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

280
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wanting to is what we wanted to do to leave the house. What did you want to go do typically or all the time, or one time.

281
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.780
Nicole Roybal: Go out with my friends and smoke.

282
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.580
Nicole Roybal: For hang out and drink. I don't know, whatever. We're gonna go do

283
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.140
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

284
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And that one where she put her nails into your arm.

285
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: About what

286
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: About what age were you

287
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.980
1415

288
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and

289
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If you didn't go out with those friends what might have happened to you if you didn't end up going out that night. Let's just say what was if you didn't go out with those friends, what would happen.

290
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.150
Nicole Roybal: I didn't go out with them. Okay.

291
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to another night if you didn't go out with those friends, what would happen.

292
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one time you stayed home. The other times you got your way. What would happen if you didn't go

293
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:36.750
Nicole Roybal: That there was a night when my friends went out and I DIDN'T GO WITH THEM, IF WHAT THE HELL events. We've changed that I wasn't there. Is that what you're asking here. What do you mean

294
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's basically it. Um,

295
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little bit more metaphoric

296
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.400
Nicole Roybal: Like what happened like to me. I stayed home.

297
00:28:50.550 --> 00:29:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to keep it open ended. I'd like you to not question your response. Your answer is just fine. You're having to make sure you don't get it wrong is getting in your way, you're not going to get it wrong.

298
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to get it wrong.

299
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no wrong. There's just your answer whatever comes up for you is perfect. Okay, let's try it again.

300
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.810
Nicole Roybal: And I stayed home I probably would have

301
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.440
Nicole Roybal: just stayed in my room and watch TV and smoked by myself. I don't know.

302
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.130
Nicole Roybal: My friends would have probably been calling me all night and bugging me here. Yeah, let's go, let's go.

303
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.520
Nicole Roybal: Let's go free right now. That's what what happened. It just kept bugging me to go with them.

304
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what you might might have done.

305
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.060
Nicole Roybal: snuck out and went with them.

306
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.080
Nicole Roybal: Probably since my friends are very

307
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.530
Nicole Roybal: Influential okay

308
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine that you could have had more help from a parent.

309
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: With those influential friends, first thing that comes to mind. Don't try not to to edit this.

310
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or censor it really

311
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But continuing to call call call call call call call call call call. How could a carrot have helped

312
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:33.840
Nicole Roybal: My dad have a cell phone when we had the landline so she could have taken the landline out of the wall and took him the phone and

313
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.310
Nicole Roybal: What she had did before.

314
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you wouldn't have been calls

315
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

316
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you would have

317
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: stayed home.

318
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.800
Nicole Roybal: Probably

319
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I don't get IS WHY SHE WANTED YOU TO STAY HOME YOU ARE ALREADY smoking in the other room. So help me understand why she wanted you to stay home.

320
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:11.340
Nicole Roybal: Because we're going to go out and party and go to a party at someone's house with under aged kids drinkers and

321
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.180
Nicole Roybal: All of us just having a little party, you know,

322
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What was she afraid.

323
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.820
Nicole Roybal: Of a house party and me going to jail. And so

324
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.650
Nicole Roybal: Getting too drunk and guys are awful altered. You never know.

325
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So going to jail. And is this possible assault that could happen, which is she expressed her concern around that.

326
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:48.510
Nicole Roybal: No, I guess just like there was like stories of like girls getting raped at parties and stuff like that. So she was just scared about that, but I always had my big group of friends and we all protect each other. That never happened to me of all the parties. I went to that never happened.

327
00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:05.670
Nicole Roybal: But she was always scared of that. And that's what she does lecture me on and tell me that's why she didn't want me to go shoot me she'd rather me stay at home and drink, drink the recency

328
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:17.340
Nicole Roybal: Majority of parents like my friends parents that growing up majority of them would say that it's okay if you drink is just stay home and dream because at least. You're safe here. It's like every parent

329
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.290
Nicole Roybal: Well, one would say that

330
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a huge group of people that just would be shocked by that.

331
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.280
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. It's insane.

332
00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what's normal so you you can register.

333
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Jail is bad, getting raped is bad. Those register from what your, your mom, at least. And what was your dad doing all this busy, busy just kind of gone at work.

334
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:52.830
Nicole Roybal: So always be in the room drinking watching TV. My mom was the main one that raised us and he worked. He would work in the morning.

335
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.740
Nicole Roybal: And all day Sunday because they own the cleaning business. So he just goes to work for a couple hours cleans the place gets paid

336
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:09.510
Nicole Roybal: Monthly. But anyway, so yeah, he would work at once, he came home from work, he gets to go and sit and watch TV because he's the one that works, and he pays the bills so he doesn't have to do anything when he gets home from work.

337
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:18.300
Nicole Roybal: Which is basically how fabulous he pays. He works he pays the bills. So he comes home and do nothing. Yeah. But now that he's been living like what

338
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:31.260
Nicole Roybal: Now that I had been gone for that month. And now that I came back, you can tell he's more independent is more like he'll make himself boot Hill clean up and like wash the dishes here and there. And I'm like, wow, it's a good thing. I love

339
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.550
Nicole Roybal: Your finally helping me with our apartment.

340
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.260
Nicole Roybal: But yeah, my dad, he was

341
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:54.330
Nicole Roybal: Never really active in the parenting. Growing up as he is now, now that we're all grown up now he's more like interactive, I guess, women stay with us, but it's like we're all grown up now.

342
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.130
Nicole Roybal: Now,

343
00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you really respect what he has to say at this point.

344
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:08.370
Nicole Roybal: I do. But I realized, you made me realize that he has a lot to do with my insecurities and my

345
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:23.040
Nicole Roybal: Just a lot of my problems. He has a lot to do with it because I never had that relationship with him and I kind of do now, but he got all mad at me the other day. He was talking crap to me, tell me that I'm just like my sister, because I take my Gabba pension and I Suboxone

346
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.440
Nicole Roybal: And it like really hurt.

347
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that piece about

348
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The relationship with your dad. Again, that's a generality. Let me. I want to understand what you mean. How has. Tell me what you mean by that, what is

349
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:39.900
Nicole Roybal: Expected my wife.

350
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:40.920
Yeah.

351
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:42.720
Nicole Roybal: I'm

352
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.810
Nicole Roybal: Just not having that relationship. Growing up not having my dad you

353
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:55.530
Nicole Roybal: Know, don't know, I guess. Talk to just, I don't know, just having that relationship. I see like other people with their dad their real close and

354
00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:08.010
Nicole Roybal: I'm close with him now, but I wish I was growing up, just have that father figure because now I think with my relationships with my boyfriend's and even this way, friend. I mean, look what I just said. He's just like my dad.

355
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:20.670
Nicole Roybal: Right, and it's insane that us girls do that we seek out a person that is just like our dad. And it's because I think I've been I was seeking that relationship that I had with him, so I never had it.

356
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So go back to this scenario. It's a little it's not going in the direction you were headed. But let's go back to this other scenario where

357
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to go out with your friends.

358
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mom says no, and your friends are calling calling calling calling calling

359
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to picture your dad doing something

360
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What could he have done to have been protective to have been nurturing your development and your gross and shared his wisdom. What could he have done.

361
00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.570
Nicole Roybal: I couldn't with inviting time he would get in it if he had to get involved in hitting so

362
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.120
Nicole Roybal: I can't think of another way, he would react okay um

363
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.400
Nicole Roybal: I would just want both of my parents as a united front.

364
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.210
Nicole Roybal: To tell me

365
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.500
Nicole Roybal: Instead of just one

366
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. I like it. What would they come as a united front, what would be the message.

367
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:35.520
Nicole Roybal: Well, hearing it from both of them will definitely help like no you can't go out like Something bad could happen to you. You need to listen to both of us. We're your parents, not just I'm your we're your parents, you know, like

368
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:52.020
Nicole Roybal: I guess I may be whatever stepped in it more than maybe listen to more just knowing that they both Karen. Both are trying to get me to stop, not just my mom is just being a brat and doesn't want me to go out i don't know what i thought i don't know teenagers brat.

369
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:53.940
Nicole Roybal: That's okay.

370
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.780
Good to be back.

371
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.040
Nicole Roybal: Just, I don't know, I guess you're right. I did. I do wish I my dad was part of it.

372
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:13.500
Nicole Roybal: But like I said, every time I just thought about, I guess he was part of it if he was all he would just come in, you're not doing nothing like search throwing shit and

373
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:23.760
Nicole Roybal: And sometimes we did a painting mean and he I was always the main one. You guys hit you never hear anyone else. But I was always the one that get in the middle of their fights as well.

374
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:30.330
Nicole Roybal: The final about them. They don't fight anymore. It's crazy how much better.

375
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So the piece about you were having a hard time identifying what you would want

376
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: From from your dad you were able to say it'd be nice if they both presented as a unified front.

377
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

378
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.590
Nicole Roybal: Isn't I really realized that

379
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.480
Nicole Roybal: It was like that big of a deal.

380
00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself, just a second, though, to think adult and maybe something that

381
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If your dad was talking to your mom.

382
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: They were negotiating in another room, how to handle your defiance or something, whatever, but they're working it out before they get in front of you, before they talk to you.

383
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you picture your dad.

384
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Recommending

385
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To mom.

386
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:43.440
Nicole Roybal: He was the one that recommended that whole good grades thing. That's the conversation. They had without me and then came to me and talk to me about it. That's what really happened. But how I would have wanted it to happen would be

387
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:45.990
Nicole Roybal: What

388
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:56.910
Nicole Roybal: I thought you said Sundance I am how I would want it to happen would be I would want them to say, well, she's getting out of control. We can't allow her to smoke weed and drink because look at us.

389
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.460
Nicole Roybal: We just

390
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.770
Nicole Roybal: There's really nothing they could have done. I was going to do what I wanted to

391
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay right there.

392
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't. So their hair can allow her to drink and smoke.

393
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at us.

394
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.630
Nicole Roybal: They could have stopped.

395
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.300
Nicole Roybal: For all of us.

396
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they could have stopped.

397
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:34.710
Nicole Roybal: That to my, what do I say I'll quit. If your dad quits. And then my dad quit. One day, this was like a year ago or a couple years ago and she didn't quit.

398
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.120
Nicole Roybal: So he started drinking it.

399
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.970
Nicole Roybal: I know they're ridiculous. He adequate for 30 days.

400
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:49.950
Nicole Roybal: I've been drinking for years. I was like, How did you do that, but I can't even do it again, still hard for me. I have to go on medication, anything you did it just like nothing

401
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I will choose to assume that he didn't

402
00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:01.350
Nicole Roybal: Nearly as he said he wasn't. He was like, You look like it's more

403
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:02.220
I know

404
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's intoxicated and there's making sure you've you felt it yourself before you go into the T's you're drinking not drunk, just making sure you have a little bit alcohol. I don't know what happened.

405
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But for him to be have been on it for that many years. That's all I don't know what happened but that's that's let's put that over here.

406
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.610
Nicole Roybal: He's no okay well what I'm sorry, one more thing about that is Daniel

407
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:41.160
Nicole Roybal: He told us what he told me he's like oh my god your dream for years. He could go without drinking a few days because he's not actually not drinking. You just make sure he doesn't get you to junk such where everyone notices. Hmm, probably

408
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

409
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:47.280
Nicole Roybal: You can't do that. But that makes sense. Sorry. That's like you said.

410
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's maintenance. There's just like, Okay, I gotta just make sure I don't go into withdrawal and then there's when you're actually intoxicated and high so

411
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but all of that is just so secondary to what you just did you identified, I would have liked my parents to have taken a look at themselves.

412
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:10.800
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

413
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:14.070
Nicole Roybal: That's too hard for them to do even now.

414
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and will you do the hard work that it's going to take to not repeat another generation. I don't know. Or you might

415
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already started. Yeah.

416
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.190
Nicole Roybal: Oh no, I mean, obviously I don't want to ship the weed here, right.

417
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So, well, it's okay. Don't have to go. Just sit with it a little bit longer you we move very quickly right pop right off of it not sitting there with it.

418
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Changing a generation of behavior isn't. It's not an easy thing to do.

419
00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't know what's different. You

420
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Only know what you have been exposed to.

421
00:42:54.030 --> 00:43:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Your people around you. Your influential friends like everybody was already doing what basically your family was doing

422
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:03.240
Nicole Roybal: There's no point

423
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And

424
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It is very possible that if you don't really look at having sort of a consciousness about it like

425
00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a difference between rationalization, and I need to take a cold, hard look at what's healthy, you can rationalize you could have kept drinking. You could rationalize the whole thing. You could have kept it going

426
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:31.020
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, no, it's

427
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.910
Nicole Roybal: Good as rationalizing

428
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it with tobacco open my grandparents don't know. I'm with the we

429
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: There they could possibly be an environment which you just said right when you're away from that exposure to the alcohol, the cravings go down there.

430
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Are a lot fewer

431
00:43:55.470 --> 00:44:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But you literally cannot imagine I'm guessing you wouldn't be alone a life without cigarettes and and marijuana. I bet you can't even imagine it.

432
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

433
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Terrifying because you got started so young. What you have put in place because you started so young.

434
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Go look it up. Statistically genetics and or an early onset of substance use.

435
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Are some of the two high predictive factors of addictive behavior and chemical dependence. Later on, you have both and and continued environmental influence the battle that if you want to get into battle.

436
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be fighting for health and you don't even know what it is.

437
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You've never even seen it. I like I might be full of shit. Maybe I'm a drink or maybe don't even believe me. I mean, you have no idea what this is.

438
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're, you can't even like even in conversation. You'll undo before it even floats from my mouth to your ears. The idea that someone might not smoke that you might not. But you can't even have it floating around, you're like above that will never happen. I don't want my

439
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:18.030
Nicole Roybal: Cigarettes. Yeah, I can imagine, but not lead

440
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.070
Nicole Roybal: I want you to imagine cigarettes, because that's like

441
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were a kid.

442
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:32.070
You had no business doing drugs as a kid.

443
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.140
That is

444
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.470
Know you needed to have been

445
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Into athletics academics activities, whether it was cheer or whether it was science or the arts or dance or music or whatever you're passionate about. That is what the reinforcement would be

446
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.530
Nicole Roybal: That's a such as I always wanted to be like volleyball and it couldn't be because my parents can afford it.

447
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you getting this week.

448
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:17.640
Nicole Roybal: Of stealing it from my dad or my friends will give me so. My parents never give me money, they never would give me and maybe two bucks for lunch, maybe

449
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This conversation right here. We need to take a look at ourselves.

450
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's Where's my daughter, getting the week. Oh, from me.

451
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.280
Yeah.

452
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.650
Nicole Roybal: Exactly. I know.

453
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that you don't have to go very far to figure this out. He could have taken a look at himself didn't want to

454
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Put all the burden on mom mom is dealing with a limited. This is a pretty common phenomenon right dad's Working start to think we're trapped with this.

455
00:46:49.980 --> 00:47:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do the best I can. I don't want my daughter to actually go to jail or be physically assaulted. I'll do the next best thing. Just do this at home.

456
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be deep down inside that both of them do know what's in your best interest, but it was too hard for them to take a look at their own behavior. Hold on.

457
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole over the next year 234 1020 however long it might be that you are the generation that takes a look

458
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you could be that same mom that rationalizes her little girl or little boy smoking at 11 years old at 10 years old.

459
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about how little your, your, so I

460
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.480
Nicole Roybal: Didn't think about that. Like I was still young.

461
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just a baby. Like for me, it's very hard. It's like hard because that's the heart now.

462
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:49.530
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

463
00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your body is a temple.

464
00:47:53.430 --> 00:48:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Know we put I gotta sneak in some healthy food, you've heard me touch on food. We've got to bodies this machine. We just treat it right and but your reference point is just so much rationalization that you grew up with.

465
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.820
Nicole Roybal: But then also. So a lot of my friends that

466
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:21.960
Nicole Roybal: Well, it's a couple of friends. I did grow up with that their parents were real strict on them. And they're like, No, you can't smoke and they'd have to like go around them and like I know it's like hide it from their parents and stuff.

467
00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:37.590
Nicole Roybal: I realized those strands. Once they turned 18 and they were out of their parents like claws. They went crazy and start taking pills and start drinking and just try to take everything because they never got to, I noticed, like every single one of them did that people

468
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know what's going on in those homes.

469
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.260
Nicole Roybal: That's true. See

470
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.280
This

471
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I cannot begin. You want to put a causal relationship between

472
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Firm parents result in people acting out and then they overdo it later.

473
00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It is the answer is not its opposite, the answer is, what's going on with that kid, what's going to work for that kid that family, you cannot see you're grasping at these extremes. It isn't how it works.

474
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole needed something you needed something you wanted to play volleyball. The money wasn't there. That sucks.

475
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.640
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, really good.

476
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that hurts.

477
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So we sit with that and had your mom been able to sort of say,

478
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe we'll come up with a plan. Maybe all this money that I'm spending on alcohol and we'd almost start any 1000 different scenarios could have happened.

479
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's go, let's go do some let's earn some money doing blah, blah, blah. It could have been a different solution.

480
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: To get sponsors, whatever.

481
00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.130
Nicole Roybal: I know you

482
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Aren't not disappointment.

483
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Around poverty. Right. That's a real thing.

484
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's real.

485
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.030
Um,

486
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That needed to be contained and held and validated and and for you to have said, this sucks. Instead what we got to see if I was there was this rage at. Let me out of here. Are you just need to get out of this House.

487
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And I get why

488
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be that house. You don't want to be what that is. You want to get out. You want to get to hope and and my life will be different and all these other things that are outside of this House.

489
00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:47.190
Nicole Roybal: There was a

490
00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Lot of good things that happened in that home. There was a lot of sacrifice and there was a lot of love. Okay. It was there too.

491
00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But the things that treatment asks clients to do is hard work. But if you because you give yourself a hard time on whatever your age is like, I can't see it right now. I have this expectation, I should be somewhere.

492
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:20.760
You're still stuck at this little 13 year old way of viewing the world.

493
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.810
Nicole Roybal: I think that's like I said before, I think that's why because like now that I'm

494
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:43.680
Nicole Roybal: Not sober. But now that I'm clean off alcohol. I'm seeing more clearly and I just feel like, like, yeah, like the 13 year old is now 27 and it's just like, whoa, wait. After they grow up right now. Like right now, if you get everything together.

495
00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't you don't

496
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:46.320
Nicole Roybal: Want

497
00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.800
Nicole Roybal: To do a final time. No.

498
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to do it all at once you do the, the ones that come right after each other, each each new thing that comes up in the current one is this one. It's

499
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't want to repeat what you've been doing in the prior generation, it will take some consciousness.

500
00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If you take the easy road.

501
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The one where you don't, you can use rationalization many, anybody can do that. We, you could say, oh, what's the difference between, you know, a Tylenol and marijuana or what's the difference. It's still medicine. Still, it's, you know, you can come up with all kinds of rationalizations

502
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You only need to do the next right thing and for you today. It's probably something like

503
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Detox from a shame. I don't know what labels, you're doing to yourself right now, not an option.

504
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going to get up. I'm going to

505
00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Eat something nutritious and make sure I'm hydrated. I'm going to go spend giving back to the people that I getting something back at these people need me. It's nice to feel needed. I'm going to go be over there. I'm going to help my grandparents that feels good.

506
00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.310
Nicole Roybal: Really does. So that's going to be needed.

507
00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all you need to do.

508
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to get all complicated. You're gonna be coming back here meeting with me on a regular basis will

509
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We get a little bit more solidification. I don't know what roller coaster your

510
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Boyfriend

511
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.250
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, you're

512
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's this little thing that's happening right now. This every, you know, I don't know yet. I'm gonna watch with you.

513
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But eventually you're going to feel strong enough that you're going to want to test out your confidence and volunteer or get a job. You're going to want to test it out. I'm guessing.

514
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:44.850
Nicole Roybal: Huh.

515
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then that's what we'll do. But you don't seem ready right now and that's fine.

516
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

517
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.500
Nicole Roybal: I want to be ready, folks. I need money.

518
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:59.040
Nicole Roybal: Within I don't want money. No, I think I'm pretty good at having money now.

519
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Only need today. Get up, go spend time with grandparents, you're, you're on the job. Now you're getting more and more conscious. Now you're already changing the trajectory of generations to come. By addressing this alcohol. Now you're already changing it so proud of that.

520
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.210
Nicole Roybal: And thank you.

521
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.160
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, hardware.

522
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And harder to no one can take that from, you know, one that's

523
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.040
Nicole Roybal: We know how hard it is

524
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.110
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

525
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's meet again.

526
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:38.100
This today is Wednesday.

527
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.540
Can we do

528
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 on February 28th.

529
00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't remember if that was good. What if we do it the other way around. You want to do it earlier like at nine on a Friday, since you're spending time over there, which would be better nine or 10

530
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:10.410
Nicole Roybal: Will Fridays. Actually I don't go over there because that's when my mom is able to go over there is 28 to Friday.

531
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.440
Nicole Roybal: Nine or 10 is or what I don't care.

532
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's make it

533
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's make it 10 o'clock. Okay.

534
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any medicine that you need me to kind of nudge the doctor about is it

535
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Connected to give you enough to get all the way to group.

536
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.200
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I have enough

537
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you did great. I did a lot of challenging with you today and you you really held on to yourself. Okay.

538
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.030
Nicole Roybal: Like I said, I always lose it. I like just go into this crazy story can't shut up.

539
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't go crazy story. You have a lot of stories. And actually, I do want to hear each one of those stories. Okay. I do want to hear them. They're there. And I want to hear them.

540
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's continue to unpack them I think next time. Again, I would like to unpack one and let's see if we can do some some decent aging around it.

541
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's do a little bit about technique together if you can. I like where you were seated today was kind of like really clear video

542
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see if we can get those two objects centered about shoulder width apart right on the left and right of your phone. And let's see if we can do some of the bilateral stimulation. Okay.

543
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, well, I'm excited about your day. So by the end of the week, we'll have a schedule for primary care physician. We've thought I'm helping grandparents out that's going to feel good.

544
00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've got a relationship with your boyfriend is kind of cruising along nicely. Those are nice things to look forward to.

545
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.630
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, actually content for the moment.

546
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:47.670
Nicole Roybal: Very nice.

547
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll meet again. Okay, I'll see

548
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:50.310
Nicole Roybal: You later.

549
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Howdy.

550
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:16.860
Erin S: Hi, how are you

551
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing well and yourself.

552
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:34.920
Erin S: Good. I've been frustrated. So I've been trying to figure out how to do zoom on my computer. And I think maybe have been looking in the wrong spot. How do I, how do I do it on my computer. I've been looking in the app store like I did on my phone, but I can't find it.

553
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see. Okay, I'll have to remember, I'm going to try and do it myself, because it's been a couple years.

554
00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I can do it. It's a great question.

555
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's become so automatic for me.

556
00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it though. I like your question. Let's see, we got

557
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is on a Macintosh and apple or different kind of PC.

558
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.130
Erin S: Yeah, it's a it's it's a

559
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.560
Erin S: Mac Book Pro.

560
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.260
Mac. How does it know that that

561
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:40.440
Erin S: Yeah, I was just looking on the internet because I couldn't find it in the app store, which is weird because that's where I found it on my phone.

562
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So listen, I just see. I don't know if this is it. We're kind of working it out here, but we're doing it together. I'll just kind of show you what I keep when I just popped up with was this guy.

563
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.850
Erin S: So let's see it so

564
00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's you. I think

565
00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's free sign in host a meeting. So if you join a meeting and you plug in my number. I wonder what would happen.

566
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a

567
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: zoom.us meetings is what I see up here.

568
00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.290
Erin S: https.us

569
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: backslash meetings, you know, it's HTTPS colon backslash

570
00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: backslash is right.

571
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:33.030
Erin S: See if it pops up. Yeah.

572
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.140
Erin S: Just curious backslash meetings, you said

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, here I'm look right at the top.

575
00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:52.020
Erin S: HTTPS. Yeah.

576
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To backslash zoom.us backslash meetings.

577
00:59:59.310 --> 00:59:59.730
Erin S: Okay.

578
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.880

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:38.790
Okay.

580
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.080
Erin S: Where did you see at the bottom and join a meeting or

581
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk. Go back to the top, you'll see, you see the zoom on the left and scroll over

582
01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:51.240
Erin S: And you'll see invited. Yeah.

583
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: See what happens if that if that opens up a box for the ID.

584
01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:04.290
Erin S: Number. It does that I can call you on that. Okay, let me try plugging in your meeting ID.

585
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And read it to 765 830-661-6132

586
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:21.360
Erin S: Okay.

587
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You might get a really awful beeping sound, you're going to want to get off that phone really fast. It'll hurt your ears, there'll be a reverberation. That happens of feedback.

588
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be prepared to jump out of there. You're going to go. So it's going to be this beeping

589
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.570
Erin S: It's downloading something first. I guess.

590
01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.660
Erin S: It's almost done downloading, I think.

591
01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna kind of go over to my database and open up a note, are you doing that.

592
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And I also for next of Tuesday I went ahead and put you back in that time spot before it disappears.

593
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:21.720
Erin S: Oh, thank you so much welcome at

594
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 o'clock on Tuesday.

595
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.730
Philip quick

596
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a good thing.

597
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.870
Erin S: Yep. Lots of people to help

598
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted

599
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you do take a picture of what you're seeing and text it to me. Maybe. Can I see which is happening for you. I don't know if I could, but

600
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:27.900
Erin S: I don't know if that works at all. I just turned around, um,

601
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.630
Erin S: It's i i think it. Well, I don't know why it won't let me press Continue here.

602
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe back all the way out and see if you need to set up an account first on there, or almost go to login. I

603
01:03:48.120 --> 01:04:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably have a password that you're using for your phone that you probably want to log in there. It's the same account when I am on my phone or my laptop or my, my home base computer. It's the same account.

604
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So you may actually we may have jumped the gun. We may have wanted to log in. First, you may want to drop out of there and just go back to it login

605
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.990
Erin S: Did that make. Okay. Something's happening. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. Um,

606
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.390
Erin S: It's changing sites. So something your meeting should start in a few seconds. It says it's connecting so

607
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:45.450
Erin S: It says connecting so hopefully it's connecting. Oh, yeah. Something's happening. Join with video just like on my phone.

608
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Prepared with the big noisy sound.

609
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, good. So we got to there. And then so you let me just get you in the room. I see you

610
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:05.430
Erin S: Okay, I'll leave, he here then. Okay. Sounds good. See you soon.

611
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So down at the bottom. You want to hit stop video and that should bring the video online.

612
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah,

613
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok ok let's check audio, video,

614
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:59.970
erinsmith: Can you hear me okay. Have you, I can hear you. Good. Okay, excellent. You hear me.

615
01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I can, and let's make a little adjustment only because today is very much me being able to see your eyes. You've got some backlighting going on. It might be nice to

616
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that a little bit.

617
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.560
erinsmith: Yeah, let me go somewhere a little darker. I'll just

618
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.840
erinsmith: Wait for the window.

619
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:24.450
erinsmith: Better

620
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what's funny is your, your videos better on your phone.

621
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:31.080
erinsmith: Interesting.

622
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you wouldn't think okay so this is what we'll do. I'm just gonna do a little bit of setup. I'm just going to show you share my screen with you just to get, get the eye, the eye movement part down

623
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do not want you to have eyestrain and it would be if you're you know how your eyes all the way over. That's too far. We want us

624
01:06:54.210 --> 01:07:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just nice and easy about a, you know, shoulder width apart. I'm going to show you this light, it shouldn't be too bad because you're going to be actually watching this light, and it's going to be no bigger than

625
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The width of your screen. You think this is about 15 inches. The screen.

626
01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.800
erinsmith: Yeah, okay.

627
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's just right. So is it taking up the whole screen.

628
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:18.990
erinsmith: Yep.

629
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're going to do a couple of things we're going to look at the speed. And there's a couple speeds. I do one of them slow this one slow

630
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, you don't need to see in between mostly just interested in getting all the way over to the left, all the way over to the right. That's a slow case for that's for sort of the

631
01:07:45.630 --> 01:08:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Integration the weaving in or installing typos or some of the words I might use but for desensitization. A little bit more uncomfortable because it's faster. Mm hmm. But you always can say, I'd like to stop.

632
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I find that really fast. Maybe we wanted to go that to that one go, one down.

633
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And just making sure the head doesn't move. It's just the eyes. You want to be right in the middle so that they the bilateral I movements happening.

634
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And

635
01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so uncomfortable that you won't want to do it and where it's strange. Does it feel like that's a good distance from the screen.

636
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think so. Okay. And so let's have a will have a. You can do this if let's say I'm continuing there's second surpassing and you don't like what's happening. You don't have to know why.

637
01:08:51.090 --> 01:09:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to stop you can you can always walk out the screen because, you know, always taking care of yourself okay don't have to do it.

638
01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do this. And a lot of times I'm looking at the bottom of my screen. And I'm watching the time because I want to put it at a set time

639
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But I can see out of the corner of my eye. If you did this and said, You need to stop. There are some times when let's say you're

640
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you're liking what's happening, you might be getting a memory or some little fragment of something that you haven't visited ever or for a while and you want to work your way through it. And you might say, keep going.

641
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because maybe I'm sorry, good for like 30 seconds or something less about what about how long they're not very long. Not long iterations.

642
01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm pretty sure you had said to me, You hadn't done FDR before or had you I can remember, help me remember

643
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.740
erinsmith: The just a little bit not too much. Got it.

644
01:09:52.950 --> 01:10:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so. Everyone's a little different. Mine has sort of this attachment focus piece to it. So you're going to hear me wanting to insert some positive imagery

645
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: During sort of the slower iterations in general. What it looks like is we'll do the bilateral stimulation will kind of get our, our target.

646
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative cognition in mind, you'll have this image. And that's the desensitization part and then what I'll say is, I'll say let's help together an exhale

647
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's your cue. You don't have to wait for me but I typically will say, Well, what's coming up for you. If you notice, you don't have to hear that. For me, that's what's next. It's

648
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are tuning to yourself and seeing what's coming up. Sometimes it's a heightened escalation. Sometimes it's a decrease. I'm interested in what the body feels

649
01:10:51.480 --> 01:11:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: With a mind what it says a belief and emotion, all of it. Interested interested interested is not one is better than the other. I'm curious about all of it.

650
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll feed what we do next, but they're going to be pretty short sort of comments and then I'll make a decision on kind of what to do next. And then we'll do another one each time. It's not our normal talk therapy thing. It's not back and forth talking

651
01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:15.900
erinsmith: I won't be doing any

652
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Analysis of it.

653
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want to get in your note here for a second.

654
01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me just check in with you just basically good week tough week what kind of equipment.

655
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:41.700
erinsmith: Um, I would say it's probably more of a tough week that a good week. Um, I definitely use the skills, more than I had been in the past.

656
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:49.470
erinsmith: And I did notice that when I was having kind of the toughest times a while I've been trying to practice the skills.

657
01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:58.920
erinsmith: It took me a few minutes to remember that that was something that I should have just done automatically. Instead of having, you know, panicking a little bit first.

658
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:08.790
erinsmith: Because I definitely spent probably five minutes in my head just honestly panicking a little bit before I remembered. Oh yeah, I have a skill for this.

659
01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Do you notice how you are an intelligent, highly educated woman right isn't let's take some respect for how powerful the threat response how powerful that is

660
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it is it is it will take over. It will persevere to keep you alive and Seiko cost it that's it's only job. It doesn't know nuance it justice keep her safe. That's danger keep her safe. That's danger.

661
01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's so powerful and we can, I think we need to just sort of be in awe of it.

662
01:12:52.290 --> 01:13:00.630
erinsmith: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Because, and I, but I was also kind of glad because in the past. I haven't necessarily remembered that I have skills for this.

663
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.010
erinsmith: And so it took a while. But I got there, and it was like, wait a minute. That's why I've been practicing these things.

664
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's right, practicing them in low stress situations so that when heavy hitters come we're ready and will remember and the trickiest part is the remembering actually

665
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So just a little review that's normal that's there's too much of a flood of the amygdala, it's cutting off the ability for the message to get all the way to the prefrontal cortex.

666
01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just getting cut off. So did you happen to use breath as one of your ways to to calm the body so that you could remember some more skills.

667
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:47.250
erinsmith: That was the first thing that I did was the breath. And then I tried doing the room.

668
01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.800
erinsmith: The room that we've created.

669
01:13:50.940 --> 01:14:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And how far did you get as far as being able to work through your panic in that room. Did you get in there, didn't, didn't fit for you what happened with that part.

670
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:07.920
erinsmith: No, it definitely fit. I got in there in it spent some time there.

671
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:14.400
erinsmith: Until I was feeling better, really, and then came back to the real world.

672
01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you went there as a refuge. It sounds until he felt better than came back out. Okay.

673
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:21.960
Yeah.

674
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So you didn't, I didn't hear you say that you went there felt better and worked it out. Okay, this is going to be my plan. These are my resources. Let me summon in, you know, what do I need to do to problem solve, I'll do it in here. So it was

675
01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:38.790
erinsmith: Okay.

676
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:39.330
Well,

677
01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:45.690
erinsmith: I guess I think I just, I went there until my brain started working again.

678
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:47.700
erinsmith: I guess wasn't really

679
01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:49.710
erinsmith: And then

680
01:14:51.120 --> 01:15:05.610
erinsmith: Once it slow down. I figured out. You know what I needed to do to address the situation, but I don't, I can't say that I figured that out in that room. I feel like mostly I was there just to make everything stop racing.

681
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like to do is

682
01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to hear if you don't mind, because oftentimes things that are being triggered current day have some link either to the past or to fear the future. They can be relevant. So may I hear a little bit about what the story is what got you to panic.

683
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:36.270
erinsmith: Yeah, they just goes back to my need to please people and worry about being kind of a perfectionist so

684
01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:44.250
erinsmith: I had a complaint at work, I had this dog a seven year old golden retriever who eats everything last weekend.

685
01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:59.220
erinsmith: Um, and she ate a couple rocks and um we did surgery on her. Um, and the rocks are actually pretty close to the colon. So I just moved them into the colon. Because once everything's in the colon, it'll come out.

686
01:16:00.450 --> 01:16:08.280
erinsmith: And I could feel it in the colon and I opened her stomach up anyway, just to make sure there wasn't a rock in there as well. There wasn't a rock in there.

687
01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:20.820
erinsmith: I didn't push the rocks all the way out through the colon because they had a little bit of a jagged edge and I didn't want to tear anything because then I have a dead dog.

688
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:31.890
erinsmith: Um, and so I just left them for her to kind of poop out naturally. And they, you know, didn't take an X ray afterwards to prove they were in the colon because

689
01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:39.360
erinsmith: I could feel them there. And I know they that's where they were they, I mean they were anywhere else it anyway, um, the dog did great.

690
01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:50.190
erinsmith: Went home the next day doing well, came back into a different fit five days later for vomiting again and had a rock in the stomach.

691
01:16:50.760 --> 01:17:00.720
erinsmith: I'm the owner was convinced that I had left a rock there and just was really upset that you know we didn't take it out and the dog ate another rock between the time I saw it in

692
01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:09.750
erinsmith: Surgery, but I can't prove it, because it was just me there. You know, I, there is an X ray from another vet.

693
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:30.720
erinsmith: After surgery that shows both rocks in the colon, but it's, I should have. I should have just pushed them all the way out and they anyway um I don't like I don't like getting complaints and I don't like when people get upset and you don't like feeling like I just wanted somebody. Mm hmm.

694
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't like the complaints and a perception of disappointing someone. How do you feel when you're around someone complaining and a perception that you disappointed them. What do you actually feel

695
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:51.390
erinsmith: Panicked

696
01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I need to know more about that panic. Where does it live. What happens to you.

697
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:20.370
erinsmith: Well, my brain starts to race my face gets really read and hot. Um, I feel like I can't breathe very well my breasts or less than my belly and more in my chest and really shallow. Um, it feels pain in my chest. It's all kind of up above the diaphragm where I feel it.

698
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hi.

699
01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:23.790
Okay.

700
01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Any presence of

701
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Dizziness

702
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:43.500
erinsmith: No, I don't think so. I definitely disassociate though. That's when I start to and honestly I don't always remember everything from them when I start to get panicky

703
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's a piece. So you're yeah you have that

704
01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got fully operational break and it breaks, maybe a little too hard.

705
01:18:56.490 --> 01:19:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You go into right like us, like the rest of us. We elevate the heart rate, I can't fight this person can't run. And so it breaks too hard, and then you go to this association go way into this almost a mobilization part and off you go.

706
01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're out of it.

707
01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, all right, I got you make sense. You got a very smart body friend take care of you.

708
01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

709
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

710
01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: My brain race.

711
01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm going to do. I'm just a couple little pieces of this and then I'm going to

712
01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Run out of the room for just 60 seconds.

713
01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now

714
01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let me check in and how you're doing right now. What does stress level are you at now 02 hundred

715
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:57.330
erinsmith: 30 not bad. Oh.

716
01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah 30 I think we can still think you can still think straight right now. Right.

717
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, excellent.

718
01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you noticing any awareness of increased tightness in the chest. Is it living there. Is it landing there. Is there anything going on in the upper part

719
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:34.020
erinsmith: A little bit. Luckily, I've had a little bit of time with this and work, you know, some stuff out. So it's not. And it's nice knowing exactly what I felt. You know what I so I don't feel like I'm making things up and trying to remember and can't so

720
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: you're noticing you're feeling productive right now. Is that right, yeah.

721
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me remind you there's no way to do this wrong.

722
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: For you perfectionist of mine.

723
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to remind it a lot.

724
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so tempting to want to please right neither good patient. Nope. I want you to be my worst. I want you to be my most difficult. Okay, you get all that wiggle room all of it.

725
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:14.640
Okay.

726
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a peek into

727
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That memory. It's not too far back, and this this week.

728
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Look underneath the racing thoughts and check and see what the belief about yourself was they're hard to find.

729
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just free associate just kind of hear your own voice talking until we land on one that seems like it's true.

730
01:21:51.750 --> 01:22:06.300
erinsmith: Well for me, I think it's that I feel like I am a phony, and I'm an addict and so I have no room to make mistakes. And if I do that, they're going to find out that I'm no good at this and they're not going to let me do this anymore.

731
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll take this thing that is your passion love this will take it away.

732
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What just pay attention to your body, see if anything landed with that.

733
01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:26.130
erinsmith: My shoulders slumped a bit

734
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's typically that were defeated goes with those slumped shoulders that what that was.

735
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

736
01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you've got some really nasty thoughts about yourself in there. Good golly, but so powerful that insight.

737
01:22:50.280 --> 01:23:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's amazing. You can find that that that phony part that labels a useful one. I want to do. I want to work with that I'm an addict. You've got a label. I'm a phony have an addict, they find out right. I don't have any room to make a mistake.

738
01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they'll take this thing. I love

739
01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll take it. It'll be taken from me.

740
01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very powerful ME CHECK IT ON HOW YOU DOING,

741
01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:21.060
erinsmith: I'm doing okay.

742
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.830
erinsmith: Okay, are we have three

743
01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Did it go up from 30

744
01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:28.620
erinsmith: Little bit like 42 that

745
01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I would invite you now while I

746
01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: go use the restroom really quick to get rid of some of this hydration gotta stay hydrated don't know if it's connected to my

747
01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.050
Vision.

748
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do some of the diaphragm matic breathing and I'd like you to visit visit your safe place what room that we developed while you're breathing.

749
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And just sort of hold that

750
01:23:57.390 --> 01:24:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That negative belief in there. See if it wants to stay in that room or maybe you want to leave it outside the door.

751
01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of using the mind breath.

752
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.980
The body.

753
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll be checking in with you and see how you're doing. See if there's a

754
01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Any production of distress.

755
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:44.580
erinsmith: Yeah, yeah, that always helps bit

756
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd also like to bring back up into awareness.

757
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All of your resources. I want them readily available and easily remembered so that we can

758
01:25:57.270 --> 01:26:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go there without invitation. You can just get a hold of them bring them into your awareness.

759
01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: As opposed to feeling helpless.

760
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: In the distress and having to

761
01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Be unconscious right having to dissociate that you have this other alternative

762
01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And

763
01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing in this awareness, maybe even in this room with the blue great bands little horses and the L and

764
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The grandmother Willow.

765
01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Just all of the pieces that you've actually developed from your creative mind in that room.

766
01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You are smart and you brought it all cohesively together.

767
01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any modification. Is there any change to these this team of of resource that I can write down that sounds like let's change this pretty much exactly the way I said it. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so

768
01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do first some

769
01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Some positive installing let's have a positive experience. In other words, we're going to these iterations are going to be really slow.

770
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I'd like to do is have you share screen here.

771
01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: May not get the instruction and all I'm ready.

772
01:27:53.970 --> 01:27:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring up those

773
01:27:56.850 --> 01:28:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Qualities of protection and nurturing and wisdom, bring them into your awareness. Make sure they match and land honestly and concurrently with your body.

774
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure they're very present with you.

775
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's just kind of have a nice slow

776
01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So just watching this light going left and right, but your work is to hold them in your awareness just really be present with the qualities of those protective nurturing and wise figures.

777
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Remembering also to freeze.

778
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together, have a nice nourishing inhale and then exhale it. You ready, letting it all go

779
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a sense of the quality of these

780
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Figures very present with them.

781
01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.160
Mm hmm.

782
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.810
erinsmith: Yeah.

783
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So the next piece. I'd like to do is I want to just do a little. I'm not going to do it for very long because I want to see.

784
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: See how you do

785
01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to do a little bit of the desensitization. So this one. So a little bit faster. I'm going to make the movement, a little quicker and you're going to be holding up

786
01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This incident that happened with the

787
01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The lab right that swallows of rocks is the worst part of it for you. You don't have to announce what it was just get that in your mind, the worst picture of it.

788
01:30:16.170 --> 01:30:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a phony. I'm an addict.

789
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like you to hold those in your awareness. This is desensitization. You're not going to hear you can do whatever you want. But do these two pieces at least pull up the worst piece first picture of that. And then I'm a phony. I'm an addict.

790
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to what

791
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Comes up for you, but try to hold them in your awareness.

792
01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A short one. Let's inhale together. Inhale.

793
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale together.

01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Go.

795
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

796
01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:27.210
erinsmith: Well, the thing that came up that hadn't come up before was trust so worrying that people aren't going to trust me.

797
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to go with that people, people aren't going to trust me. Hold that. Worst Picture that image in your mind, people won't trust me.

798
01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

799
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Mouth push it all out.

800
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and gentle.

801
01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to again.

802
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice

803
01:32:55.380 --> 01:33:03.810
erinsmith: So there's also some thoughts about how I don't trust other people either. Well, it all the time.

804
01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't

805
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't trust other people well at all. Really, especially at work. We're going to go with that pull up that WORST piece of course picture and I don't really trust other people, neither

806
01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing together nice inhale into that belly. Get that that error down in that belly.

807
01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale it out, push it all out very intentional.

808
01:34:12.450 --> 01:34:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing about consciousness.

809
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty noticing.

810
01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: To drift away.

811
01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:29.970
erinsmith: A little bit. Actually I drifted away from

812
01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:42.750
erinsmith: Well, I mean, because in the past, whenever I've made a mistake, it ends up really poorly. And so I just am terrified of making mistakes and then that makes me drift away a bit

813
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If I make a mistake, you will end up terrible

814
01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Me check in on that one a little bit

815
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a new. Is there a new

816
01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Story coming up for you. Is there a new memory that you're referencing

817
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:24.990
erinsmith: Yeah, just in the times of the times in the past when I've made mistakes in bad things happened.

818
01:35:27.450 --> 01:35:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: At work or elsewhere.

819
01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:31.830
erinsmith: At home, usually

820
01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:34.680
erinsmith: Not at work.

821
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the beliefs about yourself around this this memory.

822
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.970
erinsmith: That there's no room to make mistakes.

823
01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't make a mistake.

824
01:35:58.110 --> 01:36:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: One to 10 how absolutely 10 it's absolutely true. How true is that from one to 10 I can't make a mistake.

825
01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:11.040
erinsmith: Like a nine. Okay.

826
01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: In your home, whatever that image is that you're picturing

827
01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to believe about yourself.

828
01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:27.030
erinsmith: That mistakes are part of learning.

829
01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of person.

830
01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.470
Believes

831
01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That mistakes are part of learning. Wonder what I wonder what that person believes about herself.

832
01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.530
erinsmith: That she's free probably

833
01:36:47.730 --> 01:36:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Try on I'm free.

834
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Come true is that different scale one to seven sevens absolutely true. I'm free.

835
01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is that right now.

836
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:04.170
erinsmith: Three probably

837
01:37:10.170 --> 01:37:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm free hold that in your awareness. It says free hold it there.

838
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That that picture of there's some home memory. I made a mistake and it was terrible. That's your picture.

839
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what it is. But you get to hold it and I'm free.

840
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale together.

841
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Into that lower long, and then exhale. When you're ready, all of it out.

842
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, getting all that air out all the way to the bottom nice flat belly.

843
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a moment of quiet.

844
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to an inward.

845
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Using this insular part of the brain that knows how to look at itself.

846
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what comes up.

847
01:38:58.590 --> 01:39:02.970
erinsmith: That those two things seem contradictory, the memory of

848
01:39:06.330 --> 01:39:13.500
erinsmith: Mistakes ending poorly at home and being free. It just seems really country take on predicting children.

849
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Must

850
01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Add the presence of your team.

851
01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Close your eyes and be present with that quality.

852
01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If being in that room is the way the quickest way there.

853
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: With all of the qualities of protection.

854
01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Wisdom and nurturing

855
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you have that in your creative mind. Hold it there and we're going to visit this contradiction.

856
01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that picture that WORST piece.

857
01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am free.

858
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready, open your eyes.

859
01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot to do.

860
01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst image I'm free and surrounded by all of your resources.

861
01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

862
01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice if anything shifted in the body, pay attention to what went through your mind.

863
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And the emotions just turning inward.

864
01:41:35.730 --> 01:41:48.300
erinsmith: I imagined using that one. Did the room to turn the memory into a bubble and popping it and then I felt free and more relaxed. It worked quite well.

865
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Can let's keep that going. I'm going to just slow this down a little bit want you to go with that.

866
01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: first picture.

867
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with what you just did.

868
01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Prays together through the nose deep belly breath.

869
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

870
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go

871
01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you finding now.

872
01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:11.040
erinsmith: Feel much lighter and more in power, I guess, more in control.

873
01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:16.500
erinsmith: That I can just turn something like that and do away with it.

874
01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it I'm free from one to seven seven is absolutely true.

875
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:30.330
erinsmith: I probably go with like a five and a half six 5.5

876
01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.230
To six

877
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn now to your imagination and turn to your, your resource figures.

878
01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if there's something that they can do to add to your confidence right to the, the truth of I'm free. See if they have something maybe you'll notice there's one you want to ask or

879
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see what comes up for you if you were going to access

880
01:44:01.650 --> 01:44:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The qualities of this resource team.

881
01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone knows something, what's

882
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How can we use these resources.

883
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Like to hear a little bit of your stream of consciousness, what are you

884
01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: As running through your mind.

885
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:41.370
erinsmith: Well, I can hear the owl kind of saying that it's just in the past, and it's not real anymore.

886
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:43.770
erinsmith: Which is helpful.

887
01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:51.480
erinsmith: And I Great Dane is always there to be protective. If anything,

888
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:55.860
erinsmith: At home ever happens again.

889
01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.600
erinsmith: That's pretty much what

890
01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We're

891
01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: wanting you to evolve, develop and grow.

892
01:45:23.130 --> 01:45:23.160
erinsmith: I

893
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:31.200
erinsmith: Think they wanted me to be a little bit more gentle with myself and understand that mistakes are going to happen.

894
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Who amongst them.

895
01:45:37.050 --> 01:45:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Is congruent.

896
01:45:40.890 --> 01:45:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: absolutely does.

897
01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And says the same thing.

898
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: No hypocrisy.

899
01:45:58.710 --> 01:45:59.460
erinsmith: All of them.

900
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one would you like to ask about

901
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you learn

902
01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: About learning in a gentle way.

903
01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:26.100
erinsmith: Horses

904
01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You ask in order to get that information they they've lived it. They know how to do it.

905
01:46:41.670 --> 01:46:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To ask them what's pocket. You get that information, somehow.

906
01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:54.060
erinsmith: I guess you could ask them, how do you forgive yourself.

907
01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to use that one.

908
01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So, open your eyes.

909
01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you forgive yourself. Once you picture sort of asking that. And that WORST piece.

910
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: With the dog or at home. My apologies. I think it was at home I were working with either one.

911
01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you forgive yourself.

912
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That negative image worse picture.

913
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

914
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go

915
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What's happening for you.

916
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:48.390
erinsmith: Relaxed Laura at ease more accepted against

917
01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: more relaxed more accepted.

918
01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that matching

919
01:48:55.170 --> 01:48:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The body, are they

920
01:48:58.020 --> 01:48:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In congrats.

921
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:13.050
erinsmith: Yeah. They are my diaphragm feels relaxed. I feel like I can get the air into my belly pretty easily my hand. Nothing's clenched everything. Everything feels for you.

922
01:49:15.210 --> 01:49:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take this this bit of time right at the end. This pacified quite quickly and kind of walk back through the memory, just from this session and

923
01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: See what remains as far as what was important for you.

924
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: To happen here today.

925
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:51.840
erinsmith: Or me. I think it was orient to be less judgmental both of myself and others. Um, and more accepting of mistakes.

926
01:49:58.950 --> 01:50:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's something you thought about before. I wonder what's different about today. He thinks different

927
01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:19.260
erinsmith: Feels more real, I guess. Um, it feels like there's a way of doing that now. Whereas before it was just acknowledging it

928
01:50:23.190 --> 01:50:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you actually do forgiveness today, or did you get close to it. Did you do. Did you forgive

929
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:41.880
erinsmith: I think I got close to it. I think I forgave the what happened. You know what the dog. I'm

930
01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:45.360
erinsmith: And I'm working on anything.

931
01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

932
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Little face.

933
01:50:51.930 --> 01:50:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Gold tongue.

934
01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know,

935
01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So forgiveness is a piece of a progressive healing, it's, it's something you've known intellectually

936
01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But was maybe reserved for other people. But you, you just need to be perfect.

937
01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you're you've dipped your little toe into

938
01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's possible for you to

939
01:51:22.530 --> 01:51:22.860
erinsmith: Yeah.

940
01:51:24.810 --> 01:51:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to continue what we're doing and pick up around this concept of forgiveness. And let me just check in with you and see

941
01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything still charged left in the body right now.
