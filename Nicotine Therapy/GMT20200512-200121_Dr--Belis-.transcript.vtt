21
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.070
Eric McDermid: And then after that I went to my primary care physician to get the prescription

22
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.850
Okay.

23
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.930

Dr. Belis Aladag: That we're supposed to look at before we prescribe anything control right we're kind of mandated to do that. So I kind of check that out for you and it looked like. Yeah. Dr. Ann Handley or Haney and it's like the last one. He gave you was August of 2019

28
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.380

30
00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:04.920
Eric McDermid: Prescribed Suboxone eight milligrams four times a day instead of the subtext eight milligrams, two times a day. And that just made me extremely uncomfortable.

31
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. Clean your dose.

32
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.300

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Correct instead of twice a day, you're doing four times a day.

34
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.360
Eric McDermid: Not. No, I don't. I only ever did two pills a day at the maximum

36
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.210

38
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.040

39
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:55.470
Eric McDermid: Okay, which he raised the dose to four pills a day, as well as gave me a prescription for Ambien 10 milligrams of 30 count. Okay, I just made me extremely, extremely uncomfortable so I never went back to him and I, I've just been living off off.

Eric McDermid: At the age of 10 I started on just

66
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:29.040
Eric McDermid: I went through the wringer from the age of 10 to 16 with psychiatric drugs, just trying to see what what would help.

67
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.930
Eric McDermid: And unfortunately, every medication, kind of just left me worse off than I was, or just kind of neutral.

68
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like antidepressants, or what what kinds of

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.480
Eric McDermid: off label medications.

71
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.270
Eric McDermid: I think I tried over I think she showed me a list of over 35 plus psychiatric medications.

72
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.560
Oh Lord, I went

73
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:09.840
Eric McDermid: A couple months ago I went went in there just kind of begging for psychiatric medication. And she said, You know, I'm willing to prescribe

74
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:19.380
Eric McDermid: A psychiatric medication. I just don't think that's something that didn't work. Five years ago, it will magically start working. But if you would like to try

75
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: We can try.

76
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.050
Eric McDermid: We'll give it a shot.

77
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: I this is Dr.

78
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.110
Eric McDermid: Greg zolty

79
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.110
Eric McDermid: It didn't really work out.

80
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:39.540
Eric McDermid: Yeah, I tried to fix it didn't work out. It ended up giving me more mood swings kind of made my rapid cycling even more rapid

81
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:49.140
Eric McDermid: Okay, and then we tried Murtaza pain Rimmer on which was one of the medications that are responding somewhat decently to as a child.

82
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

83
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.060
Or adolescent

84
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.870
Eric McDermid: And that one just didn't work out. It was giving me really bad temperature and sensitivities.

85
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.770
Eric McDermid: As well as making my nerve pain, where I had shingles.

86
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:15.150
Eric McDermid: And where the shingles were on my neck and my ear, which is giving me shooting pains again. So I stopped that. And now we're trying blue box.

87
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Blue Box. Correct.

88
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:33.570
Eric McDermid: And with the dosing we she's doing it as if I'm basically a toddler okay but I get a 25 milligram tablet break it in half and then break that half and half. And that would be my dose like

89
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: A six something six milligrams

90
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:43.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, very small dose because she doesn't want you to have a reaction fix that. Okay.

91
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:52.350
Eric McDermid: I don't know if you've heard of. She did a liver enzyme test for I think CYP to d six

92
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.250
Uh huh.

93
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.770
Eric McDermid: And

94
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:06.750
Eric McDermid: It stated that since I was on Adderall, the time that if I were to consume cocaine that I would metabolize Adderall more efficiently.

95
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:20.130
Eric McDermid: As well as it gave her a huge list of medications that said that I would more than likely have adverse reactions to which it was just like a list of all psychiatric medications and

96
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: I say, oh,

97
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.680
Eric McDermid: Yeah, I'm not the best metabolize or

98
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:35.820
Eric McDermid: I, if I recall. She said one of the wheels is firing up 25% and the other illegal does not firing at all.

99
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:59.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. So your jeans. There was a genetic check that she did and that that sign a Chrome society Chrome P for 50. Yeah, it's like a thing that helps. It's a something that breaks down different medications or things in the body. So I see. So yours is not very strong or

100
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:07.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Expressed much so therefore you are more sensitive, you don't metabolize drugs to all correct

101
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Slow breakdown of medications. I got you.

102
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so that's good to know. Um,

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now,

104
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:35.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's see. Okay, so this is Dr. Brennan, right, she's managing all this. Okay, so she's that's, I mean, I'm glad that you have somebody that you trust that knows you and like knows all the different 35 meds trying

105
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.380
Eric McDermid: To yeah it was

106
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.980

139
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: It feels why. Yeah.

140
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Why, yeah.

141
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.580
Eric McDermid: Folsom. It's okay.

142
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.160
Eric McDermid: There's. Everybody drives like they're the most entitled person in the world.

143
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.660
Eric McDermid: I don't, I don't like that. The traffic's not the best.

144
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:50.220
Eric McDermid: People are kind of a holes when they're driving. So it could be better, but it could also be worse.

145
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:58.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, that's cool. Okay, so I see. And then what about your dad. You haven't mentioned. Your father is he

146
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.960
Eric McDermid: Around he is

147
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:15.900
Eric McDermid: I don't know how to categorize him, he, he does, he's an opiate addict for sure he, I don't know how he is currently getting an oxy code and prescription. He was flagged for Dr. Shopping.

148
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.420
Eric McDermid: I want to say around 2013 roughly. Okay.

149
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: But he's still managing to do

150
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:33.690
Eric McDermid: Correct. Yes. Wow. You had a I believe a back surgery, as well as a knee replacement surgery. Quite a while ago.

151
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.350
Eric McDermid: And I think he's just been milking

152
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.150
Eric McDermid: Since I mean

153
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.120
Eric McDermid: Everything he can unfortunately

154
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: did hit the action start after those surgeries, you think, or you don't know

155
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:55.200
Eric McDermid: Much or I would say before I've asked my mother and she said that he's always kind of been fucked up, excuse my language, you always kind of been fucked up and

156
00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.880
Eric McDermid: She's always known him to be on something. Okay.

157
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: So he's not in the house or

158
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.470
Eric McDermid: No, he lives in Sacramento.

159
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:12.810
Eric McDermid: He lives in Sacramento. It's probably about a 15 minute ride from Roseville about a 30 minute ride from Folsom

160
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.810
Eric McDermid: That's actually how my addiction started is

161
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:28.290
Eric McDermid: My oldest brother, Neil. He would steal handfuls of my dad was getting prescribed morphine.

162
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.520
Eric McDermid: Eight milligram

163
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.570
Eric McDermid: And hydrocodone 10 milligrams

164
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:42.270
Eric McDermid: And I mean, big, big bottles probably 360 counts.

165
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god.

166
00:16:44.460 --> 00:17:00.000
Eric McDermid: And I just remember the first time I ever took opiates. I remember seeing a Ziploc bag like that filled with like the morphine 15 and 30s and the hydrocodone and allotted that's probably about 10 and I took a just a handful

167
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.920
Eric McDermid: And we went to the bookstore borders. I remember getting a Jamba Juice and walking around and getting nauseous.

168
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:21.300
Eric McDermid: And having to go into the bathroom and throw up. And I was kind of like, Man, I don't, I don't know why they have seen my dad and brother take these pills and don't get why they taken with. They just throw make you want to throw up and it just, it really bad.

169
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:31.170
Eric McDermid: So I stopped for I stopped for like two weeks didn't really think about it and then went back and

170
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:50.070
Eric McDermid: Took another handful and that time felt great. And then it started out as like every other weekend type deal because I would go to my mom's for one week or stay with my mom her weekend one weekend then stay with through the week and then the next weekend would be my dad's weekend.

171
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: So whenever it was dad's

172
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.740
Eric McDermid: Yeah. And then I was pretty much just had full access to the narcotics.

173
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.420
Eric McDermid: Sins that he had

174
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Since since you were 10 years old.

175
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:11.040
Eric McDermid: Correct. Wow. And I developed a dependency by the age of 12

176
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:27.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: And did anyone at between those years figure this out. Like, did your mom. No. Did you say anything. Were you having any other consequences. Besides, you know you acting weird during

177
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:35.730
Eric McDermid: When you were. It took about a year, year and a half for her to figure for to figure it out as well for my dad even figured out

178
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.770
Eric McDermid: It was once I, as well as my other brothers both started just dumping handfuls of pills and

179
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.880
Eric McDermid: That took about a year and a half for my father to figure it out.

180
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:57.240
Eric McDermid: Any year now for my mom to figure it out. At which point, she told my dad that he needed to to lock up all of his medications.

181
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:09.780
Eric McDermid: In a lock box and his solution was to get a basically like a pistol case with the padded phone and he just put his pill bottles in there. So for about another year.

182
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.860
Eric McDermid: He kept the pills in unlock box until

183
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:24.840
Eric McDermid: He switched to his gun safe, which made it a little bit hard the gun safe was in the pantry in the kitchen, and he had his key, the key on his ring.

184
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.700
Eric McDermid: But that didn't stop my brother and I, when he would be nodding out

185
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:43.200
Eric McDermid: Sometimes you I wouldn't even have to go to the gun safety. There were literally where he would just sit and watch TV. I mean, sometimes there would be a good like five to 10 pills, just under the under a seat.

186
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.050
Eric McDermid: But we would

187
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:55.230
Eric McDermid: We would wait till he nodded out or fell asleep in rock, paper, scissors to who's going to army crawl and get grabbed his keys.

188
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:57.840
Eric McDermid: Yeah.

189
00:19:58.770 --> 00:19:59.700
Oh, wow.

190
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.580
Eric McDermid: So I want to say.

191
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:10.590
Eric McDermid: I was probably 14 and my mom was taking him to court for child support because he never ever paid it.

192
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:25.650
Eric McDermid: And I remember my mom making me write down a list of all the medications that I had access to at the time. And I remember going in front of a judge and telling the judge.

193
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:36.090
Eric McDermid: You know, this is a list of medications. I have access to and have taken before, you know, blah, blah, blah. It's not a good situation.

194
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.700
Eric McDermid: To which at that point.

195
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.870
Eric McDermid: Everything pretty much stayed the same.

196
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.430
Eric McDermid: We still continue to go over there every other weekend.

197
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:57.720
Eric McDermid: And the pills are still locked up in the gun safe, which made it a little bit harder to get to them.

198
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: But not if you pass out which you did. You did. You know, so there was still you still had access to it.

199
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.820
Eric McDermid: Yes.

200
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:15.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: You still so between. So between age 10 and 12 you said it was like every other weekend you develop this kind of dependency, you said, and by

201
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:20.130
Eric McDermid: Correct by 13 I was taking them every day. I

202
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:33.390
Eric McDermid: I had to, or else I would get sick and I didn't really know. You know, I didn't know about opiate dependence at 13 I just knew, you know, I feel like crap. If I don't if I don't take these pills.

203
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god, that's so crazy. So, okay, by 13 you're taking them daily

204
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:58.950
Eric McDermid: Daily 1414 I'm in middle school and this girl. She's hounding me all day. I have a headache. I have a headache. Can I have a Viking Viking. And finally, I'm just like, here's here's, here's a Viking and please shut up. I'm actually trying to do my schoolwork, for once,

205
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.500
Eric McDermid: About three hours later.

206
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.510
Eric McDermid: One of the

207
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:12.720
Eric McDermid: Like playground security guards comes and gets me and says, you know, hey, we're going to the principal's office. What forward. I think you know what I had no idea.

208
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.140
Eric McDermid: I walk into the principal's office.

209
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:25.470
Eric McDermid: There's a police officer police officer and the principal. He told me to put my backpack on the table in to strip down to my underwear.

210
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:32.340
Eric McDermid: Oh my god, I had probably a gram marijuana and about six biking in on me.

211
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:33.300
Well,

212
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.940
Eric McDermid: So ended up getting a felony for the pills.

213
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.510
Eric McDermid: And I was put on probation for, I think, six. Six months know a year.

214
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.450
Eric McDermid: Probation for a year.

215
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow.

216
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.530
Eric McDermid: So that kind of slowed down my usage at 14

217
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.130
Eric McDermid: So I would only do it a couple times a month.

218
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.850
Eric McDermid: Because I had to get your analysis on it.

219
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:13.140
Eric McDermid: But then when that was over. It was right back to stealing my dad's medication, as well as my brother had

220
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.430
Eric McDermid: Found a dealer for oxy cotton 80s.

221
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.560
Eric McDermid: And he was just buying them by the fistfuls

222
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:32.190
Eric McDermid: And I remember talking to my brother for like two weeks, he was like, I'd really like I really want you to try this oxycodone, but I don't want you getting addicted.

223
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.280
Eric McDermid: You know, if we do, we do. We're going to do this. And that way, blah, blah, blah.

224
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thinking, he can be safe.

225
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:41.640
Yeah.

226
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: This is the only brother, Neil.

227
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.200
Correct.

228
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:52.410
Eric McDermid: Anyway, so I tried the OC with him for the first time. Amazing.

229
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.460
Eric McDermid: Because snorted 40 milligram

230
00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.540
Eric McDermid: And with no tolerance, at the time, but put me on my ass.

231
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.710
Eric McDermid: And then a couple weeks later.

232
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:16.500
Eric McDermid: He would just, I would wake up and he would go to work and he would leave me like a crushed up at underneath his TV every day for about two years.

233
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you're going to school, this whole time. Where you going to

234
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:29.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Correct, yes. So you finishing high school, but you're like high every day, you're taking this stuff. Wow.

235
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:44.130
Eric McDermid: So that lasted till about 1616 1717. It was a good two years of free drugs from him, as I remember.

236
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.630
Eric McDermid: And then the op formulation came out.

237
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.180
Eric McDermid: And Roxy code own and every form of oxycodone was just getting too expensive.

238
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.940
Eric McDermid: I remember trying

239
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.160
Eric McDermid: He went to go grab some pills. They didn't have pills, but they had heroin.

240
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.480
Eric McDermid: Or a 20 bag of heroin and

241
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:16.560
Eric McDermid: I just remember he got home with it. And we've sat there and smoked it for like 40 minutes. It just went on forever. It seemed like

242
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.690
Eric McDermid: And after that it was kind of like, you know,

243
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:29.700
Eric McDermid: will still get the scenes where where we can for okay price, but I think Aaron's the way to go on this one.

244
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.710
Eric McDermid: So we started smoking it very consistently.

245
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.990
Eric McDermid: At the age of 17

246
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.050
Eric McDermid: And then about two months later.

247
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.910
Eric McDermid: Because my cousin as well. He, he was about

248
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.540
Eric McDermid: I want to say three or four years older than my brother.

249
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.390
Eric McDermid: He was also using with us as well. When we started using heroin.

250
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.810
Eric McDermid: He was around pretty much every time we smile.

251
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:09.390
Eric McDermid: I can't remember. Whose idea was, I think it was mine actually to go grab some needles.

252
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.740
Eric McDermid: And went to the pharmacy got some needles.

253
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.860
Eric McDermid: Kind of looked up some YouTube videos to try and get an idea and

254
00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: injected via

255
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:29.280
Eric McDermid: Injected it and it just got worse from there. I mean you know the story.

256
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:37.470
Eric McDermid: It was basically Fox smoking it shooting is a lot more cost effective.

257
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:40.830
Eric McDermid: So, yeah.

258
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:52.020
Eric McDermid: Yeah, that cousin that used with us. He's now deceased from from using

259
00:26:53.790 --> 00:27:07.320
Eric McDermid: Yet to get a heart transplant from shooting drugs and they told him, you know, if you go and shoot drugs. After his heart transplant, you have a week, two weeks tops tops to live.

260
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:16.800
Eric McDermid: And probably about five days after the surgery. I think he did a couple injections and a week later, he was gone. Oh.

261
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, wow.

262
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow.

263
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.830
Eric McDermid: I think I was at the age of 18

264
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: You were 18 when that happened to him.

265
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.500
Via

266
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow.

267
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.460
Eric McDermid: So,

268
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: He started with you guys. Yes.

269
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.470
Eric McDermid: started shooting with us.

270
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:52.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then he ended up in that state. So where were you at 18 then were you still using despite all this stuff happening to him and

271
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.940
Eric McDermid: Yeah, so I was still using it and

272
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.740
Eric McDermid: One of my

273
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.120
Eric McDermid: Excuse me, one of my brothers older older friends had moved out.

274
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:13.770
Eric McDermid: So my brother had a friend that he went to high school with, and then he moved off to Arizona for a couple years. And then he came back and he was into heroin.

275
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:22.200
Eric McDermid: So I remember he met up with my brother and I, and then it was just like him. And I just started

276
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:25.170
Eric McDermid: Oh,

277
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're on mute.

278
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:30.960
Eric McDermid: Can you hear me.

279
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now I can hear you, said he, you are hanging out with him.

280
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.430
Eric McDermid: So his friend and I started hanging out and just kind of using every day.

281
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:50.820
Eric McDermid: And he had a license in a car. So he was my means of transportation to get to Sacramento or Rancho Cordova to get this stuff.

282
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.820
Eric McDermid: And that lasted

283
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.800
Eric McDermid: Probably I think Tom was 19

284
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:08.430
Eric McDermid: And then I remember in 2016 and December eight, on December 18

285
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.560
Eric McDermid: I went in to Dr. Len Morrow and

286
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.460
Eric McDermid: Got on paper Dorking treatment.

287
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:26.190
Eric McDermid: I remember going in and you know he asked me what opioids opiates. I was on at the time and told him methadone and heroin.

288
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.210
Eric McDermid: He said, you know, with the methadone. We're gonna have to wait.

289
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.550
Eric McDermid: 48 to 72 hours before the first dose of buprenorphine.

290
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.380
Eric McDermid: Yeah. And he said,

291
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:50.130
Eric McDermid: If he said if I was you. And in your area able to obtain it. I would get some morphine and dose that for a day or two and then

292
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:57.090
Eric McDermid: Stop at night. And then the next day, you should be able to dose of buprenorphine.

293
00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.580
Eric McDermid: So that's what I did.

294
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.580
Eric McDermid: I went out and got some morphine.

295
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:10.680
Eric McDermid: And took that for a day and then the next day I started to be in treatment. Okay.

296
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:17.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: That was 2017 2016 16 and you were how

297
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: I believe 1919 okay

298
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you're 19, something like that. Okay.

299
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.030
Eric McDermid: Yeah.

300
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:32.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then 2016 then you got on The View. Did you stay sober, or were you using still or will. How did that.

301
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.030
Eric McDermid: I've had about

302
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.060
Eric McDermid: In the last five years, I've had about three slip ups.

303
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.350
Eric McDermid: I had a slip up the first

304
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:48.870
Eric McDermid: Within the first three months, I think it was the second month of treatment and I broke down into the shop.

305
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.700
Eric McDermid: Of heroin.

306
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.210
Eric McDermid: And I went back to Dr. Morrow and let them know you know i i fucked up.

307
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.340
Eric McDermid: To which at that point.

308
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.850
Eric McDermid: I, I just let them know you know like

309
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.040
Eric McDermid: This this Suboxone is working, but I'm still having cravings.

310
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:20.040
Eric McDermid: And when I hit it gives me. It's given me a headache and making my blood pressure, blood pressure, very erratic.

311
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.050
Eric McDermid: To it at that point he

312
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.400
Eric McDermid: Suggested that we switched to savvy Tex.

313
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.280
Eric McDermid: No oxygen could be causing the headaches and the blood pressure sensitivity.

314
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.170
Eric McDermid: Perhaps because

315
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:44.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Especially because now you're saying about the enzyme thing. I mean, some people are sensitive, it's

316
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:57.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Possible. I suppose I used to be kind of a skeptic about that because of the thing, but I'm starting to see that it's not just one offs like there are people that really are sensitive, so you must be one of those

317
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:06.120
Eric McDermid: Yeah, because with this with the Suboxone I have to dose double the dose that I do have said the text to get the same the same effect.

318
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.080
So let me

319
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:08.910
Eric McDermid: Know,

320
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:23.340
Eric McDermid: Yeah, so he switched me to the subtext. He said, hopefully, it should take care of the headaches and the blood pressure, as well as it should. It should be cheaper through your insurance.

321
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.980
Eric McDermid: Okay so started that

322
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.930
Eric McDermid: Worked pretty good still having cravings here and there.

323
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:39.600
Eric McDermid: And then I had my wisdom teeth extracted. I can't remember the exact year

324
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:46.380
Eric McDermid: I want to say 2018 2017 maybe

325
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.590
Eric McDermid: No excuse me to 2016 and 2017

326
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.590
Eric McDermid: And I remember they gave me I think Tylenol sixes.

327
00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:04.950
Eric McDermid: For the pain and it just wasn't covering it. So I went out and bought some morphine and some oxy codeine

328
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.160
Eric McDermid: And I would just

329
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:18.510
Eric McDermid: Basically dose, the morphine and oxy codeine, how they told me to dose. The Tylenol and coding

330
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:35.700
Eric McDermid: So that happened. I felt insanely guilty for a good three weeks before I came clean to Dr. Morrow and let them know you know I didn't just take the Tylenol with codeine, I went out and I got morphine and oxycodone

331
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.930
Eric McDermid: So I let him know that

332
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.200
Eric McDermid: And he wasn't really too mad at me.

333
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.520
Eric McDermid: He was more

334
00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.080
Eric McDermid: I guess just happy that I was open and honest with him about it.

335
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, of course. Yeah.

336
00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:56.070
Eric McDermid: So it went over surprisingly well. Which I didn't think it would

337
00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.550
Eric McDermid: So I was the second one, then the third one.

338
00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.210
Eric McDermid: It's been so long.

339
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's good.

340
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:05.940
Eric McDermid: I remember

341
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.360
Eric McDermid: I remember I slipped up and smoking. Smoking heroin.

342
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.330
Eric McDermid: With my brother.

343
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:21.930
Eric McDermid: And I went back, I had an appointment. The next month, and I, I let him know that appointment that I slipped up

344
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.580
Eric McDermid: And that I was just

345
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.570
Eric McDermid: I let the cravings, get the best of me.

346
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:32.880
Eric McDermid: And I just

347
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.710
Eric McDermid: caved in.

348
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:43.590
Eric McDermid: And that was the last time that I've ever used real opiates pretty. Yeah, I've been on

349
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:51.510
Eric McDermid: Subjects in Suboxone pretty much ever since that appointment that day except for those three slip ups.

350
00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:54.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, got it. Okay.

351
00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:02.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you were saying cravings. I mean those slip ups. I wonder if they were

352
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:14.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Also because of, like, were you triggered because of circumstance, like the loan dear brother. Maybe he was around and he was telling you stuff. You know what I mean. So not necessarily that

353
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:22.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Left alone taking your medication as directed, maybe you wouldn't necessarily have cravings. It's just that when

354
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.400
Eric McDermid: He was, I think it was

355
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:37.590
Eric McDermid: More this situation that I was surrounded by yeah i mean i'm still surrounded by the city, those kinds of situations today. I mean, my brother will come to my house to hang out and I know he has

356
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.890
Eric McDermid: Probably 15 grams plus on them.

357
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:42.480
Eric McDermid: But

358
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:51.510
Eric McDermid: I just don't I just try not to put myself. I just try and I try not to ask him as much as possible about this stuff.

359
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.400
Eric McDermid: Unless he brings it up.

360
00:35:54.180 --> 00:36:00.660
Eric McDermid: And starts talking about it and then I'll talk about it for a couple minutes in this turn shut it down because yeah

361
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.700
Eric McDermid: You don't want to talk about it. The

362
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.680
Eric McDermid: Higher they're just go

363
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:05.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

364
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.980
Eric McDermid: In the faster the thoughts. Yeah.

365
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah yeah

366
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.270
Eric McDermid: But I've gotten pretty damn good about

367
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.070
Eric McDermid: Not letting his presence affect my state of mind.

368
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. So glad

369
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.670
Eric McDermid: It's there's definitely been hard hard to do.

370
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.400
Eric McDermid: Especially since it's my own brother.

371
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you, I'm sure you're worried about him. Did he

372
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.500
Eric McDermid: Always 24 seven

373
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:45.330
Eric McDermid: I'm always scared that I'm not on because he's overdose three times and each time I was at our family house and I was there to network and so I'm always nervous. I'm just not going to get an arcane

374
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.480
Eric McDermid: Okay.

375
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:56.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: So did he ever you sought help in 2017. Did he also seek help, or he just wasn't interested or

376
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:09.480
Eric McDermid: He so he seek help for methadone treatment for about six months, but that was mainly to please my mom and definitely not for foreign cell.

377
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:16.740
Eric McDermid: So that last six months and then he just got back on the painkillers.

378
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:17.820
Yeah.

379
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well I hope you can

380
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: find his way out of that, you know, yeah.

381
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.410
Eric McDermid: Me too.

382
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, he knows you're in recovery.

383
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: He knows you taking this medication, this whole time. Right.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.820
Yeah.

387
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:46.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your other brother. He used to have a problem. But you said he's he's been okay for two years, right, or three years.

388
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.930
Eric McDermid: Correct, yes. About two and a half, three years.

389
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is he on something, as well as the answer.

Eric McDermid: With my brother Kyle, a couple times a month just to

Eric McDermid: Pretty fucking excuse me pretty damn privilege with what I have

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.550
Eric McDermid: And it's just a great reality check. Yeah, when I need it.

398
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you do that once in a while.

399
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow. What a story.

Eric McDermid: Anything. No, I finished school in

403
00:38:53.220 --> 00:39:08.580
Eric McDermid: I want to say 2017 I went to. I didn't graduate normal high school, I had to go to an adult ed program, which I got my dim only needed think 20 credits. So I just did the 20 credits and got my high school diploma.

404
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:21.000
Eric McDermid: And after that I laid around for about six months before I before I was just so tired linger on every day that I had to go out and get a job.

405
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.110
Eric McDermid: So I started working at Starbucks.

406
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.970
Eric McDermid: Probably for about a year. Okay.

407
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:41.550
Eric McDermid: And then I I met my girlfriend on the internet. And I went, I flew to Florida to visit her for two weeks. Oh.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:48.090
Eric McDermid: About two months later I ended up moving to Florida.

442
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.350
Eric McDermid: Not the easiest

443
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:41.730

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gradually, everything's kind of up in the air right now.

447
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.540

453
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:38.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: But if

454
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.200

457
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:57.030
Eric McDermid: I guess you just, you go to school for about 10 months and study and learn everything and then

458
00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.040
Eric McDermid: They let you go on the job.

459
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.160

Dr. Belis Aladag: It's something can train to do well and carefully that's

463
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.900
Eric McDermid: I love it. I love adrenaline surging, things like that.

464
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.720

465
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:22.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: good fit.

466
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.050
Eric McDermid: I guess we'll see when I actually get up there.

467
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:30.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you need sunscreen and a hat. You know, because you're always up in the sun.

468
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.450
Eric McDermid: Yeah, getting smacked by branches and

469
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:40.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, that too. Okay. Well, I like that. At least you have like some thought of. Okay, maybe I want to do some

470
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:50.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Little yeah yeah it's a thought, okay, and then the bipolar disorder. Do you feel like right now it's kind of well controlled or have

471
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:50.940
Eric McDermid: Yes.

472
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Recent manic episode or a depressive episode.

473
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:56.970
Eric McDermid: I do every once in once in a while.

474
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.260
Eric McDermid: But it's it's not to the point

475
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.130
Eric McDermid: It's to the point where I can pull myself out of it and kind of use.

476
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:13.950
Eric McDermid: Like just asking myself questions like why do I feel so anxious

477
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:24.060
Eric McDermid: Okay, I feel anxious about having to go to the store and get groceries. Why do I feel anxious about having to go get groceries. Oh, I mean come into contact with people.

478
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.420
Eric McDermid: I may have a panic attack.

479
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.720
Eric McDermid: You know, I just try and ask myself these questions by destroying talk it out with myself.

480
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.400
Eric McDermid: And just trying to tell myself you know like

481
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.120
Eric McDermid: You're getting anxious over all the wrong reasons.

482
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:49.350
Eric McDermid: And ask yourself these questions and answer them. That is most likely not going to happen and

483
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yourself and calm yourself down.

484
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.760
Eric McDermid: Correct. So that self talking

485
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.140
Eric McDermid: Really helps me get out of depressive episodes.

486
00:45:58.890 --> 00:45:59.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh,

487
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:00.360
For sure.

488
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:07.590
Eric McDermid: Because when I get a depressive episode, I just want to lay in bed and stare at the wall where the back of my eyelids.

489
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:15.300
Eric McDermid: But I recently started learning to play guitar and that's been a that's been

490
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.660
Eric McDermid: priceless for my mental health.

491
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.370
Eric McDermid: Yeah, whenever I feel down or

492
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.890
Eric McDermid: I was gonna, I was gonna say, I love your guitar.

493
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.130

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I started and then I just need to get back in. Now you're reminding

496
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:39.630

497
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.210
Eric McDermid: I totally feel. Yeah. Whenever I get

498
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.250
Eric McDermid: Really down or really up

499
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.450
Eric McDermid: The guitar really really helps a lot or sure

500
00:46:49.800 --> 00:47:00.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, it's, it's a good things for motivating me. I gotta, I gotta get pick it back up. Because, you know, you have to keep practicing to keep remembering what the chords are whatever

501
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:11.670
Eric McDermid: I want to show you my guitar. It's, it's pretty crazy. My dad. Let me borrow it. He has over 100 guitars and I'm not even joking. Oh.

502
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:15.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god, look at that.

503
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.260
Eric McDermid: Like this part.

504
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.620
Eric McDermid: Wow, but as of other Picard.

505
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.520
Eric McDermid: It's really cool.

506
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: Who is lending this to

507
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.360
Eric McDermid: My father

508
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your father

509
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.160

Eric McDermid: An he calls it his guitar rooms library he he easily over has over 100 really nice guitars, it's, it's crazy. But it's an absolute dream since I've since I've started playing man I'm kicking myself in the butt. I wish I would have started years ago.

511
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Has he been is he does he play or he used to play or

512
00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.280
Eric McDermid: He doesn't play

513
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:08.850
Eric McDermid: He, he likes to dink around he doesn't really he hasn't really taken the time to really learn to really try and learn it.

514
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.820
Eric McDermid: I think are actually no longer than

515
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:12.180
Like

516
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:14.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know more than

517
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:15.660
Yeah.

518
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's so great. You have a whole treasure trove, then

519
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.220
Eric McDermid: That's exactly because if save

520
00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:38.190
Eric McDermid: I don't know when. Whenever I get bored of that guitar or I go online, or watching music video and see one I can be like a dad, I saw this or that guitar and you'll be like, oh yeah, we got that you can come and get whatever you like. So it's

521
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.610
Eric McDermid: It's, it's amazing to have

522
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.850
Eric McDermid: A guitar library.

523
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.300
Eric McDermid: Yeah, I love it, I love it.

524
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:53.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm so glad. See, there's such a positive thing there.

525
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.870
Eric McDermid: Exactly yeah I

526
00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:06.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know that you can share. That's cool. I like that. That's good. Very healthy hobby. Okay, good. So you got to pick yourself up, you use the self talk to do that.

527
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:25.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: And, you know, it sounds like you've been in like treatment for psychiatric stuff since a very young age. So you're well versed in you know like techniques and things. I guess I'm okay and you have Dr. Brennan, how often are you going to see Dr.

528
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:25.710
Brennan.

529
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.400
Eric McDermid: Every month every month. I see here

530
00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:35.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you have any allergies to medication that I should put down or

531
00:49:38.010 --> 00:50:00.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not, not outright allergy. Right. Correct. Okay. Um, and then medication wise, I'm thinking that we should I know you have extras and things. But when we want. I mean, whenever you feel ready. I think we should start doing the, I guess the sub you text because you're kind of sensitive

532
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.130
Eric McDermid: To dollar on your amazing

533
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, we can do that. We can do the subtext.

534
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:11.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you think that would be eight milligrams twice a day, you think that would be your

535
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:11.520
Eric McDermid: Style.

536
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:26.940
Eric McDermid: Yeah, that would keep me stable. Because realistically I are used 12 to 14 milligrams a day and then like if I'm, if I wake up super early and I'm having a pretty you know long day. I will

537
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:46.050
Eric McDermid: I'll take, say, four to eight milligrams in the morning and then about six hours later, another four milligrams. And then if it's a long day another six hours later, another formula games. So it would only go up to the 16 milligrams a day.

538
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.140
Eric McDermid: When somebody talks with

539
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:59.280

541
00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:06.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and I'll put some refills on that in case you want more around

542
00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:07.920
Amazing.

543
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.940

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or 60 milligrams a day and you're saying, You do like have

549
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.980
Eric McDermid: Either one. Or yeah, kind of staggering.

550
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:34.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Staggering should I say, I'll just run it as twice a day eight milligrams twice.

551
00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:41.640
Eric McDermid: On here it's written as dissolve one tablet by mouth sublingual e twice daily. Yeah.

552
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Twice. Okay.

553
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:55.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we can do that. And then the way our treatment program works is we do so this like this doctor's visit

554
00:51:56.610 --> 00:52:10.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: From now on, is going to be, you'll see me, but you'll see me in a group setting. So there will be other patients with you who are mostly most of my patients right now are on some form of buprenorphine.

555
00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:21.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: So they'll be kind of similar, you know, doing a similar treatment. And so I do a check. And I'd say, Okay. So Eric, how was your week

556
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:30.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Mood good cravings whatever any changes in your meds that we need whatever any updates and if not, then I would give you another prescription

557
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:42.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then move on to the next person and whatever. And I take care of all that. And then there's a therapist with me who helps me the rest of the time to run a group like a recovery.

558
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:52.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Theme. Usually it's something that we can all relate to, like, I don't know, how do we deal with boredom, or how do we, you know, deal with triggers, whatever.

559
00:52:53.280 --> 00:53:01.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, something and it's it's been fun. It's been actually interesting as a physician, I normally see patients one on one.

560
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, I'm new to Tele health I'm new to the bright heart as well.

561
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: As new Iser yeah

562
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:24.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's a new concept for me like seeing multiple patients together. And I'm like, Well, what about privacy and stuff, but it's worked out. I think people are respectful of each other's privacy. They understand the group stuff stays in the group. There's nothing. No one does outside

563
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:35.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so yeah hopefully you'll like it as well. I think it's good. And then people can chime in, like if you had an experience and someone's like, yeah, I'm getting

564
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:45.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Even something medical like I'm feeling constipated, you can. I'm in and be like, actually, you know, I tried whatever prune juice and it worked for me and whatever you

565
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:46.890
Eric McDermid: LIKE. BERNIE YEAH WELL.

566
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:47.580
Eric McDermid: Yeah.

567
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's helpful and it's it's fun.

568
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:59.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: People, it's it's really nice to see, you know, I think that's the magic of the group is just some sort of camaraderie that randomly happens

569
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:03.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's good. So that's what we do. We do weekly

570
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:11.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I'm so that takes care of, like, a weekly doctor's visit and a weekly group therapy, visit

571
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.260
Eric McDermid: And one was pretty cool to me.

572
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:19.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. Yeah, it's good. And then, and then you're assigned your own therapist.

573
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:33.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Within bright heart. So the first visit with that therapist, you need to schedule. So you need to tell like called a virtual clinic and say, hey, okay. I saw the doctor. Now I need to schedule the therapists.

574
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:39.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: And that first therapy visit, they will do like an assessment, like a bio psychosocial they call it.

575
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:53.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: At that point, they'll tell you you and that person will decide, okay, yeah, maybe we should do monthly therapy or we should do, every other week, or whatever. Every we, you know, whatever your needs are.

576
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:59.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. Um, but you should you need to do that at least that first assessment to kind of

577
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:00.600
Eric McDermid: Fear them.

578
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:06.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, definitely. So I'll ask you to schedule that therapy, visit

579
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:21.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then just remember the drug test. So the drug testing happens once a month, the mail you something you keep it you don't open it you call the virtual clinic, you show them. You open it, go to the bathroom. They don't come with you.

580
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: You should show them like your temperature or whatever, you know,

581
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:33.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, it's just something to remind you that, like you're being monitored and you're in a program, you know, just keep you on your

582
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:48.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thing and, you know, just like you told your old older exposition about your slips, you know you need. I hope you understand that I'm here to I'm not here to judge. I'm here to help.

583
00:55:48.750 --> 00:56:02.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so if if there's a some close call or something like just definitely tell me so that we can work around it. We can figure out why did this happen and how can we prevent it does a med need to be increased like

584
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so

585
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.500
Eric McDermid: So don't feel so basically just be honest and

586
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.210
Eric McDermid: Yeah, be real with you.

587
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:15.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Be real and I'm here to help you know and

588
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:26.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: As long as you know your intentions are clear and you're like, I want to be sober. I wanted, you know, then I'm here to help you do that, you know,

589
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.710
Eric McDermid: Can I be real with you for a second.

590
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:29.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sure.

591
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.640
Eric McDermid: I did have a slip up in the last two weeks.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.880
Eric McDermid: My brother came my brother came down

593
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:46.140
Eric McDermid: And since I've been low on medications and trying to stretch it as far as possible. I told you know what, let me let me take a hit of that.

594
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.040
Eric McDermid: And I ended up taking a couple of heroin.

595
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:52.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: And when when

596
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.300

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Today well

602
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like the first the first

603
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.750
Eric McDermid: Part. Yeah, probably about the first or the third

604
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.070
Okay.

605
00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I did.

606
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:20.850
Eric McDermid: I yeah

607
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:21.630
Eric McDermid: I think

608
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.100
Eric McDermid: For telling smoke.

609
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:32.760
Eric McDermid: Like I didn't smoke or buy it like a smoke a lot but I definitely did smoke some just yeah I feel really, really guilty.

610
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.900
Eric McDermid: But I just wanted to be 100% honest with you.

611
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:48.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thank you. You know that starting off on the right foot, which I think says a lot about your character. And I think that will also be

612
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:59.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Something important for your recovery, you know, just saying, hey, I'm starting off on a completely honest, start and I'm just going to keep doing that because it's honestly for you honestly like

613
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.150
Eric McDermid: That's why I wanted to tell you I didn't want to

614
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.100
Eric McDermid: Sit here and

615
00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

616
00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.170
Eric McDermid: To go what I do, but leaving something out.

617
00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:16.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thank you. Thank you for sharing that. I really appreciate the honesty and the vulnerability

618
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.420
Eric McDermid: Sorry.

619
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:31.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did you use, you mentioned that the medication was you were trying to stretch it and stuff so you aren't taking as much as you would so

620
00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:43.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your brain was like a, maybe I can feel it right because if you take an what you're supposed to. Am I wrong. I mean, it's supposed to be pretty stuck on your receptor. So if you do use you don't feel

621
00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.340
Eric McDermid: Yeah, if, if

622
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:49.530
Eric McDermid: If I was on my actual bills, it would take probably

623
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.540
Eric McDermid: A lot of money. Probably about $100

624
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:56.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: To try to

625
00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.410
Eric McDermid: Even maybe feel something.

626
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.500
Eric McDermid: Okay, it would take. Yeah, like a gram

627
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:05.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so it's an it's a disincentive

628
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: To be using when you're on your Medicare

629
00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:27.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you need to be on the right dose and you need to be taking it regularly not skipping and not changing it around too much and because your mind can play tricks on you like that, like, Oh, I haven't out and you know and the opportunities like oh

630
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know yeah rationalizes

631
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:39.060
Eric McDermid: Yeah, the way I rationalized it was, um, I'm trying to stretch the medication as far as possible. I'm on the low, the low is still say never been on

632
00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:40.890
Eric McDermid: You know,

633
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:49.470
Eric McDermid: I'm feeling kind of crappy. You know, maybe, maybe this stuff might actually work and I might feel good for an hour.

634
00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:51.900
Eric McDermid: But

635
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:52.470
Eric McDermid: It wasn't

636
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:53.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: It wasn't worth

637
00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.310
Eric McDermid: Worth wasn't worth the way that I feel about it.

638
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:58.740
Eric McDermid: Yeah, for sure.

639
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.080
Eric McDermid: Because now I feel like

640
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.410
Eric McDermid: A failure complete should

641
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:17.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, you're not because you're here and you're talking to me and you're telling me everything from the very beginning. And you're telling me this this event, you know, and that's

642
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:30.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's huge. It's we're human beings, you know, we're not NOBODY'S PERFECT. NOBODY follows like 100% one path. You know, we deviate. And then we come back. It's the strength

643
01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:42.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your strength is in the coming back to, like, okay, yeah. No, I'm not going to stray off into this. I'm coming back, like I need to do this. And so don't beat yourself up.

644
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:56.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Please, don't you know and then but but this is a good reminder and like kind of learning lesson for you that like it is really important for you. Okay.

645
01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:03.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: It is really important for you to have your boundaries with certain people

646
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:05.250
Eric McDermid: Yeah, definitely.

647
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:05.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right.

648
01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Even if Emily members, you need to just be very

649
01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:20.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: upfront about your boundaries and you may even want to say something like, you know, would you mind not talking about that stuff or not bringing it around.

650
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.070
Eric McDermid: If you're gonna come over, you know, leave it at home.

651
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:23.730
Eric McDermid: Please.

652
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:34.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because I really feel disappointed in myself. It's not. Yeah. And you can say this has nothing to do with my view of view. I'm not judging you. But for me, like, I worked really hard to

653
01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:41.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Be doing this and be healthy, like I got it. You know, so, so I don't know, have some conversation.

654
01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:58.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then same thing with your dad. If he's still keeping stuff laying around. You know, I don't know. Just the thought. You don't want to irritate and cause a fight, but at the same time, you should be very clear, especially if you're going to allow yourself to go to those spaces.

655
01:01:59.280 --> 01:01:59.610
Yeah.

656
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:04.020
Eric McDermid: I think my father's house, it's, it's a pretty good.

657
01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:15.300
Eric McDermid: Setup as he actually does keep his medications in a gun safe in his bathroom whenever any of us any of the three of us come over

658
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.250
Eric McDermid: They automatically go in there and get locked up and we don't know the combo.

659
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.540
Eric McDermid: Okay, we're not allowed in his room without him or his girlfriend supervision.

660
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.500
Okay.

661
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.430
Eric McDermid: But I think I just had a really bad.

662
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.320
Eric McDermid: This week, and yeah.

663
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:46.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, you know, it happens. But hey, we're here. You're starting your

664
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.160
Eric McDermid: I didn't wanna

665
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:56.940
Eric McDermid: I didn't want to start, start off the treatment feeling like this or wanting to

666
01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:03.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thank you. I think you did the right thing, you know, and just, just let it off your chest and just really

667
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.370
Eric McDermid: Really hard but I'm really glad that I told you.

668
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:06.720

I know that took a lot. So I get it, and I appreciate that. Don't worry.

674
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. And so hopefully moving forward, you'll feel the same way, like if there's ever any

675
01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:58.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thoughts coming in, like, that's the kind of stuff we want to talk about it when we're checking in with each other at the groups like hey how's the week like that anything happened. Did someone come over

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:04.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your thoughts and, you know, because we want to avoid.

678
