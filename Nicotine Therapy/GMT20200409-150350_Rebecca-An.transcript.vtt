00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.139
Jessica Freeman: How's it going,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, how are you

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.440
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, hi.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.850
Hey,

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's happening.

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.370
Jessica Freeman: Same old, same old.

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:48.600
Jessica Freeman: Um, well, I, I spoke with my employer at the beginning of the week, right after the weekend. The first thing Monday morning, and I asked for an unpaid leave of absence.

10
00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:01.830
Jessica Freeman: Resuming when we go to the office or when my son can go anywhere, soon as he can go somewhere, then I can work, but it's just not working. They were great about it and

11
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.890
Jessica Freeman: It's cool. So, yeah.

12
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.690
Oh, wow.

13
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.490
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

14
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so now you feel less stressed.

15
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:29.190
Jessica Freeman: Oh my god it feel like a million pounds just been taken off my shoulders. Yeah. And I got both my federal and state tax returns yesterday. I didn't know they were going to post so soon, but cool and I got the stimulus check coming and I've

16
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.760
Jessica Freeman: Applied for unemployment, so

17
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good. Yeah.

18
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:49.470
Jessica Freeman: I'll be fine like financially. I'm actually you know I rent this house from my mom and her husband. So I've actually like paid ahead. I'm good until June.

19
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.990
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

20
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good stuff was thinking ahead for sure. Yeah.

21
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:07.800
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, and you know, I've been wanting to open a savings account forever, but like I never get they want you to go into the bank and I you know who's got the time for that, you know,

22
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:21.000
Jessica Freeman: So I've never done it, but I'm hopeful. But now, maybe they'll let me start a savings account online since of all this stuff. Everything's online and then I can transfer from my checking to my savings.

23
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.110
Jessica Freeman: Just from my phone, which would be really nice.

24
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. It is definitely a luxury to be able to do that.

25
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

26
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are things with your mom.

27
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.830
Jessica Freeman: Pretty good.

28
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:53.250
Jessica Freeman: She, she's released from her stress as well because now, like when I need her. It's not all the time. It's not for long stretches of time. So she's, she's doing well with that she and Bob has been great.

29
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.710
Jessica Freeman: Bob Braves the stores, he goes out with his gloves and his mask and gets everything that we need

30
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.350
Pretty cool.

31
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

32
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely was your son not adjusting very well to going over there.

33
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:24.210
Jessica Freeman: Oh yeah, no, it was, it was, he was like he got to the point where he wouldn't even get in the car. Like, he's like, I know you're taking me to Nana's and I don't want to go, I just want to stay home with you.

34
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:36.000
Jessica Freeman: And well, like, I love that it's still like I know it's not really healthy but back before we were here all the time like he he loved to go to the neighbor's house and he loved to go to school.

35
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.290
Jessica Freeman: And I'm sure he'll love to go out again soon as all this is over. But for right now he wants to be at home with mommy.

36
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.170
Jessica Freeman: And he's

37
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.300
Jessica Freeman: A happy guy. He's cool. He's just been a perfect angel. I really can't complain.

38
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.810
Jessica Freeman: He started to look like a rag a muffin.

39
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.000
Jessica Freeman: No haircuts.

40
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.630
Jessica Freeman: But haircuts are awful. Anyway, they're so bad for him. It's like

41
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.400
Jessica Freeman: It takes three people to hold them down.

42
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.780
Oh, wow.

43
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:21.540
Jessica Freeman: And he just screams and cries and he's like traumatized. The whole time and I feel terrible. But there's nothing really. I mean, I've done everything I can do, I tried everything that there is try he hates people mess him with his head.

44
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, that's his preference, you know, to me,

45
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

46
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: definitely so. How have things been going with your online meetings.

47
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:43.740
Jessica Freeman: Pretty good, actually, um, yesterday you know how I said that there were some indie meetings, you know, Indianapolis meetings that I was able to participate in. Yeah, so

48
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.990
Jessica Freeman: The day before yesterday, I got a text from somebody that was in

49
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.900
Jessica Freeman: Well, let me just describe it to you. Okay.

50
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.440
Jessica Freeman: You know there are a lot of rooms have a

51
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.870
Jessica Freeman: And then this particular room.

52
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:07.560
Jessica Freeman: Is where I got sober like it's the place where I found everything that I needed and those people feel like my family.

53
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:18.210
Jessica Freeman: You know, it's not like the women's meeting where where I feel like you know there's some cattiness going on and politics and all that stuff. No, it's just like the real love of a

54
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:27.060
Jessica Freeman: Was in this room and I used to go to all the time, it was downtown on monument circle. So I would go on my lunch hour and back when I was in the recovery house.

55
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:37.260
Jessica Freeman: It was on the bus line so like I always went to that meeting for years you know it my ups and my downs through the good and the bad like those are my people.

56
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:49.860
Jessica Freeman: And they had. I haven't seen since December, because when I went back, it wasn't, it was over a weekend. It wasn't during the week, so I didn't get to go to that meeting because I wasn't there on a weekday.

57
00:05:51.330 --> 00:06:06.090
Jessica Freeman: So it was just so wonderful to meet with them yesterday. Oh my god. Like even know. Like it was so good, like so, good to see everybody's faces and like lots of love and they all miss me and they love me. It was great.

58
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:19.710
Jessica Freeman: It was a big blessing and they're they're doing it every Wednesday. So I'm gonna it's at 10 Wednesdays at 10am for me noon for them.

59
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.320
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it was great.

60
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good.

61
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, really good. I'm glad you got to connect with them.

62
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.670
We do.

63
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how's the rest of it going still engaging still

64
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I'm not going to say that I do it constantly. I mean,

65
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.630
Jessica Freeman: I'll go to a meeting, maybe every other day.

66
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.160
Jessica Freeman: Not every day.

67
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:51.000
Jessica Freeman: But then on the days that I don't do a meeting, you know, I'm on the phone with somebody or

68
00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:01.080
Jessica Freeman: I'm listening to like speaker meetings on podcasts and you know I'm staying plugged in, it's just

69
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That

70
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.000
Jessica Freeman: Some of the online meetings.

71
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:13.800
Jessica Freeman: There's just so impersonal. There's, like, you know, 250 some odd people in there. But yeah, I am still doing it, it's just, it's not how I get what I need.

72
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah but but it's part of what I need, I need to hear people talk about this stuff.

73
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

74
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:37.440
Jessica Freeman: And we're all commiserating you know I mean not commiserating as very positive. It's not like a bitch best like people think it is, but we are all in the same boat. We're all having to stay home and suffer through this or yeah I can't even imagine being a healthcare worker right now.

75
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.110
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, life. I couldn't do it.

76
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.940
Jessica Freeman: There's no way

77
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.550
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I'm not good with blood and like people, the old people.

78
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.970
Or

79
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.590
Jessica Freeman: People

80
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.800
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I just wouldn't be very good nurse.

81
00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is so funny. How did you on our video people get into a zoom room.

82
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.350
Jessica Freeman: I don't know, dude. The all the paid subscriptions. I mean, you can have

83
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As many people as you want.

84
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.030
Jessica Freeman: I guess somebody doing it.

85
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:10.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

86
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.580
Jessica Freeman: A lot of people are doing it. There's some big ass meetings.

87
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That it's just crazy.

88
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.000
Jessica Freeman: It is. That's why I like the ones where your people I know.

89
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Makes sense. I would do if I were you.

90
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

91
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.300
Jessica Freeman: So something big happened yesterday and kind of emotional

92
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:34.980
Jessica Freeman: Um,

93
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:49.260
Jessica Freeman: It's good though, I think. And so finally I get up, we had. Okay, so when I first moved when we first moved here I enrolled him in Albuquerque public schools.

94
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:59.370
Jessica Freeman: Here by known as APS and then we had to go through this whole like we had to have an IEP meeting to transfer his old IEP stuff into his

95
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:11.940
Jessica Freeman: Like an APS IP, but nothing had changed, even though his old IP was from like 2017 so he underwent all these evaluations weeks and weeks, months and months and then we got his

96
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:23.010
Jessica Freeman: His IEP meeting on the books right after the shutdown. So like it would have happened on March 18 and school shut down on like march 13

97
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.500
Jessica Freeman: So anyhow,

98
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:37.680
Jessica Freeman: So after the like the the government, they're putting out all their stuff about what they're doing and blah, blah, blah. I sent them an email and I said, Hey, it looks like IEP meetings can be held over zoom. Can we do this.

99
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:46.830
Jessica Freeman: So we got that on the books and we finally had the IEP meeting yesterday, and it was good, you know, um, but I had to make

100
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.420
Jessica Freeman: I had to make a really tough decision. I've had him in this charter school

101
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:59.970
Jessica Freeman: And I haven't been confident about my decision with anything like it was it was going to be APS special ed it was going to be a horrible Charter.

102
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:12.300
Jessica Freeman: Or it was going to be ABA therapy and I had all these options. I do all this research and I made a decision I send them to the charter school and I have not been confident about that decision at all because

103
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.890
Jessica Freeman: Asleep. He just needs more services. He just needs.

104
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.300
Jessica Freeman: More

105
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.350
Jessica Freeman: But anyway.

106
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:27.930
Jessica Freeman: So we had this IEP meeting yesterday, and we were talking about like what services are available for him right now. And what about the coming months.

107
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.450
Jessica Freeman: And so it turns out that the APS special ed is offering stuff.

108
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:42.630
Jessica Freeman: Right now, actually, right now, like they've been working on it and effective this coming week like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, they're going to be rolling this program out and

109
00:10:43.350 --> 00:11:00.930
Jessica Freeman: It's going to be, it's going to be like 30 minute sessions online, like a zoom meeting or Google meets once a day, every day Monday through Friday, but she's she gives me a list of like all the stuff that I need to be able to help him with like his crafts and

110
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.800
Jessica Freeman: Like learning activities and they're really short engaging learning activities that he should be able to pay attention to.

111
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:17.520
Jessica Freeman: You. She is prepared that you know he'll run he'll come back. He'll be all over the place. But we're going to do our best to try this E learning. And I think it'd be really good for him.

112
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:33.810
Jessica Freeman: So I switched in schools. I decided against the charter school and I switched him to APS and he's like, I gotta get him enrolled like today, and then also over the summer. They have this program if they get to go back into the classroom in June.

113
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:34.920
Jessica Freeman: Which, you know,

114
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.130
Jessica Freeman: New Mexico is doing pretty well as far as numbers, you know,

115
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.710
Jessica Freeman: So maybe he'll get to go back to school in June, who knows, I don't know. I'm ready doing now.

116
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:45.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

117
00:11:46.980 --> 00:12:01.380
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, they have this social emotional class that he'll be able to go to where it's very text heavy and he has to use different methods of communication to get anything that he wants in the class, which I think will be really motivated for him.

118
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's good.

119
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:17.010
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so I feel like I made a sound decision for him, but it was hard because I really love the charter school and they've been so good to us and it's just it was just a really hard decision to make. But I do think it was the right one.

120
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, those are always tough. Yeah.

121
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:31.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know the great part about it is if you find out that it wasn't you get the opportunity to re evaluate it. You know what I mean.

122
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:42.060
Jessica Freeman: Yeah well coming months. It's definitely it's like the only option charter schools not doing anything. They don't have a special ed stuff set up an

123
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:50.610
Jessica Freeman: ABA I've had him on the waitlist for ABA he's going to stay on the waitlist Rabia, but now with the coronavirus stuff. How much longer is that going to be, I don't know.

124
00:12:50.670 --> 00:13:02.250
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. So, at least that's that's brewing and then when they call me and say, Oh, we have an opening however many months down the road. That is, you know, I can, I can look at how he's doing and

125
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:11.160
Jessica Freeman: And see what is best at the time, but I definitely feel like this. This APS special ed is best right now.

126
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:20.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool. So he'll be able to get online every day and have projects to do work with somebody on the other end.

127
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's gonna be cool for him.

128
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:34.590
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I mean, it's not going to be easy. It's going to be a big adjustment. He does not have a 30 minute attention span for, you know, like FaceTime, and this kind of thing, but hopefully he'll be into it.

129
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:41.340
Jessica Freeman: We use my laptop, because it's not touchscreen, and I need him because he thinks everything is touchscreen

130
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:49.830
Jessica Freeman: You know, he walks up to the TV. And he's like, you know, and I'm like that way. So we're going to use my laptop. That way you know he didn't know how to use a keyboard.

131
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

132
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.500
Jessica Freeman: You can't mess it up to bed right

133
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.580
Jessica Freeman: Swipe the teacher off the screen and be like, What's watching tube.

134
00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.160
Jessica Freeman: That's

135
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So funny.

136
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And smart kid.

137
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:14.550
Jessica Freeman: He is. And it's funny, they tell me he's cognitively between the ages of seven and 22 months. And I'm like, you don't know him. You don't know anything about him.

138
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Seven months and one is 22 months.

139
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:18.600
Yeah.

140
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.200
Jessica Freeman: But you know when they do this testing for the kids.

141
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:34.650
Jessica Freeman: You know okay with autistic kids when they go to ABA therapy they spend weeks pairing with them, building a rapport building a relationship to where they have instructional control with him.

142
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:47.010
Jessica Freeman: When you go to a test for, you know, three or four hours he didn't care about you. He's not gonna listen to anything that you have to say he's gonna cover is yours and go the other way.

143
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.050
Jessica Freeman: You know, you got to spend the time to

144
00:14:49.890 --> 00:15:02.280
Jessica Freeman: Develop that rapport with him pairing. It's important, but they don't do that. So they see a little boy that's over in the corner, holding his ears going, la, la, la, la. And they tell me he's cognitively below.

145
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.870
Jessica Freeman: Not the case, but whatever. At least we'll get lots and lots of services.

146
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

147
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy.

148
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.180
Yeah.

149
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.670
Jessica Freeman: It's pretty hard to read that stuff and be told about your kid when you know it's not true.

150
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

151
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.790
Jessica Freeman: Go ahead.

152
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, you know, they have him for the certain amount of time. They don't spend all the time with them like you do, you know, so they don't know

153
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:34.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When it'd be different if they went into his environment and just monitored and watched

154
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What he did, how he interacted with things throughout the day.

155
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I bet you would be a whole different

156
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:41.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know result.

157
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.670
Jessica Freeman: I agree. And you know what they're doing now they're trying to do these evaluations over a zoom meeting.

158
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.180
Jessica Freeman: That would never work. There's nothing about that that would work. Nothing.

159
00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:04.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy. But that you know they're trying to utilize the tools that they have and do the best that they can do and I get that to you know but

160
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's almost a disservice. In a sense, because they're not going to get an accurate.

161
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.310
Jessica Freeman: Exact picture.

162
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:17.580
Jessica Freeman: I was hard. I had a long conversation with the special ed coordinator at charter, the day before the IEP.

163
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:29.910
Jessica Freeman: And she was saying like they should just not do any testing right now because it's just it'll be too skewed, you know, just not accurate. It's better to know testing them to do wrong testing.

164
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.540
Mm hmm.

165
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really

166
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I agree to very much

167
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:53.100
Jessica Freeman: Even though the testing was shitty. I'm glad we already got it done. You know, it was shitty. It was shitty but it was shitty in Indiana to they just don't have the time to be able to spend to really get an accurate read on these kids. It's a major investment.

168
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which they should be doing.

169
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.890
Jessica Freeman: Sure. Now is a very dangerous word. Yeah.

170
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know it is

171
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.670
Jessica Freeman: Don't shut all over yourself.

172
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:15.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know, hey, what would you think if I pulled together a group of moms.

173
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With autistic kids.

174
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For this, yeah.

175
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.300
Jessica Freeman: You know more than me.

176
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:25.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

177
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:43.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I have other clients that also are in the same boat that you are as far as, you know, no services at this moment, you know, that have autistic children and just trying to adjust to, you know, having to have them you know 24 seven

178
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:51.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As a support group, not as a therapy group, but just as a support group for each other.

179
00:17:52.650 --> 00:18:01.410
Jessica Freeman: That'd be cool. My only concern is that we would is that most people would be inclined to sit around and bitch about it and I don't like to do that.

180
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:02.910
Jessica Freeman: Like

181
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.980
Jessica Freeman: I can relate

182
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:18.120
Jessica Freeman: It's just, I don't know. It's too tempting to just be like, oh, and this sucks that sucks it oh my leg is crap. You know, it's just too easy to do that. I would. I don't know if it's a support group. It should be about support.

183
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.930
Jessica Freeman: Right, not just whining and complaining

184
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.320
Jessica Freeman: About right i don't know this, but other moms.

185
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can be dying of

186
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:26.970
Like

187
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:40.020
Jessica Freeman: You know the mom competitions. Oh, I only feed my son, you know, organic and granola nuts and berries and you know if my kid wants to eat Oreos, and go fish.

188
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:50.670
Jessica Freeman: But like that, you know, I'm not gonna compete. I don't like to compete with other people like that. And a lot of moms are like that. But I mean, hey, I got an open mind.

189
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.290
Jessica Freeman: And an open mind.

190
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.630
Jessica Freeman: I've just had some experiences like this in the past they haven't turned out well.

191
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:10.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, if I'm in a group to and we facilitate it to where it is a support. You know what I mean and bouncing ideas off one another and having a place that you can talk to somebody else.

192
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:19.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And get different ideas from each other, that, you know, you might have information that one of the other moms, don't you know

193
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:36.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They might have information that you don't. But just be able to have the ability to talk to other moms, that and the other moms that I have in mind there's only a couple. You know, there's three that I work with that have autistic kids and

194
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:53.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know all of all three of you guys are in the same boat. It's sitting at home, having to be with you know with the babies with no services being provided at this moment you know and be able to talk to somebody that knows

195
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because they're living it to

196
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you think about going into a group of people that have no idea because they're not living it

197
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.410
Jessica Freeman: They got typical kids are

198
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

199
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:15.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, the typical kids. It doesn't even compare. I'm sorry. Like there's just, yeah, I like your idea. I mean,

200
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If

201
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:17.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

202
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If it turns out to be a bitch session, then we can completely stop it, but

203
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.680
Jessica Freeman: Definitely. Well, if you're there to like moderate, you know,

204
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.220
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, cuz you know how women are

205
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:35.760
Jessica Freeman: They are

206
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I sigh now.

207
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.460
Jessica Freeman: I'm too old for that should

208
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey, there's no time in the day, for it is

209
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, no way.

210
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:51.660
Jessica Freeman: It's senseless drama, like how crappy is your life that's that's like what you have to. That's your entertainment is to be a snotty bitch.

211
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's like, no, thank you.

212
00:20:54.390 --> 00:21:02.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And I'm I really try to stay as resolution focused as I possibly can. You know what I mean, I really try to stay out of

213
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My life is is a horrible mess type of thinking because in reality you know that's not the truth, you know,

214
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.250
Jessica Freeman: There might be some things that

215
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:14.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are tough.

216
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:23.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it doesn't mean that they're not fixable or they're not doable, or you know that I don't have the power to change it.

217
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

218
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm. That's what I'm hoping.

219
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm

220
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:50.070
Jessica Freeman: I prefer to stay on, you know, the resolution side as well. And if I if I'm not like solving a problem I it's I still just kind of want to be neutral about it, you know. Yeah, just I don't like to get into that negative headspace because it just no there's no point

221
00:21:50.700 --> 00:22:04.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There is no point, that's the thing. You know, when we get stuck in negative headspace, you know, it ruins are art, it's wasting time it's ruining you know a great opportunity to find something that's positive and good and resolutions.

222
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

223
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.520
Jessica Freeman: Even if there's

224
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.510
Jessica Freeman: nothing that can be done. You know, like that happens. Since

225
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.670
Jessica Freeman: There's nothing that can be done.

226
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:15.780
Jessica Freeman: And that's okay.

227
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:24.090
Jessica Freeman: Just sit in a place of acceptance about it. Yeah, and that's okay because like I'm a badass to be able to do that.

228
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:33.240
Jessica Freeman: I don't have to react and I don't have to, you know, do all the things that I used to do. I don't have to be like that. And there's a power in that

229
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There is a power.

230
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:35.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In that

231
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very, very much.

232
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, the other the other couple ladies, you know, they have

233
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One of them has good time to in recovery. So she's been a recovery for a while as well.

234
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's how so

235
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, big time. And the other one, actually. She's been in recovery for a while, too.

236
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely so

237
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work. You know what I mean it's, I'm thinking about. I'm like, wait, all of us every single one of you ladies.

238
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I've got some good time so

239
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not like it's somebody that's brand spanking new to recovery that still going through the initial process of stabilizing themselves, but it's for a

240
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.230
Jessica Freeman: While man yeah it

241
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:31.740
Jessica Freeman: Takes a while to really get a clear perspective on all like the person that you are versus the person that you want to be.

242
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

243
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.570
Jessica Freeman: I'm much more the person that I want to be today than I ever have been

244
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:38.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pretty amazing.

245
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.050
Jessica Freeman: It is, isn't

246
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.400
Jessica Freeman: It. I mean, I was

247
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.660
Jessica Freeman: I was at the edge there man like I was the end of the line.

248
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.510
Jessica Freeman: And I could never have imagined that I'd be where I am today.

249
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.470
Jessica Freeman: That's a God thing.

250
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is very much so.

251
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.160
Jessica Freeman: Lucky to fly do

252
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.090
Jessica Freeman: This to me outside money.

253
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.760
Jessica Freeman: Back friend, you can go

254
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.580
Jessica Freeman: Need to take him to the vet.

255
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:24.090
Jessica Freeman: It's not an emergency or anything. That's why I'm going to wait. But he needs to go to the bat you guys nails done on

256
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.300
Jessica Freeman: Medication refills.

257
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.670
Jessica Freeman: Beautiful day in Albuquerque.

258
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:33.720
Oh, yeah.

259
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.420
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's 40 frickin degrees in Indiana right now. Okay.

260
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.200
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, they have shale last night.

261
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.720
Jessica Freeman: And my apple tree is blooming. Can you see it.

262
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.550
Jessica Freeman: Yes, my apples very

263
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:51.810
Nice.

264
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.360
Jessica Freeman: I'm pretty excited

265
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.370
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, fruit tree before

266
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.430
Jessica Freeman: They all my fruit trees in Indiana.

267
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because the snow.

268
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The weather. Yeah, they committed it.

269
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.700
Jessica Freeman: So I talked to my son Brendan, my older

270
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.220
Jessica Freeman: Um, he you know how much you mean like that. Dean's List nomination thing.

271
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:31.530
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, he had to go through some interviews, if he was going to make this state list or whatever. I'm not clear on the Details button. You went to these interviews and he did not make state. So what I told him was

272
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:49.650
Jessica Freeman: It's amazing that you were nominated to begin with, like that sets you apart from the rest. And he said, this is not the last opportunity, you're going to get. And when the right opportunity comes along, it is already yours.

273
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What did he say about that.

274
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.190
Jessica Freeman: He's a teenager.

275
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know but

276
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:03.210
Jessica Freeman: No, actually, he didn't know he was just like, cool things move

277
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.960
Jessica Freeman: You know, he's a teenager he doesn't talk unless he's talking about robotics.

278
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:22.260

Like yeah

350
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.650

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

352
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:18.870
Jessica Freeman: So now I'm watching it as a woman who's gone through these transitions of age and relationships and you know babies and all that. And I have a completely different perspective now.

353
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.230
Jessica Freeman: I can relate to a lot more of it than I ever did before.

354
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.720
Jessica Freeman: You know, especially like the cynicism about relationships.

355
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.600
Jessica Freeman: That I've always thought that Samantha is a giant whore, and my opinion remains the same.

356
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's funny.

357
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:51.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some people though, you know, it's really like that. And some people just, you know, they equivalent

358
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:59.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sex with intimacy. You know what I mean. And they're always looking for something that you know they need to give themselves.

359
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

360
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:03.630

363
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:24.630

364
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:32.460
Jessica Freeman: And I'm fine with that for a while, especially until all this virus stuff is over.

365
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.950
Jessica Freeman: You can't wait for us to

366
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.270

368
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.220
Jessica Freeman: If it were, were time in Indiana, it would be dark at five, and I could go to bed.

369
00:35:53.130 --> 00:36:04.710
Jessica Freeman: But I love the sun. I love the fact that key. And I can go on walks and we can go outside and play and yesterday or the day before. I can't remember they're all running together.

381
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.570
Jessica Freeman: That's that doesn't sound funny. That sounds

382
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.350

383
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:08.370

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

443
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:47.670
Jessica Freeman: I'm so bad about birthday cards and holiday gifts.

444
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:56.970
Jessica Freeman: So bad about it. Oh, now that I have some money. I should send Brendan a birthday present because I was broke over his birthday should send him something

445
00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm gonna do that equal

446
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And don't tell him.

447
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.110
Jessica Freeman: Why I gotta check and see if he has a Venn Mo, or like

448
00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.220
Jessica Freeman: How I need to send it

449
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool.

450
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

451
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: make his life better and easier while he's going through the changes, he's going through

452
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:27.330
Jessica Freeman: So bad for him. He's got a great attitude about it. Actually, let me let me read you what I wrote him about because

453
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.840
Jessica Freeman: He has he's okay he's very sensitive

454
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.220
Jessica Freeman: His dad is very

455
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:42.000
Jessica Freeman: Like brash like bull in a china shop never recognized Brendan's tender little sensitive heart and he's not nice. Okay.

456
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:50.010
Jessica Freeman: Scott is the worst freaking worst. So Brendan. Okay, I said.

457
00:43:53.160 --> 00:44:00.660
Jessica Freeman: I've been thinking about how you might feel with robotics being cancelled, not being able to go back to school with your friends before you move

458
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:11.070
Jessica Freeman: It breaks my heart for you, son, and he said, it does suck. But I can't be upset about it or it'll mess up any successes, I get in Texas. That sounds like Scott

459
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:18.270
Jessica Freeman: So I said, that's true. And it's a great attitude wallowing in self pity never helped anybody

460
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:28.320
Jessica Freeman: I know you're stronger than me and I know you will get through all of this and come out even stronger. But for me, when I have to deal with something that brings me emotional pain.

461
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:34.320
Jessica Freeman: I've learned that it's important not to stuff that pain because it will find another way to surface.

462
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:42.810
Jessica Freeman: Another way that is usually pretty unhealthy like anger or resentment or something else that's ugly and not likely to help with my emotional health

463
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:53.850
Jessica Freeman: I've learned that I have to deal with the pain sometimes having to just sit through it sit with it, but the ability to do that is bad ass and it makes me a better person.

464
00:44:54.450 --> 00:45:03.690
Jessica Freeman: When my pain is really extreme I just take it bit by bit and process through it. There's a saying how do you eat the elephant. One bite at a time.

465
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:17.280
Jessica Freeman: Wink, that's what helps me after decades of dealing with my emotions in a myriad of unhealthy and destructive ways today. I can deal with them. Just like how I've described, and it really helps so much

466
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Love, that's pretty powerful.

467
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:26.640
Jessica Freeman: You can't really say anything, but I don't expect him to him. I just

468
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:32.490
Jessica Freeman: I, you know, I'm a parent. I want him to benefit from my from my experience and hard

469
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.680
Jessica Freeman: Yes. And I've learned so that he doesn't have to

470
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.270
Jessica Freeman: Go through all that I did.

471
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.460
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. And I also know his dad like we are polar opposites.

472
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long were you in his dad together.

473
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:48.000
For years,

474
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:57.240
Jessica Freeman: Together for two before we got married, married for two and then splitsville at the age of 25

475
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. Was it your choice or his

476
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:13.620
Jessica Freeman: Oh my god mine. I couldn't take it was like, I'm 25 years old rolling over in the morning, looking at this guy. I'm like, no, I can't wake up to this every day of my life. I hate this man.

477
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:17.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not good.

478
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.290
Jessica Freeman: Well, Brandon was only two, you know, but the thing is

479
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:37.440
Jessica Freeman: Like Scott was really truly genuinely in love with me and me. I was an alcoholic, you know, drug addict and I couldn't. I didn't see what I was doing. I didn't understand the decisions I was making

480
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:44.880
Jessica Freeman: And I didn't care about his feelings. You know, I was using him because I didn't want to go home and live with my mom. So I just

481
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:50.460
Jessica Freeman: Lived at his house and then I got pregnant and then my family was all like wins the race.

482
00:46:51.420 --> 00:47:05.400
Jessica Freeman: And then he proposed and I was like, okay, but I was fucking miserable. Then I focused on the wedding and I had a big extravagant beautiful wedding and then the marriage was just shit just total shift from day one.

483
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:19.650
Jessica Freeman: So I left him and he's never gotten over it and he hates me he despises me and he does every single thing that he can to make my life a living hell and I've given him a lot of opportunities.

484
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.080
Jessica Freeman: A lot of opportunities.

485
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:25.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

486
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:31.950
Jessica Freeman: We're good. I mean, bring in 17 you know how long I've been waiting for. Brendan to be this age. Why, why are you

487
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.270

520
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got that one solid in stone on what you're doing on that day. So that's perfectly awesome, you know,

521
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:59.520
Jessica Freeman: Quiet please. There's another one on Friday that I just heard about so Wednesdays and Fridays solid

523
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:10.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. Okay, so you're going to try to go to a meeting a day. And don't forget that. Well, of course, you're not going to forget. But, you know,

524
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:22.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your son has his school that's starting so you have that to help him get adjusted to and see how that works, working with him. You know, you gotta, you got a full plate.

525
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.460
Jessica Freeman: And I do

526
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.690
Jessica Freeman: I have plenty to do

527
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Very much so. Very much so. So

528
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of new adjustments.

529
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:44.490
Jessica Freeman: But these are like positive investments. Yeah, these are really good things. I'm going to be able to help my son, and we'll be able to get more done and feel accomplished. And then, you know, strengthen those connections with the people I care about. This is great. Yeah.

530
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, it's a perfect time, you know, perfect opportunity to take this time. And really, you know, develop and put

531
00:51:55.230 --> 00:52:05.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: heart and soul into connections with people so that when you do go back to work and life is chaotic and crazy and oh my gosh, you know, you'll still have that. But you'll have that built

532
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:07.080
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

533
00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:10.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, then you'll be able to just say, hey,

534
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's talk about the day because it was a rough one, you know,

535
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:29.190
Jessica Freeman: And maybe go maybe go through my like my calendar and put stuff on the calendar like to repeat annually, with the alerts like one week before and that way I can kind of get in a pattern of given up on stuff.

536
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:30.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a good idea.

537
00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:31.710
Jessica Freeman: Very much so.

538
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:32.850
