Gwenevere Abriel: good cheer, you can see

4
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you like nearsighted or farsighted. Like what's your deal

5
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.720
Adam Vallejos: Okay, what is it when I can see, fire. The fire sign

6
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you're near side it's. You can see it near but you can't see stuff out. Okay, got it.

7
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, of course, you got to have that when you're driving you can't see the signs.

8
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.870
Yeah, exactly.

9
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you're busy doing some things about around funeral arrangements with your mom.

10
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.860
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, and just

11
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.810
Adam Vallejos: Getting everything ready for

12
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.300
Adam Vallejos: You getting their outfit for she's gonna do

13
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.340
Adam Vallejos: She decided, I'm in cremation.

14
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.760
Adam Vallejos: She's like, she's like

15
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.800
Any thoughts about that.

16
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.010
Adam Vallejos: Guess.

17
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.120
Adam Vallejos: They wanted to do it because his dad his dad had passed away and

18
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.820
Adam Vallejos: They, they get him. And I guess they

19
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.490
Adam Vallejos: I don't know. We just want to put them next to each other and

20
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.860
Adam Vallejos: I want to

21
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.770
Adam Vallejos: Close it. So, right, because I

22
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.510
Adam Vallejos: I'm gonna get like that little necklace thing with some of it in his

23
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.940
Adam Vallejos: Some of his name.

24
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that. I didn't know, people were doing that now you can carry him around with you.

25
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So how, how, how much have you had a chance to talk out loud about what this process has been you and your mom been talking you and you're on.

26
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.430
Adam Vallejos: Every

27
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.370
Adam Vallejos: Month. Like, I don't know, I always

28
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.560
Adam Vallejos: I guess they always want stuff in life.

29
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we take this time and give yourself permission to just, just whatever comes up for you, then let me just hold that space for you.

30
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

31
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you feel like crying that fence. If you feel you're angry.

32
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, whatever it is. It's going to take probably, months, years for this grief process.

33
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But just curious. I had in my mind in the back of my mind because I only know a couple little things about your dad.

34
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I only have

35
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Was working on cars and you were going to maybe do a little bit of a

36
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.410
Adam Vallejos: Training.

37
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Training with him. And I think there may have been addiction in his life.

38
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:10.290
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, we'll see. I it's not my real dad. Okay, it's my monitors, but he was more with that to me than my filter.

39
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That feels painful.

40
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.180
Adam Vallejos: Yeah yeah

41
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.510
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, he's my

42
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.700
Adam Vallejos: Call him my dad and my real dad, you know, I mean, that's why. But

43
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.030
Adam Vallejos: He was my mom was married to him for like 18 years and I knew

44
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.520
Adam Vallejos: I grew up with him or that was like my dad was

45
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:50.070
Adam Vallejos: my real dad was in prison for 17 years and then he just had got out like two, three years ago. And then my thing now is that my step dad, he

46
00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:00.240
Adam Vallejos: He was in prison to anything that I guess hurts more is that he had just got out like three weeks ago.

47
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.260
Adam Vallejos: And we didn't really get to spend that much time together and seeing them like

48
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.230
Adam Vallejos: Two or three times.

49
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.080
Adam Vallejos: And

50
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.770
Adam Vallejos: Then my mom just showed up.

51
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.200
Adam Vallejos: And said that he

52
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.720
Adam Vallejos: Passed away.

53
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You got robbed right the opportunity to get to know them a little bit after that period was away.

54
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.560
Yeah.

55
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.000
Adam Vallejos: Like we didn't really get to talk to my still really

56
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.760
Adam Vallejos: Good. My mom didn't

57
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:48.360
Adam Vallejos: Mom didn't have them go back to the house because I know this is a big thing cuz he he

58
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.750
Adam Vallejos: He just she was supposed to go to a halfway house after he got out of prison.

59
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.030
Adam Vallejos: And he did.

60
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.510
Adam Vallejos: Um, but knowing my dad, he will stay in there, he

61
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.700
Adam Vallejos: He was on the run.

62
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.520
Adam Vallejos: He escaped from halfway house he does eating scape but he just left, right, so he was he was on the run and

63
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.760
Adam Vallejos: My mom didn't want him.

64
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:33.000
Adam Vallejos: At the house like that because we had my little brother and and stuff. And my boys and she didn't want the Cubs going over there busting stuff. So that's why

65
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.160
Adam Vallejos: My mom is kind of

66
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.400
Adam Vallejos: Taking the arts or two because she didn't have he

67
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.910
Adam Vallejos: Didn't do what he was supposed to. I mean, if he did what he was supposed to state up halfway house.

68
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.310
Adam Vallejos: He would probably still be here.

69
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.140
Tomorrow mom blaming herself somehow

70
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's definitely not her fault, but it can seem like that, right, because we didn't let her let them stay at the house and, you know, but we don't know. We don't know what horrible things might have happened if he had stayed at that house. We just don't know. She

71
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: She made the best decision that she could. And he you know he's

72
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what are you going to miss about and tell me, tell me a little bit about him which going to miss.

73
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.520
Adam Vallejos: I guess.

74
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.930
Adam Vallejos: Talking to him because he was like going

75
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.480
Adam Vallejos: To talk to me about anything.

76
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.220
Adam Vallejos: We didn't really do.

77
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.350
Adam Vallejos: Like stuff together really but we could just talk to

78
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:01.830
Adam Vallejos: Him.

79
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.380
Adam Vallejos: He's a good draw stuff and he

80
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:36.030
Adam Vallejos: Was he was supposed to finish because he didn't my tip to you all night and you're supposed to finish that

81
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.690
Adam Vallejos: Now I'm thinking just to look at least say that something have him on my buddy.

82
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.270
That's me like that.

83
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe later on down the line, you know, it'll really mean something. When you have that tattoo finished.

84
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.630
Adam Vallejos: Yeah yeah

85
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.420
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, it's just

86
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:17.100
Adam Vallejos: And I don't think you're like really hit me still. Yeah, because I haven't seen him or not. I have my mom didn't even really get to see him as he was his sister's house and

87
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.850
Adam Vallejos: When she went over there, they just

88
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.070
Adam Vallejos: Let him. Let her feel him like do the bag.

89
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.590
Adam Vallejos: And

90
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.490
Adam Vallejos: So like that, or no, I just have it.

91
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.790
Adam Vallejos: As in, and it's just weird, like the sister.

92
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.910
Adam Vallejos: He was at his sister's house and he's just

93
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.350
Adam Vallejos: Kind of acting weird toward my mom and like

94
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.810
Adam Vallejos: Because my mom has all the, like, I don't know. We still haven't really found directly how he died and

95
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.530
Adam Vallejos: This is do is like acting weird about dogs have seen stuff like that.

96
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.980
Adam Vallejos: Like she did something. I don't know. It was weird.

97
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Still, it's awkward and, you know,

98
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:13.980
Adam Vallejos: And

99
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.460
Adam Vallejos: And she's just to my mom has all the power that she has to do

100
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.940
Adam Vallejos: This is just acting like

101
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.250
Adam Vallejos: Like she wanted on okay here's this is

102
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:56.070
Adam Vallejos: Like, not even like worried about him. She's worried about the money and like she wants the money to go like very and I don't know it's just weird how she feels like she's very caring. She's worried about getting the autopsy in her hand before anybody else sees it and

103
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.560
Adam Vallejos: She he was

104
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.660
Adam Vallejos: She said that she called right away at in the morning on Sunday morning and

105
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.990
Adam Vallejos: He was already a mom said that he was ready, but real cold and

106
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.480
Adam Vallejos: And that takes usually like six hours.

107
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.280
Adam Vallejos: And

108
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.010
Adam Vallejos: So like her story and really adding up to what she's saying.

109
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:34.650
Adam Vallejos: She's saying that like he was, he lets you found them in the kitchen on the floor like having a seizure, I guess.

110
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.670
Adam Vallejos: And then she was trying to

111
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:47.430
Adam Vallejos: rush to the she was rubbing his heart or something because they're shifting to the he had a heart attack or something but

112
00:11:49.350 --> 00:12:00.030
Adam Vallejos: The timing really adding up because she said that she said that he was still alive when she found on my he was having a seizure and coming from the mouth, but not even

113
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.830
Adam Vallejos: Not even hours later, he was already cold and stiff.

114
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.090
Adam Vallejos: And that takes up to like six hours so

115
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.060
Adam Vallejos: It just still make sense, really.

116
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like thinking those thoughts that maybe she did something negative.

117
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Some kind of distracting for you kind of giving your mind something to focus on, like maybe maybe his sister did something that can be a distraction, then you don't kind of have to think about, really, what just happened.

118
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's going to change.

119
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.410
Yeah.

120
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.300
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

121
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:49.680
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I guess that's been a big distraction is thinking how he died. Exactly. And

122
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:52.500
Adam Vallejos: And

123
00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:04.530
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I just, I don't know, I just, I guess, been more just thinking about her and what she did and how she's acting right now and

124
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.100
Adam Vallejos: And yeah.

125
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So my guess is Adam at some point maybe months from now, it may not fit you for quite a while.

126
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The connection between the loss of this man this father of yours and bigger losses, right, the amount of time.

127
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe having him be there when you were a child and that bigger loss that may come up. So don't be surprised if you find yourself, sort of in that sad state and a lot of other memories are coming up. Don't, don't be surprised if that happens like

128
00:13:52.410 --> 00:14:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I needed to Father. It's not just that he passed now but I needed him many, many years ago to and he wasn't there, that kind of thing may come up for you.

129
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't be surprised if it does, okay.

130
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.090
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

131
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

132
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: There's gonna be he's gonna have his ashes next to his who put next to

133
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: His dad. Okay.

134
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.880
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, so we're just

135
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.710
Adam Vallejos: We're gonna have a viewing for him.

136
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.640
Adam Vallejos: Not this weekend, but next Saturday.

137
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.650
Adam Vallejos: And then

138
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.820
Adam Vallejos: That's really the only thing that set in for a day is his viewing and then

139
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.400
Adam Vallejos: We're trying to get

140
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.710
Adam Vallejos: Some church to have his own

141
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.250
Adam Vallejos: To have like this service. I guess for him and stuff. And he's

142
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:24.210
Adam Vallejos: But we have a the churches. I guess the church that will help us like more with they do it like for free. They just do like donations or something. But right now, that churches.

143
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:34.200
Adam Vallejos: Is getting like remodel like well. The kitchen is getting the model, then that's what we need to like to have the food and stuff for everyone and

144
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:40.650
Adam Vallejos: So we're just trying to figure that out because right now we just have the viewing set for him.

145
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.540
Adam Vallejos: And

146
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:49.080
Adam Vallejos: We just yeah I'm just trying to help my mom do all that, cuz she's

147
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.240
Adam Vallejos: And his family is this, I came out always like

148
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.410
Adam Vallejos: Because she ever since she went to prison. This last time.

149
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.580
Adam Vallejos: Some, not all, but some of his family just been

150
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:16.710
Adam Vallejos: Kind of hitting on my mama just for SATA know why like she's trying to keep my brother away from them and stuff, but she's she don't she just didn't over

151
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:29.190
Adam Vallejos: They don't ever recall. Get him or see him my little brother and they're acting like my mom had kept them away. And she went to prison. This last time and

152
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.740
Adam Vallejos: And now they're just

153
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.260
Adam Vallejos: Acting like it's about them.

154
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:47.280
Adam Vallejos: And just nothing about them. I mean, they called my dad Michael and they're just acting weird, so I know that's harder for my mom to right now.

155
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.480
Adam Vallejos: How they're acting torturing and it was really hard on my little brother to because he

156
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.440
Adam Vallejos: He never really met his that he might he went to prison, when he was three years old.

157
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's his biological father

158
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So how much contact you having with your brother around this.

159
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.000
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I've

160
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:25.980
Adam Vallejos: Been there as much as I can for him because he he was just, it was hard because he was he was so happy when he got out and he finally got to me is that he was just like

161
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.640
Adam Vallejos: I finally have a dad now and

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.200
Adam Vallejos: And he's just saying, like, why did you have to us.

Adam Vallejos: In this envelope. He just says I love you. I miss you and say hi to

166
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.740
Adam Vallejos: His ground play

167
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.580
Adam Vallejos: I don't know, it's just sad too hard to see. And nobody like that.

168
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.750
Adam Vallejos: And he's just

169
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:24.660
Adam Vallejos: It just part because he just really guys that back and he only seen him.

170
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:37.470
Adam Vallejos: A couple times, but my mom. My mom had took on boto they went on to go. He went to be and they did some other things together. Just then three

171
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

172
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.600
So,

173
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.170

Adam Vallejos: You just gone again.

175
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it affect you.

176
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: For a moment, again, and now you don't

177
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.270
Adam Vallejos: And I just

178
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.970
Adam Vallejos: He was just he he came

179
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.880
Adam Vallejos: That night before.

180
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.860
Adam Vallejos: That night before he came to the house and he seen

181
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.480
Adam Vallejos: He was fine. He wasn't he seemed perfectly fine.

182
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.340
Adam Vallejos: He just

183
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.030
Adam Vallejos: Left and the Right number

184
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:50.610
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

185
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And how does this impact how you are with your kids right now.

186
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.160
Adam Vallejos: This makes me

187
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.500
Adam Vallejos: Not take anything for granted, little thing reason

188
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.720
Adam Vallejos: Everything. It's just

189
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.920
Adam Vallejos: Again, making me closer to them, actually. So, because anything could happen.

190
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.010
Adam Vallejos: It's just making me

191
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.460
Adam Vallejos: Closer to them and

192
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:42.180
Adam Vallejos: Making me not take any all the little things for granted. Anything anytime I get to spend

193
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Things like this can either sort of divide family members or it's an opportunity to get closer to connect in an even more honest way and it sounds like at least with your children.

194
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're seeing this as an opportunity to get closer, and that's that's a good sign it. That's what we do. As humans, we do need each other. We need to come together and support one another.

195
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty smart. So you're going to gratitude with it.

196
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Any questions for you. Are they are they talking yet or they're still kind of quiet.

197
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.700
Adam Vallejos: Really

198
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.800
Adam Vallejos: Well, because they really

199
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:41.880
Adam Vallejos: They really didn't know him at all because my oldest son was was only a year old when he went to prison, and then they're just

200
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:52.830
Adam Vallejos: They just met. They just barely got to meet him and my, my youngest son wasn't even born at all, and he

201
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.050
Adam Vallejos: Still like he

202
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.500
Adam Vallejos: I know my boys and really

203
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.590
Adam Vallejos: Because they didn't know him at all. So,

204
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:11.730
Adam Vallejos: But they're just still wondering like why they just have their grandpa back, they just kept cutting ground and

205
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.760
Adam Vallejos: Now he's fun to

206
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Film and this is obviously very early in this process. But you and I have been talking about.

207
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You really getting into your life, you know, look how you have these glasses right at one point it was like, oh, I forgot that part.

208
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And then next. It's going to be sort of, you know, heading to the DMV you guys call it something else but Department of Motor Vehicles right getting that that license so that more opportunities come your way.

209
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this going to derail you right now, is it feeling like oh now I don't I don't I don't want to do it or is it still okay this is it. I've got to get in my life. Life is short, what are you doing with it.

210
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.320
Adam Vallejos: It's fairly

211
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.020
Adam Vallejos: Easy get everything

212
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.080
Adam Vallejos: Everything's

213
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.100
Adam Vallejos: Have to do is not really

214
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:29.190
Adam Vallejos: I don't know, it's just, it's hard to do it, but I'm still need to do everything that you get. I got my glasses so I I could have easily just not went and

215
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.100
Adam Vallejos: But now I just

216
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:41.760
Adam Vallejos: Want to still get everything done because life is short I anybody could just be gone tomorrow.

217
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.500
Adam Vallejos: And

218
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So make you think about your substance use in your voice, your with your kids.

219
00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.100
Adam Vallejos: Yeah. Was it make you think about

220
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.980
Adam Vallejos: That I

221
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.090
Adam Vallejos: Think

222
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:23.550
Adam Vallejos: Is my what happened. I think he was he was using anything. And I think that I had with him.

223
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: My dad passed away and

224
00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.290
Adam Vallejos: It's just I don't

225
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:45.840
Adam Vallejos: Make me get on to me too, because it just takes all the time away from my family when I mean, when I was using yeah and I wasn't there at all.

226
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:53.730
Adam Vallejos: And I just don't want to go back to any of that.

227
00:24:55.470 --> 00:25:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This part of me that wants to sort of take advantage of this moment, you know. Maybe not today but down the line and see if at some point, you'd be willing to say

228
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A goodbye letter right a goodbye letter to heroin.

229
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not an easy letter to write, you know, it's a

230
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I see if I can track down some of the ones that I have

231
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: They're harder, right, because to say goodbye.

232
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:29.220
Adam Vallejos: No.

233
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to see it again means closing the door on that chapter.

234
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: saying goodbye not I'll see you later, which keeps the door cracked open. But what happens from these letters is you can say things like

235
00:25:48.330 --> 00:26:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. Right, thank you also for helping me not have to face my problems. Yeah, yeah. I appreciate that. Thanks. You also still you know 10 years you rob for me seeing my children's milestones, you get to get it all out.

236
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And like you're talking to an actual person when you write this this goodbye letter you think of this heroin this substance and maybe

237
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of picturing it right in an image of of that addiction that voice that you and I kind of talk about picturing it and saying goodbye to it, getting all the feelings, the resentment, the gratitude to because for a lot of you. It's like

238
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I got some friends. I didn't know I could, or I took some challenges that I wouldn't have done otherwise.

239
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To give yourself permission to just you say thank you. You say, I hate you. I resent you you robbed for me. And then you're done.

240
00:26:51.150 --> 00:27:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and I could decide later on. What we want to do without letter. We could have a ceremony, we could read it. We could frame it, we could mail it we can bury it. We could burn it, we could do any number of things for that.

241
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But you wouldn't want to write that letter.

242
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And have it be a phony, you know, and not be ready to really say goodbye, not, not that it's not going to be difficult. Either way,

243
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I'm hearing you talk like you might actually consider doing it. Am I, am I right.

244
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.980
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, why would I see like to do

245
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you actually think I mean you even remember who you are, without even even we never will kind of person who are

246
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.640
Adam Vallejos: Like can go yeah

247
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's a reasonable question. Because there are a lot of people, they get started at 1011 1213 1415 and they have forgotten.

248
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And for all

249
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That the age that people start smoking. It's typical right to most people in their, their substance use history they smoke weed first. But what ends up happening is you guys get stuck develop mentally and emotionally at that age.

250
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't grow emotionally you problem solve, like a 15 year old like a 14 year old. It gets stuck right at that age.

251
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there's some ketchup work to do. So if you give yourself a hard time. Like, why does everybody seemed like they don't have any problem doing this and this is probably because you got started with substance use very early.

252
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're thinking about your own children, statistically, the earlier that children start using

253
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The more likely that substance abuse and addiction is going to be a part of their life.

254
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to as parents we want to delay, delay, delay, delay, delay. If we can pop obviously for me right zero. But if you can delay it further into their life, their first time they smoke weed. Oh, we have just now reduce the likelihood of other substance abuse and addiction.

255
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: By an astronomically high number.

256
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:35.850
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, that's one of my main things for my boys, because I did start early. I study like well

257
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:45.870
Adam Vallejos: It is early. I just know people that started like way earlier than me and a couple years earlier. But I started like a 14 smoking weed and then

258
00:29:48.090 --> 00:30:04.470
Adam Vallejos: I didn't, I just did that for years until I was about 18 and that's when I started. That's when I first tried to heroin or I guess maybe 17 is when I did. I started with the pills and as I tried pills and then

259
00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:12.420
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, and that's my main thing is just to make my boys understand that.

260
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.500
Adam Vallejos: That life is just

261
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.220
Adam Vallejos: So much better without any without no you

262
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: can't preach that can you not right now.

263
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in a way, and especially did you got teenagers, they're going to call you out.

264
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:32.490
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I

265
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: wouldn't call that a parent. If someone said,

266
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do is as a note as I do.

267
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know. It's difficult.

268
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'd be curious to meet you. I'd be curious to know who you are, without all that stuff.

269
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you're not the same. You have different resources you're you're in a program right now and

270
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We can support you through this, we can help you remember we can teach you emotional regulation skills. We can take a look at cognitive distortions, you and I, you already know. I love to role play if you have a situation, we can learn

271
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How to navigate through this life and you can go get a degree in veterinary school or whatever it is that you want to do.

272
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody has to take

273
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That first step and say I'm enough

274
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be hard for you to teach it to your children when you don't even know it in yourself.

275
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:35.880
Yeah.

276
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.500
Adam Vallejos: So I haven't really

277
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.030
Adam Vallejos: Because I can't really say anything, and how

278
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you can. I mean, you can add it. Of course, you can say

279
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:51.060
Adam Vallejos: When

280
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:53.940
Adam Vallejos: I don't think

281
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.600
Adam Vallejos: Like me

282
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.510
Adam Vallejos: Because I haven't, I haven't did it for a long time, so I won't be like

283
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.600
Adam Vallejos: I don't even understand it yet.

284
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all right. Okay. Okay. And I do think everything is going to be okay. You, you really want to raise your children in a healthy way and that's enough, you'll learn how to do it.

285
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.070
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

286
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.220
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

287
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.350
Adam Vallejos: It's just crazy. Everything is just

288
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:40.320
Adam Vallejos: happening all at once is everything that's my boys and

289
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.770

Adam Vallejos: They're just a lot

293
00:32:54.510 --> 00:33:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it does seem like it's happening all at once. But you don't have to feel all of it all at once, just

294
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You made it to this appointment. The next thing you'll just do the next thing, the hardest work is going to be for you to not be thinking about all of them at the same time, just one at a time.

295
00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what are what's right in front of me I going to do that. I'll write things down. Remember how how important the list writing is

296
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Out, you can rely on that if you wrote it down and something you can do some things you you put on sort of that urgent list that's over on the left side things you need to get done today.

297
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And the other, the right hand side is the stuff. It's important, but you'll you'll take a look at that list tomorrow.

298
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll write a new urgent list, but just for today only got one or two or three things over on the left side and you're doing it, look what's happening.

299
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We first started with, you need a driver's license you remembered that you needed glasses, we got on the phone. I said, go for it. Right now you schedule an appointment. You went to it and then you picked it up and I promise you.

300
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not getting a degree taking your GED learning a new trade. It's the same process.

301
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I kid you not. It's one little step at a time. No matter what, no matter, you think you want to bypass it

302
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you're like one of these genius. He just take the exam and somehow like you can make it through these classes, but most people it's just

303
00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I researched the class and sign up for the class or find a way to pay for it. I show up. I study the first page.

304
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Study the second page I quiz myself, all of a sudden how I'm taking the test. Oh my gosh. Now I'm passing my class. Now, I have this whole credit. I'm going to go get another one.

305
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I kid you not. It's just one step at a time. We overwhelm ourselves when we start to think that there's all this stuff to do. It's just the next right thing in front of you. It's no big magic. We're all going through it.

306
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.240
Well,

307
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.840
