25
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So there is some choice about it.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, it's nice to have the money and how great is it to be able to take care of them. They're not you know strangers to you, but at the same time.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.470
Jessica Garcia: It's all for taking care of them.

30
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:47.310

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear anything about any kind of laundry or so. But notice it. It's not an instruction. It's just, it sounds like you're you're come home, you do bathing and some self care and then are you going to bed.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: By what time

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

64
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.800

65
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:47.130

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.610
Jessica Garcia: It's the same. It's, it's about the same, the same exact thing.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.670

85
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you finished it to. And where was your son.

Gwenevere Abriel: And you came home and it looks like he was having fun with his dad or no.

88
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.240
Jessica Garcia: He does. He whenever he's with his dad like he has good days and I can tell.

Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I got here and I made dinner and um

93
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.750
Jessica Garcia: And then me and the baby laid down and asked out

94
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And he stayed in bed. The whole time though all those hours with you.

95
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:18.570
Jessica Garcia: Know a. So my sense that he was off yesterday, but she went on an emergency.

96
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.460
Jessica Garcia: And when he got back, it was like

97
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.060
Jessica Garcia: A little while. LAUGHTER We laid down.

98
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.740
Jessica Garcia: So he got a nap in and then she went and got him from upstairs and I stayed sleeping.

99
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.110
Jessica Garcia: And they hung out

100
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me about the, the, tell me about the patients clients. I don't know what you guys call the the

101
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.980
Jessica Garcia: The client.

102
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.510
Jessica Garcia: Client. Okay.

103
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about them. What was kind of the work that you needed to do with them.

104
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.520
Jessica Garcia: So who is the man from yesterday.

105
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:14.670
Jessica Garcia: I washed the dishes and talk to him for a while, he likes to

106
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.820
Jessica Garcia: He likes to talk. He's, he's funny.

107
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.470
Jessica Garcia: And then I went and I did his laundry. Okay.

108
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So wash dishes. You got to have that satisfaction of taking a dirty area and making it clean, and I know you like that.

109
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you got to do wash some clothes. I don't know anything about whether you like doing that or not.

110
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:50.340
Jessica Garcia: For some reason I don't like to do my own clothes, but I like doing other people's okay

111
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that that was still a really positive experience. Are you like doing his clothes, and do you get them all the way out of the dryer and fold them and put them away.

112
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh that's satisfying a nice Chris Flat. Flat. Flat nice as those corners and then we hang them up as they need it and off they go. Okay.

113
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.610
Yes.

114
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Simpson satisfaction there. Um, so that's 910 1112 one, two, that's still a pretty full day six hours. That's, that's still a full day of work.

115
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.210
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

116
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

117
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.300
Jessica Garcia: It is so I means I'm working longer day

118
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:48.120
Jessica Garcia: That's probably why. Because then usually well my Sunday, a client is in the hospital. The afternoon one. So, usually after I was done there. I would go to her house until 530

119
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But not on Sunday.

120
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.360
Jessica Garcia: No, because she was in the hospital.

121
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you have normally done on a Sunday during the day.

122
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.600
Jessica Garcia: If I wasn't working.

123
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.530
Uh huh.

124
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.290
Jessica Garcia: Well, it's bad luck to do your laundry on Sundays.

125
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:23.040
Jessica Garcia: So I probably would have just laid here and watch TV or something. Okay.

126
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about that. That's, that's something I hadn't heard what spiritual kind of perspective does that come from educate

127
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.780
Jessica Garcia: They say that

128
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.780
Jessica Garcia: Is it good. Yeah.

129
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:49.980
Jessica Garcia: They say that you're not supposed to wash your clothes on Sundays, because it's the beginning of the week.

130
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.150
Jessica Garcia: And you wash all your good luck away.

131
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But where does that come from.

132
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.540
Jessica Garcia: I don't know. It's a superstitious like for Mexican Mexican superstition.

133
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:13.050
Jessica Garcia: Superstition like they say that you're not supposed to sleep at night because you sweep all your money away. Okay.

134
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.680
Jessica Garcia: You know, our US Mexicans were very superstitious this

135
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your, is your clients Mexican

136
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.920
Jessica Garcia: No he's not.

137
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it you don't cause bad luck.

138
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.910
Jessica Garcia: He's not one

139
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.440
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

140
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not doing the washing of his own. So it's the sweeping have your own space cleaning of your own stuff that's problematic.

141
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:51.960
Jessica Garcia: Okay. Oh, I mean, and either that or I watched on his good luck, go away.

142
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.750
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, okay.

143
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just curious what you where it comes from, where it came from.

144
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

145
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What

146
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.180
Jessica Garcia: So I have an issue because

147
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:17.340
Jessica Garcia: My grandma wants me to go like right now. She called me, and I know she wants me to go over there.

148
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.420
Jessica Garcia: And I had decided that I was gonna

149
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:29.340
Jessica Garcia: Like separate it like only go on the days that I'm getting paid for.

150
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.320
That smart.

151
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.980
Jessica Garcia: But then she calls me and

157
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.170

Jessica Garcia: Sometimes if I do go, I'll go like a little bit late at night.

165
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.550
Jessica Garcia: Like eight or nine and

166
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.380
Jessica Garcia: Go and take them a plate of food or something and then come home.

167
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.590
Jessica Garcia: Um, but then she'll tell me please come over here.

168
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.330

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:44.970
Jessica Garcia: Need you like we we want you guys here or whatever. And I'm like, Okay, yeah, no problem.

170
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.030
Jessica Garcia: But then I'm like, crap. I have so much to do at home.

171
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.710
Jessica Garcia: Okay.

172
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.280
Jessica Garcia: So not really a day off, but just my days to do my stuff around the house.

173
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right. If Sunday. You can't sweep and you can do laundry. And then of course you would probably be looking into those things during the week.

174
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you said to me, You're laughing I'm not laughing You

175
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.860
Jessica Garcia: Are. Yeah, it's true. But I just

176
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.860
Jessica Garcia: Ridiculous.

177
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not true.

178
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.120
Jessica Garcia: No. Okay.

179
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

180
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay but but but it's real like

181
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.850
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, it's true.

182
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So now you have this pressure. So that's what I'm trying to get a sense, you said it happened last week. So I'm trying to understand. Did you just get a text or a call from your grandparents like this morning or last night, like how recent is this pressure

183
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.160
Jessica Garcia: Like around 1050 she called me and I answered.

184
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:08.760
Jessica Garcia: And I told her. Oh, I'm getting ready I'm making the baby breakfast and getting ready because of, you know, my, my therapy appointment that I go

185
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.250
Jessica Garcia: Every Monday and they know about it already.

186
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.620
Jessica Garcia: Okay. And, um,

187
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.950
Jessica Garcia: And she was like, oh, what time is it at

188
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:27.720
Jessica Garcia: And she mentioned to me first. You mentioned to me that she got extra food stamps again and she was really excited about that.

189
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.930
Jessica Garcia: And then

190
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.890
Jessica Garcia: And then she said that

191
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:45.720
Jessica Garcia: Oh, and then she told me, Oh, well, I'll let you go because you it's almost 11 it's 1050 I'll let you go because you have to go to your appointment and I was like okay

192
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.730
Jessica Garcia: But during that time I was like brushing my teeth and stuff so

193
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.120
Jessica Garcia: After that we hung up. And I was like oh my gosh she wants me to go over there.

194
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.460
Jessica Garcia: And I'm deciding

195
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.730
Jessica Garcia: Whether I want to go over there, not like my auntie supposed to be there. She's

196
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.270
Jessica Garcia: Supposed to be them.

197
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:16.050
Jessica Garcia: And she doesn't go like she helped them she'll take them stuff.

198
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.690
Jessica Garcia: Or they need it.

199
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.360
Yes.

200
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.820
Okay.

201
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.490
Jessica Garcia: Like just stuff like that but she just didn't

202
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.880
Jessica Garcia: Do it correctly supposed to go and sit there with them and

203
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:46.920
Jessica Garcia: Clean and which I know that's why she was like August HOURS TO YOU, BECAUSE SHE KNOWS. I'll do it.

204
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.070
Jessica Garcia: I was doing that anyway without getting paid and

205
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:09.780
Jessica Garcia: So that that responsibility is kind of falling on me, like, up until last week I had to correct my grandma because up until last week she like she likes to make these jokes where she's like Oh, I'm gonna fire you.

206
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Dirty

207
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:27.210
Jessica Garcia: Because because you're not doing what you're supposed to do, or you're not good at, like, you're supposed to. I told her. Remember my auntie got mad at me because I was putting hours during the week. I told her she was like

208
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:33.840
Jessica Garcia: She made a comment and then I was like, Well, either way. I'm only getting paid for Monday and Saturday.

209
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:44.280
Jessica Garcia: So all the other days that I come, it's just because I want to, and I do it. You know, I don't even have to say it.

210
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.500
Jessica Garcia: I don't have to say that because I do it, I don't know how to explain it.

211
00:19:50.010 --> 00:20:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But you did that part. So this is new. You actually did communicate with her. Hey Grandma I as far as like the work part. All joking aside. I'm the days that I'm being paid or Monday and Saturday.

212
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this really about you love your grandparents your auntie isn't doing the kind of job that you know that she should be doing.

213
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what this really about

214
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:32.370
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, like the burdens for not burden, but like the responsibilities falling on me and my grandma needs they need somebody there. They need somebody like you know

215
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.310
Jessica Garcia: To be there and it's just

216
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:45.450
Jessica Garcia: When I do it out of the out of my life, my own will, you know, it's, it's one thing, but when it's expected

217
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.810
Jessica Garcia: That's a completely different.

218
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.150
What

219
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What is he got it. You got a little face. What do you got

220
00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.410
Jessica Garcia: He just just me.

221
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.490
A shish.

222
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He

223
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Should he should just you.

224
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just got the shirt. He's got the shirt now.

225
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.050
Jessica Garcia: I can

226
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna, I'm gonna go use the restroom. I'll be right back. So go take care of him doing something fun to do. I'll be right back.

227
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.230
Jessica Garcia: Okay, thank you.

228
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.600
Jessica Garcia: What do you want to watch Dexter.

229
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.970
Jessica Garcia: No doctor

230
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:36.660
Jessica Garcia: Huh.

231
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm back here. When you're ready,

232
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.750
Okay.

233
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.510
Jessica Garcia: Sorry.

234
00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry mom or his articulation is just improving I can tell what he's saying.

235
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:09.990
Jessica Garcia: He's working so hard to put together sentences.

236
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a great one.

237
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: While you were talking about how you deal with

238
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know this boundary of wanting time your time.

239
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think you have to correct me.

240
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it is it about

241
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Your grandparents.

242
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Are putting on you a request that really belongs with your auntie.

243
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what it kind of comes down to

244
00:24:51.480 --> 00:25:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is an interesting place because I'm it's really, it's up to you what you what you want to do with it. This could be an opportunity for you to practice those really new sort of boundary skills.

245
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you already have this playful way with your grandma right you already have this kind of joke going

246
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So you could kind of use, that if you wanted to, to kind of continue with the joking and say, well, maybe you should talk to you know what, what's your aunties name.

247
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Kathy. Kathy. Yeah, well it's Kathy's day, maybe you should go tell her, you're about to can her hahaha

248
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.650
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

249
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but we got to keep talking, because it's not that simple. And I know that. So I want to know the real deal. I really want to know.

250
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Has your grandma actually had a conversation with Kathy and said, Kathy, how come you don't do my laundry or clean my dishes.

251
00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.970
Jessica Garcia: Well,

252
00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:08.400
Jessica Garcia: Okay. The thing with my grandma is that, to me, she'll say one thing.

253
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:17.490
Jessica Garcia: And she'll be upset and this and that. But then my auntie goes around and

254
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.650
Jessica Garcia: She talks today she tells them all my my

255
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.750
Jessica Garcia: My st parents. My, my, St. Parents with the mask of of

256
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.510
Jessica Garcia: Silver like okay now I know how to explain it in English.

257
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, does she have godparents or spiritual parents or something.

258
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:49.050
Jessica Garcia: No, just she's saying that they're saints calling them saints and saying, but they have a mask of gold.

259
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And but our issue referring to

260
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:58.050
Jessica Garcia: You, my grandparents, my grandparents, my parents, her parents. My grandparents.

261
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.550
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

262
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what, let me just see if I'm getting what you're saying.

263
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That Kathy is not held accountable for

264
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Goal as a caregiver, but by kissing her parents ass.

265
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that basically it

266
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry about the swearing. I kind of forgot the little he's like well he's gonna be like this. Shush.

267
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.350
Jessica Garcia: He's used to it.

268
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Trust me. Sure, sure. On the therapist.

269
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.210
Jessica Garcia: That's his job.

270
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

271
00:27:44.880 --> 00:28:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, so there are a lot of challenges with this number one, you're not only are you working for family you're working with family and those are dual relationships. Whenever there's dual relationships is gonna get sticky period going to be sticky.

272
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.330
Jessica Garcia: And it's the same and who

273
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:16.800
Jessica Garcia: Who got me a job with that company and I never got paid and like you went under, and stuff like that.

274
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's even on some maybe some low grade resentment towards for maybe from you a little bit

275
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.120
Yeah.

276
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:27.930
Jessica Garcia: Pretty much.

277
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

278
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I, I'm perfectly capable of not swearing. You didn't have to leave the room if it was about me.

279
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.680
Jessica Garcia: Know it's cuz he's like gonna be

280
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.490
Jessica Garcia: He's gonna be like mom mom mom mom mom, man.

281
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I'm telling you, I do have, I do have other words I can use

282
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.250
Know,

283
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.210
Jessica Garcia: Stuff like that too. It's okay.

284
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so we're okay so let's come back to to this being

285
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Additionally, complicated with these other things. So let's come back to what you want, but I know I heard you say is I want Mondays, Tuesdays off. I heard that.

286
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You had Mondays and Tuesdays off.

287
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you started working. Is that right,

288
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You are you basically home or were you going over

289
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You were right. So Kathy was handling it before.

290
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, was it not W judge it meaning she was there, over there at the grandparents.

291
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:38.640
Um,

292
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.610
Jessica Garcia: No she doesn't.

293
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Mondays and Tuesdays.

294
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.170
Jessica Garcia: Who she just doesn't like

295
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:56.520
Jessica Garcia: Either that, or she'll go like for like an hour, two hours and sit there with my grandparents and then she'll leave because she door dashes.

296
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here again, Jessica. I'm ignorant. I can't tell what it is yet so you're going to have to push back at me and say, No, no, no, that's not it.

297
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell if what's missing is hey, Kathy. Um, I keep getting calls from from Nana wanting me to come over

298
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I do need money. And I'd like to bill for that. What time. Were you planning on coming over, because I, I like to help them out. Is that going to be a problem with your budgeting your money for the week. Do you want to make a change, because they keep calling me

299
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice what I just did right now. I did a role play of you talking to Kathy.

300
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, I'm ignorant and I don't know really what's going on with you, Jessica. I can't tell if that's the piece that's missing.

301
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell if you've already thought about that, and you're like, duh. Like, I mean, of course, or it's like, well, you couldn't possibly not a, not in the Mexican culture, you can't talk to people like that. Are you insane.

302
00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I have, like, I have no idea. I have no idea. So educate me what's really what's the need here is this year assertiveness, is it you're afraid of Kathy's manipulation or I don't know what it is. I can't tell.

303
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's work with the one I just did that and see what happened when you saw me doing a little role play me talking to Kathy. I was friendly, wasn't it

304
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um, do you picture her being pissed off at me, even in that call.

305
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.350
Jessica Garcia: No, but

306
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:43.410
Jessica Garcia: She just won't like she won't like it like they have it. They have their own agreement.

307
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.560
Jessica Garcia: And

308
00:31:50.430 --> 00:32:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wait, I got I got wait one more piece. How do you know this agreement, how did you come about learning the agreement. How did you run across it.

309
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:11.040
Jessica Garcia: Because I already pushed for it. I had already like, hey, you know what, I'll do it all step in, you know,

310
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.910
Jessica Garcia: If she's not doing what she's supposed to do.

311
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And she said that to the grandparents, is that correct

312
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:32.070
Jessica Garcia: Yes. And then I also set it to my auntie. I also because she. It was just the whole thing. But I said to her, that like, you know, my grandma She needs help.

313
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:40.380
Jessica Garcia: She needs help. And she complains a lot about you know how you're not doing anything.

314
00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:48.600
Jessica Garcia: Because she called in and told my mom a bunch of stuff. So I called her and told her you know I'm an adult. You can call me.

315
00:32:49.290 --> 00:33:05.730
Jessica Garcia: And talk to me. I won't be disrespectful. But at the same time, you know, my grandma She complains a lot about you too, and that you're not doing your job and then to my grandma has been saying that she's been making comments to her.

316
00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:12.810
Jessica Garcia: So she'll make comments to her and say, Hey, you know, well if you're not going to do it, then I'll find somebody else who can

317
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.030
Jessica Garcia: And

318
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's grandma talking to you.

319
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:18.840
Jessica Garcia: To my auntie.

320
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:39.630
Jessica Garcia: And then the next couple of days. My auntie's like extra kissing ass and that my grandpa, my grandma just doesn't end up saying anything because she's you know so I'm to the point where I'm like,

321
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.080
Jessica Garcia: They're not doing anything about it. But now,

322
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:55.410
Jessica Garcia: I'm here where my grandma wants me to go over there, but at the same time I'm expected to take care of my household. Otherwise, I'm not doing my job as

323
00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you and I will have to disagree on that part. I don't care if the house is a mess. I don't care that that part about the woman thing.

324
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're being a woman doesn't change because the floor isn't slept on a Tuesday night or Sunday night or something like that, you're, you're a woman regardless. So I think what you just said was, you're going to hear from remote about it.

325
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:21.960
Jessica Garcia: No.

326
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, then this is a self image.

327
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:25.620
Yeah.

328
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:31.800
Jessica Garcia: Well, okay. I won't hear from Ramon, but

329
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:44.250
Jessica Garcia: It's like an unspoken thing because of the way he grew up the way his mom is god bless her soul. She

330
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:59.700
Jessica Garcia: works full time job comes home, make sure that there's dinner on the table serves them picks up their plates washing their clothes. So it's like that and his family to like he's Mexican as well. And so

331
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:12.750
Jessica Garcia: I've had like our aunt and uncle, my aunt and my aunt and uncle. I talked to us about and my uncle was like you're supposed to be taking care of

332
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:25.590
Jessica Garcia: Make sure that no matter what you're taking care of your house to and then it was said in front of him. And it's just the whole thing. Like it's it's what's expected of me. Okay, not from anyone, but from everyone.

333
00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, it's a cultural norm. So, okay, I got you. I get it.

334
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But you cannot be in two places at once we humans, we cannot do it.

335
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

336
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

337
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.350
Jessica Garcia: I'm just gonna have to

338
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.750
Jessica Garcia: Tell my grandma. Okay. But if I go, I'm clocking in

339
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello. Yeah.

340
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.140
Jessica Garcia: But better tell my auntie.

341
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's that. There's better tell my auntie and now there's come back to I overheard as I had this barrage of texts coming in at my attention. Got a little sidetracked. But I want to hear something. I thought I heard you give me an example of how you communicated with Cassie.

342
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was. Was it you, saying, hey, but they've been complaining about you have you did you talk to Kathy like that.

343
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, is that the only way you've talked to her, or has there also been an approach of

344
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Not accusations, but rather than and justifications, but rather the way I did it right.

345
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.500
Jessica Garcia: Now, there hasn't been

346
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe that's that's the bridge between all or nothing that bridge of instead of dumping it on grandparents.

347
00:36:49.830 --> 00:37:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you can because it's there. The one hiring you. But you have decided to blend family and work together. God bless you. This is not an easy thing to do. It takes a really unique set of skills to pull this off and the skills that it needs is clear boundaries. I mean, clear.

348
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can reset them and say hey guys, since we're family. We're also doing this work thing just to reiterate, Mondays and Tuesdays. That's what I do.

349
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of a keep my house together, but I'm willing to clock in one or two hours, just let me know when you set the limit. But you let them both know what that is. You guys have any concerns about that. What are they let me know now.

350
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is not the same thing as justifying things like people have been complaining about you. I'm better than you know Kathy what

351
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.930
Jessica Garcia: Kind of, I was kind of pissed off at her.

352
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, you can you can tell

353
00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but it doesn't work it. Whatever it is, it's not working because now you're in distress and now there's this conflict and it might be, it might be

354
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: cleared up with one solid communication, maybe with the both of them and saying what you just did.

355
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But not making demands of grandma, but rather, Grandma. Do you want to be. I have this conversation with all three of us in the room. Do you want me to write an email and you write an email already together.

356
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you want to do this because I keep I keep having conflicting feelings as as your, you know, your granddaughter. I want you safe, healthy, happy and taking care of, um, but as an employee.

357
00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a real challenge happening here because

358
00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I do need to earn a living. And we have this arrangement, but Kathy seems to have this arrangement with you too, and they're they're bumping their, their odd sometimes. So I'm wondering if we can get clear on the work part

359
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And just because you've revisited it before, doesn't mean you can't revisit it again. And maybe that's what's happening because maybe

360
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe Kathy has changed. Maybe she's more open, maybe she really doesn't want to go there for six hours on Monday, and she'd be willing to give up those couple hours but let her answer it for herself.

361
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do that. If I'm Kathy.

362
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just play with it. You don't have to do anything because it's just me, but if it, if it was a real conversation with Kathy and I was her, how would it sound. If you were to speak your truth to me if I'm Kathy.

363
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.720
Jessica Garcia: I would say

364
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.910
Jessica Garcia: Hey yeah um

365
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:11.070
Jessica Garcia: So my grandma's calling me and telling me that you want me

366
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.330
Jessica Garcia: To go with her grocery shopping

367
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.700
Jessica Garcia: Which I'm pretty sure that's what she's gonna say because they need, they can

368
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hang on, keep with the role play

369
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:29.880
Jessica Garcia: I wouldn't mind.

370
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:45.510
Jessica Garcia: Picking up those few hours. If for some reason you can't make it, or, or I wouldn't mind like going with her, you know, clocking in those just a few hours.

371
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.460
Jessica Garcia: Um,

372
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.430
Jessica Garcia: If you want to talk out

373
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard, isn't it, because you're trying to avoid a conflict, aren't you

374
00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yeah okay so

375
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:06.300
Jessica Garcia: Okay, so there's that part of me. And then there's this other part of me that's like

376
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.750
Jessica Garcia: You know, yeah.

377
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know. I'm with you, girl, but we end up what we end up doing is we're going to do your first version. We're going to do that one. It's just you're going to put, if you can sort of the

378
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The burden of answering the question on her shoulders a little sooner. Okay.

379
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So something kind of like this.

380
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey TIA just heard from from Nana. She wants to bed. She's asking me to go shopping for a couple hours are you okay if I clock in from 12 to two. Is that going to kind of throw off your, your schedule and your budget.

381
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.640
And she answers.

382
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hear the difference

383
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.490
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I need to write that down. Because I'm gonna forget it.

384
00:41:58.350 --> 00:41:59.430
Jessica Garcia: Give me one second.

385
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:16.170
Jessica Garcia: GUYS DIDN'T EVEN just like

386
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Already I know that's because you guys aren't used to talk

387
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.050
Jessica Garcia: We're not know

388
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're wrapped up in the feeling of apprehension, Jessica. You're wrapped up in the emotion of what happened. And so you're not able to notice how even memory didn't, it didn't, it didn't stick because it's like

389
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's this emotional response. That's the predominant thing but not with me because will a there's no threat of love loss. There's no threat of conflict. This is just make believe in here.

390
00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you. You're going to have to actually get ready for that call, you're going to have to breathe. Do the belly breathing, you're going to have to do some visualization, you're gonna have to tell yourself.

391
00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I am so worth is all it is is money. Love is not on the line. It's just some money. Um, and this woman might be unreasonable, but I'm going to let her answer.

392
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If the answer's no. Jessica, the answer's no. And then guess what, when your, your, your Nana gives you a call. You say, yeah, I spoke with Tina. She said it doesn't work for her schedule. I would encourage you to give her a quick call

393
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

394
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Amen. That's it. You can look what I do as soon as I possibly can. I get it off of my shoulders and where do I put it

395
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: where they belong.

396
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: where it belongs. Oh, did you already asked him, did you ask her, did you already asked her, he put it here, put on grandma right asking her a question.

397
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You already did your part you're already kind of you danced you did the dance you danced around and you asked called up. So we're going to, you want to do it again.

398
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.290
Jessica Garcia: Yeah okay so

399
00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what I said, but I'll try it again. So it's, um, hey, to how you doing, I'm manages to give me a quick call and asked me to go shopping from 12 to two

400
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm cool with that. But I do want to clock in, is that going to mess up your, your, your budget. The, the money wanted this week because I do want to get paid for those couple hours. Is that going to mess with with your plans this week, or can that work for you.

401
00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I it's a forced. It's a closed ended question. So what I did is I put all the meaningful information in the question. So she only has two choices. Yes. No.

402
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: She can either say yes yeah that messes with me. I had planned all this money. Okay. Will you watch what I do. Will you let let her know or do you want me to to call Nan and let her know that

403
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want me to clock in those are forced choices to there's either I call until I Nana that I can't work or you call they're forced

404
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.990
Jessica Garcia: I just need to not worry about what's going to happen between them, because I already

405
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, like go let go.

406
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Let them let let this is because here's the thing that's you getting into family relationship right in there as family members. We try to protect each other's feelings, but if this is a job. Listen for a second. Just imagine

407
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: These were employees and this was an employer watch it changes, doesn't it. Hey, hey, hey, Benny. I'm

408
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A client Fred is asking me to come in. I didn't know. Did you already booked those hours you already have it set

409
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Oh, you don't. Okay. Well, he just called me and asked me to go from from 12 to one to 12 to two. I'm gonna go over there and do it was that messing with any of your schedule it wasn't okay, cool, cool, cool. All right. Well, I'll talk to you later.

410
00:45:52.050 --> 00:46:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not this not the there's no dual relationship. It's just about compensation. We work. We work, cuz we make money. That's why we do it.

411
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're respectful, you are checking in to say, oh, this is kind of a weird day. This is usually my day is my day off. But you know when I kind of need a little extra cash. So it's not messing with your budgeting with your expected income.

412
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is okay with you. Is it all the same to you if I just go do it for two hours.

413
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you wait for the answer, kind of, be prepared if it's. Yes. Okay, cool, cool, cool. I'll talk to you later. If it's no okay then the closed ended question is, do you want me to tell Mr. Peterson that you're going to clock in, or do you want to tell them your clock in and you do the shopping

414
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: See, I was closing and he has to pick the two, you just presented

415
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.870
Jessica Garcia: closed ended questions.

416
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning they either they do this one, which is am I going to call Nana and tell her that I'm going to clock in, or are you going to tell her that you're clocking in those are the two choices.

417
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if it's her know if she says no, that's like my day and I need the money around and you say okay are you going to be the one to tell Nana that you don't want me doing that or do you want me to be the one to call her and tell her that you declined my offer

418
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:13.920
Jessica Garcia: They're closing it

419
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: He has two choices, each time.

420
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:24.960
Jessica Garcia: What I'm trying to decide now is whether I'm going to call my grandma and figure out, figure out what she was gonna say

421
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.980
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, or just yeah I should

422
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because you you guys have noticed that there's like when I listened to you, there's, there's

423
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: There's an understanding. There's a superstition. There's a belief, there's an unspoken rule. There's all this unspoken stuff. And I don't know if you've noticed in here. Everything is like laid out raw

424
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really different. And it can feel abrupt and unusual for family system when they're not used to

425
00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying things directly. But look what happens when you end up being pissed off at each other, boy, then you really say some direct stuff. Don't you

426
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So why wait. Why wait when it's ugly, why not do it when it's chill and we acted direct we ask a direct question. So I don't know what. So is it is it Nana.

427
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You called me earlier, is it that you want me to go shopping. From about 12 to two. I was about to call it and see if it's going to mess with her her schedule is, is, is that what you want it so that I'm real clear when I call to is this what you wanted.

428
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That seems easy enough. No. Yeah.

429
00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're but you're in charge of keeping it on content because she could still be playing the silly game. Well, you better. You know, I'm going to fire you little cutie.

430
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: She might still want to play that game. Your job is to see right that call is not you as GRANDDAUGHTER THAT CALL is employee.

431
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to know which lane, you're in, you're employing

432
00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I think unless because you want money so you. Which is it, you got to pick which lane, you're in

433
00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's just swinging by on a Tuesday night just to drop off, you know, a covered dish BECAUSE YOU HAD LEFTOVER enchiladas. Well, then your, your granddaughter, but you decide not other people you decide which

434
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.370
Jessica Garcia: I think it's more so setting the boundary

435
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.960
Jessica Garcia: It's

436
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. It's not easy.

437
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:23.340
Jessica Garcia: Yeah, I'm

438
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier.

439
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But the earlier you do it like. Now, the more people will go. Okay, so she's. She knows what she wants, I, I'm gonna have to

440
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you not see that now they might keep pushing and pushing and pushing up against it. Your job is you just keep showing up with your boundaries. This is what I am eight. The basic philosophy behind it is

441
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This

442
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: This amount is what I have to give today. I can go from 12 to two

443
00:49:56.310 --> 00:50:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If it isn't, then, well then you give, I can go from one to two give what you have to give without resentment.

444
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: If you accept the agreement. I'm going to get paid for those two hours. Well then you agreed to it. There's, there's, that's it. You made a commitment, then okay then you stick with it, but

445
00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: In the workplace. It's clarity. This is what I do and this is the compensation, I get

446
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, it's hard.

447
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In a family system when everything's been what's called a meta communication, where it's like

448
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know what to do. You've been in you've been raised in this family you know that you're supposed to get up early and you're supposed to clean.

449
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure the kitchens put together so that the man comes in and everything's all tidy and he's just feels like is this, you know, I know that there are there are, you know, norms in every family.

450
00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So you notice that it's you, setting a boundary, isn't it.

451
00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:56.700
Jessica Garcia: Yeah.

452
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: They're easier said than done. These are hard to do.

453
00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.410
Jessica Garcia: I think the more that I talk about it, the more I'm like

454
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:18.480
Jessica Garcia: I don't care who gets her like this is what it is. And that's it. Like I'm starting to realize how ridiculous. I was just in my own head, I guess.

455
00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it weird though hurt your grandma benefits from clearly knowing when someone's going to help her.

456
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have an income your auntie isn't thrown off by a surprise. Like why is Jessica here up on the dance.

457
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that interesting that you go to somehow you're at fault for hurting someone when really what this does is give people choice, it gives

458
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It gives them a choice to speak and say, Oh, she she could just as to could just as easily be like

459
00:51:51.330 --> 00:52:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank goodness I'm so busy today. I was afraid she was gonna call me. She just called me 20 minutes to go, and I can't do it. We don't know what she's going to do, let her answer, hold on to yourself.

460
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And

461
00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're going to have to deal with the outcome. Now, I don't know what she's going to say, but

462
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Her reaction is her reaction.

463
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That is what makes it difficult is I don't want anyone to think negatively of me. And so, yes, we are in a constant sort of Battle of impression management. I want to be seen this way and this way. I want to be seen this way.

464
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what it is to be human, you know, but as an employee.

465
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Come on this is about a work schedule.

466
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.830
Jessica Garcia: It sure

467
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, put yourself in that zone. And so your tone of voice changes.

468
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You got a list of kind of what you can say do an if then if she says no, this is what I'll say if she says yes, this is what I'll say, and have it all written out you she doesn't know you have a piece of paper in front of you, you can be ready. She doesn't know when you're on the phone.

469
00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:57.300
Jessica Garcia: That's so true.

470
00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Believe me, I've done it. I've had to turn down jobs. And I'm like,

471
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I still do. It makes me sick. I'm like, I just, I know that this poor woman is going to want she's gonna she was so counting on me, but I can't do it.

472
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote it out first.

473
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This

474
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.020
Yeah.

475
00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And it went just fine. And she's like, Oh, okay. Well thanks for letting me know. Sooner than later, doggone it, you know, I wanted to work with you and you know so

476
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we're wired to care about other people. You can't jump over that we're not robots, even though I say stay in your lane and be the employee. We're a human. We care about what people think.

477
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you got a plan.

478
00:53:52.350 --> 00:54:02.610
Jessica Garcia: Yes, I do. And I'm going to use that plan with everything because I'm starting to think about where I could use this kind of communication.

479
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, it shows up in a lot of places, doesn't it. Yeah.

480
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:08.640
Jessica Garcia: Thank you.

481
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.360
Sure.

482
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to stick with the system we've got here of Mondays at 11

483
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:16.290
Jessica Garcia: Yes.

484
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:16.980
Do you

485
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need me to message. The doctor will I get to see you tomorrow.

486
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.580
Jessica Garcia: Tomorrow, yes.

487
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so my Nana.

488
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.090
Jessica Garcia: Okay, thank you.

489
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I got

490
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: My taste.
