55
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.010
Joey Raya: Nothing I can really think of offhand.

56
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:40.950
Joey Raya: You know it's despite the longevity of my illness. I'm actually I've been feeling better. Last week I went to Disneyland and

57
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.320
Joey Raya: I didn't use a little cart.

58
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:58.440
Joey Raya: At all. You know that because the time before that I did use a cart. But this time I didn't, you know, we were there for about 10 hours, you know, and it wasn't terrible

59
00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.910
That's good.

60
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.620
Joey Raya: And

61
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.750
Joey Raya: So it's a

62
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.560
Joey Raya: It's been getting better, but I just want to get. I want to get it fixed and figure out what it is.

63
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:25.650
Joey Raya: That way, you know, I can go back to work, because I have to be 100% when I go back to work, you know, and I've lost almost 80 pounds.

64
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:39.630
Joey Raya: And not just not just fat but but muscle mass as well, you know, and in fact, just real quick. So I play. I still play music I'm in a band and

65
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:47.610
Joey Raya: We were at our studio on Sunday rehearsing and after rehearsal, we were hanging out talking outside and there happened to be a car accident right there.

66
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:59.520
Joey Raya: And so I went over to help. And, you know, the police came and you know I ended up, you know, helping the police there you know extricate the guy from the car and

67
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:16.500
Joey Raya: Got them all settled, and then the fire department showed up and and you know I handed it off and came back, but it was just, it was, you know, I realized that I need to get my my strength back. And so I need to also figure out a

68
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.620
Joey Raya: Nutrition regiment. In order to do that.

69
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, any past childhood trauma any

70
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.190
Joey Raya: Yeah, when I was 16 I was

71
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.160
Joey Raya: Kidnapped slash carjacked type of thing.

72
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:47.400
Joey Raya: And held for about, about three to four hours and then released it was in the it was a gang member

73
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.010
Joey Raya: You know, long story short,

74
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.350
Joey Raya: You know they he picked us up at knifepoint I was with a friend of mine. They drove us. He made us drive around

75
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:07.230
Joey Raya: You know, went to the ATM went to my friend's house and took computer parts and you know cameras and stuff and

76
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:18.630
Joey Raya: Went to a parking lot went through the stuff gave back what he didn't want. Drove us around and then pulled into some dark alley.

77
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:30.150
Joey Raya: And whistled a bunch of dudes came out he got out of the car pointed down the alley said drive that way. Turn right and you'll be at this street and that was pretty much at

78
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.850
Joey Raya: The cops never found anybody in fact they accused us of

79
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.450
Joey Raya: Taking this stuff and making up the story.

80
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:48.510
Joey Raya: So, but, um, you know, it's made me a little bit more aware of my surroundings. Now, and

81
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.480
Joey Raya: I mean it's it's pretty traumatic and

82
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.300
Joey Raya: I don't, I'm not really sure how it affects me now, to be honest. Okay.

83
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, any

84
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: childhood abuse. I don't know. No. Okay.

85
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:13.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what is it that you would like to get out of working with bright heart besides pain management. Are there issues that you would like to

86
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work on personal issues.

87
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:28.710
Joey Raya: Nothing I can think of offhand. I mean, I have, you know, self esteem issues, but I think you know that's something everybody everybody deals with

88
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:39.030
Joey Raya: But, but mainly I came to bright heart for for the pain management and to be quite honest, I'm a little blown away with how

89
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.880
Joey Raya: What's the word I want to say interactive, for lack of a better term, but

90
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:55.710
Joey Raya: You know I'm, you know, speaking with you. I had a group session. You know, I saw one doctor here I have an appointment with a different doctor to talk to and

91
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.560
Joey Raya: It's really nice to to see that hands on. There it is.

92
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.120
The hands on approach.

93
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so.

94
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, at in the comfort of your own home to that's

95
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About it, you know, you don't have to fight traffic or anything else.

96
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.470
Joey Raya: Real, real quick. I'm sorry, I meant to tell you this before we get started.

97
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.410
Joey Raya: I have a dentist appointment at 230 and the office is about 10 minutes away and

98
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.190
Joey Raya: I just wanted to

99
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.490
Joey Raya: Give you a heads up and I forgot to do that. So I apologize.

100
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, it's okay, we, you know, all the questions on the, on the, on your history have already done so, you know, we actually are done with that piece.

101
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:47.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just asking you what it is if there's anything that you want to work on. Personally, I would find out who your therapist is if you have one assigned and

102
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:57.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you're going to engage in therapy sessions with them, or if you're just going to work with a doctor and be in the group there you know group check in weekly

103
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good that they're connecting you up with the doctor so fast.

104
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.110
Joey Raya: You know, yeah. Yeah, it was great. I

105
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.510
Joey Raya: Actually, I ended up in the emergency room and

106
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:23.040
Joey Raya: You know I told the ER doctor there. I said, you know, this is the medication. I'm on and you know I can't find everybody that that is prescribing, it is prescribing it for for opiate

107
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:32.010
Joey Raya: Withdrawal and and that's not when I'm taking it foreign team for actual pain management. So I guess there's a special licensure.

108
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.470
Joey Raya: Here in California for that.

109
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.370
Joey Raya: And so I was unable to find anybody around me.

110
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:48.180
Joey Raya: That was able to do that for me. And so when I spoke to the ER doctor he recommended you guys and you guys have been wonderful.

111
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome, awesome. What what area do you live in.

112
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.570
Joey Raya: I live in Orange County, California.

113
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.340
Oh ok so I

114
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.140
Joey Raya: Like

115
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.250
Joey Raya: I'm in the county south of La

116
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

117
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.810
Joey Raya: Yeah, I'm about an hour and 15 minutes from him from LA. Okay.

118
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.980
Um,

119
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm in Sacramento. I could definitely

120
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:21.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know some doctors here, but I think that our doctors that we have with bright heart and I could be biased.

121
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I think that they are exceptional and what they do and can definitely gear you in, you know, the right direction on where to get the best help

122
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, definitely. How has the medication been helping so far since you've been on it with bright heart.

123
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.230
Joey Raya: It's been, it's been great, actually, he

124
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.280
Joey Raya: The doctor. I've been working with actually bumped it up.

125
00:12:49.500 --> 00:13:01.860
Joey Raya: To milligrams and it's made just a huge difference. And, you know, and I was thinking two milligrams, that's you know it doesn't seem like very much but

126
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:15.030
Joey Raya: You know I'm forgetting about the physiology of of everything and the delivery system and all that kind of stuff. So, but no, it's been it's been great. My only concern and I think I have an appointment with him.

127
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:24.810
Joey Raya: I think next week. On Tuesday, or might be tomorrow. I don't know. I have like multiple appointments and I can't keep track of who its way ahead.

128
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.750
Joey Raya: About say taken in the morning I but about see

129
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:41.430
Joey Raya: Maybe 334 O'clock ish and the pain starts to kind of

130
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.420
Joey Raya: Kind of do again and my medication is only a twice a day thing. So what I've been doing is

131
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.670
Joey Raya: taking the medication around that time.

132
00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:03.840
Joey Raya: And then by the time it wears off again I'm asleep, and then when I get up in the morning. I just take it again. So I just going, I'm going to talk to him and see if there's a way to

133
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.410
Joey Raya: Extend it so I don't have that period where the pain kind of bumps up a little bit.

134
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:19.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. Definitely. Because the idea is to for you to be able to function without having all of that pain. Yeah.

135
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, well, we are done.

136
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:23.460

138
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:40.050

139
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.180

142
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.170

143
00:14:52.230 --> 00:15:01.320
Joey Raya: I know, yeah. The problem is as well. Just real quick, so I'm a smoker and I've been really good with keeping the stains away in

144
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.630
Joey Raya: Because I've had the pancreatitis for so long. I haven't lost so much weight.

145
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:17.340
