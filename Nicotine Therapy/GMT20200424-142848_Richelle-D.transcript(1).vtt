00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.310

Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, so how is the How is she dealing with the younger one

27
00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.560
Jennifer C.: She's really good with them. I mean, it's only for, like, what, five or six hours tops, so it's not too bad.

28
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.470
Richelle Direny: Oh, you mean between that you have

29
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.990
Jennifer C.: Yeah, well, I'm only gone for like five, maybe six hours and I'm only a minute down the road, literally one minute.

30
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.980
Richelle Direny: Oh ok ok ok the Dollar General is is close.

31
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.100
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

32
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.160
Jennifer C.: So it's not you know it's not too bad.

33
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.170
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's good.

34
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.000
Richelle Direny: That's good.

35
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.900
Richelle Direny: Okay, so how is there, how was everything I know it's I'm a struggle to laugh because

36
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.440
Your

37
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.160
Richelle Direny: Your husband, you said is incarcerated. Right.

38
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.460
Jennifer C.: Yeah. And I just, they just actually locked him down because I guess one of the employees has corona.

39
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.950
Jennifer C.: So,

40
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.660
Jennifer C.: I was thinking I'm I might just write a letter to the governor

41
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.800
Richelle Direny: To get him released

42
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.560
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

43
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.010
Jennifer C.: Because you know they released all these pregnant women that just had kids or are about to have kids that have eight months left and

44
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:26.100
Jennifer C.: Have never been in trouble before and he's got three kids, he's never been in trouble before and he's only got about eight months left. I don't see the difference between him and a woman, you know,

45
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:40.380
Richelle Direny: Well, I guess the differences that that you because when you when you give birth. I mean, I don't know how the system works. But if you give birth in the prison, don't you have the opportunity to have your kids in the prison with you.

46
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.240
Jennifer C.: Um, I don't know.

47
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.490
Richelle Direny: I thought that they do they, some of them get to keep the babies with them in there for a little while and they have everything set up.

48
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.710
Jennifer C.: For them to keep the baby. I mean,

49
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.100
Richelle Direny: I was watching. They don't have, they have like a documentary. They have like

50
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.160
Jennifer C.: Is it, you know.

51
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.890
Richelle Direny: Well then how some of these

52
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.670
Jennifer C.: These

53
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.290
Richelle Direny: I mean going there already predicting

54
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.410
Jennifer C.: Yeah, some of them do, like, some of them are already pregnant. Some of them probably get pregnant, I would imagine.

55
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.490
Jennifer C.: I, I still don't see the difference between a man and a woman. A woman having kids in a man having again.

56
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.460
Jennifer C.: You know,

57
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.480
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

58
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.520
Jennifer C.: I don't know. I don't see gender and stuff like everybody else does, I guess.

59
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.160
Richelle Direny: I mean, there's some things that some things has to be applied. I mean, there's, there's

60
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:50.700
Richelle Direny: There is a day when it comes on to gender, but there. There are other things like we pick and choose how we want to apply it right

61
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.450
Richelle Direny: The circumstances in the situation. I mean you so you know you have to think about it from

62
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:13.080
Richelle Direny: Your perspective of, you know, your husband having three kids in you're out. You're out having to care for your kids on your own. So you're looking at it from the standpoint of at this point I want equality, because it's hard to take your three kids out here.

63
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.650
Jennifer C.: Right.

64
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.940
Richelle Direny: And I need the help. So you're

65
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:22.470
Jennifer C.: I mean, honestly, like, Well, honestly, like I could care less about the hell because right now at this point, I got this, you know,

66
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.300
Mm hmm.

67
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.110
Richelle Direny: Moments that it's challenging

68
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.600
Jennifer C.: Oh yeah, I do. But

69
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.430
Jennifer C.: I just don't want him to have this one to get sick and be stuck in a prison or potentially dying.

70
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.330
Richelle Direny: Because he's, he because of

71
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.790
Jennifer C.: The fact that it wasn't as bad as it was

72
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.560
Jennifer C.: Before someone there was sick. I didn't

73
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.550
Jennifer C.: When they are sick.

74
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.720
Mm hmm.

75
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.980
Jennifer C.: And prisons are Petri dishes.

76
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.760
Jennifer C.: So now we can potentially spread like

77
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.580
Richelle Direny: Your thing is breaking up now. I think they're driving that.

78
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.190
Jennifer C.: They really did.

79
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.860
Jennifer C.: Yeah, you know,

80
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.840
Richelle Direny: You were breaking up for a little bit there.

81
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:32.610
Jennifer C.: Um, what I was saying was, like, I didn't worry about it as much before because he he wasn't it, you know, there wasn't someone they're saying

82
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.960
Mm hmm.

83
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.620
Jennifer C.: And now, now it's like

84
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.190
Jennifer C.: It's a petri dish of sickness.

85
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:52.620
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because it's not just the coronavirus coronavirus is all you hear about and coronavirus know about. So right now, coronavirus is going to be your big thing in comparison to

86
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.320
Richelle Direny: You know, other things that he can he can contract or he can get while

87
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.610
Jennifer C.: Incarcerated right

88
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:06.930
Jennifer C.: And he's he's got like died, they found out when he was in there that he's diabetic, um,

89
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.320
Jennifer C.: It's just like, I don't know.

90
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.930
Richelle Direny: I think it's so what is it safe to say that before you. Everything is going to be

91
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.850
Richelle Direny: Heightened anything that you hear is going to be heightened because, I mean,

92
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:35.520
Richelle Direny: Connected to you. This is your spousal everything that you hear, even if you hear there's a breakout of hepatitis, you're going to have the same reaction, like all it released a release and because there's a break.

93
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.210
Jennifer C.: Right.

94
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.520
Jennifer C.: Yeah, so that's well not maybe hepatitis is curable.

95
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.980
Richelle Direny: Well, hypothetically speaking, isn't the corona somewhat careful. It's all about

96
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.690
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I just don't want them, I guess.

97
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.680
Richelle Direny: Anything, anything, um,

98
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.180
Jennifer C.: But isn't there.

99
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.140
Richelle Direny: Don't you think that the the coronavirus is curable.

100
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.130
Jennifer C.: I mean, if

101
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.610
Richelle Direny: You're breaking

102
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.040
He

103
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.950
Jennifer C.: But it's not right.

104
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.860
You're breaking okay now.

105
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.330
Jennifer C.: Hello.

106
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.310
Jennifer C.: Yeah, okay.

107
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.280
Jennifer C.: Um,

108
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.170
Jennifer C.: I don't know that it's curable, though.

109
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:13.800
Richelle Direny: It is because you that's in. So this is the thing with the coronavirus it's that you have, you have a lot of people you have more people who has

110
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:26.130
Richelle Direny: Kind of like the flu. You have more people who have recovered from it. Then you have people who have died from it. It's just what they highlight on the news. They do tell you how many people has

111
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.840
Richelle Direny: Has

112
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.980
Richelle Direny: What do you call it that you have a lot of people who has had it.

113
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.630
Richelle Direny: And has gotten really is fine, but it's kind of like, here is the

114
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.330
Richelle Direny: When you watch the news you have like the global

115
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:53.730
Richelle Direny: cases reported. Then you have the deaths. Then you have the people who has, who has had it, but they have what is the one that I just use not

116
00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:09.060
Richelle Direny: Recovered recovered. You have the number of people are recovering when you look at those numbers, the number of people who have recovered, or it's a large number, but what would they focus more on what they kind of highlight more is the amount of

117
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.860
Richelle Direny: Identified cases or reportable cases and the day

118
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:21.150
Richelle Direny: You don't see the Ricoh you don't see a lot and you don't hear a lot about the recovered cases. So there's a lot of

119
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.070
Jennifer C.: You don't think that once

120
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.540
Jennifer C.: Once Trump opens up everything would be shooting for next week.

121
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.380
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

122
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.430
Jennifer C.: Yeah, is that right

123
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but I think once all that happens, it's gonna be like

124
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:49.860
Richelle Direny: Worse. It could be, it could be, it really cool I mean it could. Because now everyone who is somewhat quarantine and I don't think they're opening it up where everybody gets back to business is not as usual, I think it's more of a

125
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.880
Richelle Direny: One. If you're phase two. And remember each state's governor determines how they want to do it.

126
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.380
Jennifer C.: Right, it's

127
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:12.600
Richelle Direny: Up to the governor who determines how they want to do it and how you know they're going to how they're going to open it back up. But in the end, I think when it's all said and done, it's all fear is what governs everyone right now.

128
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:20.610
Richelle Direny: The fear of the unknown. You're just going off of what I'm telling you, and remember your receptors are only

129
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:38.850
Richelle Direny: Receiving what your fear is telling you to receive so oh my god that like 10 died. Okay, but what about the 30 who recovered. No, but 10 died and 100 got it. But what about the 30 who recovered. But we because we're so fearful, we just look at the fact that only 10 died, um,

130
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.660
Richelle Direny: You know, without saying that you need to, you know, you need to be cautious.

131
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.870
Richelle Direny: But when you're thinking from the fear.

132
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.190
Richelle Direny: You, you're not necessarily

133
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.980
Richelle Direny: You know you're not necessarily doing everything from a rational standpoint, so like

134
00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:06.870
Richelle Direny: Even like when it's so the thing is, like, even when I first met you with the thing in this situation like when it comes down to your husband, your thing is that your husband is a way every day. So any

135
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.910
Richelle Direny: Opportunity that you can see

136
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.900
Richelle Direny: For him to come out. That's what you want to hear. You don't want to hear nothing else.

137
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.310
Jennifer C.: Right.

138
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:21.840
Jennifer C.: I don't think about it that much like it's weird, like that. It just sits in the back your mind until it's opened up, you know,

139
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.370
Jennifer C.: Until it goes. I honestly I don't think about it. I don't watch the news.

140
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.470
Jennifer C.: I go to work every day.

141
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.130
Jennifer C.: I, you know, for me it's business as usual.

142
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.120
Mm hmm.

143
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.660
Jennifer C.: So it's, it's just weird like

144
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.720
Richelle Direny: So you mean you don't think about the coronavirus

145
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:50.760
Richelle Direny: Nope. But then when you hear all these people are getting released from prison for whatever the reasons are now it's just like, Oh really, well let me go, let me go look into this. Let me see how

146
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.750
Richelle Direny: It can be right.

147
00:12:52.140 --> 00:13:05.220
Richelle Direny: And that's, that's just how we are naturally. So you're thinking, oh, this is an opportunity. Maybe he can get out. Let me see how because even though for you. You are learning how to

148
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:12.960
Richelle Direny: cope in your present situation, even though you're learning how to because you have to be strong for your children. You can't sit there and milk.

149
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.240
Richelle Direny: Every day and I let it consume you. Because then

150
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.180
Richelle Direny: What's going to happen to your children. So because

151
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.170
Jennifer C.: Our like that.

152
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.160
Haha

153
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.220
Jennifer C.: They didn't like that.

154
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.080
Richelle Direny: Exactly. So we go

155
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.920
Jennifer C.: In every day.

156
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:35.070
Richelle Direny: Every day. So you found a way you've gotten to that place where you're saying, okay, it's, I have to work. I have to provide I have to this, I have to that I can

157
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:45.390
Richelle Direny: I can't allow him not being here to consume me like it once did. Now guess what it happened that the fact that you're hearing people being released it.

158
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.510
Richelle Direny: To your forefront of your mind now.

159
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.090
Jennifer C.: You cannot even think about it before.

160
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.400
Richelle Direny: until somebody says this is a

161
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.210
Jennifer C.: Possibility.

162
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.660
I mean,

163
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:04.830
Jennifer C.: Yeah, because before like everybody's I don't know everybody always brings it up and meet for me. I try not to think about it.

164
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.670
Jennifer C.: I mean, I'm not gonna think about it till the last 30 days.

165
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.590
Jennifer C.: You know, because anything can happen.

166
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:31.650
Richelle Direny: Anything can happen, but then free so that. So for you, thinking about it, you have to ask yourself, Why are you choosing the route of not thinking about it. Is it because thinking about it. It heightens all the other stressors, or the all the other potential stressors that are

167
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.730
Jennifer C.: That and I can't get my kids hyped up. I can't do that.

168
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.940
Jennifer C.: Myself, I can't hide myself up for something

169
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.830
Jennifer C.: For disappointment later.

170
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.980
Richelle Direny: And that's how you have to always think

171
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.260
Jennifer C.: What so I just

172
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.320
Richelle Direny: You try your best. Just not to allow it to consume.

173
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:49.470
Oh,

174
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:58.650
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you. I hear I hear your information, but I'm not going to allow it to consume me because doing that is going to put me in a bad headspace

175
00:14:59.460 --> 00:14:59.940
Right.

176
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:07.680
Jennifer C.: I even tell people that come into my store like I don't want to hear about none of it. I don't want to hear about it.

177
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.220
Jennifer C.: Because it makes it harder for us to want to go to work.

178
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.450
It does.

179
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.450
Richelle Direny: It really does. It really does make it harder for you.

180
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.010
Richelle Direny: To function because then you start thinking to yourself,

181
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:32.430
Richelle Direny: You know, I don't want to go out, it's, it's so, so you have it so it's like a double edged sword. What's going on right now you have some people

182
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.360
Jennifer C.: Saying

183
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:47.250
Richelle Direny: You have some people saying, Oh, why are they opening up back in the state. Why, why don't people just stay home. Okay. But are you speaking from the standpoint of if you're quarantine at home, you're still making money you're still able to pay your bill.

184
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.010
Richelle Direny: Right. Are you speaking from that angle.

185
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:58.710
Richelle Direny: And are you hearing these people who are saying, open up. Open up. Is it because they just want to go back out and mingle, or is it that they need to go out and make money which one

186
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.400
Richelle Direny: So you have to be mindful in the

187
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.440
Jennifer C.: Show. There's a little bit of both.

188
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.330
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. One Trump's which one is your primary in which one is your secondary

189
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.840
Jennifer C.: I would say, making money is the primary point

190
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:21.840
Richelle Direny: exactly the point. The primary is your, you need to make money because, you know, hey, they only push back my bills, three months, I can't stay home this long.

191
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:32.730
Richelle Direny: Because I needed you know because and they're not just saying you don't have to pay your rent for three months. What they're saying is you have to you, they put you on a payment plan.

192
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:44.400
Richelle Direny: So after you have to figure it out. So it's the two groups coming together and say, how can we help each other out. How can we do things where

193
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.340
Richelle Direny: We slowly open up back

194
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.230
Jennifer C.: Right.

195
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.160
Richelle Direny: So,

196
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.400
Jennifer C.: I got a feeling like it's not gonna probably be the first time.

197
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.400
Richelle Direny: If this all happening.

198
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.360
Yeah.

199
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:06.540
Jennifer C.: I mean, just because I mean I used to work in healthcare. Like, like that's what people coming to me all the time. Like, why don't you have a mask on.

200
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.040
Jennifer C.: Well,

201
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.410
Jennifer C.: When I worked in health care around all the sickly people. I didn't wear a mask.

202
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:25.770
Jennifer C.: You know, like, you're not going to build your immune system up. If you don't, if you have a mask on, or gloves or, you know, this or that or the other, they don't make us wear masks.

203
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:27.870
Jennifer C.: Um,

204
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:37.620
Richelle Direny: But then that's twofold it yes you're right, you're not going to build your immune system. But at this point, your immune system is built to a certain point, because, I mean,

205
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:50.520
Richelle Direny: Right. It's so it's so it's twofold. I mean, yes, you want to protect yourself, to some degree, when it comes on to certain elements and what have you. Like in this case, you know, if you have

206
00:17:51.960 --> 00:18:00.000
Richelle Direny: How you know, do you really know how much immunity, you have and you don't want to put it to the test with a virus that can be so deadly

207
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:11.460
Jennifer C.: You don't, but I just have a feeling like they're gonna let they're going to open. You know, so short opening things up and then all these people who have been inside and for real like quarantine quarantined. You know, the germ of folks.

208
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.700
Jennifer C.: They're going to come out and they're going to get sick.

209
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.200
Jennifer C.: And then everybody else is gonna get sick.

210
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.070
Jennifer C.: It's gonna be a snowball effect.

211
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.870
Richelle Direny: Probably

212
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.310
Jennifer C.: Fortunate Lee.

213
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.150
Jennifer C.: But what can we do

214
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:43.710
Richelle Direny: That's perfectly true. Um, let me ask you this. And one of the things that I'm that I wanted this session to be is because I think this is our first actual individual

215
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.870
Jennifer C.: Um, we have one

216
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.430
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And that was the your bio. That's your intake. So now,

217
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.240
Jennifer C.: This is

218
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.610
Richelle Direny: Your individual and

219
00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:02.490
Richelle Direny: You know, I would love to talk about, you know, what are some of your goals and your goals.

220
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:15.360
Richelle Direny: your long term goals. What is it that you are working towards and building short term goals with that. And in doing that, we're identifying some of your, your, your

221
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:23.400
Richelle Direny: Whether it's triggers or challenges or struggles that stops you from meeting those long term goals.

222
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.870
Um,

223
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.090
Jennifer C.: Well, going to work for Wednesday is like one of the things that's keeping me from not triggering

224
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:34.920
Jennifer C.: Um,

225
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.970
Jennifer C.: I, I learned my sister's birthday was on the 12th. So that was kind of hard.

226
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.290
Jennifer C.: I did have a little bit of a backslide with that one.

227
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.820
Jennifer C.: When I'm

228
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.890
Jennifer C.: The 12th of April.

229
00:19:53.490 --> 00:20:03.930
Richelle Direny: The 12th of April. Now in some regard i've you know and how many times have you had a backslide would you say in the last month or two.

230
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.650
Jennifer C.: That was it.

231
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.580
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

232
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.660
Jennifer C.: That was a I went and got a Xanax

233
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.060
Richelle Direny: Your, your drug of choice is his prescription pills. Right.

234
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.210
Jennifer C.: My drug of choice was Percocet.

235
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.320
Richelle Direny: Okay, so what about your sisters

236
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.460
Jennifer C.: But I try to stay away from all of it, you know, uh,

237
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.170
Jennifer C.: It was just, it just kind of snuck up on me.

238
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:56.850
Jennifer C.: It was Easter and I was hoping that you know Easter would keep my mind off of it and I wouldn't think about it. But then once I realized that what day it was in, in, you know what, and I just kind of like snuck up on me.

239
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.110
Jennifer C.: I didn't try to prepare myself for it. Um, she passed away in December.

240
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.610
Richelle Direny: Last year,

241
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.800
Jennifer C.: Yeah, um,

242
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.190
Jennifer C.: How right before Christmas. She was 31

243
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.470
Richelle Direny: She will she's she had she had

244
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.970
Richelle Direny: Cancer. Okay.

245
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.940
Jennifer C.: Yeah, she had bladder cancer. Um, and she got pneumonia.

246
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.160
Richelle Direny: So I like

247
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:37.110
Jennifer C.: To I tried not to think about it, you know, not to like I tried to just think about Easter, but it didn't work out that way.

248
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.610
Jennifer C.: Mm hmm.

249
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.780
Richelle Direny: So you tried to avoid the thoughts and feelings that came along with it.

250
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.640
Jennifer C.: Right.

251
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.370
Richelle Direny: But let me ask you a question. Have you tried it, because you're grieving so

252
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:59.970
Richelle Direny: Have you tried to just embrace the thoughts and feelings in home because it's okay to if you want to cry. It's okay.

253
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:14.910
Richelle Direny: If you want a nasty cry, whatever it is, just to release that hurt because she's not physically with you anymore. Um, and it is a loss, but have you tried to embrace it and just allow it.

254
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.470
Jennifer C.: I'm

255
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.730
Jennifer C.: Trying to think of like that happy times, you know,

256
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.250
Jennifer C.: I drives you but it doesn't always work out that way.

257
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.830
Richelle Direny: But just like how you're the emotion is coming on you right now.

258
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:44.250
Richelle Direny: Allowing it to just the feeling to come because of the feeling is not the mullingar the whole day. The feeling is going to come in and it's going to pass, but just allowing it

259
00:22:44.670 --> 00:23:03.300
Richelle Direny: To take its course to just think that I my sister that I loved ensure she's no longer with me, she's in a better place. And she's no longer in pain, and for that you're you're you're happy for that, but it still hurts. It still hurts that she's physically, not with you.

260
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.110
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

261
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.800
Richelle Direny: Tell me something, tell me a happy memory.

262
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:25.860
Jennifer C.: I think our happy us was just like we just we we just bickering back and forth, but we never did it seriously, you know,

263
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.890
Richelle Direny: When you say Baker back and forth.

264
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.610
Jennifer C.: Like we just arguing back and forth that each other, but it was never serious

265
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.940
Jennifer C.: We just did it for fun.

266
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.080
Richelle Direny: Just to get you both ground up about something.

267
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.580
Jennifer C.: Yeah yeah

268
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:50.070
Richelle Direny: So what was the last thing that you guys have you decided, whoa, let's get ourselves riled up about

269
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.120
Jennifer C.: Um,

270
00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.280
Jennifer C.: I don't even remember at this point.

271
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.880
Jennifer C.: Because there was so much like just say at the end. Like I just

272
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:15.360
Jennifer C.: The last one that we rally our unit about was when she was drunk. She went and got drunk.

273
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.850
Jennifer C.: Before chemo.

274
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:27.660
Richelle Direny: What was her. Okay, so she's got front for in her mind. Why does she think okay let me go get drunk before I do chemo.

275
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:39.090
Jennifer C.: Probably because she probably knew it was going to be one of her last times. I don't know what she was thinking all I was thinking was, like, now you're going to be sick for chemo.

276
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.200
Richelle Direny: And so you guys got an argument about that, you know,

277
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.810
Jennifer C.: But I think I can't really give a shit, you know,

278
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.220
Jennifer C.: Cuz she's, she's the one that's dying. So I can't really

279
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:51.810
Richelle Direny: Say,

280
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.010
Jennifer C.: Are you go do it.

281
00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.240
Richelle Direny: So you guys

282
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.960
Richelle Direny: Are doing about why are you going to get, you're going to be double sick.

283
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.070
Jennifer C.: Right. And in the end, I was right.

284
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:06.210
Jennifer C.: Double sick.

285
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.830
Jennifer C.: Mm hmm. She was sick when she came home and she was sick. The next day,

286
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.100
Jennifer C.: And then she was sick from chemo, so

287
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.070
Richelle Direny: How did you respond to it when she was double sick.

288
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.500
Jennifer C.: I mean, I took care of her.

289
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:27.330
Richelle Direny: But in in while taking care of her where you're just like, dude, like, seriously, like now look

290
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.970
Jennifer C.: Like I told you so, you know,

291
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:39.720
Richelle Direny: Until you guys just be heard about that that that told you so moment. But then you enjoyed spending that time with her. It's just like

292
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:46.830
Richelle Direny: I'm Ronnie. It's kind of one of those like I just need to tell you that I told you so. So I told you so, but come on. Here, let me help you.

293
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.840
Jennifer C.: Right, exactly.

294
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.990
Jennifer C.: Exactly.

295
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.340
Jennifer C.: We always think heard about who was who was right.

296
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.130
Richelle Direny: But, and I and you missed those moments.

297
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:03.720
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

298
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:11.730
Richelle Direny: And see, yes. But then it's just it's just allowing that

299
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:21.480
Richelle Direny: Moment of half is just allowing that moment like I miss you. I miss you being here. I miss talking to you.

300
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.830
Jennifer C.: I'm inspired with her.

301
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.030
Mm hmm.

302
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:28.230
Richelle Direny: But

303
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:39.840
Richelle Direny: How did it feel just even just now as you got to your up thinking about you know that she's not here but allowing that moment to pass.

304
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.350
Jennifer C.: I mean, it's definitely lighter

305
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.610
Richelle Direny: But then when you take something to suppress that feeling, what do you think happens when you're suppressing it

306
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.700
Jennifer C.: Oh, I just feel heavier.

307
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.710
Jennifer C.: I feel like shit.

308
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.740
Richelle Direny: And then like when you see

309
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.930
Jennifer C.: There's no matter how much you try to hide it.

310
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.270
Jennifer C.: They never really is hitting you know

311
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:10.050
Richelle Direny: It's just allowing it and just allowing allowing it to

312
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.820
Richelle Direny: Pass.

313
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:20.670
Richelle Direny: It's if I miss you. If I want to cry. If you want a moment to just go and cry.

314
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.870
Richelle Direny: Just cry. It's okay. It is cry if you want to wail, it's okay because guess what

315
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:34.860
Richelle Direny: There is going to come a time where the intensity of the feeling you're having the pain is not going to be the same.

316
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:36.810
Jennifer C.: Right.

317
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.160
Richelle Direny: It's not gonna be the same.

318
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:47.340
Jennifer C.: Well, I definitely bring it. I'm definitely looking forward to those times.

319
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:55.170
Richelle Direny: It's coming. It's just, it's cash. So think about how long, how long have your husband being away.

320
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.530
Jennifer C.: Well, he's been away for

321
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.340
Jennifer C.: Over a year now.

322
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.830
Richelle Direny: How did it feel in the beginning when he was

323
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.800
Richelle Direny: Even though you knew that it was hell.

324
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.910
Richelle Direny: It was hell.

325
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:16.680
Richelle Direny: How long did it take before you got to that point where the intensity of the loss wasn't the same

326
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.590
Jennifer C.: I'd say at least six months maybe eight

327
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:27.270
Richelle Direny: Okay. And after that, how did it feel when you when you accepted your new reality.

328
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.380
Jennifer C.: I mean,

329
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.110
Jennifer C.: It was hard, but I just had to, you know,

330
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.910
Richelle Direny: You had to why

331
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.370
Jennifer C.: For my kids.

332
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.970
Jennifer C.: I was now mom and dad.

333
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.010
Jennifer C.: I had to accept that.

334
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.340
Jennifer C.: I no longer at him and I no longer had my best friend. So I just had to do it by myself.

335
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.000
Richelle Direny: And how is it

336
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.590
Jennifer C.: And it's hard but

337
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:11.160
Jennifer C.: But I'm also grateful for it because when he was out. I never had to work. You know I never had to

338
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:20.460
Jennifer C.: To do things by myself or pay my own bills or, you know, get my own house or whatever. And now I do so.

339
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.730
Jennifer C.: I'm also grateful for it because I would have never got the opportunity. How do you get out

340
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:43.200
Richelle Direny: So what I just heard you described is that from both. You got one provided you that emotional dependency, to some degree, the other one, provided that both emotional and

341
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.590
Richelle Direny: physical dependence you because you dependent

342
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.210
Richelle Direny: Right was meant for everything.

343
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:57.390
Richelle Direny: So you never had to worry about, you know, how much time I have to put into work to physically go out there and work and put up with people and get a page.

344
00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:02.970
Richelle Direny: Right pay all these bill. You've never had to do that because at some point in time we are

345
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.740
Jennifer C.: Eating at all. I didn't have it.

346
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.060
So,

347
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:13.770
Richelle Direny: You're always an independent woman until you met your husband and he says, I'll do it all. So you relinquished all of it to him.

348
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.740
Richelle Direny: Yes, life came knocking and it forced you to regain your independence.

349
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:25.470
Richelle Direny: Right. So do you think that outside of him physically not being there.

350
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:32.400
Richelle Direny: It brought you that reality, like, well, now you have to be independent. You have to learn to be independent.

351
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.120
Jennifer C.: Yeah. If it wasn't for him going to prison, it would definitely wouldn't never happen.

352
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:42.510
Jennifer C.: To because your hell if it wasn't for him going to prison. I probably wouldn't even be clean and sober today.

353
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.820
Richelle Direny: Um, so it was a whole lot came out of it.

354
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.650
Jennifer C.: A whole lot

355
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.900
Jennifer C.: Like my whole

356
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.110
Jennifer C.: Life changed. I had to change everything.

357
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.520
Richelle Direny: So did you do you think that there was some degree of

358
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.250
Jennifer C.: Enable law.

359
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.080
Richelle Direny: Do you think that's some degree of

360
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:09.480
Richelle Direny: The

361
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.670
Richelle Direny: enablement came from him.

362
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.580
Richelle Direny: With your

363
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.620
Richelle Direny: Addiction to the pills.

364
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.650
Richelle Direny: Hello, you're breaking up.

365
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.340
Richelle Direny: I don't know if you can hear me, but I can't.

366
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:38.790
Richelle Direny: Hear you

367
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.160
Richelle Direny: You're breaking up a lot.

368
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:00.900
Richelle Direny: Okay.

369
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.780
Jennifer C.: I don't know what happened there, but

370
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.070
Jennifer C.: Some of it was from him. He definitely kept it going

371
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:12.810
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

372
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.540
Richelle Direny: He had his struggles with addiction to pills as well.

373
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.560
Jennifer C.: I mean, he did because of me, but like, I don't know.

374
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.630
Jennifer C.: It's hard to even remember that far back. We both were like

375
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.310
Jennifer C.: I didn't, I didn't until

376
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.640
Jennifer C.: I had my kids.

377
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.280
Jennifer C.: Um,

378
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:48.000
Jennifer C.: And then I think after I after I got them from the doctor, I just thought it was okay, you know,

379
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.370
Richelle Direny: So, um,

380
00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:07.800
Richelle Direny: OK, so now here it is like you talked about your sister, not being around your husband, not being around Um, what made you said that because of him being incarcerated. It made you made that

381
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:19.140
Richelle Direny: Made you to make that decision to to do something about the addiction. What about that dynamic Picchu in that place where I says, Okay, I gotta do something about this.

382
00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:29.160
Jennifer C.: I mean, I was just tired of it like I i definitely tried to keep it up while he was gone, but it just wasn't working for me.

383
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:37.530
Jennifer C.: I just got to the point where I just didn't want to do it no more. I didn't want to chase that high. Every day I was tired of it.

384
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.370
Richelle Direny: Okay.

385
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.700
Richelle Direny: And so far.

386
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:52.620
Jennifer C.: And you know he's when he comes out. He's not gonna be on nothing. So it's like, you know, I kind of just did it for him to because

387
00:33:53.850 --> 00:34:00.030
Jennifer C.: It was when he was out and we tried to stop it was too hard for both of us at once.

388
00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:01.620
Jennifer C.: Um,

389
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.740
Jennifer C.: There was this never like never a good time, you know,

390
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:23.910
Jennifer C.: It's like he was that he had to work. I had to take care of the kids if I was the lead. Who's gonna take care of the kids if he was the leader who's going to work like it was never a good time. Um,

391
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.210
Jennifer C.: So I guess in a way prisons been a blessing.

392
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.050
Richelle Direny: Because you believe that

393
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:32.610
Jennifer C.: It may time

394
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.500
Richelle Direny: Do you believe that

395
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:35.910
Yeah.

396
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:43.440
Richelle Direny: Because if it wasn't for that. I wouldn't be cleaner now.

397
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:55.020
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. And even when you had your slip ups. How did that make you feel because now you're on this journey. How did it make you feel when you had your slip ups.

398
00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.750
Jennifer C.: I mean, I definitely felt good in the moment, but I felt like shit afterwards.

399
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.290
Jennifer C.: Mm hmm. Just guilty.

400
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:11.580
Richelle Direny: And how it just let's talk about the guilt, the guilt that's around that like is that guilt really

401
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.280
Richelle Direny: So,

402
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.110
Richelle Direny: When you compare the okay the pain of the loss.

403
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:20.760
Jennifer C.: In comparison,

404
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:26.580
Richelle Direny: To the guilt of you, your slip up, which one do you think is worth

405
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.850
Jennifer C.: The pain of the loss is definitely worse.

406
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.170
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. How so, the pain of the love in comparison to the guilt.

407
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:43.290
Jennifer C.: Um, I mean the guilt came from the vein of loss. So it's got all tied into one.

408
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:49.230
Richelle Direny: But we're going to separate it because you have to understand both, you have to understand both because guilt.

409
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:59.760
Richelle Direny: Is something that you can always be reminded of guilt is something that, let's say your slip up and your children are now reminding you over it, or somebody else's reminding you of it.

410
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:09.360
Richelle Direny: And the guilt, the guilt comes. It's a whole burden by itself in comparison to the pain of the loss. It's a loss, but

411
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:18.420
Richelle Direny: Like I said, it's a passing emotion. It's a passing feeling where Israel can be more lingering

412
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:33.960
Richelle Direny: guilt. People can remind you of the things that you're trying to get past guilt can remind you of all you think you better than me. Remember when you did a, b, and c. So how do you think guilt. Guilt does that you in comparison, the pain of a loss that says

413
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.640
Richelle Direny: Uh, you know,

414
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:51.900
Richelle Direny: I know my sister is not here. I love her and I wanted her to be here, but it was more painful to watch her suffer. It was more painful to see all that she was going through it was more painful to see how miserable she was

415
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.520
Jennifer C.: It's more painful.

416
00:36:53.610 --> 00:37:07.140
Richelle Direny: To watch that in comparison to just having her physically here with me, simply because I want her here so that pain is a passing emotion that one day you get to that place where you say,

417
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:22.800
Richelle Direny: The intensity of the pain will kind of decrease. That's why I tried to compare it to. When your husband left, even though he's not gone gone because you can see him again one day, but he's not here with you and he's not going to be here with you for a few years.

418
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:23.850
Richelle Direny: But the

419
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:30.150
Richelle Direny: Passing emotion, where you say, I can't allow this to consume. I have to work in getting

420
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:36.450
Richelle Direny: Now when you're talking about guilt. Guilt is it's always going to remind you of the bad things you've done

421
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.330
Richelle Direny: The pain.

422
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:50.010
Richelle Direny: The law person never reminds you of the bad things you've done it never remind you of the things that you're sorrowful for and never reminds you of that the pain, the loss of someone never reminds you of that.

423
00:37:51.960 --> 00:38:07.380
Richelle Direny: The guilt. Does the guilt says, Remember when you did this, remember when you almost you remember all of these things. Remember, and then it three, the things that you've done. Let's take. It's kind of like I have someone else that's going through

424
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.390
Richelle Direny: The same thing like you grief and loss lost a loved one.

425
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:21.480
Richelle Direny: Um, and they said it's okay to cry. It's okay. Even if you're in a nice the crowd done talking and she was like, you know, I tried to allow myself to get through and and

426
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:29.370
Richelle Direny: You know through that pain. She thought about, like, you know, in those movies when you're watching. And then people get mad and they clear off everything and they break up everything.

427
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.480
Richelle Direny: Right. And in my mind, I'm like, do they know they got to clean that up afterwards.

428
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.710
And so she's

429
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:43.530
Richelle Direny: So she said she said she, she made that point. She said she felt like doing it. But then in that moment, she thought. I don't want to do that. I'm gonna have to clean it all up.

430
00:38:44.340 --> 00:39:01.650
Richelle Direny: So right but then pain would have made you do that you broke up everything that was expensive guilt is not going to remind you, I lost my expensive thing because I was hurt I broke it. Now the guilt of remembering what I did is going to linger longer

431
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.440
Richelle Direny: In right Harrison to the passing pain.

432
00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:14.220
Richelle Direny: And that's just, that's why I said you have to separate the two. I cut myself it's painful, but it's going to stop. Eventually the guilt.

433
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.040
Richelle Direny: The scar that I created on myself.

434
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:26.160
Richelle Direny: Guilt is always going to remind me of that scar of how I got that scar, but the line until you have to separate the two. To understand the two so

435
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:33.660
Richelle Direny: Going but I mean do you do understand the concept in terms of when you take the two and separate them what it looks like.

436
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.860
Jennifer C.: Yes, yeah.

437
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.250
Jennifer C.: Yeah, definitely do.

438
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.880
Richelle Direny: Until you have to think if you though.

439
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.550
Richelle Direny: You use

440
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.110
Richelle Direny: Pills to suppress pain.

441
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:59.760
Richelle Direny: Hurt or whatever. And it kind of gives you a high or whatever it does for you. The question is after you come down from that high.

442
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.300
Richelle Direny: Are those issues are resolved.

443
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:04.620
No.

444
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.360
Richelle Direny: It's still clearing and sometimes it invites more troubles.

445
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:10.530
Yep.

446
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.880
Jennifer C.: That it does

447
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.940
Jennifer C.: I mean, it will call us to more than. So now, like

448
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.920
Jennifer C.: I know now, I would never go back to taking pain pills never

449
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.460
Richelle Direny: Will never is a big word. Now why you say never.

450
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:32.940
Jennifer C.: Because it's just not worth it.

451
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.800
Richelle Direny: Why it's not worth it.

452
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.510
Jennifer C.: It's

453
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:45.720
Jennifer C.: Not worth like forgetting here, the general public use. Look at me. And it's just, it's not going to be when

454
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.400
Richelle Direny: You're speaking. I can't hear you.

455
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.830
Richelle Direny: Okay, go ahead.

456
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.450
Richelle Direny: Hello.

457
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.100
Richelle Direny: Okay.

458
00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:23.010
Richelle Direny: I couldn't see you. I know I couldn't see. I couldn't hear you are completely frozen. So what did you, said the general public and wells.

459
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:31.620
Jennifer C.: And just my kids and my it's just not going to be worth like when he gets out it's not going to be worth risking my marriage.

460
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:37.230
Jennifer C.: And the rest of what I have. I mean, I've felt like I've lost so much, you know,

461
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:44.460
Richelle Direny: Which one. Which one makes it not worth it. Losing your marriage or losing your children.

462
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.080
Jennifer C.: My children.

463
00:41:47.850 --> 00:42:02.310
Richelle Direny: Do you think I'm a relapse a full relapse or succumbing to the pain and the loss and everything and you having a relapse, because you've just gotten really overwhelmed with life. Do you think there's a possibility that you could lose your children.

464
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:07.800
Jennifer C.: I mean, I would hope not. But there's always that possibility.

465
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.200
Richelle Direny: And how do you think that you would lose them.

466
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:27.270
Jennifer C.: Because that damn way if I gave you a relapse. I wouldn't be probably going to work or making the money to pay for the house and pay the bills and at that point CPS or somebody would probably step in

467
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.150
Jennifer C.: And that is not worth it.

468
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:46.620
Richelle Direny: So I have a question. Losing your children to CPS is it worse than if you don't lose your children to see. Yes, but you lose the respect of your children because now they only see was an addict and they treat you.

469
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.690
Jennifer C.: Know that would definitely be worse.

470
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:54.630
Richelle Direny: You understand, and I think it's, it's how you notice that it's everything I'm to how you look at it.

471
00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:06.390
Richelle Direny: Well, hey, it's one thing to lose your children to CPS because you always work to get them back but losing the respect of your children in them seeing you in their eyes. All they see is an idea.

472
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.230
Richelle Direny: And they try and see which one would be worse.

473
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.690
Jennifer C.: That one would definitely be worse.

474
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.310
Richelle Direny: Because the love of a child is like no other.

475
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.260
Jennifer C.: Right.

476
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.280
Jennifer C.: Yes.

477
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:32.550
Richelle Direny: So then the question again is what what what is your motivator to staying on this path.

478
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.840
Jennifer C.: They are

479
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.050
Jennifer C.: They are

480
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:42.330
Jennifer C.: That will get them every day. And they're my motivator.

481
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:44.490
Especially that little ha

482
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:47.610
Jennifer C.: Ha.

483
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:51.450
Richelle Direny: I said, especially that little son of yours. That's always coming to say hi and your camera.

484
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:57.120
Jennifer C.: He is the he's my world right there. Um,

485
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.920
Jennifer C.: So, I mean, some days they even motivate me because I get on my nerves.

486
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.390
Jennifer C.: Like, I gotta go to work.

487
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.790
Richelle Direny: You got to go take a breather.

488
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.380
Richelle Direny: You gotta go regionally set

489
00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.300
Exactly.

490
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:21.360
Richelle Direny: So when you again. So we go back to our original question, what is your long term goal to sobriety.

491
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.620
Jennifer C.: Just

492
00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.980
Jennifer C.: Staying away from all the bullshit.

493
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:33.690
Jennifer C.: Stays over

494
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.900
Richelle Direny: And how do you want to do that. How do you want to

495
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:44.910
Jennifer C.: Do my get through, through work and just being with my kids right now.

496
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.330
Richelle Direny: What is something that you're working

497
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.580
Jennifer C.: On don't have room for everybody else.

498
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.700
Richelle Direny: And that's important. What is something that you personally can see that you're working on.

499
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.940
Jennifer C.: Oh. Kidding me.

500
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:09.240
Richelle Direny: Like, okay, so you have your goals, like you said you're learning through this process of

501
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.810
Richelle Direny: Your, your you've said that you're learning through this process of

502
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:29.400
Richelle Direny: Independence, your, your real relearning how to be independent and you're not just re learning how to be independent, as an individual, you're learning how to be independent, a cure for three children.

503
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.730
Richelle Direny: Right, you have three children that are looking up to you.

504
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.900
Richelle Direny: You want you want our greatest desire is that our children turn out better than we did

505
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.110
Richelle Direny: On Live successful than we were.

506
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.050
Richelle Direny: And so, in doing so.

507
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:57.540
Richelle Direny: Right now as it stands, what is your, what is a goal that you're working on, to maintain your sobriety.

508
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.520
Richelle Direny: Because I could say I want to stay sober. But how are you doing

509
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:08.970
Jennifer C.: I'm

510
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:17.790
Jennifer C.: By going. I mean, just by going to work every day and I don't, um,

511
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.440
Jennifer C.: I don't like allow new relationships.

512
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:32.850
Jennifer C.: And I'm keeping everybody at a distance right now, just because it's just me and my kids like I don't need anybody else right now. You know, I'm

513
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.590
Richelle Direny: Where people trigger for you.

514
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:50.040
Jennifer C.: Whoa, that and i just i i don't i just don't care to know about all their drama in their lives. And you know, I don't need them bringing it into mine.

515
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.000
Richelle Direny: Naturally, are you a very caring person of others.

516
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.920
Yeah, there's also everyone

517
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:01.590
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

518
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.030
Richelle Direny: So you

519
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:07.590
Jennifer C.: Know it's hard for me. It's hard for me to tell people no but I have to

520
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.010
Richelle Direny: Somewhat keeping them at bay helps you to work on you.

521
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:21.840
Jennifer C.: Yes. Because if not, then my whole it'll all just worry about I worry about everybody else too much.

522
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.810
Jennifer C.: And not myself enough

523
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:27.630
Richelle Direny: So, at this time, I've

524
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.340
Jennifer C.: Always been that type of person.

525
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.900
Richelle Direny: So you're working on rebuilding you

526
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:35.430
Right.

527
00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:38.310
Richelle Direny: And

528
00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:42.120
Jennifer C.: If I started to worry about other people. I will, I will stop.

529
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:48.090
Jennifer C.: That I'll solve rebuilding me and I will give everything that I have to them and I can't do that.

530
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.660
Richelle Direny: Because doing that overwhelms you

531
00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.790
Richelle Direny: You stopped. You're frozen again.

532
00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:14.220
Richelle Direny: Okay, you're back.

533
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:15.840
Jennifer C.: Someone call me.

534
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.410
Richelle Direny: Okay. Cuz it seems like sometimes when you move the phone like you haven't in a good spot. And if you move it for whatever reason you freeze it.

535
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.990
Jennifer C.: Right. Someone tried to call me.

536
00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.880
Jennifer C.: And like when I ended, and then it makes the black screen for whatever reason.

537
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.410
Um,

538
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:38.580
Jennifer C.: But yeah, I just, I don't know. I just don't want, I just don't want a backslide

539
00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:40.740
Richelle Direny: And I asked you.

540
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.180
Do you love you.

541
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:44.130
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

542
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.110
Richelle Direny: How much do you love you.

543
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:46.710
Jennifer C.: I do

544
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.480
Jennifer C.: Not enough, but I do

545
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.940
Richelle Direny: You understand what it means to love you.

546
00:48:56.430 --> 00:49:01.350
Jennifer C.: I mean, yeah, you got to put yourself for like I have to be healthy. In order for my kids to be LV

547
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:11.460
Jennifer C.: Mm hmm. I had with myself first in order to put them first. Um, obviously, if I don't say if I don't stay sober, then

548
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.770
Jennifer C.: It's just not gonna be good for anybody, really, um,

549
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.570
Jennifer C.: But I can't care for them. If I can't care for myself.

550
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:35.340
Richelle Direny: Please. And that's how you start off. And that's how you know how to put things in perspective and set your, your, your goals for yourself.

551
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:50.790
Richelle Direny: Ultimately for children, but for yourself, because it's, you have to you. And the reason why I'm asking you is because I want to see what you're thinking when you're saying, I want to stay sober. But what does that look like what do you understand from that.

552
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:58.740
Richelle Direny: Because hey, we all say we want to do something, but then the least little thing that comes across our path we completely forget

553
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:11.700
Richelle Direny: About our goal. So we have to understand first our triggers. What are some triggers. I care about people. I always want to help people and then helping people. I tend to always put myself on a Mac bench. I have this goal.

554
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:19.020
Richelle Direny: For myself today, but then Jennifer comes along and she says something to me it really tugs at my heartstrings

555
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.270
Richelle Direny: So now I'm ready to help. Jennifer and I completely put myself and what I need to do on a backbend

556
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:30.270
Richelle Direny: When I'm finished helping Jennifer. Jennifer doesn't really stop to say, Hey. Thank you, Michelle. You know, you helped me along the way.

557
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:42.780
Richelle Direny: She moves on with her life. Now I feel horrible because now I needed to get things done and now I didn't get it done, then I'm upset with myself. I feel guilty and hear me going back on this road.

558
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:47.220
Jennifer C.: Oh, that's me to a tee, like, that's it. That's how it always ends up

559
00:50:51.210 --> 00:51:00.990
Richelle Direny: And so, learning, like you said, and learning to say no and understanding what it means you're not saying no, because you're really truly don't want to help the person you're saying no, because you're choosing you

560
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:02.970
Jennifer C.: Right.

561
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.840
Richelle Direny: So in choosing you

562
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:13.470
Richelle Direny: You have to be okay with the backlash that may come along with it.

563
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.030
Jennifer C.: I mean, I'm okay with that.

564
00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:31.980
Richelle Direny: You have to be okay with the intensity of the backlash that will come with it, of how what people how people may respond to you. And if you lose some friends along the way. You have to be okay with that.

565
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:41.400
Jennifer C.: I mean I've pretty much lost all my friends along the way, because they were either on drugs do drugs or I mean they

566
00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:48.930
Jennifer C.: Booked when he got raided and went to prison. So I'm okay with that. I'm okay with no friends.

567
00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:52.410
Richelle Direny: You're

568
00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:52.890
Jennifer C.: Really

569
00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:55.620
Richelle Direny: And how long have you been okay with that.

570
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.230
Jennifer C.: Goodbye of lollies two years now.

571
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:06.900
Richelle Direny: Hmm. So what is your current support that you have right now.

572
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:16.410
Jennifer C.: My family like my dad, my mom I'm obviously my work, family supports me and then my kids.

573
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:22.680
Jennifer C.: But as far as friends. Like, I don't need them. I don't need them or their stress.

574
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.320
Richelle Direny: And you just have to be confident where that's concerned.

575
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:35.220
Jennifer C.: Yeah, I'm I'm to the point where I'm pretty confident in that I don't need them.

576
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.060
Jennifer C.: I don't need them.

577
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:44.130
Richelle Direny: Just, I don't need to be

578
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:47.490
Jennifer C.: I don't need them dragging me down any further, that's for sure.

579
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:57.030
Richelle Direny: You listen you sound like a pretty strong individual

580
00:52:58.170 --> 00:52:59.610
Jennifer C.: I think maybe some I am

581
00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:04.650
Richelle Direny: Maybe do you think somewhere along the way you kind of lost sight of your own strength.

582
00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:07.050
Jennifer C.: Definitely

583
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:09.960
Jennifer C.: Definitely

584
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.080
Jennifer C.: Probably the minute I got married.

585
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.580
Richelle Direny: I mean, I think all of us do.

586
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.500
Jennifer C.: Have kids.

587
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.100
Richelle Direny: Then you completely lose sight, and then you have to rebuild it.

588
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.780
Jennifer C.: Right.

589
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.480
Richelle Direny: And but then how many daughters, you have

590
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:29.520
Jennifer C.: I have two daughters.

591
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.350
Richelle Direny: And how are you teaching them.

592
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:32.370
Jennifer C.: To be a strong

593
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:37.860
Richelle Direny: And one person, but how are you teaching your daughters to be a strong, independent woman.

594
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:49.920
Jennifer C.: I mean, I just tell them they don't need anybody but then like they don't need. They don't need boys and you know they're at the age now where they want to hang out with boys and talk to boys. I'm like, you don't need voice.

595
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:52.710
Richelle Direny: Not if

596
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.320
Richelle Direny: They don't do nothing but use. You don't need voice.

597
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.640
Richelle Direny: But, so how are you. How are you an example of that to them because it's not what you say is the

598
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:07.290
Jennifer C.: Boys over

599
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:18.810
Jennifer C.: You know, I don't have. I don't talk to guys I don't have them over my house. I don't, I don't have

600
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:24.570
Jennifer C.: Relationships, you know, or anything like that. I keep it all away.

601
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.540
Richelle Direny: And you find time to really spend important to them positive thing.

602
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.040
Jennifer C.: Yeah.

603
00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:50.010
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So as you send your goal is to maintain your journey by choosing yourself and how you do that is you're mindful of the people you allow in your life.

604
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:50.940
Right.

605
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:58.140
Richelle Direny: A person is for you. And you know, is for us. The one that helps you along your journey.

606
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:03.030
Richelle Direny: To means right or call you can identify that by

607
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:15.840
Richelle Direny: Seeing what they're all about when they come on your journey. Are they trying to find a way to call her see you into their direction or are they finding a way to mean to help you to uplift the torch, man.

608
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.000
Jennifer C.: Right.

609
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:20.970
Jennifer C.: I'm definitely sticking to it.

610
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:32.820
Jennifer C.: And then a short term goal or mine is I have to come up with a $5,000 water bill.

611
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:44.130
Richelle Direny: Oh my gosh, you listen when you brought that up in group you have other people on the sideline like don't need to be paying that you don't. That is not your house, you don't. You need to go to

612
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.830
Jennifer C.: My house, but I don't want to move either

613
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.710
Richelle Direny: But then why are you paying someone else's bill.

614
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.740
Jennifer C.: I mean, I like my house. I don't pay rent.

615
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.500
Richelle Direny: What do you mean you don't pay rent.

616
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.120
Jennifer C.: I don't have to pay, right.

617
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:10.650
Jennifer C.: All of a is my bills because it's it's my husband's friend's house so he doesn't make me pay rent, um,

618
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:12.660
Richelle Direny: Well he's making you pay that

619
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.990
Jennifer C.: Bill obligated that I have to pay the water bill.

620
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:16.530
You know,

621
00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:23.040
Richelle Direny: To also he's kind of making you pay the water bill.

622
00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:29.460
Jennifer C.: Right. Like he said you know you don't pay the rent, you have to pay the water bill or they're going to shut it off and you're gonna have to move out.

623
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:38.040
Richelle Direny: I mean, is the house inevitable like it's, there's nothing else wrong with the house outside of the water.

624
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:39.270
Right.

625
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:42.750
Jennifer C.: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with the house outside of the water.

626
00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:52.800
Jennifer C.: Bill, I love where it's at. It's close to my work and it's away from all the riffraff and the people that I used to be around, you know,

627
00:56:53.460 --> 00:57:02.550
Jennifer C.: Even for my kids like it's away from all their friends and the people that they used to hang around like I love where my house is I don't want to move again.

628
00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:08.040
Richelle Direny: But you said that this is a house that you guys got where

629
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.800
Richelle Direny: He bought the house with an exorbitant. What about right.

630
00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:16.110
Jennifer C.: Right.

631
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:24.630
Jennifer C.: Which I I found out like the house. He's not he didn't go and switch the deed. All the way in his name yet.

632
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:30.180
Jennifer C.: So the house right now is not even in his name.

633
00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:39.990
Jennifer C.: It's in that previous owners name.

634
00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.720
Richelle Direny: So then the previous owner can't pay the bill.

635
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:46.770
Jennifer C.: Oh. Apparently not.

636
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:59.910
Jennifer C.: But I do know that since I switched the water into my name, just to pay the bill like that whole $5,000 came with it like that $5,000 bill comes in my name.

637
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.490
Richelle Direny: Um,

638
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:04.710
Jennifer C.: Why

639
00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:10.080
Richelle Direny: Because you registered when you moved in, you registered everything in your name. So now, what's your problem.

640
00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:15.990
Jennifer C.: Right, I guess. I mean, I would imagine, if I moved out. It's not my problem anymore but

641
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:21.090
Richelle Direny: No, because then that person may not want to register it in their name until that's paid

642
00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:35.580
Richelle Direny: So then it becomes. I mean it, then it becomes an issue, but you would have to, I would say, you would have to speak to maybe legal aid or someone to see how you can get around having to be stuck with the bill for some when you were not living there.

643
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:43.110
Jennifer C.: Right, like I'm I need to go to the water company and talk to somebody, but they're not open

644
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.680
Jennifer C.: But I need to do it sooner. The money's not going to be there.

645
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:54.720
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes, I would say definitely show just once everything is open back off that you go and find out.

646
00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:59.460
Richelle Direny: Hold on down for let me Schedule A follow up appointment.

647
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:32.460

657
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.340
Jennifer C.: Yeah, but I can still do it at work.

658
01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:15.510

659
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.180

662
01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.540
Jennifer C.: They're not against it. They're very supportive of it.

663
01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:46.890
Richelle Direny: Okay. I mean, if anything changes, then we can go from there. But, um, let's do the 20th

664
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:53.430
Richelle Direny: And we'll go what I think. I think maybe once a month to check in on someone is fine.

665
01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.090
Richelle Direny: If you just need that extra support, then we can do that.

666
01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.010
Jennifer C.: Alrighty.

667
01:00:59.550 --> 01:00:59.880
Richelle Direny: All right.

668
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:06.720
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Like I said, if you ever feel that you know before when you think about like a slip up just

669
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:18.150
Richelle Direny: If you want to cry. Allow it to pass. Let the emotion past cry release it because it's going to pass. It's going to stop that.

670
01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.800
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and it's going to stop.

671
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:37.290
Richelle Direny: And then, you know, then what again if you feel if it's so overwhelming and so overbearing and you just can't get through it. We're here to for that additional support and not going through grief counseling or no, it's, it's, it's kind of harder to not know how to deal with ankle.

672
01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.720
Richelle Direny: Rice. Okay.

673
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:41.670

Richelle Direny: I've been doing the walk thing as well. It feels good. You know, it's funny, because when you walk. I think when say they walk in a run, you're working every muscle.

719
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:09.780
Richelle Direny: Because it takes a lot for you to whether it's the walk and run. So you're working every part of your body when you're walking, running, stone. It's a good year.

720
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.810
Brandon H: I have an exercise bike to need to use that to

721
01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.630
Richelle Direny: That's like you have a lot of stuff.

722
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.700
Brandon H: Yeah, just don't use it. I got the Bowflex dumbbells ago from

723
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:26.730
Brandon H: Five to 52 and a half, you can adjust the weights in this pull up the

724
01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.250
Richelle Direny: Watson as it goes.

725
01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:32.280
Brandon H: The way you choose because like Tao in weights.

726
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:34.980
Actually, I went to wait.

727
01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.640
Brandon H: A whole set of dumbbells in one convenient package.

728
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:45.000
Richelle Direny: That both like there's not like a nurse thing.

729
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:55.620
Brandon H: No, he did all around thing read is a sliding maneuvers. I forget what his code Bowflex is like a top line.

730
01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:58.470
Brandon H: Home fitness. They do a lot of

731
01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.550
Brandon H: home gym stuff like the cables. They have like the

732
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.600
Brandon H: UK tension cables. There's no weights you just

733
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.170
Brandon H: Been that take pressure

734
01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:12.600
Richelle Direny: So yeah, pressure. Yeah.

735
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:13.830
Yeah, for sure.

736
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:16.110
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's

737
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.110
Richelle Direny: That is one

738
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.100
Richelle Direny: I've always seen all these different

739
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:34.620
Brandon H: Yeah, you can't go wrong. Both selection of top line I bought it several years ago when I had a little extra money. It was like $500 for the Dumbo so

740
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.250
Richelle Direny: Okay.

741
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.270
Brandon H: I've had it for years. I have used them off and on.

742
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:58.320
Brandon H: Medium least couple times, we just to do like butterflies and stuff, trying to get a badge record do stuff like pecs and to swim and all that you do this way, shoulders, you build your upper body.

743
01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:08.880
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but I mean, so what your goal is one of it was, um, you know, like when you come home to set an alarm when you come home to do at least 30 minutes, um,

744
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:11.460
Richelle Direny: Now it doesn't necessarily

745
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:27.420
Richelle Direny: Have to be you know you're working yourself up to it, because I think in the beginning you like we all have the momentum we have, like, oh, this is a great idea. You're all forward and then you kind of like all back down into kind of doing nothing. So even if you did it.

746
01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:28.260
Once for the week.

747
01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.100
Brandon H: Yeah. Couple times since I talk to you or not. It's consistent

748
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:45.120
Richelle Direny: And that's and it's it's not, you don't have to do it every day. Thank you. Try it. But you said that you can say that it did feel good doing it right.

749
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.310
Brandon H: Yeah, it always does.

750
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:57.210
Brandon H: And I did hear a job from my uncle. I forgot. When you mentioned that I did. He laid some stone for his girlfriend like I did about

751
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:09.120
Brandon H: Three and a half times of shoveling out of a bag of a a dump truck pickup like a slight shovel into a wheelbarrow wheelbarrows likes you. Three and a half times myself.

752
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:12.240
Richelle Direny: Oh, and that's exercise.

753
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.330
Brandon H: Yeah. Didn't hurt. Yes, Mother, good hard work.

754
01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.050
Richelle Direny: Is that really the room.

755
01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:24.480
Brandon H: Yes, always crouch down all the way the ground like Ramona squat press. I didn't hurt my back.

756
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.510
Richelle Direny: And so think about like all the muscles that you're using, because remember the wheelbarrow.

757
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:35.370
Richelle Direny: Its operating on one wheel you're carrying all of this weight on one wheel.

758
01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:48.330
Richelle Direny: So then, like you say you have to squat to ensure that you, you have a good posture and it's a whole lot of upper body strength to hold up that loaded wheelbarrow and then you're having to maneuver it where you're going. So at the

759
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:50.040
Richelle Direny: Content, it doesn't fall.

760
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.090
Brandon H: He's trying to tell me where to dump it. I'm trying to do is get a dump threshold.

761
01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.070
Richelle Direny: So that there's exercise in it. I think I was

762
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:03.630
Richelle Direny: My mom's fitness. When I did outside work. Can you

763
01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.980
Imagine, nice. Yeah.

764
01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.210
Brandon H: Good for you. Get sunshine in the

765
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.310
Brandon H: Shape too.

766
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:12.660
Mm hmm.

767
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.270
Richelle Direny: So it's good but like even I mean where you live.

768
01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:20.970
Richelle Direny: Is it like in a community.

769
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:27.600
Brandon H: Yeah, I live are several apartments around me. Then there's an allotment across the road.

770
01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.010
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. So like where you live, just

771
01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.220
Richelle Direny: So you can walk around where you live, or just walking to your parents is a better

772
01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:46.380
Brandon H: Although I was walking with them. They walk two miles or so, a day. Now they're living at my uncle's they sold their home.

773
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:48.570
Richelle Direny: You're looking

774
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.800
Brandon H: Ranch towers and two stories 678 years

775
01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.510
Brandon H: Too much upkeep forming an older version seven

776
01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:02.550
Brandon H: But now I watched the parks like there's not a good parts and Kim.

777
01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.930
Brandon H: Cipro lake has amazed when you walk around the lake city.

Brandon H: Hall of Fame part for the Football Hall of Fame.

779
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:18.000
Brandon H: National Football Hall of Fame ever that park is like a mile and a half track. That's like that.

780
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.430
Brandon H: Track and field.

781
01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.170
throws off.

782
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.240
Brandon H: The cushion.

783
01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:31.860
Richelle Direny: Oh ok ok ok on the track. Oh, that's cool. So your parents are pretty strong if they're sitting there walking two miles.

784
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.210
Brandon H: They might be more I walked with them and then recorded there just guessing.

785
01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.020
Brandon H: They want one or the other one is the road and you're going to walk over to a

786
01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.200
Brandon H: Silo mass it I'll skip the scouts. I won't back

787
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:45.600

788
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:50.250
Brandon H: No, it was already at a reward, but time is all done I listed two miles.

789
01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:55.140
Richelle Direny: Three miles. So your parents out watch you.

790
01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.690
Brandon H: I get to walk and I get pretty good.

791
01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:02.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah

792
01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:04.890
Brandon H: They were moving fast. I was kind of

793
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:05.940
Taken

794
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.140
Richelle Direny: You are dragging along

795
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.400
Brandon H: Yes.

796
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:18.060
Brandon H: I mean I can remember them until as an order that extra my our quarter mile whatever was added on.

797
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.400
Richelle Direny: That they added on.

798
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:27.660
Brandon H: Extra. This is a walk instead of walking on the road back the walkers side road and back on that too. So

799
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:35.610
Richelle Direny: I mean, what, like you said, it's like every day. I mean, if they're doing it every day. They probably have built up the agility and everything else to

800
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:42.540
Brandon H: My mom's always been a walker she when she can get my data dirty. I'll do it, he's a hard worker. He's a hard working guy ever met my life.

801
01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:53.880
Brandon H: All day at work and then come home and work and then work on the weekends and around his house and do all the chores. My mom wants me to do, and you just constantly going so

802
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:55.050

01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:56.700
Brandon H: Sure as much downtime.

804
01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.940
Richelle Direny: Hey, listen. How old are your parents.

805
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.920
Brandon H: He's a Christ 68 my mom for me 67 so I'm like,

806
01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:11.670
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. I mean, look, when it's all said and done, it's

807
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:20.880
Richelle Direny: You know when you're doing it every day. I remember when I was much younger I used to work with this lady, I think at the time she was in her

808
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:24.420
Richelle Direny: I mean, I want to say maybe in her 80s.

809
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:34.050
Richelle Direny: She had to have been in her 80s and she had dementia. But let me tell you something. Brendan deadly tickle walk. She couldn't walk

810
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:47.940
Richelle Direny: She just walked and walked and walk and walk and walk in at the time that then I was like 19 and I was just like, Oh my gosh, but she walked in, she walked in, she wanted, she wanted. You have to keep

811
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.840
Richelle Direny: Pace with her.

812
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:52.980
Brandon H: To remember things, try to do it doesn't retain

813
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:57.180
Brandon H: That dude as a routine. You said she had dementia. So

814
01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:57.900
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

815
01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.010
Brandon H: She's a routine.

816
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:11.880
Richelle Direny: Yeah, she had the one that was the one thing she forgot how to do was walk but and then she lived on the beach. So if we weren't walking like on the sidewalk, we would go on the beach and walk sometimes

817
01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:25.410
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, um, but then she was. That was the one thing she did not forget to do all the way to the end was to walk and she walked a lot. So, um, but, you know,

818
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:41.880
Richelle Direny: The Walking is good and even now. Sometimes I go out and walk but like you said 30 3030 minutes doing whatever mixing it up, whether it's walking or even doing like you said you're doing this with the whatever machine that does that.

819
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.610
Brandon H: Other hand grips you like it looks like a

820
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.770
Brandon H: Triangle. And it was like a circle at the top.

821
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:07.260
Brandon H: Look like that.

822
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.720
Brandon H: See that that's reinforced to me.

823
01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:14.580
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

824
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.350
Brandon H: A lot of pressure. So it's like

825
01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:19.830
Richelle Direny: It's working, not just it's working. The whole arm isn't it.

826
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:20.460
Yeah.

827
01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.110
Brandon H: Yeah.

828
01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:27.150
Richelle Direny: It works on the, you know what I should just go get something like that and just keep squeezing it

829
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.460
Brandon H: They make a ladies want to have a softer grips.

830
01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.190
Brandon H: Are easy to pull together for

831
01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.360
Brandon H: Soccer hand.

832
01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.800
Brandon H: Hands over they make different levels of resistance.

833
01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:45.480
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. No no no i i gotta you know when you grow up with a dad who they they they move

834
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:46.620
So everything

835
01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.890
Richelle Direny: To me, the soft things is just not working for me I need the

836
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:54.540
Brandon H: Yeah, I can't do this. I could do like 100

837
01:14:55.830 --> 01:15:01.290
Richelle Direny: Yeah so. But then, but that's good. You know, it just makes you feel you know overall better

838
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:14.130
Richelle Direny: About just about yourself. And I think what makes you even feel a lot more more energized, you feel a lot better is also, um,

839
01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:30.570
Richelle Direny: I think your energy level goes up. And if you start seeing the results. If you see the result because if you lose five pounds in just doing just literally teams. I'm sure you're going to feel like, whoa, I gotta that should do more of this. Yeah, I've lost

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:11.700
Brandon H: As excited to get the job back, everyone. I'm sorry. The other rotator cuff injury.

862
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:15.480
Richelle Direny: He said, Who wasn't you, you are excited for one

863
01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:19.800
Brandon H: To get the job again. But he has an injury. So I got it.

864
01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.650
Brandon H: He's in his 70s, and he shouldn't be doing stuff he does, but still does it.

865
01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:31.170
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Oh, well, yeah, I mean,

866
01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:37.230
Richelle Direny: That's another thing when you're, you know, you're up there in age, you don't want to do

867
01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:44.070
Richelle Direny: Over exert yourself because then it just becomes more or you

868
01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.050
Richelle Direny: Into

869
01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:54.180
Richelle Direny: So, um, but that's good. Overall, I mean, that's good. Like you're just finding. Basically, I hear you saying, It's just you're finding

870
01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:00.960
Richelle Direny: Ways to exercise in just your normal routine of things to do.

871
01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.190
Yeah.

872
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:11.640
Brandon H: Then the guy was Uber and for I'll be certain midnight's again, they're kind of rotating shifts around. Here's a coronavirus where he works.

873
01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:25.500
Brandon H: So next week over you burn him again as another 50 bucks. And because you busy in the mornings. So am I going to get into some exercise because they don't go back to like 737 45 when I do that, Uber, about an hour to trip.

874
01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:26.820
You

875
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.780
Brandon H: Know, issues of society.

876
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.870
Richelle Direny: Oh, because

877
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:48.600
Brandon H: I was doing it for a friend of mine, son. He works not far from my home to visit alliance. So a city gets a road he sees a ride home in the mornings and he gets up 633 when I work, I get up at six. So what so

878
01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:55.710
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you're you're you're finding different ways to generate income.

879
01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:05.670
Brandon H: Yeah, and to stay busy to try to find things to do anything, I'll go to grocery stores over my home all day just to do so.

880
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:09.840
Brandon H: I rarely stay inside all day long.

881
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:13.800
Richelle Direny: I'm explaining how much rest of you get

882
01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.850
Brandon H: A lot. I've been doing better. The last couple months.

883
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:27.900
Brandon H: Haven't been sleeping quite as much. I mean, for a while there I was sleeping. I'd work going sleep too. I try to stick to our guns but working read literally

884
01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.570
Richelle Direny: So what's great about that change. Huh, what's right about that change.

885
01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:39.690
Brandon H: Back on Suboxone I live in a hectic not being sort of press

886
01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:41.880
Richelle Direny: Next,

887
01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:46.980
Brandon H: Time I have seasonal depression I get depressed in the winter, every time.

888
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.470
Richelle Direny: That you that you got you.

889
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:52.470
Richelle Direny: Got you.

890
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:54.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

891
01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:57.630
Richelle Direny: I'm

892
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:00.810
Richelle Direny: A psychiatry is diagnosed you with seasonal

893
01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:02.910
Brandon H: No, I did.

894
01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.100
Richelle Direny: You do.

895
01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.820
Brandon H: Today agree with me if I say is overused anything itself. I'm, you know, but

896
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:15.420
Brandon H: I pretty much got my own diagnosis down and I know what I need. Don't need

897
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:21.960
Richelle Direny: I mean season. I know I have heard about, um,

898
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:28.350
Richelle Direny: What is it seasonal seasonal affective disorder.

899
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.630
Brandon H: That's a little more intense minds is there seasonal depression and colors. It's like

900
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:41.610
Richelle Direny: No, it is. It's the same thing. It's, it's quite it's a diagnosis. It's a diagnosis. That's what it's called. Because I remember here in Florida.

901
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:58.650
Richelle Direny: Know, it was more so effective it whatever the diagnosis is I remember here in Florida, seeing that diagnosis in a psychiatry saying that there's those diagnosis is are more in where the seasons changes.

902
01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:06.060
Richelle Direny: And when the seasons changes. Is it affects different people in different way, like you said you're more depressed during a particular season.

903
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:11.070
Brandon H: So everybody was it all year long. I think

904
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:13.200
Brandon H: That like mania and the summer and

905
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:20.730
Brandon H: The winter I just have a little wonder drug depression, usually in a sexually maybe more than most.

906
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:27.480
Richelle Direny: Was specifically about the winter. You think about that season is more depressing for you.

907
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:29.310
I'm

908
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:34.830
Brandon H: Just being so Colby and trapped and days are shorter

909
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.030
Brandon H: Kind of a depressing times jury jury.

910
01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:54.750
Richelle Direny: But then I know, for the most part, you've always said that, you know, you tend to isolate more you stay by yourself a lot. So what about that season when you're trapped or not trapped. But when you're more isolated.

911
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.220
Brandon H: And almost like you're forced to stay and you don't have a choice, you know,

912
01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:12.450
Richelle Direny: So for you, it's more mental in terms of like now. Well, okay. So, especially with what's going on now. Would you say you're more depressed now because of the fact that you're more forced to stay in only really allowed to go out

913
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:20.700
Brandon H: I felt that rather rules at all. I do as they please. I go to stores and seven over run around. No, nothing but

914
01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:26.070
Brandon H: You haven't really followed staying out and stay indoors unless an emergency or whatever.

915
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:41.400
Richelle Direny: Gotcha, gotcha. And so even though. So even though I'm so the difference between now and in the winter, the winter, the coldness and when it's you're saying where you are. It snows right

916
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:48.510
Brandon H: Yeah, get a fair amount of snow this year is pretty easy winner, but it's been cold throughout April. So it's been rough that way.

917
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:57.360
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you're saying that even in the winter when you're more the weather conditions. Keep you more track, it's harder.

918
01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:02.640
Brandon H: So yeah, you wake up. You're cold and at and, you know,

919
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.690
Brandon H: He got to go outside shovel snow record.

920
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:09.210
Brandon H: Just a pain.

921
01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:20.250
Richelle Direny: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. So you think I know one of the things you said like, you know, having a companion think that if you had a companion. The depression would have been less

922
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:23.400
Brandon H: I would assume so. Yeah, easy it is.

923
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.950
Richelle Direny: Because one of the things we talked about yesterday in group was

924
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:37.440
Richelle Direny: The quote that I had put out there who that we discussed a lot is where you thought you would have been at this the picture you had

925
01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:47.670
Richelle Direny: At this point in your life that you probably would have been married and had children, and given that that's not your reality. You think that during the winter it, it reminds you that much more

926
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:50.310
Richelle Direny: Of the things that you don't have

927
01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.340
Brandon H: Yeah, so what

928
01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:55.920
Led to that.

929
01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.130
Richelle Direny: But what you spend times you see, you see your nephew was in your, your brother. Right.

930
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.200
Brandon H: Sometimes, it says the coronavirus No. See, I'm a down day before Easter.

931
01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:17.250
Brandon H: Give a bunch of candy and a rocket things you either like that and big rocket flies off the phone rocket

932
01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.450
Brandon H: candour here.

933
01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.410
Richelle Direny: Um,

934
01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:34.320
Richelle Direny: So it may be, you know, in the future, one of the things that we could, because I know some things you have. It's like that social anxiety.

935
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.670
Brandon H: Yeah, I've been doing a little better. I just kind of go with the flow. And it's not a social butterfly, for I never will be.

936
01:24:43.050 --> 01:25:02.190
Richelle Direny: Again, it's how you think about it, social things that sometimes we we go back go back into that statement, the picture we create in our minds, we create in our minds that the way to socialize is one that mirrors, a person that is a social butterfly what socialization doesn't have to be.

937
01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:10.350
Richelle Direny: One that marries a social butterfly, because even a social butterfly sometimes says, Maybe I shouldn't be so social

938
01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.350
Richelle Direny: So like

939
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:13.890
Yeah.

940
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:18.870
Brandon H: Vs. The others can do it.

941
01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:26.550
Richelle Direny: They remember and we've talked about this in the past, it's kind of, it's how you think about it, you don't have to

942
01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:40.980
Richelle Direny: Just say what you have to say. And just keep it moving. Or, you know, you don't have to always be a part of the conversation in terms of verbally, you can be there, you could share just limited but you don't have to always be a part of the bigger conversation.

943
01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:53.610
Brandon H: Right. I mean, I didn't keep up the conversation. So I understand there's a lot less than seven words why our I and knowledgeable about a subject or

944
01:25:56.010 --> 01:26:00.870
Brandon H: easier for people to start talking about seven domains. No matter much. So when a curveball thermo off.

945
01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.770
Brandon H: I'll say something totally different.

946
01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.640
Richelle Direny: But even but even I'm

947
01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:20.190
Richelle Direny: Just, just think about something that you are pretty knowledgeable about, um, do you just you just do you add to the conversation just like maybe facts about it, something that you are very

948
01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:23.370
Richelle Direny: knowledgeable about and just leave it, or do you just keep it going.

949
01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:33.210
Brandon H: And is trying to keep up with him. I started learning sheep. We're talking about segments like they're talking about who the Browns drafted or

950
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:41.490
Brandon H: How's it seems you know look this year. Oh, listen to stuff like that kind of BS because more factual and it's some it can happen.

951
01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.430
Richelle Direny: In comparison to them.

952
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:46.860
Brandon H: Talking about the weather or something. Oh.

953
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:48.900
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry.

954
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:50.070
Brandon H: To say it was kind of

955
01:26:50.100 --> 01:27:00.870
Brandon H: Slow today or tomorrow or going to rain tomorrow or 30% chance of rain, but this one's from the north of coming in. So who knew they don't. This is some data meteorologist reading just

956
01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.800
Richelle Direny: Pointed stuff you know every

957
01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:05.400
Brandon H: Meeting it

958
01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:11.670
Richelle Direny: How does it. Um, so how was it for you being a part of, like, even groups.

959
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:14.670
Richelle Direny: Being a part of that larger conversation.

960
01:27:16.170 --> 01:27:21.300
Brandon H: It's all right good to me or kind of annoying because some people were paying attention. So we were kind of lost

961
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:22.650
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

962
01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.220
Brandon H: And I pay attention just I don't know church.

963
01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:32.130
Richelle Direny: It's a little bit more distracting because people are doing so many other things and are not

964
01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.050
Brandon H: A lot of people aren't paying a bit of attention.

965
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.450
Richelle Direny: But then

966
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:38.340
Brandon H: I watched him on the screen.

967
01:27:40.170 --> 01:27:42.120
Richelle Direny: But even with even with Zach.

968
01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:45.090
Richelle Direny: Just kind of for yourself.

969
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:54.450
Richelle Direny: How is that in terms of even the topic or even for for the people that are paying attention. Um, are you

970
01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.440
Brandon H: Carrying. It doesn't bother me just

971
01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:03.270
Brandon H: Because it's structured as easy for me have a structure.

972
01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.500
Brandon H: The structure structure to set our time with

973
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:12.090
Richelle Direny: Hmm, and the distraction tend to be a little

974
01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:14.310
Brandon H: Yeah, more

975
01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.290
Unstructured

976
01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:22.050
Richelle Direny: To use a dreamer zone. Oh, hmm.

977
01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.560
Brandon H: See a daydreamer puny zone out

978
01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:37.770
Richelle Direny: Now, do you think it's a little bit more distract. How would you compare it like even being in one for you and kind of like, even with the socialization, or just being a part of a conversation and just be

979
01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:51.330
Richelle Direny: Your personality, ultimately, how was that in this setting, being a part of a video chat in comparison to if you were sitting on our room with everyone else.

980
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:58.890
Brandon H: That made me a little more uncomfortable because then you gotta do is all the up close and personal stuff but

981
01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:08.010
Brandon H: I dealt with it. I mean, I was in that chance program for a year and we had group three times a week for eight weeks, two times a week for

982
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:14.370
Brandon H: 12 weeks, one time a week for, like, however many weeks to finish.

983
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.660
Brandon H: So I did a lot of that did a lot of a and stuff.

984
01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:22.110
Brandon H: I mean, I can do it is not my cup of tea.

985
01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:27.420
Richelle Direny: It's not your cup of tea, but you're able to take away from it what you can

986
01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:29.730
Brandon H: Yeah, I tried to

987
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:37.950
Richelle Direny: It's just, it's you have limited control of your outside environment.

988
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.360
Yeah.

989
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:52.020
Richelle Direny: And I think it's coming to that acceptance awareness one and acceptance. The other is we have you only have control of your inside environment where you are right now.

990
01:29:52.650 --> 01:30:04.320
Richelle Direny: You have no control of your outside environment and what people bring to it because you're in a different place than another person and what you bring to a group discussion or the topic.

991
01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:09.150
Richelle Direny: Can help the ones that are paying attention, you know,

992
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:14.670
Richelle Direny: It's going to be very hard for everyone to stay focus

993
01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:21.960
Richelle Direny: To be a part. It's very seldom that you get everyone that is really focused and really weighing in

994
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:31.680
Brandon H: Ensuring I already know what they all I have to say, I just had a hard time not what people are talking about is that I was just registers in my mind.

995
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:42.060
Brandon H: Some that I relate to someone was just like they repeat themselves or they say frivolous things over and over and over. And then I get lost in their own sentence.

996
01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.350
Richelle Direny: So for you, that's a little bit of a challenge.

997
01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:53.820
Brandon H: I challenge myself not to get frustrated, annoyed with different levels of

998
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:57.390
Brandon H: Comprehension or visitation.

999
01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:08.010
Richelle Direny: And that's good. And so, so that can be the conversation of our weaknesses, it's because you try your best not to

1000
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:21.210
Richelle Direny: get annoyed, or because remember we often judge people and look at people and think people should operate based on our own lens of what how we are. And so it's very hard to be able to

1001
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:31.320
Richelle Direny: It's very hard to be able to be tolerant of others limitation if it's not our limitations and it's very hard to be tolerant.

1002
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:36.810
Richelle Direny: Of people's comprehension and everything that comes along with that, when it's not through our own lens.

1003
01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:50.940
Richelle Direny: So, but I, we have to we learn one to be aware of it and learn how to work through it that we're all our own unique individuals and our level of understanding and the way we communicate is very different. Well, we can all learn from each other in that way.

1004
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:53.580
Richelle Direny: We get along with each other. Yeah.

1005
01:31:55.530 --> 01:31:56.040
Richelle Direny: Let me

1006
01:31:57.570 --> 01:31:58.110
Richelle Direny: For next

1007
01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:00.750
Brandon H: Year. Yeah, let me get my notebook.

1008
01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:21.330
Brandon H: Are you starting that Monday group next week.

1009
01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:27.120
Richelle Direny: Not next week, I have to, I have to try to figure it out. I'll let you know what we're going to sell when

1010
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:30.420
Brandon H: They open like to use whichever one you choose.

1011
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:33.000
Brandon H: To sign him.

1012
01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:35.970
Richelle Direny: He said if they're going to leave it open.

1013
01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:39.960
Brandon H: Yeah, like I can do Monday or and good two different times. Thursday.

1014
01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:43.680
Richelle Direny: Well, that's how I suggesting

1015
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:52.680
Richelle Direny: That's what I suggested is that you have to to come to group because you want to, you want to be able to choose whether or not you going on Monday or Thursday.

1016
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:58.590
Brandon H: Yes, it's a one way to go on Monday nights was on a Thursday that keep that possibility.

1017
01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:09.450
Richelle Direny: Well, let me talk. Let me talk to the the powers that be to see if we can leave it open, because that remember if we leave it. I think it's, it also is attached to your script.

1018
01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.170
Script

1019
01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:20.670
Richelle Direny: Meaning that you remember because they, how does Natalie's fill your script monthly or weekly

1020
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:23.220
Brandon H: Bi weekly as of now.

1021
01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.650
Richelle Direny: Bi weekly. Okay, so then

1022
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:27.360
Brandon H: It should be going into little

1023
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:35.220
Brandon H: Three weeks here soon. I mean, you mentioned that you only have to go to group like every other time if you do real good attendance.

1024
01:33:36.330 --> 01:33:38.820
Brandon H: I mean, common sense like

1025
01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:48.360
Brandon H: early February, getting a favorite end of January, I only missed one group. So anything ever missed the whole time I've been here.

1026
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:52.980
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then let me talk to Natalie about. See if you can switch to

1027
01:33:54.120 --> 01:34:00.210
Richelle Direny: Monthly. Let me talk to me about that. Let me see what what she says. And kind of like reviewing the parents and more

1028
01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:03.900
Brandon H: Out of talking to you one on one that I do with people just going on about

1029
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:08.700
Brandon H: We have to form, but sometimes they they get off topic.

1030
01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.500
Richelle Direny: And you got to repeat

1031
01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:14.760
Brandon H: What you said at the beginning 10 times I'm like Jerry said that five times ago

1032
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:24.600

Richelle Direny: Country. The weather is really bad. The rest just kind of everything is

1072
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:09.450
Galaxy A10e: Our governor, just to make an announcement to so there's probably lots of people on their phones.

1073
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:12.900
Richelle Direny: You said the government that just made an announcement.

1074
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:20.970
Galaxy A10e: Yes, extended stay at home. So there's probably tons of people online right now and on your thumbs.

1075
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:29.610
Richelle Direny: Up. We didn't even speak. They extended it past the first because I know they they're trying to open up everything by the first

Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

1079
01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:53.670
Richelle Direny: And I think that's what it is. I think they're the even though the President wants to do one thing. I think it's really up to the each individual states governor what they do.

1087
01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.540
Richelle Direny: Um, so with the

1088
01:38:52.650 --> 01:39:01.530
Richelle Direny: With Michigan. I have the groups every Tuesday at 630 so I know every Monday you meet with Dr. For Rocco.

1089
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:02.940
Kelly Yeomans: Yep.

1090
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:09.330
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so I have groups so groups are like a requirement. So, you know, and with

1091
01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:24.000
Richelle Direny: Compliance with the program and you know groups and what have you, then at that point. Dr farago can, you know, make the determination or I could even make the determination whether or not you have to come to group every week or if you just come on a monthly basis.

1092
01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:25.380
Richelle Direny: But

1093
01:39:25.410 --> 01:39:33.360
Richelle Direny: Each time that will check in the same like what you do with Dr farago you check in, in virtual clinic when in virtual clinic.

1094
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:44.190
Richelle Direny: Okay, they will give you the code for whether if you're seeing doctor for Agha whether you're coming to group with me or you're doing individual with me. That's always the platform you go through

1095
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.590
Richelle Direny: Virtual clinic.

1096
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:50.220
Richelle Direny: The same way you sent me the message.

1097
01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:51.480
Richelle Direny: If

1098
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:59.490
Richelle Direny: You're running late or you're unable to make it like this, you're at work or you can't take the time or whatever the situation just always send me a message.

1099
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:07.980
Richelle Direny: I honestly like especially this morning. I really appreciate when someone sends me a message to say, hey, I'm running late or whatever the situation is

1100
01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:13.560
Richelle Direny: Because like I'm literally sitting here, just waiting for everyone to show

1101
01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:21.420
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, so always, you know, have that information on blocks, put my name. So you can always communicate with me that way.

1102
01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:29.130
Richelle Direny: And now, whenever you especially when you come to groups like I see you have your headset, especially when you come to groups.

1103
01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:35.220
Richelle Direny: We always ask that you keep your headset, especially if you're like, I know right now you're in your car, but let's say if your home.

1104
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:51.210
Richelle Direny: And your other people living in the home that it just provides a degree of privacy. So, because there are other people that's on the screen speaking and you don't want everyone in the background to hear it. So everybody has to just provide the same respect for each other so

1105
01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:57.870
Richelle Direny: I always asked, like if you're in your car, sometimes, you know, people will say, Hey, I'm not going to wear my headset because I'm in my car. I'm the only one that's fine.

1106
01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:14.550
Richelle Direny: Um, especially when you're meeting with me. I'm that's kind of how I look at it, so you know next Tuesday the 28th. Are you able to come to groups on Tuesdays at 630

1107
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.850
And thank you for

1108
01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.020
Richelle Direny: Okay, I think you were frozen for a while. Can you hear me now.

1109
01:41:58.110 --> 01:41:59.310

1118
01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:33.360
Richelle Direny: Just

1119
01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:33.690
Kelly Yeomans: Keeps freezing. That's really weird.

1120
01:43:35.130 --> 01:43:38.910
Richelle Direny: I don't know. I don't know if it was me this time because I think both of us just went off.

1121
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:45.900

1126
01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:15.780
Kelly Yeomans: Yes.

1127
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:18.750
Kelly Yeomans: Right, especially because my hours are cut so

1128
01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.110

Kelly Yeomans: Okay, so I have back pain, and I started seeing a pain specialist and they put me on all kinds of opioids and then that was probably for three or four years.

1142
01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:08.880
Kelly Yeomans: And then they cut me off because of my insurance. And so, by that time I was addicted and they didn't we me off. And so I just found it other places to get it.

1269
01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.650
Richelle Direny: Sobriety in terms of not being dependent on

1270
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:33.570
Richelle Direny: The pills.

1271
01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.590
Kelly Yeomans: And maybe

1272
01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:43.350
Kelly Yeomans: I think since I started with the Suboxone

1273
01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:45.960
Kelly Yeomans: I didn't think about it again.

1274
01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:05.430
Richelle Direny: So in terms of working towards your own sobriety, where are you in terms of

1275
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:12.630
Richelle Direny: What is your goal is it that your goal is that you just

1276
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:24.960
Richelle Direny: You want to eventually taper off. Like, what was your goal when you decided okay let me find a program to help me with this outside of, you know, just buying it off the street. What was your thought process.

1277
01:57:26.190 --> 01:57:26.910
Kelly Yeomans: Um,

1278
01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:33.090
Kelly Yeomans: I don't want to buy it off the street anymore, but I don't want to have back pain, either.

1279
01:57:34.530 --> 01:57:41.160
Kelly Yeomans: Oh, I need to be able to stay off them and to be able to control my pain also

1280
01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:46.200
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. So from a medical standpoint, with you. I'm sure you have

1281
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:53.010
Richelle Direny: To for your arthritis. What is their plan of care in terms of managing your pain.

1282
01:57:55.800 --> 01:58:01.110
Kelly Yeomans: It's they tell me to take ibuprofen, which I've taken pain pills for so long that

1283
01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:04.110
Kelly Yeomans: That doesn't do anything. So

1284
01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:12.570
Kelly Yeomans: I guess one step at a time. I mean, get my pills under control and then figure that out.

1285
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:21.330
Richelle Direny: So right now it's just your main focus is just to get the pain under control and then go from there. Now, I mean,

1286
01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.990
Richelle Direny: I know with her, it is, it comes, you know, with a lot of pain and

1287
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:32.940
Richelle Direny: Depending on how far gone, it is no there is an enormous amount of pain, but

1288
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:45.120
Richelle Direny: It's one thing to yes to get stable on the Suboxone or more just to take the Suboxone to stabilize the pain, but then the reality of it, just like with anything.

1289
01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:52.230
Richelle Direny: Like, even with the medication that they told you to take if your body becomes immune to it, then it doesn't really do a whole lot of anything.

1290
01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:55.830
Richelle Direny: So I and having that conversation.

1291
01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:08.670
Richelle Direny: With that medical provider, it's him having a realistic conversation with you to say, hey, there has to be more to managing my pain than just taking something because

1292
01:59:09.210 --> 01:59:22.800
Richelle Direny: His streaking has stated that I take this my body gets me into it. I'm back again. I'm on this. My body kind of immune to it. I'm back again. So, you know, I'm coming to see you. You have to give me right and just that.

1293
01:59:23.550 --> 01:59:23.850
Yeah.

1294
01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.730
Richelle Direny: So have you had

1295
01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:28.260
Richelle Direny: Have you had

1296
01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:36.360
Kelly Yeomans: I have not. I haven't even thought about it, but it definitely makes sense. I do.

1297
01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:39.270
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

1298
01:59:40.290 --> 01:59:50.190
Richelle Direny: Realistically speaking, when you, when we're thinking about goals, especially if one of the main things is pain if someone said, ones that you know they eventually wanted to

1299
01:59:51.630 --> 02:00:02.850
Richelle Direny: taper off of the Suboxone message. Okay. Well, let's think about if it's a realistic goal for you or they want to take on a taper off of medications, period. Well, let's talk about the realistic piece of it.

1300
02:00:03.450 --> 02:00:16.830
Richelle Direny: If you're, if it is that you're having back pain, and it's a medical reason why you're doing this. What was that conversation with that doctor and if the doctor saying, well, you have to have surgery. But then you say, No, I don't want to have

1301
02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:33.390
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

1302
02:00:38.010 --> 02:00:38.730
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me now.

1303
02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:39.660
Kelly Yeomans: I can hear you.

1304
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:55.290
Richelle Direny: Okay, you know, if the doctor says if you say, No, I don't want to follow that. And if the doctor says, well, all you can do is manage your pain and this is how you manage your pain because there's nothing else from a medical standpoint that we can do, then you would have to adjust your

1305
02:00:55.290 --> 02:01:06.390
Richelle Direny: Goal in knowing how to manage the pain and taking a medication and not having a goal to taper off of the medication because that's literally the only way to manage your pain.

1306
02:01:06.810 --> 02:01:16.440
Richelle Direny: So when we're thinking about goals and what is it that you want to do is first having that very real conversation with this medical professional and saying, hey,

1307
02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:22.050
Richelle Direny: What stage is my arthritis. What is it that I can do right now to manage it.

1308
02:01:22.410 --> 02:01:34.620
Richelle Direny: Is it that you know if they say, well, you need to. I mean, I can only see your face. So if they say no, you need to lose weight. No, you need to do more exercise, you need to do. You have to have that very real conversation with the doctor.

1309
02:01:36.030 --> 02:01:45.150
Richelle Direny: And with saying that, then you can have a better idea of how you're managing your pain moving forward so that you can decrease

1310
02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:56.460
Richelle Direny: Your pain levels, um, you have an idea what am I working with, what am I doing because I could take a pill. There's no problem.

1311
02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:05.160
Richelle Direny: But then my pain is getting more so it's going to cause me to take more pills. So what exactly is this real conversation with the doctor.

1312
02:02:05.490 --> 02:02:14.430
Richelle Direny: Am I, I don't. And I don't really know how arthritis work. Is it like you know if there's phase one and phase two. Where is my face. And what does that look like right now.

1313
02:02:14.730 --> 02:02:20.400
Richelle Direny: And what are the chances that you know I could go to phase two, or can I slow the progression, so it doesn't get to that.

1314
02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:23.700
Richelle Direny: And it's having that very real conversation with a doctor and

1315
02:02:23.730 --> 02:02:32.640
Richelle Direny: Then making a realistic plan or goal for this to say, hey, because then I'm abusing

1316
02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:37.380
Richelle Direny: Medication because I have so much pain, but then

1317
02:02:38.730 --> 02:02:48.330
Richelle Direny: My pain is getting becoming more and more. So then Suboxone is not going to be strong enough to assist that if I don't really have that very real conversation with the doctor.

1318
02:02:49.710 --> 02:02:50.100
Kelly Yeomans: Okay.

1319
02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:53.940
Kelly Yeomans: Okay, that makes sense. Yep. So

1320
02:02:54.390 --> 02:03:02.400
Richelle Direny: Um, let's, I'm going to make another appointment with you because I know your time is going by and I again don't want not want to be

1321
02:03:05.850 --> 02:03:06.300
Richelle Direny: So,

1322
02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:11.040
Richelle Direny: Let's make our next. Now this evening better for you.

1323
02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:15.540
Kelly Yeomans: Yeah.

1324
02:03:17.370 --> 02:03:18.600
Kelly Yeomans: Yeah, that would work. You

1325
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:22.770
Richelle Direny: Know if I put it for the 18th at four. Would that be okay for you.

1326
02:03:26.610 --> 02:03:39.870
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, and I'll send you a reminder for the 18th at 4pm and I will have the, the, the care coordinators send a reminder out for you for Monday at a for Tuesday at 630

1327
02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:42.180

02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:59.580
Richelle Direny: That is indicating that you know you're having thoughts or you want to harm yourself then you know confidentiality kind of goes out the door in that aspect.

1389
02:08:59.850 --> 02:09:00.210
Rachel Cooper: But

1390
02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:03.540

Rachel Cooper: And then I had $50 one day and another friend was up here, try this. It's cheaper and it'll get all of us from being sick.

1420
02:13:15.090 --> 02:13:16.800
Rachel Cooper: And that began my journey with heroin.

1421
02:13:17.250 --> 02:13:18.480
Richelle Direny: At 21 years old.

1422
02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:21.060
Rachel Cooper: I was 31 when I started the heroin.

1423
02:13:21.930 --> 02:13:24.060
Richelle Direny: But 21 when you started the

1424
02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:28.530
Richelle Direny: Pill, and this is after the birth of your daughter. You said

1425
02:13:29.130 --> 02:13:34.710
Richelle Direny: Yes. And this is, um, after the birth of your daughter, and after your accident.

1426
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:38.430
Rachel Cooper: Yeah, I was 17 when I got to the bad car accident.

1427
02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:57.270
Rachel Cooper: And then got pregnant had my daughter and I was just so tired all the time. Um, and she was like my sister really she carried me and from the car. The day I came home from the hospital when I was born, you know, she was like family. So I trusted her

1428
02:13:58.890 --> 02:14:16.470
Rachel Cooper: I had no idea of like it was addictive. No clue at all. You know, back then it was darvocet for the big thing. You know what I mean. So I never would take those. But then I went to break it in. Well, once I started goes. It was, you know, for me it was like Kevin. I was awake.

1429
02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:20.280
Rachel Cooper: I felt good. I'm

1430
02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:32.400
Rachel Cooper: Sorry. Um, and then for 10 years I continued on with that to where it got to where I was spending three, four or $500 a day and pills.

1431
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:45.750
Rachel Cooper: And somebody introduced me to heroin and I would do one line a day and I would be fine that lasted for about six months and gradually I got all the way up to where I was doing about two grams a day.

1432
02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:52.140
Rachel Cooper: Then it went from snorting it moved on to injecting it

1433
02:14:56.730 --> 02:15:00.030
Rachel Cooper: And I am, it helps with the pain.

1434
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:04.050
Rachel Cooper: It blocked out all the emotional pain that I was feeling

1435
02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:05.490
Rachel Cooper: Mm hmm. Um,

1436
02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:20.430
Rachel Cooper: It was to me. I felt like I found a miracle cure. You know, I worked at a bar. So I would get drunk and the next day have a hangover. But I would take to like it and and to the action I would be brand new.

1437
02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.910
Richelle Direny: And I'm

1438
02:15:25.410 --> 02:15:26.070
Richelle Direny: So,

1439
02:15:27.210 --> 02:15:30.300
Richelle Direny: This went on for the next 10 to 15 years

1440
02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:36.390
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay. And have you ever gone into treatment.

1441
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:38.910
Rachel Cooper: I've been into treatment 17 times

1442
02:15:40.710 --> 02:15:41.880
Richelle Direny: When was the last treatment.

1443
02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.080
Richelle Direny: Room. You were in

1444
02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:52.350
Rachel Cooper: About three months ago and I took my son, which means, but the way he behavior on the other kids, they had me leave because he just

1445
02:15:53.430 --> 02:16:01.770
Rachel Cooper: When he's in a strange place he acts out very badly. And I don't smack on my child. So they said I wasn't disciplining him enough

1446
02:16:03.090 --> 02:16:07.080
Rachel Cooper: So I chose to leave as opposed to make my child stand on the corner all day long.

1447
02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:10.470
Richelle Direny: Live in program that you were in

1448
02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:13.380

1451
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:29.040
Rachel Cooper: So,

1452
02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:33.450
Richelle Direny: So what, um,

1453
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:43.320
Richelle Direny: Okay, what about um

1454
02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:50.940
Richelle Direny: So in 17. What's the name of the last program that you were impatient.

1455
02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:52.200
Rachel Cooper: Clear view.

1456
02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:56.970
Richelle Direny: And this was with the clear view was a family friendly. It sounded like

1457
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:59.850
Richelle Direny: If you were able to bring your child.

1458
02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:09.510

1459
02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:25.140
Richelle Direny: Okay. And so, um, so, so in this last 10 to 15 years it was started with pills addiction to the opiates, then it moved over to the heroin. What about alcohol.

1460
02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:40.020
Rachel Cooper: I drink for for a while, like I said, when I was bartending. I was drinking every single day. Um, but other than that. No, not really. When I'm on opiates alcohol just doesn't do much for me.

1461
02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.090
Rachel Cooper: It just, I don't enjoy it.

1470
02:18:33.210 --> 02:18:39.600
Rachel Cooper: And then once again on assault and battery. But again, was never formally charged. Come here, boy.

1471
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:53.370

1540
02:26:11.970 --> 02:26:15.270
Richelle Direny: Okay. Now when you say your religion, what would

1543
02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:25.770
And so

1544
02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.040
Rachel Cooper: I don't want to spend eternity in Hell because no matter how bad I got it here. That sounds much much worse.

02:26:53.490 --> 02:26:54.510
Rachel Cooper: Not that I'm aware of.

1551
02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:55.950
Rachel Cooper: Now,

1552
02:26:55.980 --> 02:27:06.600
Richelle Direny: Even now, when so going back a little bit. When you said about the homicide. The video. The vehicular homicide. Were you in the vehicle. Were you

1553
02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:21.450
Rachel Cooper: I was driving and I was an abusive marriage and we separated and I moved home with my mom and my daughter is from a previous relationship to my husband and

1554
02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:27.990
Rachel Cooper: He showed up to take my hurt her dad showed up to take my daughter to school. Well, my husband. Shut up at the same time.

1555
02:27:28.410 --> 02:27:43.110
Rachel Cooper: So I sent my daughter, along with her dad. Well, I knew he was going to try to fight with me. So I got in my car to drive away. And as I was blown down the driveway. He tried to be just jump on my car and wrapped his arms and I rolled my windows up well.

1556
02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:53.760
Rachel Cooper: Somehow he continued to grab on. And I think the window caught his shirt because he wasn't letting go. But halfway down the block you finally let go, was arm shattered.

1557
02:27:54.300 --> 02:28:03.600

02:41:02.730 --> 02:41:04.260
Rachel Cooper: You haven't done anything

1704
02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:10.080
Rachel Cooper: I found it. Thanks for the help

1705
02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:20.400
Rachel Cooper: Oh, what did I do

1706
02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.860
Rachel Cooper: Monday. Oh, now you want to take off.

02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:56.730
Rachel Cooper: And that's her problem is, is I'm on her phone. I'm sorry.

1711
02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:00.540
Richelle Direny: Oh, it's her phone that has the camera.

1712
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.560
Yeah.

1713
02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:05.520
Rachel Cooper: I'm sure I apologize.

1714
02:42:06.210 --> 02:42:11.880
Richelle Direny: No problem. Now, you said that, um, you weren't allowed to stay with her before.

1715
02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:13.200
Correct.

1716
02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:18.180
Richelle Direny: It hasn't always been this way.

1717
02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:20.190
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

1718
02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:24.450
Richelle Direny: So what's the dynamic between you and your mom.

1719
02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:26.700
Rachel Cooper: You see it.

1720
02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:33.360
Rachel Cooper: What toys.

1721
02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:35.730
Rachel Cooper: Get them what's going on.

1722
02:42:36.750 --> 02:42:39.780
Rachel Cooper: Why are you yelling at him. You need to phones.

1723
02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:42.360
Rachel Cooper: So I can set here.

1724
02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:53.310
Rachel Cooper: Sorry.

1725
02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:01.500
Richelle Direny: Take a moment.

1726
02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:20.070
Rachel Cooper: I don't, I really don't understand why she treats me like that. I really don't. I've been doing everything everything this whole sense the year started to try

1727
02:43:22.530 --> 02:43:26.040
Rachel Cooper: I do everything for her but I asked for one thing, and this is what she does.

1728
02:43:30.750 --> 02:43:33.120
Richelle Direny: Are you working on trying to get your own place.

1729
02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:35.760
Richelle Direny: Where you're unable to at this time.

1730
02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:46.140
Rachel Cooper: I'M NOT ABLE TO THIS TIME AND SHE'S GOT CUSTODY OF MY SON. So if I go I don't get to see him, and she throws that up in my face every single day.

1731
02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:52.740
Richelle Direny: So she only has custody of your son alone.

1732
02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:55.920
Rachel Cooper: She adopted my son so

1733
02:43:57.540 --> 02:44:00.150
Richelle Direny: For the four year old, she legally adopted him.

1734
02:44:00.810 --> 02:44:01.200
Yeah.

1735
02:44:03.150 --> 02:44:03.870
Richelle Direny: From birth.

1736
02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:07.230
Rachel Cooper: Yes, cuz I was on drugs.

1737
02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:10.410
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1738
02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:16.860
Richelle Direny: And what in your other son was adopted by another family member.

1739
02:44:19.230 --> 02:44:22.410
Rachel Cooper: Oh no, I'm my other son.

1740
02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:35.220
Rachel Cooper: I was clean with him. I got clean. When I found out it was pregnant. Um, and, yeah, I have my body doesn't carry babies. Well, I had him at 27 weeks pregnant.

1741
02:44:36.030 --> 02:44:47.670
Rachel Cooper: And he wasn't withdrawing or anything, but, um, you had to stay in the incubator, because it was so small. Well, I'm about a week before you is ready to be released, um,

1742
02:44:48.600 --> 02:45:02.220
Rachel Cooper: Before my court date to see if I was going to get to keep them. I was arrested on some more sense. And I missed my court date. And because of that, and because of my prior cases, they all they took them from me and I haven't seen him since.

1743
02:45:04.410 --> 02:45:06.870
Richelle Direny: So you sign away your rights and he was like, no.

1744
02:45:07.650 --> 02:45:10.170
Rachel Cooper: I didn't sign away my rights. They just took my rights.

1745
02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:15.930
Richelle Direny: Hmm, and he was legally adopted by another family. Yeah.

1746
02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:21.960
Richelle Direny: So the only person, the only child, you have full custody of your daughter.

1747
02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:29.220
Rachel Cooper: Yeah, and my mom has guardianship of for go he can sit in here. Oh.

1748
02:45:32.670 --> 02:45:37.740
Rachel Cooper: God why, excuse me, why can't you sit in here on the phone. I didn't ask you to take camp well

1749
02:45:43.770 --> 02:45:45.420
Richelle Direny: When did you move back in with your mom.

1750
02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:52.410
Rachel Cooper: Just a couple days ago, but it's like this every time I come to visit to. That's why I'm not here a lot

1751
02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:55.560
Richelle Direny: So where do you say if you're not living with her.

1752
02:45:56.430 --> 02:46:02.190
Rachel Cooper: random places lover, a lot me stay the night outside wherever

1753
02:46:03.330 --> 02:46:09.630
Richelle Direny: I'm I mean this, it seems like it will be a trigger both

1754
02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:27.780
Rachel Cooper: For trigger. But if I'm not here. I guess I am you know brain damage from my strokes. I have memory issues. I won't. I don't remember. I don't have a phone to use to call you guys. Um, I don't have access to my kids if I'm not here. It's only choice. I just have to deal with it.

1755
02:46:29.550 --> 02:46:30.600
Richelle Direny: And then, have you been

1756
02:46:32.190 --> 02:46:34.440
Richelle Direny: When was the last time that you've used

1757
02:46:36.810 --> 02:46:38.880
Rachel Cooper: Oh yes, I might use about two weeks ago.

1758
02:46:43.050 --> 02:46:48.870
Richelle Direny: And around the time that you the two weeks, was a lot of what's going on currently what's going on as well.

1759
02:46:49.980 --> 02:46:51.810
Rachel Cooper: Happens every day. So, yeah.

1760
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:56.400
Richelle Direny: And you use the in in what did you use when you use

1761
02:46:57.810 --> 02:46:58.230
Rachel Cooper: Heroin

1762
02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:01.860
Richelle Direny: And use it to cope with your stressors.

1763
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:04.440
Rachel Cooper: That helps

1764
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:10.500
Richelle Direny: And that's why you were sick when we weren't able to meet because you were coming off with the heroin.

1765
02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:21.600
Rachel Cooper: No, no, because I only used at that one day and it takes more than just one use for me to get dependent on it again. I was sick because I was literally sick.

1766
02:47:22.650 --> 02:47:24.810
Rachel Cooper: I lost my voice and

1767
02:47:26.490 --> 02:47:27.030
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1768
02:47:28.350 --> 02:47:31.620
Richelle Direny: You don't have any other family or anyone

1769
02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:34.590
Richelle Direny: That is sober support.

1770
02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:36.240
Rachel Cooper: I have no money.

1771
02:47:40.170 --> 02:47:43.260
Rachel Cooper: I have no money to do it on my own.

1772
02:47:47.070 --> 02:47:54.330
Rachel Cooper: I'll get there. That's the point of going back to school. And that's the point of view on with all of this so I can so I can get there, but I know

1773
02:47:57.180 --> 02:48:06.300
Richelle Direny: You do understand that even though you say that you will get very easy to not understand that to go on this journey by yourself. It's going to be very hard.

1774
02:48:08.970 --> 02:48:12.060
Rachel Cooper: I, there was a the phone was ringing. I apologize. What did you say

1775
02:48:12.510 --> 02:48:28.470
Richelle Direny: No, I said, even though you say that you're going to get there, but to do it by yourself to do it alone with so much on your plate. It's going to be very, very hard and your chances are your own, you know, for you are relaxed will be great.

1776
02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:32.220
Rachel Cooper: Yeah, that's what they call me a chronic relapse, sir.

1777
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:34.080
Rachel Cooper: Because I relapsed so often.

1778
02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:51.000
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Because, but, but, I mean, if it's if you're relaxing any indication of mirroring any of what you just what you're encountering right now to do that alone, it's always going to be. There's always going to be relaxed.

1779
02:48:51.090 --> 02:48:52.440
Richelle Direny: Because of what you're dealing with.

1780
02:48:55.980 --> 02:48:57.870
Rachel Cooper: Another reason why I thought

1781
02:48:59.130 --> 02:49:00.270
Rachel Cooper: Hold on one second, please.

1782
02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:33.660
Rachel Cooper: Sorry, I had to go into the other moment. I just want, um, any of the conversation that we heard that's why I thought maybe going back to rehab would be a good idea, but I'm like

1783
02:49:33.810 --> 02:49:35.580
Richelle Direny: We have with the real okay so

1784
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:41.580
Richelle Direny: Looking with a rehab. It's, you know, yes, you can go to rehab. It is an option.

1785
02:49:42.750 --> 02:49:57.480
Richelle Direny: But you're only there for a period of time. So let's say you're there for two months between detox between I'm going through the program you're getting therapy and all of that, you're kind of take taken away from everything all of the triggers and all of that.

1786
02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:59.910
Rachel Cooper: In 19 days 2019

1787
02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.100
Richelle Direny: So then what are you going to do after 19 days.

1788
02:50:02.490 --> 02:50:11.100
Rachel Cooper: Um, they, they helped me what's housing options, looking for, I'm looking for sober living places somewhere to go

1789
02:50:12.390 --> 02:50:12.720
Rachel Cooper: But then

1790
02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:27.360
Richelle Direny: What you're saying that you have very, very limited support. So after 19 days of being in impatient or your monitor all day. Your, your triggers your, your triggers your temptations or or decreased by

1791
02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:37.440
Richelle Direny: 80 to 90% now you go out and they're going to put you in maybe a halfway house or three quarter house, whatever your, your

1792
02:50:39.270 --> 02:50:44.640
Richelle Direny: Your temptation has not gone up, let's say 40%

1793
02:50:45.450 --> 02:50:45.900
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

1794
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:53.250
Richelle Direny: With no support. It just makes it that much harder to resist temptation. So

1795
02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:54.600
Rachel Cooper: I do

1796
02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:01.110
Richelle Direny: And that's why I said, you know, really reevaluating to see in terms of

1797
02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:14.580
Richelle Direny: You know you say you have no support, but then taking a step back and saying, is it that you have no support because you opted to really not talk to anybody because of your history and because of what you've done in the past, maybe, or the relationship you have

1798
02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:22.380
Richelle Direny: Or you know that you can't call anybody like what about a sponsor. Do you have a sponsor. Sorry, getting Johnson.

1799
02:51:22.890 --> 02:51:29.490
Rachel Cooper: I don't have a sponsor and I tried like the, um, um, any meetings like on the phone or whatever.

1800
02:51:30.180 --> 02:51:46.470
Rachel Cooper: And the two that I went to the host was just so rude. Like this one guy call was talking and he was crying so badly. And the guy was like, all right, your time's up and kind of hung up on them. And I just, I don't see that that's going to be beneficial at all.

1801
02:51:48.330 --> 02:51:49.920
Rachel Cooper: To, you know what I mean, if

1802
02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:55.800
Rachel Cooper: I don't know, I just, I don't know. I don't know where I don't know what to do.

1803
02:51:56.040 --> 02:52:01.560
Richelle Direny: I just, are you a part of any organization like church organization or anything like that because they have

1804
02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:03.540
Richelle Direny: They have, um,

1805
02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:08.340
Richelle Direny: What is it, come. Celebrate Recovery groups and things of that nature.

1806
02:52:08.730 --> 02:52:09.180
Yeah.

1807
02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:19.140
Rachel Cooper: I've talked to many, many, many, church groups and as soon as this coronavirus thing is is over, and I can actually get out of the house and go to them and

1808
02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:28.590
Rachel Cooper: Be a part of that stuff. And now that's going to be a big help, because I, you know, I've talked to them. I kept people from church call all the time. I talked to them, you know,

1809
02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:39.150
Rachel Cooper: It's going to be helpful. But until then, you know, I just, I kind of just stand the room which it's not, I'm sorry, just caught me in a bad time. It's not as bad as it sounds. It's really not. I just

1810
02:52:40.590 --> 02:52:43.470
Rachel Cooper: You know, I'm still going through the motions. That's all.

1811
02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:51.600
Richelle Direny: It didn't. And that's understandable. I mean that you know everything. It's always bad in a moment or in a time frame or what have you.

1812
02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:58.920
Richelle Direny: You know, even though it's, you know, it may be a toxic situation between you and your mom.

1813
02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:12.930
Richelle Direny: Her taking that initiative to take custody of your two children. It still shows that she still does care, the end of the day, she does care for her to allow you to stay with her temporarily. It shows that she's still there. She does care.

1814
02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:17.250
Richelle Direny: And it may be in her way. Hmm.

1815
02:53:17.700 --> 02:53:21.360
Rachel Cooper: She allows me to stay here for money reason she's not for me.

1816
02:53:23.010 --> 02:53:26.520
Richelle Direny: Got it. She, she could say, regardless of the money or what have you.

1817
02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:39.600
Richelle Direny: She couldn't make other decisions you understand it's hard to see it because maybe of the behavior or what have you. But again, you know, for right now, if it's what you have, you try to work through what you have

1818
02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:51.210
Richelle Direny: But I can definitely say I know especially large organizations they have church organization, especially they have programs for women.

1819
02:53:52.410 --> 02:54:05.910
Richelle Direny: That are dealing with addiction. They help them with housing and, you know, give them skills to help them with different skills that they need to be employable and to get back on their feet. It's just a matter of you.

1820
02:54:08.100 --> 02:54:16.170
Richelle Direny: You know, look, seeking it out just like how you saw that right out heart. Yeah, the same way that you have to seek them out and just kind of

1821
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:25.290
Richelle Direny: Stick with it because I know here. I'm not in Michigan. I'm in Florida, and I know here. They have a lot of programs like that where they how's the women.

1822
02:54:26.820 --> 02:54:29.850
Richelle Direny: And they help them practically with almost everything.

1823
02:54:30.510 --> 02:54:42.600
Rachel Cooper: Yeah, I am. I eventually once I can get a, you know, get schooling over whatever I eventually want to move out of Michigan. I don't know where I don't care where I just want to go somewhere, um,

1824
02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:57.480
Rachel Cooper: I just sucks because you know sometimes my mom can be my best friend, all the time, she can be the way she is now which is most of the time. And I just, I have to deal with her for the rest of her life. SHE'S GOT CUSTODY OF MY SON, you know,

1825
02:54:58.440 --> 02:54:59.760
Rachel Cooper: I can't live without them.

1826
02:55:02.310 --> 02:55:04.050
Richelle Direny: Know, it sounds like she think you're saying she has

1827
02:55:06.420 --> 02:55:19.830
Rachel Cooper: She has guardianship of my daughter. All I have to do, especially now that I'm clean is just go down until them. I want her back, but not going to do that until I'm in the right state of mind can actually fight for at least visitation with my son.

1828
02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:30.660
Richelle Direny: Um, I know you'll get through it. We're here for you.

1829
02:55:31.410 --> 02:55:45.210
Richelle Direny: Thank you know and I will send you messages to try to remind you know as I know to try to remind you, Rachel. You got to get on and maybe I have to tell you, half an hour before. Okay, get on now. So by the time you get on you on time.

1830
02:55:45.690 --> 02:55:53.910
Rachel Cooper: That would be perfect if you could, and eventually I'll, I'll get the hang of it. Once I you know I just got so much on my mind. Plus, you know, on the memory issues I have

1831
02:55:54.930 --> 02:55:58.770
Rachel Cooper: I would, that would help so much I would really appreciate if that was a possibility.

1832

Richelle Direny: Okay, if you do you have to just send me a message. So we can update the number for group because you also have groups on Tuesdays and

1835
02:56:17.100 --> 02:56:30.420
Richelle Direny: The thing is with groups, you have to be consistent attending the groups in order to get your because then what will happen is if you keep missing the groups, you will, they will bridge your script, you won't get your full weeks worth of scripts.

Richelle Direny: Okay. All right. So you're all set for on the 18th so far.

1848
02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:09.450

1849
02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:11.730
Richelle Direny: Okay. Have a good one, Rachel.

1850
02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:13.050
Richelle Direny: See you on Tuesday.

1851
02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:19.560
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Hi, can you hear me.

1852
02:58:20.940 --> 02:58:21.540
Richelle Direny: Oh. Oh.

1853
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:23.250
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Okay.

1854
02:58:23.310 --> 02:58:23.730
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry.

1855
02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:27.150
Richelle Direny: Very important piece that needs to be here.

1856
02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:36.390
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Yeah. Um, but I don't even know if we're able to have this meeting, because I don't have money to pay for and I don't understand why I have to pay for, because I had

1857
02:58:36.900 --> 02:58:49.980
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Good insurance and I had to fork out money every week and my Suboxone prescription because the doctor will only write it for a week forever. He'll never write it for a month supply and

1858
02:58:51.000 --> 02:59:11.010
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: I just don't get that. So I spent $20 a week now as opposed to only spending $20 a month and i don't know i i was i was not informed that I ever had to pay for anything else other than my copay $15 and I see another therapist. So I don't know if they're mistaken, or what but

1859
02:59:11.430 --> 02:59:14.160
Richelle Direny: OK, so what, let me let me before, before I

1860
02:59:14.970 --> 02:59:16.140
Richelle Direny: Decide to move forward.

1861
02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:19.920
Richelle Direny: So this is not just an individual, hold on.

1862
02:59:21.390 --> 02:59:27.900
Richelle Direny: This is not just an individual session for today. This is because you are or this is your new to the program. Right.

1863
02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:29.310
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Right, yeah.

1864
02:59:29.730 --> 02:59:31.830
Richelle Direny: And so you met with Dr farago

1865
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:37.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And so now you're meeting with me to do the intake.

1866
02:59:37.830 --> 02:59:47.430
Richelle Direny: Okay, by a psychosocial. And so if you're seeing a therapist in I'm in the community, then that will be a little different.

1867
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:52.620
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Yeah, I mean I'd see it there because and a psychiatrist.

1868
02:59:55.470 --> 02:59:56.130
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Matters.

1869
03:00:01.980 --> 03:00:02.550
Richelle Direny: Hold on. One moment.

1870
03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:07.110
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: But I don't know what in the community means

1871
03:00:09.150 --> 03:00:10.530
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Like in my community.

1872
03:00:11.430 --> 03:00:16.380
Richelle Direny: Okay, so do you see. Okay. Do you see it outside of bright heart. Do you see a therapist.

1873
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:25.680
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay, so that's fine if you want to continue to see. We don't have to meet to do individual therapy if you already do that.

1874
03:00:26.010 --> 03:00:26.550
Richelle Direny: This is

1875
03:00:26.580 --> 03:00:32.220
Richelle Direny: Only I'm a bio psychosocial intake. This is just a part of the whole admission process.

1876
03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:37.680
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: So okay, so they were missing one when they told me I had to pay them money just now.

1877
03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:47.430
Richelle Direny: Well you so, so each now. Now, that's all. Depending on your insurance so your injuries. It's how your insurance pays for it. So for every session that you do.

1878
03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:53.340
Richelle Direny: Your insurance your insurance is being charged so to see the doctor. There you have to pay a copay for that.

1879
03:00:53.700 --> 03:01:09.120
Richelle Direny: To do your bio for what we're doing, you pay a copay for you to meet for individual therapy, you have to be a book called pay. So for every if you come to groups, you have to pay a copay it's all based on whatever your insurance. They are the ones that dictate what is paying

1880
03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:09.930
Richelle Direny: I was paying

1881
03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:13.950
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Right, right. But he called me so self thing. Sorry.

1882
03:01:14.100 --> 03:01:15.480
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: He said yes. Okay.

1883
03:01:16.650 --> 03:01:17.280
Richelle Direny: Oh, you're so

1884
03:01:17.910 --> 03:01:33.300
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: He said, You're no no I'm not. I'm like, So paintings. I had no insurance. And when I signed up. They sent me an email that said you have a $15 deductible for everything. And that's what it normally always it's like everywhere I go, I pay $15

1885
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:41.310
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: For my therapist for my psychiatrist for for DR Fargo for anything else I paid $15

1886
03:01:41.790 --> 03:01:47.550
Richelle Direny: So when you were like when you logged in. Just now you you paid the same $15 copay

1887
03:01:47.550 --> 03:01:57.090
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Anything because they were like yourself pay. And I said, No, I'm not. And I said, and I don't have money to pay for self pay I they never told me how much

1888
03:01:57.390 --> 03:02:01.020
Richelle Direny: They just said yourself, if this is what we can do. Um,

1889
03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:12.810
Richelle Direny: So do you want me to can't speak to them to figure out what it is. So then you're not charged for something that you are not ready to pay for

1890
03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:14.250
Right.

1891
03:02:15.630 --> 03:02:15.930
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

1892
03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:17.610
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Sorry.

1893
03:02:18.390 --> 03:02:19.260
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Go ahead. Go ahead.

1894
03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:28.170
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry. Yeah, no, I don't. I don't. So again, like I said, this is the bio. This is just a part of the whole intake process or the, the whole admissions process.

1895
03:02:28.410 --> 03:02:37.980
Richelle Direny: So if you were on aware that this was going to be a self paced session because it's a bio, which I'm but I would think. I don't know. Don't quote me on it. I would think it's going to be a little bit higher.

1896
03:02:38.310 --> 03:02:53.040
Richelle Direny: In comparison to a regular individual therapy session. There is also groups that you would have to do. So just kind of part of right heart. Now when you got admitted into the program. I don't know how they communicated all of this information to you and the charges and everything.

1897
03:02:54.450 --> 03:02:57.900
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Right, I got an email and everything said $15 copay

1898
03:02:58.770 --> 03:03:17.670
Richelle Direny: So if you would like. I can have them reach out to you to kind of discuss in, you know, just to explain to you what is a copay what you have to pay a copay for if you have to pay. Is this for you to meet with me to do the individual or to do the bio, is it self pity or is it copay

1899
03:03:17.790 --> 03:03:23.550
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Right, that's all I was asking like, I would have assumed it would have been a copay or $15

1900
03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:37.260
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Which I would have had no problem paying. But you know what I'm saying when he said yourself, pay and I was like, nah, nah, nah, I was like, and I don't know how much it is, but I probably don't have money to pay for that. And he was like,

1901
03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:39.420
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Oh,

1902
03:03:40.710 --> 03:03:42.330
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: He seemed confused and then he was

1903
03:03:42.330 --> 03:03:44.850
Richelle Direny: Oh, okay. This is what I'm looking at. It says

1904
03:03:45.330 --> 03:03:53.100
Richelle Direny: Patient is self pay until meets the remaining deductible then $15 copay for doc and and

1905
03:03:55.230 --> 03:03:58.350
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: I paid that though when I signed up. I paid that

1906
03:03:58.500 --> 03:04:13.800
Richelle Direny: Paid and it seems like therapy is self pay. That's what it says here, so this is what I'll do. Let me go ahead and have them give you a comb to explain. Explain your at least the insurance aspect of it. And then at that point you can go from there.

1907
03:04:14.220 --> 03:04:14.610
Now,

1908
03:04:15.690 --> 03:04:27.180
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: If it is self pay is there. Is it going to be okay if I just see my therapist Lindsay for, like, can we somehow do it like that because

1909
03:04:28.770 --> 03:04:33.810
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: My job is Lindsay, you know, I paid $15 every appointment to see it. So,

1910
03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:40.110
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Go ahead and all that. That's gonna work fine. Then I'll just do that, you know,

1911
03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:55.920
Richelle Direny: One. Yes, you can see, I'd like I said, if you're because I personally speaking, you don't. I don't know why you would need to see two separate therapists work on the same issues and my understanding, I don't know that insurance will pay for you to see two different counselors.

1912
03:04:56.400 --> 03:04:57.810
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Dogs probably laughing

1913
03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:03.960
Richelle Direny: Yes, they're not gonna pay for two for the same thing. Now again this session today.

1914
03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:15.570
Richelle Direny: It's not an individual, it's not as a therapy session today, it's, it's an intake session for me to get to know your history in terms of the addiction and why you joined the program and just kind of that now.

1915
03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:22.980
Richelle Direny: What would be required outside. Have you seen Dr farago is that you would have to come to the group's every Tuesday at 630

1916
03:05:23.520 --> 03:05:24.600
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Right, and I will

1917
03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:33.750
Richelle Direny: Okay, so those are the two things we can, if anything, we can check in every couple months. Just so I can check in to see how is everything going

1918
03:05:33.960 --> 03:05:40.740
Richelle Direny: But you don't need to meet with you're seeing a therapist outside. No, we don't need to do individual sessions, if you're already seeing a therapist outside

1919
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:50.280
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Okay, good. Yeah, I really, I mean, I've done with Lindsay, a long time. I really like her. She's at my their psychiatrist his office. So it just works out. You know what I mean.

1920
03:05:50.850 --> 03:05:55.260
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. So if you would like, Did, did you pay on ready for this session.

1921
03:05:55.350 --> 03:05:56.610
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: No, I didn't.

1922
03:05:57.630 --> 03:06:07.650
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: He just I told him, I said, he never even told me how much it was, which was kind of weird. And I just, but I was like, I'm not a soap bag. I have insurance, and I go,

1923
03:06:07.920 --> 03:06:16.350
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: And I paid my deductible. When I signed up. I had to get paid immediately. I go, it was like a few hundred dollars. I paid that and then I paid my

1924
03:06:16.830 --> 03:06:30.600
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: deductibles. Every time I love with the doctors, um, I go, I, I'm just confused. And he goes, well, here, let me give you Michelle's number and he basically pawn me off on the same can on. I mean, and I

1925
03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:39.420
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Just know okay he gave me the number to love to log into the session. Anyways, you know what I mean. Without me giving them any form of payment.

1926
03:06:40.980 --> 03:06:41.310
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Okay.

1927
03:06:41.790 --> 03:06:51.210
Richelle Direny: So let's see if I'm so again it's up to you because I don't want you to get charged for something that you know you're not ready to pay for years. So

1928
03:06:51.270 --> 03:06:59.760
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: I said I thought you said this is just part of the admissions and this ain't a normal therapy session. So like this would just be considered like norm.

1929
03:07:01.320 --> 03:07:10.470
Richelle Direny: Well, no, listen, every day. That's what I'm saying to you every encounter. I believe comes with some type of fee that you have to pay. Now what this particular encounter.

1930
03:07:10.800 --> 03:07:27.570
Richelle Direny: Fee is going to be, I don't know, you would have to speak with the finance department about that. So if you want to get that rectified with them first before you continue with me today I have no problem in rescheduling for us to do our for us to do your bio psychosocial

1931
03:07:28.920 --> 03:07:29.220
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1932
03:07:29.250 --> 03:07:36.420
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: You can't. There's no way for you to figure out how much money this is going to cost me so we can just get it done now. Like, I'm so

1933
03:07:42.030 --> 03:07:44.580
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Because this guy has to be done either way right like

1934
03:07:44.700 --> 03:07:45.750
Richelle Direny: It hasn't been done.

1935
03:07:46.050 --> 03:07:50.100
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: It had if I want to say if I want to stay with Bray are, it has to be done right.

1936
03:07:51.480 --> 03:07:52.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you

1937
03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:55.590
Richelle Direny: Got to do the bio, you have to do the bio, but it's the book again.

1938
03:07:56.100 --> 03:08:06.360
Richelle Direny: I, I will contact Danielle and have them give you a call to have a more in depth conversation about the financial piece and then once she has that appointment.

1939
03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:16.770
Richelle Direny: With you, or she calls you to talk to you about that. I will have them reschedule you based on my calendar for you to do the bio yes the bio is a part of the program.

1940
03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:26.520
Richelle Direny: And like you said you already know the groups is a part of the program and seeing doctor farago the individual if you're already seen someone individually for regular therapy sessions.

1941
03:08:26.880 --> 03:08:38.100
Richelle Direny: That's different. But if you don't know how much, what the cost factor is associated with today, whether it's $15 or whether it's more than the $15 that's a conversation, you would have to have with them.

1942
03:08:38.730 --> 03:08:41.670
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Okay, so you can put me back with them. I appreciate it.

1943
03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:47.520
Richelle Direny: Well no I there's no way for me to send you back over to them, you would have to, um, I'll tell I'll tell them to give you a hall.

1944
03:08:47.970 --> 03:08:50.280
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: To all right, or do I go to the virtual clinic.

1945
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:52.350
Richelle Direny: Yes, go to the virtual clinic, go to the

Richelle Direny: All right. Thank you.

1948

Richelle Direny: Sorry, that's okay.

1949
03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:57.450
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Okay.

1950
03:08:57.630 --> 03:09:00.210
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: But I'm trying man. And I'm

1951
03:09:01.470 --> 03:09:09.690
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: I would like to discuss it because it's just something that I almost want to get off my chest because like I've been on Suboxone and I've dealt with.

1952
03:09:10.020 --> 03:09:25.380
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: I traveled around the country since 2003 and I've been on Suboxone since 2006 and I've seen many, many Suboxone doctors across the country since oh six, and I just them.

03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:45.390
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: I don't know. I'm never been on a one week script in my life, ever. And I heard of it. I definitely heard of it. I've heard of it for short periods of time I doctors doing it and I've been on I've been in pain management programs. I was in, I just have a history, I've

1954
03:09:47.130 --> 03:09:57.150
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Just I was diagnosed with Jay era, when I was five years old by the University of Ann Arbor. So when I was 19 I was put on like more pain medication that a cancer patient should be on and

1955
03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:07.320
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: That's what started everything and it just as soon as I found Suboxone I basically got on Suboxone but then I heard myself on Vegas. I went back to pain management.

1956
03:10:07.740 --> 03:10:24.990
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: And then I was getting pain pills out there. And then I got back on Suboxone and now I'm basically trying bright heart because I heard it's something new, progressive and that's about the short story so

1957
03:10:26.460 --> 03:10:32.880
Blake Grodi’s iPhone: Um, I don't know. It just, it seems like it's more harder than it should be, but

1958
03:10:34.020 --> 03:10:36.870
Richelle Direny: Again, I don't know if it's misunderstanding.

1959
03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:49.440
Richelle Direny: In what was explained to you, but this is that, like I said, I think it will be not right for you. If I tell you, okay, this is I can only read what I see in the system. It's

1960
03:10:49.710 --> 03:10:50.490
Richelle Direny: A one liner.

1961
03:10:50.820 --> 03:10:57.360
Richelle Direny: I am not going to go into depth and tell you more get you confused. Then you move on to the next person. And then you're confused because of what I told you.

1962
03:10:57.630 --> 03:11:03.810
Richelle Direny: That only gets you even more upset and then you think, what kind of program is this. They're telling me one thing. And so it's basically

1963
03:11:04.230 --> 03:11:14.280
Richelle Direny: I'm only the counselor. I'm only doing what we do now. Then you have the financial person who goes in depth. They go through and tell you everything that your insurance pays for what the copay is

1964
03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:22.500
Richelle Direny: The person who checks you in. He's only they're kind of like when you go to the doctor's office and you check in, you have a copay. What is the copay. Well, this is it.

1965
03:11:22.800 --> 03:11:32.580
Richelle Direny: According to this it saying every time you meet with me. It's self pay whatever that is, they would have to tell you, because it doesn't tell me here what that amount is

1966
03:11:32.850 --> 03:11:34.020
Richelle Direny: OK. OK.

1967
03:11:34.050 --> 03:11:34.590
Richelle Direny: I'll just go

1968
03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:37.620
Richelle Direny: Just go back to virtual clinic. I'm just telling them that you're coming

1969
03:11:38.310 --> 03:11:39.420
Richelle Direny: Thank you.
