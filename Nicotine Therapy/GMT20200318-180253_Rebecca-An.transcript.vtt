54
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. And you know, you have to remember that the United States as well. But the world is in this national emergency thing and you know it's nothing personal. I think it's just you know what they're trying to contain and control, you know,

55
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

56

61
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It seems to me that if it did. If it does, don't get there.

62
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that there's a case in that because, you know, this isn't out of your control.

70
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:35.970

102
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:08.340
Dawn Ninham: You know what I mean. Exactly. I have to, I have to know that the system is not fragile, I have to know that I i do my hundred 10% I'm gonna get a kickback

103
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.270

106
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.880
Dawn Ninham: Talking about you.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.900
Dawn Ninham: get older, what

108
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:29.850
Dawn Ninham: I thought about him and I know maybe not yet. I want to be doing good. First, you know, trying to brag about but

109
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.100
Dawn Ninham: And then I'll set it to post apparently her eight year old daughter just died. My niece.

110
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.560
Dawn Ninham: I didn't want to, um,

111
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.730
Dawn Ninham: You know now texture like she's gone through everything so

112
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.570
Dawn Ninham: I don't know why she died how she died. She died.

113
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's a good time for you to reach out connect with her. She probably needs.

114
00:08:52.320 --> 00:09:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That support, and I can tell you that by getting out of your own getting out of your own self, getting out of your own stuff and and and being there for somebody else really helps with a lot of the thoughts inside your head.

115
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.340
Dawn Ninham: Okay.

116
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:19.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so I would encourage you to reach out to her for, you know, for family support over what she's going through, you know what I mean.

117
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:38.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And eventually, you know, you guys will get around hopefully to, you know, be support for one another. You know what I mean. But I know from experience what it's like to lose a child, and I can tell you that it is the worst thing that you can ever

118
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go through, you know,

119
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.180
Dawn Ninham: So that I could

120
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.200
There's no way

121
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I encourage you to make that can that connection with her and

122
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get justice support her

123
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:58.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which will help you. You know what I mean, it's like a selfish selfless thing to do. Yeah.

124
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But getting out of self will help you walk through this process a little bit

125
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.720
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, I can get a hold of her tonight.

126
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.130

Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

130
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know what I mean and being a support for her will help you stay out of your head. It's kind of crazy how that works just

131
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:47.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you can't like, and they probably are. And, you know, I'm hearing all over in different areas that they are, they have been closing down na meetings but or a meetings, anything that has, you know, social social gathering, but I encourage you to continue with the online.

148
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.500

149
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.180
Dawn Ninham: Literally right

150
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.600
Dawn Ninham: It's a notebook for all this stuff.

151
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. Um,

152
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:19.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think

153
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a woman's way through the 12 steps is what it's called. Okay.

154
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

155
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The step before the steps introductions.

156
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it really kind of goes through everything from a woman's perspective.

157
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:37.530
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

158
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.200

Dawn Ninham: Or yeah

165
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm just kind of reading the

166
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We mentor we admitted. We were powerless over alcohol that our lives became unmanageable. So it's still, you know, even in here, even in this one, it kind of

167
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Focuses

168
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On alcohol. It uses alcohol a lot, but it's about women in recovery from any addiction.

169
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:32.880
Dawn Ninham: Okay.

170
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.870
All right.

171
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we can kind of because I wish I could like share this book with you.

172
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.160
Dawn Ninham: And let you. I'm gonna look it up and do like a

173
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.550
Phone.

174
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.130
Dawn Ninham: Because he's been while he's really excited to 30 you know I look up stuff.

175
00:13:51.510 --> 00:14:04.470
Dawn Ninham: I didn't realize yesterday. Somebody said, Vietnam. Vietnam is not a country and I can't believe I didn't know what it was. I looked at him like, and all of a sudden, it says, Oh, no, Vietnam, Asia, so I looked up and we treat filtered locating it and he

176
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.640
Dawn Ninham: Said cannot be located for my friends are laughing

177
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, it is funny.

178
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I also downloaded each day, a new beginning. It's called. It's a daily meditation for women.

179
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:29.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let me read to you what what today says, Okay, yeah, it says noble deeds and hot baths are the best cure for depression.

180
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of ironic because we're talking about your sister.

181
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.320
Yeah.

182
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:42.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Depression feeds on itself with attention it worsens but there are places for attention. We can move

183
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:49.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our focus to a woman who is close by a woman who is struggling, struggling to determine her

184
00:14:49.890 --> 00:15:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: direction in life we can offer our ears or we can observe attended really attentively today. All the women, children and men, we see on the streets.

185
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When we notice their expressions we will we realize they too may be suffering.

186
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:14.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing something for someone else will lessen our own problems. No matter what the cause. In fact, just doing something will lift our spirits.

187
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Depression becomes habitual and habits, even those that are detrimental are easily easy to hang on to when we take action even a small one, we can note the change action that benefits. Another is guaranteed to benefit us as well.

188
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:42.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Isn't that funny depression doesn't get worse with self pitying attention. Wait, depression, does get worse with self pitying attention.

189
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:54.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: However, attention to ourselves that is nurturing has its place. We can pamper ourselves but not pitting ourselves pampering reflects approval caring self respect.

190
00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:06.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Three attitudes inconsistent with depression, even more than inconsistent pampering and depression are incongruent. They don't go together. In other words, if you're putting if you're focusing on self care.

191
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:12.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're taking care of yourself. It's hot. It's hard to sit in a depressive depressive state.

192
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Depression must be coddled to maintain it, it's my choice to move beyond, beyond it at any moment. I can put something besides my problem at my center today and enjoy the results.

193
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so it's kind of amazing because we're talking about you, you know, reaching out to your sister and and there you know what I mean. Yep.

194
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that just kind of confirms exactly what I said it's funny. Yeah.

195
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:44.040
Dawn Ninham: Yes.

196
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:53.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just read. I haven't, you know, I didn't read that this morning myself. So it's amazing to me that it really reflects on what we're, you know, talking about

197
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's crazy how some of those

198
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some of the meditation books do that.

199
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

200
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:15.420
Dawn Ninham: Even church. I work all the time I was, I wrote my drill that down. Like I was thinking circles like low is weird, like that. I was, you know, teenager, I used to go to church and then like I just, I was in the choir, I would use group every Wednesday and all of a sudden I just

201
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.340
Dawn Ninham: I just took a different route. I know like stop.

202
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it happens when we start engaging in other you know behaviors and other being around other unhealthy people, you know, doing things, you know, with other people. But, you know, in the beginning of this whole thing.

203
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:46.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The beginning of, you know, the wrong path or the path that leads us to addiction. It's like it's the feeling of being accepted by others. Yeah.

204
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, is the big picture of it all. And if you think back to it. It's like that connection you feel accepted you feel you know these people are cool reality together.

205
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.450
Dawn Ninham: Give me attention. Okay.

206
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.880
Dawn Ninham: Why did I even go to them. Oh, they're giving me attention.

207
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:04.230
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, no.

208
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.550
Dawn Ninham: I'll accept that was getting

209
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

210
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:27.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that it works until it doesn't work anymore and it doesn't matter what we try to do as far as recovery goes if we do it halfway, but we try to do things halfway. It never works out. Right. And then we get frustrated because it's like, you know, I'm trying my best and it's not working.

211
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the reality is

212
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.450
Dawn Ninham: Really not the best five know I

213
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:39.750
Dawn Ninham: pulled it up right and we're right there and he was trying to like say that we will screw up for this. Now, I'm like, I'm like, it's our own fault you know even like

214
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:47.700
Dawn Ninham: Seriously, you got to take responsibility for your own our students, our own fault. No we shouldn't know if women testing.

215
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:58.650
Dawn Ninham: The entire time after we knew we knew that we had the court case, we thought we had it as if we were to just not tested through the next month and a half, like we did, we would have just kept testing with you probably would have one

216
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

217
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Same time but sitting in what it should have couldn't

218
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.460
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, exactly.

219
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.750
Dawn Ninham: I know what I have to do. And I know what I didn't do so I'm that's what I'm going to do.

220
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.530
Right.

221
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:17.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's an awesome place to be. You know what I'm yes reflection and moving forward.

222
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's not about beating yourself up and staying and guilt and wishing that it would have changed because the past is written. It can't change it. You can only do you know move forward and do something different. Yeah.

223
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.420
Dawn Ninham: My daughter sent me a letter. I'm the one that's in

224
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.940
Dawn Ninham: Down there, and Sacramento.

227
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.520
Good.

228
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:54.900
Dawn Ninham: About being her mother, you know, because I was like gambling like kids and I think again.

229
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.790
Dawn Ninham: You know, because I am my other daughter is dealing with a bunch of stuff to her boyfriend. I'm like, What did I

233
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.730

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And during that. See, there you go. Because you know her doing that has, you know, really open the door for building on your relationship with her in a healthy way and giving you a little bit of great affirmation that you know what i mean that you need.

236
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:06.570
Dawn Ninham: Any

237
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:17.580
Dawn Ninham: Like bush mom. She's like, I can't, you know, it's just like, I can't believe out of all the people that we know and I can't believe it was your kids, they're not taking out you know everybody that we know and

238
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.930
Dawn Ninham: Everything was just like, what, what, what, what is up with that. And I'm like,

239
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.890
Dawn Ninham: I don't know, you know, everything happens for a reason. So I just have to

240
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:33.960
Dawn Ninham: Deal with it. I'll do, I'll get you back, cuz I gotta figure out somewhere to go and four months when I graduate. I'm like, you're coming on.

241
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.840
Dawn Ninham: He's like, he's like, I'm not going back to a buster buster. I'm like, I know you're coming home.

242
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.830
Dawn Ninham: You know,

243
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.570
She's 15

244
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

245
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:48.750
She was

246
00:21:50.640 --> 00:22:04.770
Dawn Ninham: She was 14 which went in there, but it's been 18 to 20 months now, they've been in touch care when we got back, the first six months. It doesn't say nothing about that. And the court report. It doesn't say it says the wrong judge took the kids. It says all different name.

247
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.050
Dawn Ninham: And says, I have a different where all the dishes or maybe it's too much. It's just weird.

248
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know. Well, I can

249
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can tell you

250
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From my past experience that

251
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that's a normal occurrence.

252
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:33.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be accurate in the paperwork. You know, you know, a little bit of self disclosure my kids I have three adult children and when they were young.

253
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Under five, they were taken for me to and

254
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:53.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I scrutinize the court documents I scrutinize the paperwork and there was nothing in there that was accurate, you know, and I don't care how many times I highlighted it and took it in and said, you know, was this. These are all lies. You know,

255
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.390
Dawn Ninham: Contact. Yeah.

256
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean,

257
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:03.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Um, but when I finally surrendered and realize that none of that really matters. What matters is what I'm doing.

258
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right now I'm presenting myself.

259
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How I'm responding to their

260
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Constant.

261
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: put downs and leggings and and probes and whatever.

262
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:26.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When I quit responding to it or reacting to it in a manner that was unhealthy for me because every time I did it. You know, it just kind of confirmed all the lies.

263
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.480
Dawn Ninham: Yeah yeah

264
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so once I start, I realized that and I backed up and I surrendered and just put my heart and soul into doing what was on that that plan to complete, you know, I got my my kids came home.

265
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:48.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just figured out that it was better to not engage in

266
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know there. It's almost like they try to provoke you to react in a manner that they can confirm that you are

267
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Down there.

268
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so it's really about building up your, your

269
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:20.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Resilience your perseverance and your motivation to not engage in the whatever that no matter what they say. But to present your proof that you're doing.

270
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:25.530
Dawn Ninham: It in itself like you're not supposed to, you know, as bullying you and I was supposed to encourage them to walk away.

271
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.030
Dawn Ninham: Right, so yeah.

272
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:34.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And especially in this scenario because it's like anything that you do or anything that you don't do is on the table in court.

273
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.250
Dawn Ninham: You

274
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:43.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know what I mean. And if you are 100% transparent and you are doing what you know you're supposed to do. That's what gets put on the table.

275
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:44.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, what I mean.

276
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.800

331
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's, that's awesome. Because the only thing you have control over is you your actions, your you know what you are doing. You don't have control over anybody else. And really, you know, doing that.

332
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:36.210

333
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, well maybe if I do a little over here, everything will be okay. And it just, it just

334
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:51.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it just doesn't accept a lot more guilt and a lot more shame and a lot more stuff that you don't need piled on your plate anymore.

335
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.110
Dawn Ninham: Right.

336
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:58.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're moving forward. You've got a plan. Yeah, you know,

337
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:05.220
Dawn Ninham: Stuff, can you come up, like, for some reason, everything starts to work out, you know, all of a sudden you know your car tune up as like running great and

338
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:13.350
Dawn Ninham: You know everything's just use the word out where you're going down, you'll ever be as lost like you lose it. Because, you know, you know, you lose them all your

339
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.780
Dawn Ninham: Crap, your dog is just like everything

340
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really what happens

341
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then we've got

342
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:40.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, these are all like life, things that are out of our control. And we've just got to kind of adapt and adjust to the best of our ability with them. You know what I mean.

343
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but they're easier to deal with when we are on the right path and we are doing things, you know, differently. Yeah, and you

344
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.930
Dawn Ninham: Do on April 2 so that's for a whole month so I'm all I have to work on, you know, worry about me.

345
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.260
Dawn Ninham: I'll be home do what I gotta do.

346
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:04.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you going to, how are you going to manage the time alone.

347
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.230
Dawn Ninham: Oh, um,

348
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.320

349
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:27.270
Dawn Ninham: I got you know him and everybody else around by it. So anyway, so I just do my own thing. I was just take care of my dogs and clean my house. Once everything done usually just, you know, either write stuff down or taking out like an hour nap does wonders for me.

350
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And don't forget that if you're engaging in recovery. I don't care if it's online meetings, you're going to get connections with women that you'll be able to communicate with on those times when you're struggling with loneliness.
