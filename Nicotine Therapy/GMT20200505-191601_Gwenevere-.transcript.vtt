00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

2
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Same same bed different room.

3
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.760
Saraniah Aston: Uh, yeah, I had to move

4
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying in a cottage or like a guest house. I think with mom right

5
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.640
Saraniah Aston: I'm saying, and my mom studio

6
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.770
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, separate from her house.

7
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to take some minutes and kind of

8
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what it's been like for you.

9
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.060
Saraniah Aston: Not really.

10
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.440
Know,

11
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a little bit of irritation going on or anger, maybe

12
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.370
Saraniah Aston: Disappointment a little bit

13
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then let's that we can't deny it. We got to get to it, don't we, it's more productive when we go right out the truth. So there's disappoint on to talk about it.

14
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.440
Saraniah Aston: Will

15
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.280
Saraniah Aston: Yesterday was

16
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.200
Saraniah Aston: particularly awful day and

17
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.100
Saraniah Aston: I had no I didn't have anyone to talk to. And I tried

18
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.310
Saraniah Aston: But I was ignored. So

19
00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:03.750
Saraniah Aston: I don't understand why I feel like it's like some sort of punishment for not making the meeting or something like that. I really don't know.

20
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you. How are you doing right now with just that much contact with this very personal experience. How you doing,

21
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.400
Saraniah Aston: Not well

22
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. Well, we've been here before. We've made our way through. So I have confidence that we'll get through this. So not well. So where are you feeling it.

23
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: In in the tension, maybe in the body. Is it, is it a sense of in the throat, the gut. Like where's it landing

24
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.540
Saraniah Aston: Um,

25
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.200
Saraniah Aston: I guess if I had to choose, it's the head and the gut.

26
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Gut, okay.

27
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And the emotion is

28
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Disappointment was the earlier one. Is there more to it.

29
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.510
Saraniah Aston: Disappointment and hopelessness.

30
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopeless. Okay.

31
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And the thought is, I tried and it didn't work. I asked for help and I didn't get it.

32
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, and feeling

33
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That this is retaliatory and punishment.

34
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.970
Saraniah Aston: Yes. Okay.

35
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What have we done before that has helped us get past these are similar. I think

36
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you and maybe what have I done. What did I do

37
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To help before when we've gotten past

38
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

39
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got

40
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.820
Saraniah Aston: Everything down

41
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you want to share them written down stuff.

42
00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.640
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

43
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.510
Saraniah Aston: first session with one

44
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.920
Saraniah Aston: Annoyed disappointed slightly angry.

45
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.190
Saraniah Aston: And I thought it was okay to text or call I needed to speak. I felt desperate alone.

46
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:39.120
Saraniah Aston: My week from hell. I had to leave my apartment and temporarily move into my mother's studio. I had no help. No one talks to me, my brother completely ignores me on Sunday. He told me in these exact words. I hate you.

47
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.800
Saraniah Aston: As he was walking away. He also said everybody hates you.

48
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.820
Know,

49
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.820
Saraniah Aston: And it's hurt BP.

50
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.160
Saraniah Aston: I let my anger out after a dread me tears. I wish it had made me feel better.

51
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.810
Saraniah Aston: And my mother barely speaks to me.

52
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:11.640
Saraniah Aston: I had to move an entire apartment by myself. No one offered to lift one finger I exploded on my mother, a few times.

53
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.500
Saraniah Aston: My

54
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:25.800
Saraniah Aston: Father and I share meaningless words I learned more and more of how much of my childhood. He's completely forgotten stuff that he cherished

55
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.000
Saraniah Aston: It's heartbreaking. I don't know what to say to him.

56
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:46.020
Saraniah Aston: I drove my father to Walmart. When we return, we sat in the car for a while. I asked him what his plans were. And he pointed my mother's house almost with tears and says, I want a home. I just want a family.

57
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.720
Saraniah Aston: He wanted me to talk to my mom.

58
00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:08.910
Saraniah Aston: No, I am confused or really stressed, and I must find a place to live right away. Also, I think I need intensive therapy and I need to have my medicine just adjusted. Last but not least, I did not do my body scanning homework.

59
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:26.130
Saraniah Aston: There, I think there might be something wrong with me. There has to be, I need help. I don't know what the best thing to do right this moment is I'm so lost. I feel the beginning

60
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there's a lot of truth in there and you're feeling that, as if it's like you are doing the move in the whole everybody saying those things as if it's happening right now.

61
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.200
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

62
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look around and see if anyone is threatening to hurt you. Now,

63
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's some acknowledgement of some physical safety anyway.

64
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.330
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I have the studio and nobody comes back here or anything. So that's fine.

65
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.390
Saraniah Aston: Pit that also pisses me off.

66
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.280
Saraniah Aston: But it is what it is I get I think I get it, I think I get how my family is

67
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.550
Saraniah Aston: And

68
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.380
Saraniah Aston: It's really painful, but I cannot

69
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.960
Saraniah Aston: Stay here.

70
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.580
Saraniah Aston: Long

71
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you knew that when you left and you you these are these are things you already know it's not like you intended to do this move back house he you knew right and

72
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.880
Saraniah Aston: My landlord was awful. And I had to leave. Anyways, I told him it would be out by the fifth so

73
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.480
Saraniah Aston: And

74
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the piece that happened between us around.

75
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It was just piled on top on top on top that I was unavailable as well.

76
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:12.390
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I mean I wrote, I wrote all this when I had when I was I was desperate. So I didn't have anything else to do but just write it all down.

77
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What makes you think that you need more intensive care care like more intensive psychotherapy. Tell me more about that when I heard about

78
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.100
Saraniah Aston: I feel like I talked to you and I'm doing really well.

79
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.580
Saraniah Aston: To for a few days.

80
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.910
Saraniah Aston: I feel like

81
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.060
Saraniah Aston: Wow, I need another hour

82
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right.

83
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so

84
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want me to see when I look at

85
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: My schedule to see if there's a way to find another hour somewhere in there where we could meet to see if this care can work for you without having to change the program. Let's say you know I'm trying to say like trying to make this

86
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It because it is an hour if it's a feel good feeling like I feel good about myself and it lasts even three days. That's actually pretty cool.

87
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:29.280
Saraniah Aston: I mean, it could be even every other week or something like that. So, you know, it doesn't have to be a really just maybe just something extra in there just because

88
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we do a couple of things. First, number one, I can do that. We're not quite through how I impacted you were going to get there. You know me. I'll go all the way through it.

89
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll get to the other side, but I don't want to forget some important details around the service. I want to also throw and I can't remember if I said it.

90
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe it was forgotten. But you if it's affordable to you because I know not everybody has like Medicaid in it. It gets pricey but

91
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.330
Saraniah Aston: You

92
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Can afford it. You are welcome to attend my other groups this week is on something that is just massively important

93
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's radical acceptance and it's not a little trivial thing. It's like this is a very specific skill that without it, it can feel like we're in turmoil and constantly having to deal with the next sort of hurricane or tornado that's coming at us.

94
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we're talking about it in group and you had missed it.

95
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Reason society. We already know that. But you missed it. And it's, I want you to have it. So if you want to, if it makes sense to you. I can review what my groups are you're more than welcome. You don't, as far as I'm concerned, you're welcome to all of them.

96
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't even have to announce it as far as I'm concerned. Okay, this has to be you balancing your budget. Yeah.

97
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you want to do it, but you're you're more than welcome to. So just to review.

98
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I have Monday at 9am, of course.

99
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:04.980
Saraniah Aston: I have

100
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Monday at 1pm

101
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't want people in the same group. But if you tell me you know what I really need it, then what we'll do is I'll just say this the same service don't Bill, I'll just tell the doc. Hey, she's here for just fellowship and we're not billing for it's on the same day as a service.

102
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been able to get up get away with that.

103
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.130
Saraniah Aston: You might say on on on Monday when I

104
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you went into 9am and you said, I want to hear this. Again, I want to talk. I want to hear myself through this next piece of work. I didn't quite say it at 9am I want to keep this going. I've got something I've been able to get away with it. So until they

105
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, no.

106
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep going. So I've got that, then I have 7am on Tuesdays. And then I have a new group which I just had, which is 12pm on Tuesday.

107
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you can't happen of course

108
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.260
Saraniah Aston: We just were doing this.

109
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Get the idea and then I have Thursday at 11am

110
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And then Friday at 12pm

111
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:26.430
Saraniah Aston: Right, I just have to ask my mother, she can handle she can take another payment for me. Um, but yeah i think i think Thursday or Friday. What time did you say on Friday it was

112
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.740
Saraniah Aston: Off at 12

113
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be

114
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:40.230
Saraniah Aston: I see you, I see. I go to the group on Monday, and then I see you on Tuesday. And I'm good for a few days. So then it sounds really good.

115
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.650
Saraniah Aston: I will ask, I will find that out.

116
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:44.520
For sure.

117
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

118
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What I can do this is, there's a little caveat, and that is that I also know these groups. I know the composition of the groups and

119
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I see a part of my role as protecting everyone and I want to protect to you. So I want to protect you. A little bit around how my Friday group has a lot of new people and it has fewer opportunities for self reflection. There's a lot of just sort of psycho education around

120
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Addiction, it's not quite as process or the Thursday group, however.

121
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is very process oriented.

122
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.620
Saraniah Aston: These are focused

123
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only address me directly. They like you're doing now we're talking about right this stuff that is this kind of deeper sort of inner core really getting a core

124
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, whether it's a toxic relationship clients are talking directly to each other at one point they were talking directly to the doctor.

125
00:13:50.550 --> 00:14:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's more intense sort of psychotherapy happening versus psycho education. We just it's just a different group and I just wanted to mention to you. You're more than welcome to it but just a little bit of the limitation of Friday.

126
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.450
Saraniah Aston: Okay I scratched out Friday.

127
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

128
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, thank you.

129
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Get more out of it.

130
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So beautiful. Yeah, that's available to you. And now, so that said

131
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we look

132
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.360
Saraniah Aston: I'm not mad at

133
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, certain is, it's okay. Even if you're mad. I don't you know i don't i don't have discriminate against anger. I think it's a juicy emotion, it means something important was going on. I don't I don't I don't mind if you're mad.

134
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, too.

135
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You were disappointed you saw something about that tax and you didn't get what you needed

136
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.590
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

137
00:14:51.570 --> 00:15:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think it's going to be useful for us to get get into the minutia into the details of that. But before I do, I thought, what we do is we can look ahead, and I can look through my calendar and I can see see what's available.

138
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:05.910
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

139
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming we're going to get through this fine and then already have some stuff set up. So here's what I'm

140
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.080
Seeing

141
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any possibility that you could get up a little earlier on Friday, May 15 and attend at a 9am appointment I have someone that sees me every other week.

142
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: On Wednesday, May 15 at nine.

152
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.720

Saraniah Aston: Okay may 12 is next Tuesday. Right.

154
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes it is, if you can believe it.

155
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.450
Saraniah Aston: No, I can't. I cannot believe that.

156
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Blows my mind.

157
00:16:51.060 --> 00:17:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is now. So for this week. You're more than invited. I hope to see you this Thursday, right, at seven right rolling in about 1030 kind of saying, hey, I'm going to be going to women's group. If there's flax and just, just let them know, hey, she's going. Additionally, and

Gwenevere Abriel: 15th at 9am So we've got something kind of already set in place for support.

163
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.390
Saraniah Aston: Yes. That's great. That's actually really great

164
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.580
Saraniah Aston: Thursday. It was going to be 11 right

165
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, that's group one right group next to that, but I can refresh all of it again because I know you're writing down I talk faster than most people can write so I can review it.

166
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.560
Saraniah Aston: Individually

167
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, sweet. All right. Now the hard stuff. You ready

168
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.090
Yes.

169
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Inside go inside your truth.

170
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having to protect me.

171
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But indeed, your experience is what I want to take care of today. So go inside your truth about what it felt like for you to want to be able to get support through through the phone with all of these things piling up right all of those stressors and how overwhelmed. You felt

172
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you have a question that you want to ask me.

173
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.120
Saraniah Aston: Hmm.

174
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I stepped back a little bit to reduce a little bit of tension for you. I don't know if it was helpful. I kind of pulled back a little, my image is a little smaller.

175
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.100
Saraniah Aston: Good.

176
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, all right.

177
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I could sneak off.

178
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.360
Saraniah Aston: A questions, um,

179
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.950
Saraniah Aston: No, I guess not. I don't. Nothing is coming to me. It's just like I'm

180
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.980
Saraniah Aston: In the moment I saw you everything kind of disappeared, and I felt better.

181
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, but it's still

182
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.160
Saraniah Aston: I was angry. I was I was angry.

183
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.490
Saraniah Aston: I wanted to throw my phone across the room, but

184
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.370
Saraniah Aston: I just after I wrote down. I felt like, are we ready

185
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.150
Saraniah Aston: To you, so it felt better.

186
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We gotta remember that that that writing can be like

187
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't reach you, but

188
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You're my audience like that writing is what read. Oh, that's good for me to know

189
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.380
Saraniah Aston: It's why I wrote, Dear I wrote it says, Dear when

190
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. Yeah, that was that stuff you wrote was powerful.

191
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.590
Saraniah Aston: It just something mentally for me to put a name and a

192
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.350
Saraniah Aston: Dear, dear somebody to do that.

193
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.540
Saraniah Aston: It opens me up and it makes it really easy for me to write

194
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.710
Saraniah Aston: It's like I have a purpose for writing. Yeah.

195
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can sort of picture maybe hopefully maybe the response you'll get whether it will be listened to it will be contained

196
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'm the audience.

197
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

198
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I know a little bit about people.

199
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of the job and you have moved through that.

200
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling just today move through it and you took care of yourself in various ways, kind of turned away a little bit

201
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then as as that comfort level got closer and closer, you're more able to open up. Notice how your chin came up a little bit and you're able to kind of look in here and look at me.

202
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was important for you to say I'm not Mac. Why don't we go there and see, see how how saying that helps put me at ease or puts you at ease. What do you think that does for us that I'm not mad at you.

203
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not mad. I think you said

204
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:18.810
I'm

205
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.600
Saraniah Aston: Well, I think a lot of times people around me like my family. They assume

206
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.090
Saraniah Aston: With a lot of times when I speak that I'm mad.

207
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.580
Saraniah Aston: And I'm

208
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:51.120
Saraniah Aston: So, and it's it's mostly because of Israel and the way my tone of voice change. And the way I speak louder and more pushy, it's different. Um, so

209
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.750
Saraniah Aston: I feel a little bit more put at ease. When I say

210
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.510
Saraniah Aston: Listen, I'm not mad.

211
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.310
Saraniah Aston: It's more for me. I think

212
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.210
Yeah.

213
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

214
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.890
Saraniah Aston: Person. No, see the reaction and then breathe.

215
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.210
Okay.

216
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you mentioned a couple of things you know your journal is just so helpful. Are we about ready to go into that. Do you think yeah okay so you said some amazing stuff in there. Maybe we can kind of kind of dive into it.

217
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already kind of covered

218
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Covered adding some services and we did that. Is there anything more that needed around this idea of of increasing services and support.

219
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:50.220
Saraniah Aston: Another thing that's good. That's awesome. I have options feel good.

220
00:22:50.940 --> 00:23:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice how you were invited to ask a question and you opted out, you can change your mind, you can say, I got one. And you can ask me anytime you want to. Okay, that's always there.

221
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right you are comfortable that question may come up or UK so just just let it, let it flow.

222
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What else, it was also, you mentioned something about wanting to

223
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Review medication management with your psychiatrist.

224
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.990
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I'm kind of wondering if maybe my Paxil right into the present.

225
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.980
Saraniah Aston: Is kind of

226
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:40.350
Saraniah Aston: What I know what I know from people taking it is that they need to increase it and have it adjusted every once in a while like every year or two years or something like that.

227
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:51.000
Saraniah Aston: And I feel like maybe it might be worth it. Just to see if if that might be a good idea to just try maybe increasing it or whatever. The doctor says

228
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.290
Saraniah Aston: Because I feel I can

229
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.980
Saraniah Aston: I feel a little less

230
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.590
Saraniah Aston: In control.

231
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:03.510
Saraniah Aston: Um,

232
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.490
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I feel a little less in control and

233
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.430
Saraniah Aston: A lot more depressed.

234
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:17.070
Saraniah Aston: Than I think I should be even with everything that is going on.

235
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Okay, I got you.

236
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.210
Saraniah Aston: I got so I'm curious if if I if maybe I should. It should be adjusted or not.

237
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's, here's the tricky bit for me. Of course I don't manage medication, but if I if I were to say well you know how you said, Well, I don't know if I'm

238
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: The right dose of depressed for what's going on. So let me just here here's. So in the context of what would be somebody would be depressed about

239
00:24:45.780 --> 00:25:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: A father that doesn't remember and doesn't value the same precious things that happened a brother that just after that hug that amazing experience you had basically pulled the rug out from under you and is what did he say I hate you.

240
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And a mother that continues to be who she is consistently showing up one way and then switch to bait and switch constantly with that.

241
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.270
Saraniah Aston: Goes on things to be depressed about

242
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm doing right. I'm not a

243
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.200
Parent

244
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's appropriate. Like, like what kind of robot would not be, you know, laid flat by that.

245
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:37.830
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's true. Well, either way my psychiatrist is sick, and he's out for two months. So I have to wait two months. Anyways,

246
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's still on the radar and don't hear. I'm saying, No, no, no, I'm just saying, I'm just catching that one phrase, just like a like as if I'm too depressed for this.

247
00:25:51.090 --> 00:26:04.470
Saraniah Aston: No, I agree. And these are things that I try and figure out on my own, too. So I totally, like, is this something that's logical to be depressed about to be down about because you're actually human

248
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:11.670
Saraniah Aston: Or is is it do you, is it could be like a chemical chemical something

249
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:18.270
Saraniah Aston: And it could be both. Or it could be one. It could be the other but I definitely hear what you're saying about the

250
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:26.490
Saraniah Aston: Just kind of taking a step back and looking at each of those situations or

251
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.800
Saraniah Aston: An energizing my feeling and

252
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting because I already come from a psycho biological perspective, I already think that my thinking is chemical so so how is right. So if my thinking is chemical. Well, it's my response chemical to to proceed abandonment and rejection. Like, how am I hey

253
00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do. Where is just a thought of thought or my baseline chemistry reactive, but which came first, was I chemical how far back do we go to the end of the wall.

254
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How far back. We go well.

255
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.490
Saraniah Aston: Since we first started taking medication, I thought we I

256
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.790
Saraniah Aston: Started taking medication, I guess.

257
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I would go back, much, much, much, much, much further than that. I would go back, literally to

258
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There were look at the chemistry going on in there. Was she a chill calm happy loving

259
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Pregnant woman. I don't know.

260
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.180
No.

261
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.740
Saraniah Aston: No.

262
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, it seems unlikely, given poster. He told me

263
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:43.950
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

264
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

265
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a tiny little body developed

266
00:27:51.570 --> 00:28:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: A reactivity to startle to perceived threat before you were even born. It was already wired for it already flooded with cortisol already a message sent the world is a hostile place I'm exaggerating but not really like it. That stuff may have happened.

267
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.650
Saraniah Aston: No, no, I agree, and that being a possibility.

268
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what happened.

269
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.880
Hmm.

270
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you haven't told me stories you know about the infant

271
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Caregiver bond was that there was it disrupted. These are critical. These right

272
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Number. Right. What we don't tend to remember before age four and a half. We tend to

273
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It drops off. We don't really remember, but but you can use deductive reasoning.

274
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And walk back and you can hear stories you can hear your mom tell stories. You can hear family members tell stories about whether your mom was able to look at you.

275
00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And a tune to you. So if you are a little face was off like this, you know, turning away, giving a break to the intensity of a gaze if shirt gays turn to, like, Oh, she doesn't listen to me, that's fine.

276
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

277
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And use the passive voice and tuned in and paid close attention to

278
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you are hungry.

279
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Tired wanted affection or maybe was close to far

280
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't come in and give you a communication from the outside, that when you do your distress crying.

281
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That the world will take care of you. It's there, and will come and hold you and address your diaper and you're eating and your need for contacts, because it's a pretty scary thing to enter the world. I mean, it's like you're like perfectly fine. And then you're like, so not fine out there.

282
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Naked

283
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's like me.

284
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:13.770
Saraniah Aston: I remember my mom's and I know that, but she was 19 so but I know that my brother's four years older than me so she had my brother, and then she had her her OCD, which she hadn't

285
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.580
Saraniah Aston: They hadn't had medication for it then.

286
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:41.130
Saraniah Aston: So she's to have, you know, images of throwing a baby out windows up like that. And I know that I'm alive, she's told me a long time that I was such a calm baby she would just put me in my bouncy chair, and I would be entertaining myself for hours and hours and hours.

287
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: that strike you just did you tell that story. How does that impact you when you hear yourself say that story.

288
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.330
Saraniah Aston: I think it's sad.

289
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, me too. I didn't, I didn't really like it all of a sudden I pictured just because I'm

290
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Calm doesn't mean I don't want attention.

291
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.910
Great.

292
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do I have to do to get attention in this family is

293
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.970
Saraniah Aston: Yes, now I get to be the baby. Okay.

294
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So okay, so I'm here and that's one story. We also have she was 19 and does she talk a little bit about how well she had a little baby she already had. What a three year old.

295
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.070
Saraniah Aston: She had a crazy little monster of a baby, yeah. She was very well.

296
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.190
Okay.

297
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

298
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring it bring us back to this notion of US struggling with the last feeling earlier of am I flawed.

299
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a chemical thing am I supposed to be this depressed. You know that. Those are important questions. You were asking in those moments.

300
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.550
Saraniah Aston: I think about them a lot.

301
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.110
Saraniah Aston: Like

302
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.270
Saraniah Aston: I wonder sometimes what's real.

303
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.530
Saraniah Aston: And what isn't what you know.

304
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So it is

305
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: My hope that over time.

306
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That sense of deep realization. That's a real thing. Like, you can go look it up and it is it matches this sort of cluster of symptoms.

307
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Of this particular label of Borderline Personality Disorder. It matches this cluster. It's got there's this interesting little cluster behaviors you kind of look at your life.

308
00:32:46.260 --> 00:33:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's sometimes, sometimes not so much. Some of them, yes, some of them know. But there's a real like cluster. And that's, that's one of them. This sense of round like I don't even know if I exist like where am I, what am I tethered to the sense of just floating

309
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotions will completely consuming

310
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.550
Saraniah Aston: I've wondered, for a long time and money before alone.

311
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you hear about it from somewhere. Do you read about

312
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:34.440
Saraniah Aston: My, my ex was borderline and bipolar. So I learned a lot about her. And I'm also my fascination with psychology psychiatry.

313
00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:47.070
Saraniah Aston: And psychology. I've done a lot of study and research and I know that it's not the most understood disorder still on.

314
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:53.490
Saraniah Aston: And a lot of it. I completely relate to, um,

315
00:33:54.510 --> 00:34:04.470
Saraniah Aston: But then again, there's, there's just missing. Missing things that there's not enough information, but there are some things where I'm just like that. It's

316
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.300
Saraniah Aston: On yes yes yes yes yes

317
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.010
Saraniah Aston: And not so much.

318
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.750
Saraniah Aston: Yes, yes, yes, yes. So

319
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's an interesting term in in this field. There's no single inventory assessment for it. You don't just go, well, let's just

320
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, if

321
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: He is then you know that's that's what we'll go with. That's the label will use, it's much, much

322
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: more subtle than that. There are some out there, but there's really no go to you just go just answer this one.

323
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little cluster. There's like these little peaks and notice how you saw it, you're like, yes, yes, yes, yes. No man. Yes, yes, yes, yes. No. So that's kind of what we're talking about. And it's like anything.

324
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Just one thing or a combination of different stuff.

325
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes, you could probably relate a little bit to some

326
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: compulsivity when it's time for cleaning you may just like, dive into it. Or maybe it's you. Maybe you'll hold on to things that people identify those right kind of hoarding well maybe it isn't a hoarding it has more to do with an attention deficit.

327
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Around initiation. There's so many different things out there to capture this human experience. And if we don't get locked up on the label which I don't. I only mentioned that word because I

328
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just wanted to test the water and see

329
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's about that last i don't i don't exist. Who am I

330
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Am

331
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Like be annihilated by all of these intense feelings.

332
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:41.970
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

333
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is

334
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When I have been working with you. It is my sort of undercurrent of, kind of, I guess I have to treat something right

335
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm thinking about, then I'm thinking, well, let's start with the body. Let's start with that she can find herself again and she can find her truth. And one thing I have learned, for sure. Is it is going to be

336
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This dual awareness of whether it's a collage. It's a drawing, or it's journaling it somehow. It gets you to sort of almost like see

337
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This real this is this is how I feel this is it is happening right now. And somehow that that works. And so we want to keep doing those things right.

338
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.630
Saraniah Aston: And then, and then

339
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Also notice you wrote. Oh, I am I didn't do this body scan homework.

340
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You did what you probably always did you felt emotionally distressed about uncertainty.

341
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And

342
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean behavior.

343
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt it on an emotional level.

344
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: In this for all a lot of years.

345
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you make of homework, not being done like what's let me hear from you a little bit

346
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.030
Saraniah Aston: About me not doing getting it done.

347
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it mean to you that you didn't do it.

348
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.290
Saraniah Aston: Oh my god. Totally. It's

349
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:24.720
Saraniah Aston: It makes me feel like like I felt in elementary school, um,

350
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.200
Saraniah Aston: Where when I didn't do my homework.

351
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:41.790
Saraniah Aston: Which was a lot of times, because I would try and I would try and then I wouldn't understand it. I would get confused. I would get up my mind just go completely somewhere else.

352
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.010
Saraniah Aston: So,

353
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.510
Saraniah Aston: I get a little I get a little paranoid and

354
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:55.740
Saraniah Aston: Down on myself a little bit because I take something so seriously, you know,

355
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.840
Saraniah Aston: I really do. And then I'm like, Damn, you know why you take something so seriously and they just don't do it.

356
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:20.010
Saraniah Aston: But it's not like I didn't do it because I've been thinking about it all week to go back to my book and actually look at exactly what I'm supposed to do and try it and then again this week has been insane. So

357
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: If we don't get a break, as humans, it keeps coming at you.

358
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.810
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, it does, doesn't it.

359
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, um,

360
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.300
Saraniah Aston: I just have to keep myself together and hopefully

361
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.920
Saraniah Aston: About to dive back into working so

362
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.480
Saraniah Aston: I think that that could be a really good thing for me.

363
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

364
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.540
Saraniah Aston: To focus

365
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.260
Saraniah Aston: On selling my clothes.

366
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so

367
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You

368
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.230
Saraniah Aston: went off on a tangent

369
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I followed. I know, I know where you go in here.

370
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are able to turn your attention to work. It is a sense of relief because you really, you start doing all the selling the marketing the whole thing you really immerse yourself in it. Yeah.

371
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:35.400
Saraniah Aston: I mean I yeah I I'm building my own backdrop i'd bought my own life equipment I I take pictures I researched the pieces of by I write descriptions. I come up with prices sales campaigns marketing, advertising, social media, all kinds of stuff. And when I do it.

372
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.970
Saraniah Aston: I'm on top of the world. I am control and I'm powerful and I am a boss.

373
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome. We definitely want you to get back and doing that. That's

374
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.830
Absolutely.

375
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay.

376
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.760
Saraniah Aston: I closed my store until March until May 30

377
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:05.460
Saraniah Aston: So I gave myself that time to get everything together and kind of re reopen

378
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: The part about the giving yourself a hard time he didn't give yourself a hard time just now. Can you said I needed to sort of say, I'm not in the store for the next month or so.

379
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There wasn't any of that self-reproach there, but something came up around this homework idea, but this is within me, this is with an actual person. Whereas with there's no other person really on the other side of whether the issue.

380
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you mean

381
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

382
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is more resembling maybe some earlier inner personal rupture.

383
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because there's a person that might be disappointed in you.

384
00:40:53.910 --> 00:41:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that's the risk, right, that is that the painful part like I'm trying my best. I couldn't do it. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do. And I don't even know how to ask for help.

385
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I said elementary school.

386
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.180
Saraniah Aston: Absolutely, yes. And

387
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And here it is again.

388
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.000
Saraniah Aston: If you're a failure.

389
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

390
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be

391
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That it was just a matter of a good enough teacher when you were younger, seeing what you were doing because we now know a lot more about kids that you know in the classroom about whether their

392
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Energy is this or focuses that we can diagnose and label a little better. And I think we're getting better at it.

393
00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.760
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, even my when I was a kid.

394
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And

395
00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If a good enough teacher had been there to see or you were going through. I'm imagining the teacher would have been able to say, okay,

396
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a smart girl, girl. At the time, you're now you're smart girl.

397
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's happening and have taken the time and really understood what was going on with you. It doesn't sound like someone

398
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:32.730
Saraniah Aston: I've had teachers say that to me. I've had teachers sit me down and say, sorry, I don't really understand you. You're very confusing to me because it's obvious that you're very smart girl. Um, and you're you're good in class and you know you're a pleasant to have in class and

399
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:47.040
Saraniah Aston: But your grades are s and you're you don't bring it you don't do your homework. And yeah, so they would. I would have a lot of discipline of teachers who liked me

400
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.380
Saraniah Aston: A lot but we're very disappointed in me.

401
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And and so were they able to tease out

402
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it because all of your focus is that emotional regulation at home with the dynamics with family.

403
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that you you turn your attention to something and then it goes off to another, or is it that. Yeah, I understand. I understand this, but I, I can't get started on a homework, like there are so many different things that could go sideways.

404
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.610
Saraniah Aston: The middle one, the second one.

405
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't remember what I said was

406
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:26.880
Saraniah Aston: Basically like

407
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:47.550
Saraniah Aston: Getting an assignment. It's all on board and it's in a piece of paper. I have a textbook too and I suddenly see the paper, the textbook, the stuff on the board and it all just kind of just like comes at me and

408
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.180
Saraniah Aston: I get so stressed out.

409
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.330
Saraniah Aston: Okay, I just can't do it.

410
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.050
Yeah.

411
00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:04.530
Saraniah Aston: So yeah, I grew into the same where yeah my my mind just kind of started to go off into other places.

412
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Was. Let me just ask a couple questions when let's say you were looking at a projector, you know, something where they they have words projected

413
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And now they use PowerPoints, but I had projection

414
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you look at it and sort of you've noticed the kids around you already kind of knew what to do. They're already writing assignment. This is also still and you were still sort of fascinated by the shape, you're still started orienting yourself to what you're seeing up there.

415
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:53.460
Saraniah Aston: For it. Yeah. Or I've gotten really, I got it. I got into the project I got into it totally there watched it. I'm excited to do to to go further.

416
00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:10.830
Saraniah Aston: And once it's time to apply myself to an assignment. I'm, I'm looking at my neighbor. Like, do you understand anything that just happened. Do you know what we're supposed to do, how do we do it like

417
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

418
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.690
Saraniah Aston: And they're like, Don't look at my paper.

419
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you ever had an inventory assessment for any kind of attention deficit challenges. Has anybody ever given that to you.

420
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.930
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I mean, I'm diagnosed with attention deficit disorder not

421
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.900
Saraniah Aston: Attention deficit.

422
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.640
Saraniah Aston: Hyperactive Disorder.

423
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, it's changed it's you're probably just inattentive type is my guess right

424
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.460
Saraniah Aston: I think so, yeah.

425
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.700
Saraniah Aston: What do you mean there's no such thing anymore as

426
00:45:50.730 --> 00:46:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Add they've dropped it from from the diagnostic manual. Now it's there. Everybody's just ADHD and you're either sort of the hyperactive type or you're the inattentive type

427
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of weird, but I get what they're doing with them.

428
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So inattentive

429
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:12.630
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

430
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you know and I just am so enjoying because I'm having a refresh on some of this information recently.

431
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That

432
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Story. It's the initiation of an assignment that it's an actual feature of that condition, you can have just like you said, I knew how to do it. I was excited to do it. I'm like, oh boy, I'm going to do it and he will do that.

433
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you don't get started. So what we can look at is just curious. See, just hacks little tricks that already exists.

434
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The tomato timer a visual

435
00:46:55.290 --> 00:47:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Timer on your app. It's like an actual tomato or, you know, what do you

436
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: See the sand going down.

437
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:05.580
Where

438
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is tangible, do you have anything on your phone. What do you use

439
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.740
Saraniah Aston: Well, I can I can I can download a nap.

440
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's not one there.

441
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:16.920
Saraniah Aston: No. Oh.

442
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I really easy one. And of course there's. They're all over the place and don't by any means, think that mines. The only snazzy one

443
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But I found this incredibly simple and it's tomato timer. And so right now you're going to see it's already set. So that's how easy it was. I just opened it, and it immediately went here. There's not a lot on it.

444
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Due to all I would do is as soon as I touched the app. I'm going to tap it already set. It's already set for 20 minutes so

445
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do it in a second. But what I wanted you to see was how it was already set up for me to not have to tap a bunch of stuff. It's already set up for all I do is wake it up and go, but

446
00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to start timing down for 20 minutes

447
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I set this and I sent this over here and this is how you would do it when you figure yourself out on how your time frame works is you'd go here and there's little choices. This one set at 20 minutes and seven minutes then 25 minutes, but this is a little break right here it is seven.

448
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:20.760
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

449
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: way this is set is like this. I'm going to kick butt for 20 minutes I'm going to be hyper focused on will be like

450
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. And it's popped up like that and now it's already taken down. Okay, awesome.

451
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.220
Saraniah Aston: I'm getting it.

452
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So yes, it's called tomato timer.

453
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.840
Saraniah Aston: And yeah.

454
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't random. This is actually scientifically.

455
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Explained because y'all. And I'm just gonna say, y'all. Because that's kind of what I got a lot of light in here, I'm just gonna turn it down just cut my blinds us a little bit

456
00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this initiation of starting something I've got the knowledge about the experience. It's starting.

457
00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Start for some people, once they get going, because notice once you get into the work you're you're in a group, you're already going. It's actually that initiation of a task that can be a challenge.

458
00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.170
Saraniah Aston: Right.

459
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This does is it, it sets it in motion.

460
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, I will go

461
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people they can't work on undivided attention for 20 minutes for some people it's 15 and then you said a break.

462
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't give yourself a hard time for it. You just say, Okay, I'm really good for 15 minutes and no matter what, even though I don't even

463
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Like dig it about myself. I'm going to get distracted. Anyway, I might as well just set the timer for a solid 15. Then I'm going to go play for 10

464
00:49:48.780 --> 00:50:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Minutes. So it's already set. Notice it set would be set for 15 the middle one would be a 10 minute break and then there's that 15 again it's already set up to boop boop boop boop boop boop. And then guess what you just spent a solid half hour undivided attention. I'm imagining if you

465
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: were focused on something work for solid 15 into solid 15 a lot. We get done.

466
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.550
Saraniah Aston: That's a good idea.

467
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It works for people

468
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you gotta you'll have to figure out, well, how long is my attention span when I'm really undivided attention. So I have this blast to focus attention I kick its butt.

469
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I oh it's been it's going to chime at me. I'm going to go take a break and it will chime again when that 10 minutes is playtime is over. Okay, I'm gonna go back and now I'm going to focus, again, that works for folks like you

470
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, frankly,

471
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but especially when you're you want to add the I'm not good enough to it. There's something wrong with me. What's wrong with me.

472
00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know you've just got a kind of just know your own brain. Your brain is different than this brain and that brain. So if your brain likes to hyper focus for

473
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: whatever amount of time, then you set that timer for that and then give yourself, it tends to be I think it's 20 to 10 minutes, believe it or not.

474
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But you'll register that you may say, oh, I need more or that was too long. I was already interested in coming back to a project and it made me sort of wait too long. So then you

475
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.420
Saraniah Aston: I think the the idea of the

476
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:41.280
Saraniah Aston: The break is a really good thing because sometimes I will when I do go at something like collage or whatever. Um, I can go and go and go and not stop and then I will kind of work myself into a corner. So I think that break could be a good thing.

477
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:45.150
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, on download and checker sounds

478
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:45.540
Cool.

479
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There's not a lot, a lot of bells and whistles. If you can change the color. You can change the timing of it. You can change the sound. So it's I think it's kept simple for good reason. Nice and

480
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.050
Saraniah Aston: The more simple, the better for me.

481
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, me too. I kind of liked it that way. So, so there's that piece and then there's the, the self appraisal. There's this is a feature. This is just kind of, you have a brain much life a lot of other brains that

482
00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Meet that cluster. Right. Remember we were talking about that other than other term this cluster matches there too, which is, it might be hard to

483
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick one thing to do when you have a bunch of things that might be hard. It might be hard to get started on on it and

484
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Then make a bad

485
00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:35.310
Saraniah Aston: Know,

486
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.520
Saraniah Aston: Is this cognitive behavioral therapy.

487
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We're doing this right this second.

488
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:44.610
Yeah.

489
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh man, I'm wash everything together so much cognitive behavioral therapy was it would sound like this and you'll see me do it. Sometimes, especially when we, when we start to do preparation for am Dr.

490
00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this.

491
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what the underlying belief is about yourself.

492
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Sponsoring belief and what are the thoughts that continue to feed that and how does it make you feel emotionally. When you have that thought. And when you have that emotion what what behavior then happens

493
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Beliefs box emotions and behaviors. And it's this sort of right circle you can intervene anywhere you can intervene on any of those and it's still going to impact the next one.

494
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:41.640
Saraniah Aston: Always been curious about it and what it is I, I know that my ex. She was borderline and bipolar. She did.

495
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Etc. D.

496
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:46.680
Saraniah Aston: Beat me too. Yeah.

497
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:50.880
Saraniah Aston: Yes, she did that, she said it was very difficult.

498
00:53:52.590 --> 00:54:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but there's pieces of it that are throughout my work too. I love it. If you do DDP with 100% fidelity.

499
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't do it.

500
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I just can't. It's not

501
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just not practical for my practice, I can't pull it off, nor am I, nor did I get the certification $20,000 it costs to get the training, it's

502
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.130
Very good.

503
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So all but there are some really cool things about it. One of the neat things I wish I had the privilege to do is they have like a roses and thorns kind of meeting where the clinicians themselves meet

504
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And they say they kind of help each other we call each other out, like, Oh, is that pushing your buttons are you having sort of a counter transference experience and they call you out. Like what, like you're getting therapy to and it's mandatory.

505
00:54:50.490 --> 00:55:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you talk about your cases you staff your cases not just me, but in this this supervision group you talk about all your cases. And what happens is it's a

506
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: An accountability thing like my is your client to. So what happens. She's going to hold me accountable. She's going to make sure that I'm doing the best I can. And guess what I'm going to do for her. Want to make sure she's doing the best she can

507
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Her client. We're all held accountable for this caseload. It's a neat feature but

508
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't pull it off and you'd be going to skills groups.

509
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Ya know it, but I will tell you if you ever run across it and you can afford it. Go for it. DB T Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. Yes, it is.

510
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.470
Saraniah Aston: Maybe sometime in the future.

511
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, it's just it's it's intense

512
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.310
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's what I've heard. Well, right now I'm taking care of basics.

513
00:55:45.600 --> 00:56:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're getting your you're talking with me who already has buy into it. It's weaved in there. It's in there. It's just like it kind of flowing with other things. And sometimes it's a day for teaching skills. Other times it's

514
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about therapy interfering behavior.

515
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:15.600
Saraniah Aston: No, I love the way you work. I can see how you take all these different things and you, you have your you have your own approach. And I think your way under

516
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.450
Saraniah Aston: Underrated probably underpaid.

517
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So now we are at the end of this session techie, see how you're doing.

518
00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.170
Saraniah Aston: I feel really good.

519
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.150
Saraniah Aston: I feel good. I feel

520
00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:49.620
Saraniah Aston: Like I have a bit of a path to go on. I'm excited about this little app and I'm tearing out if I can come, I would like to come on to the Thursday.

521
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:56.100
Saraniah Aston: Group something to see, I'm going to do that. And I feel good.

522
00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's add let's add I do feel

523
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Strongly

524
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: About the body awareness, not because there's something deficient in some homework undone. It's barely give homework. Actually, this has to do with

525
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:16.260
Saraniah Aston: That think

526
00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: About earlier about you feeling lost and you feeling. I don't want that for you. I want you to always feel connected at least to the planet. You know what I mean.

527
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:30.150
Saraniah Aston: To your

528
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body, so maybe when you do your timer maybe putting in there embedding in there.

529
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: For belly breaths. And how's your body feel so it'll be

530
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:44.310
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

531
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Or body breasts and I'll do it. Belly breath.

532
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:52.530
Saraniah Aston: And then

533
00:57:52.590 --> 00:58:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do my grass and then I'll say, okay, well where am I still feeling a charge in the body, but I'm feeling it here. Okay.

534
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, what's the message huh oh Someone just insulted me. Yeah, I got you, I got you know now that happened.

535
00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Where else oh my shoulders are so tight. Yeah. What else is going on. Oh, I have this and this and this and this. Okay, so what

536
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What all of it. What it, what can I do right now to take care of this body right now.

537
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We get into some problem solving. But that first piece about

538
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Inquiring within looking within not getting the information from how other people are viewing you and treating you

539
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This is why it's homework right and you may I gotta tell you, I don't care. We're going to bring it up again. So what does

540
00:58:51.360 --> 00:59:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This okay this is it. If you knew how to remember it. You never remembered it. We just spent a whole bunch of time talking about how hard it is to take learned information and start it.

541
00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not wrong. It's just, it's just part of the way your particular brain works. And so we got to hack. We got to find little tricks.

542
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.400
Saraniah Aston: And finding my birdie my

543
00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:19.860
Saraniah Aston: Attention to my body is completely brand new to me so it's it's interesting, but

544
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:22.200
Saraniah Aston: I'll do it. I'll do it.

545
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you can laugh all the way through it. Find it goofy all the things that people need to try something new. We can kind of say all just go for this lady. This ain't gonna work. You can say all those things.

546
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:36.780
And just get

547
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:43.230
Saraniah Aston: There. Yeah, there's no harm in asking myself this question so

548
00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.080
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. OK, I will, I will do it.

549
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. And that timer kind of labeling it that way. Help. Help. Remember these are there because right you're going to remember what you've done over and over and over.

550
00:59:56.850 --> 01:00:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And this does take work and it feels like work and it feels like effort it takes more glucose to learn something new. It actually feels like effort.

551
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:06.570
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

552
01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Something new, the brain has to work harder to create a new habit. The front end lot of glucose. It gets easier once it's a habit. Okay.

553
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm excited to see you on Thursday. This is going to be cool.

554
01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.400
Yeah.

555
01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you take the message of the doc that you were here is that relevant or not relevant.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.160
Saraniah Aston: Oh, if you could, yeah. Love know I came to the
