What from

16
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:24.030
*Michelle *: I honestly don't know. I haven't really heard anything I was up there to kind of help out around the house with the dogs and stuff. And my dad's just been

17
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.180
*Michelle *: Going on a bender.

18
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I don't.

19
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.570
*Michelle *: Time.

20
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Michelle.

21
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, what

22
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've been up there for how long.

23
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.380
*Michelle *: Was there for most of the week. I just got back, day before yesterday. Yesterday, they wish me well.

24
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.690
*Michelle *: It's been, it's been rough. I don't even know what we're gonna do now, now that she's gone and

25
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.240
*Michelle *: You know,

26
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What did your dad say

27
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's devastated. So he's not thinking clearly

28
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.420
*Michelle *: He hasn't really said much he hasn't. I haven't really talked to him.

29
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.370
*Michelle *: Anytime I try to bring up our situation he kind of just like

30
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.580
*Michelle *: Not important you know and I'm like, well, yeah, it is important. You know, we're going to be out of here in two days. You know that

31
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.740
*Michelle *: I just don't even know.

32
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you get your license back

33
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.700
*Michelle *: I am one step closer I found out that

34
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:18.480
*Michelle *: On the MVD website. They're showing in their system that there were two failure to complete a stop at a stop sign tickets written

35
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:31.860
*Michelle *: The same. I mean, the tickets are identical, they're just, there's only one letter difference, you know. And obviously, it's an error in their system, but they still need verification from the court that it's an error.

36
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.250
*Michelle *: Because in order for me to be reinstated.

37
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.590
*Michelle *: It has to show in their system with that the court, the court fine has been paid. So it's only showing one ticket paid off.

38
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.620
*Michelle *: In the other delinquent so

39
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.430
*Michelle *: I'm waiting on that to clear up and then after that's cleared up. I'll have my driver's license.

40
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

41
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One rock after another home.

42
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.970
*Michelle *: Yeah.

43
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.290
*Michelle *: Just, I mean it just

44
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.430
*Michelle *: It's not one thing. It's another and I just feel like I can't catch a break and

45
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.780
*Michelle *: I just, I feel like I'm cursed. I feel like no matter what I do. I'm just spinning my wheels.

46
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is it an option for you to pay one more month where you're at.

47
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.790
*Michelle *: No, she's threaten me with her lawyer, whatever, just

48
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:55.920
*Michelle *: To sign something or other. And I didn't, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm just the average Joe Schmo I don't know nothing about nothing. So I

49
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.400
*Michelle *: I'm sure she figures just threaten me with her lawyers and paperwork and

50
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.170
*Michelle *: I mean, I've tried talking to the sheriff. I've tried

51
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.800
*Michelle *: Calling the DHS office, you know, because I've heard that in Southern California in other areas in California, they're putting homeless people in

52
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:31.320
*Michelle *: hotel rooms and such, but they're not doing that here where I am and the sheriff's office had no information to give me because I asked them, you know, with the stay at home order and hold on evictions

53
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:44.130
*Michelle *: What if we just squat here. Like, are you going to enforce you know evictions and they told me that they can't give me an answer, because they've never dealt with anything like this and they wouldn't know unless they have

54
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.080
*Michelle *: An eviction in it present in you know what what

55
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.260
*Michelle *: So they can't even tell me that

56
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So your vehicle less

57
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.010
Yellow do

58
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:10.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You need, you need a U Haul or something to be able to get all your crap out and had up to Oregon and plant your butt where that is.

59
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

60
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.260
*Michelle *: Need I need that vehicle and and I'm hoping that

61
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.360
*Michelle *: I just, I don't even know my dad is just so

62
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.480
*Michelle *: Right now, he, he just, I mean he's not even returning my phone calls. He's not returning my texts.

63
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.040
*Michelle *: And

64
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:47.940
*Michelle *: I thought about asking, you know, a friend to take me up there, you know, to just be like, if you're not going to answer me. I have no other choice but to just show up and like, I mean, I need that man.

65
00:06:52.110 --> 00:07:00.930
*Michelle *: I don't know how he's going to react, though. I mean, cuz he just he's he's extremely selfish. In general, and with all this going on.

66
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.910
*Michelle *: It's even more, you know,

67
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.100
*Michelle *: Because it was his mom and

68
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.880
*Michelle *: You know, he's gonna have to figure out where he's going to have to stay to

69
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.210
*Michelle *: Because he's the one that's been staying there.

70
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.790
*Michelle *: He's one that's been living there.

71
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And he can't continue to live there now.

72
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:48.120
*Michelle *: He can't afford the lights. My uncle's house. My, my uncle's the millionaire. It's his house. He pays for everything. My grandparents were paying the utility bills on whatnot, but he was letting them live their rent free well

73
00:07:50.010 --> 00:08:02.580
*Michelle *: Nobody else has like a relationship with with Glenn. His name is Glenn, AND HE DOESN'T HE DOESN'T HE DOESN'T CARE. It's not not his problem. We're not like a family unit like that. Like it doesn't matter.

74
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.150
*Michelle *: You know, doesn't he doesn't care.

75
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

76
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:15.090
*Michelle *: He's not gonna let my dad lived there for free. And my dad certainly can afford to

77
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.540
*Michelle *: Pay for whatever it would cost to live there expensive house.

78
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.400
*Michelle *: But I don't even know what Glenn is planning on doing now that

79
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:28.860
*Michelle *: I mean, cuz

80
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:35.280
*Michelle *: Bill my grandmother's husband is still alive. BILL STILL bill still there.

81
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

82
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:52.350
*Michelle *: I don't even know what Bill is planning to do if he's planning to stay there or to move, but I do know that my dad and build don't get along. So he's gonna have to he's gonna have to leave bills. Not gonna allow him to stay there. Now that my grandma has gone

83
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:05.850
*Michelle *: Bills probably like praise. Enjoy. You know, because that was that's always been a standing argument between my grandmother and him bill never had kids.

84
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:16.080
*Michelle *: And it's always been an argument with them of my grandmother helping my dad out all these years his entire life and

85
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:23.580
*Michelle *: Now that she's gone. He's got everything to himself all the money everything to himself.

86
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

87
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.360
*Michelle *: I don't even know.

88
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

89
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:49.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm at a loss because I'm sitting here going, what would I do if I was sitting in your shoes. You know what I mean.

90
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:57.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I think that you know what i would definitely do is write out the place that you're out as long as what you can

91
00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

92
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make her a victor.

93
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.400
*Michelle *: We thought about that. We thought about just squatting here and hoping the sheriff doesn't force it.

94
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.130
*Michelle *: You know, but

95
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.190
*Michelle *: Then we lose our head.

96
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have anybody that can take you load your stuff up and take you

97
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:28.680
*Michelle *: Know my dad is only one that I know that would, that will help us that can can help us but

98
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.090
*Michelle *: I mean the storage unit is already paid for.

99
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.890
*Michelle *: So,

100
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:50.070
*Michelle *: I'm hoping that we can just squat here for a little while and I can get up up there to talk to him to at least just get the keys to the van and I'll do it myself. I'll move everything myself.

101
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Were you planning on doing that.

102
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.090
*Michelle *: Soon I don't even really know hopefully within the next week or two.

103
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.060
*Michelle *: I mean,

104
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.570
*Michelle *: I am hopefully within the next week or two, because

105
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.480
*Michelle *: I don't know how long we're gonna be able to squat here. If we can squat here.

106
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.180
*Michelle *: But

107
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.400
*Michelle *: I know

108
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.280
*Michelle *: There's 30 days in this month.

109
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.830
*Michelle *: I don't even know.

110
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's not you don't have a friend that you can stay with

111
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.210
*Michelle *: No.

112
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.790
*Michelle *: No, not where it would be okay with Ryan.

113
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.310
Know,

114
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much stuff do you have to move

115
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.890
*Michelle *: Got quite a bit of stuff here. I mean,

116
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:16.530
*Michelle *: Really, it's not that much in the eyes of people who have like a full house and home fully decorated and stuff like that but

117
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.040
*Michelle *: It is you know quite a bit.

118
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:25.890
*Michelle *: But it would be, I mean it. I mean, I could move it all in one day with the band.

119
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.510
*Michelle *: And we just ate.

120
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.850
*Michelle *: A lot of driving back and forth.

121
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.750
*Michelle *: I'm hoping that I can pull it off.

122
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:50.640
*Michelle *: Because I don't, I don't know. I mean, if we have the band and we can sleep in the van. It's not, you know, it's not a big deal.

123
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.180
*Michelle *: We can sleep in the van. I mean,

124
00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.760
*Michelle *: You know there's places where we can go like

125
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:13.470
*Michelle *: to camp out, if you will, you know, like we've got a 10 we've got, you know, stuff to go camping with and we don't have to go camping an actual campground because right now they're all closed.

126
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:24.180
*Michelle *: But there are places where we can go camping out in the boonies where there's nothing to nobody around. You know, it would just be super rough and

127
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.300
*Michelle *: But either way, you know, at least we're all together and

128
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.350
*Michelle *: We've got someone have a roof over our head.

129
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.050
*Michelle *: Yeah, I mean,

130
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:51.240
*Michelle *: I don't, I don't think the cops would bother us. I mean, just, I mean, I get the whole stay at home order thing. You know, I get that whole thing. But when you don't have a home where do you go

131
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:58.620
*Michelle *: And I would think that any cop that would see, you know, we're camping, you know, we're not

132
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:06.180
*Michelle *: Totally like useless. You know druggie bums you know just

133
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're not exposing yourself or your baby to other people.

134
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:16.200
*Michelle *: Yeah, we're isolating ourselves, so to speak.

135
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:26.040
*Michelle *: Yeah I would hope that any any officer would have some sort of compassion for situation because

136
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:38.070
*Michelle *: There's nothing else. We have nothing to nobody else. There's no other option. And because our area is so poor. And so, rural

137
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.610
*Michelle *: They're not offering hotel rooms which I feel like is is is

138
00:14:47.400 --> 00:15:01.050
*Michelle *: In that blows my mind. I mean, if you're doing it in other counties in California. Why can't they do it in our county. I mean, I know there's a lot of people out there that are homeless just in in our city alone.

139
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.130
Yeah.

140
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.370
Very nice.

141
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.200
*Michelle *: I don't understand why they're not offering that here like

142
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.860
*Michelle *: That blows my mind.

143
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it does. Mine too.

144
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:21.870
*Michelle *: Especially with the the shelter. I mean, it was. It's not an exactly a shelter, there's only like a few beds there.

145
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:30.420
*Michelle *: It's not like a shelter or whatever, then they close that down because they don't have the resources to take care for

146
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:37.560
*Michelle *: People like that. It's just, it's not really a shelter. It's just kind of like an overnight place to sleep.

147
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.750
*Michelle *: A cot, you know, in a small room there's only so many COTS

148
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:48.450
*Michelle *: And I mean, it's not like an actual shelter. It's more of a like they feed you.

149
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.160
*Michelle *: You know,

150
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They don't

151
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:56.580
*Michelle *: don't provide like resources like that where you can stay long term. It's just like

152
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.680
*Michelle *: Shortly one nice short term, I mean,

153
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.140
*Michelle *: Dr. Jamison mentioned and

154
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:15.600
*Michelle *: JOHN I think his name mentioned, you know, to reach out to the churches and and I plan on doing that to

155
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.170
*Michelle *: Just to at least, you know, see if there's anything available or any options.

156
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.910
*Michelle *: But

157
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:38.190
*Michelle *: I do. I don't know how to get ahold of any of them because the churches are closed and I know they do the Wednesday's Sunday night worship or whatever through zoom

158
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.130
*Michelle *: But

159
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:47.220
*Michelle *: I don't know how I would, you know, speak to somebody, one on one.

160
00:16:47.730 --> 00:17:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They all they should, if you put Google, you know, churches in my area and then you'll have a list and usually they all have phones offices and somebody is monitoring those phone calls.

161
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.220
You know,

162
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.460
*Michelle *: Anything about that month in someone's gotta be monitoring phone calls.

163
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:10.590
Yeah.

164
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:12.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hmm.

165
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.660
*Michelle *: I did plan on reaching out to the church.

166
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:17.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That

167
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Would be a great idea.

168
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See, they even thought of something that I didn't even think about

169
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.240
*Michelle *: Right.

170
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.470
*Michelle *: You know,

171
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I didn't even think about the churches because at this point the way that things are. It's almost, you know, you're

172
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's almost where it feels like you're going to get the help

173
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:39.450
Yeah.

174
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about a desert Community action where you're at.

175
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.730
*Michelle *: I don't think so.

176
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's nothing like that.

177
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:53.880
*Michelle *: When I talked to DHS. I mean, I told them you know our entire situation, the eviction and everything, and he he

178
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.630
*Michelle *: Did not have any any options or anything.

179
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.220
*Michelle *: You know, and, and then the one girl was like, well, you know, they do, though.

180
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:14.550
*Michelle *: Once in a lifetime where they put you up in a hotel room and they help pay for your deposit and and all that and and I said, and I mentioned. Yeah, that once in a lifetime has already been used

181
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:25.290
*Michelle *: We used up that once in a lifetime motel stay and help with the first and last deposit when I was homeless and pregnant with a riot. That's how we got into a place

182
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.130
*Michelle *: He was through that once in a lifetime help

183
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.680
*Michelle *: Me and I think it's really shitty how they only offer it once in a lifetime.

184
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.380
*Michelle *: But

185
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do

186
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:52.650
*Michelle *: Think it's really shitty that in this time right now with it with the virus and all. I just think it's really crazy how they're not offering anything

187
00:18:53.070 --> 00:19:01.890
*Michelle *: How are, how are they not offering to put people in motel rooms, but other. I mean, I get like these other counties down in Southern California are are more

188
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:16.050
*Michelle *: Richer whatever I mean because the lady at EHS strict straight up told me you know we live in one of the poorest counties in California and I get that, but at the same time, I mean,

189
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:27.360
*Michelle *: How are you going to put people in motels down there, but not put them in up here like i don't i don't get that. I don't understand how that's not an option.

190
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Must be a county per county thing.

191
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on one second. I gotta close my door.

192
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright. Sorry, I'm back.

193
00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:05.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm sitting here and I watched my friend door just kind of fly open. I'm like, what is that he's kind of windy, the wind. It took the door, but

194
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:07.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm

195
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:19.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. And the only resources that I know is in the Portland area. I don't know any resources, any place else.

196
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.470
*Michelle *: I met a woman through Facebook.

197
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.890
*Michelle *: I had put an ad on there. You know, I was looking for clothes for Riah because she

198
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:39.360
*Michelle *: outgrew all of her clothes in like a matter of a couple of weeks, you know, and I put on there, you know, in search of, you know, clothes.

199
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:52.290
*Michelle *: That fit her for free or super cheap and she ended up giving us a big bag of clothes for free. And, you know, we kind of talked about our situation and whatnot. And she mentioned, you know,

200
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.700
*Michelle *: Going down to eureka that there's more options down in Eureka or whatnot. And I just

201
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:09.870
*Michelle *: I don't, I don't want to go farther south. I don't want to go down to Eureka, if anything, I want to go up north more, you know, I just

202
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.570
*Michelle *: I want to get out of California.

203
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:27.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. I understand that. Very much so. If you are up closer in the Portland area, I can certainly you know guide you and direct you into different resources that I know are available there, right.

204
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But as far as you know in your area. And I just, I'm naive in that area. I have no idea.

205
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're in Crescent City huh

206
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.820
Yeah.

207
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.920
*Michelle *: Yeah, I talked to my caseworker DHS and then he just

208
00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.370
*Michelle *: Had nothing to offer nothing

209
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:07.890
*Michelle *: Because I asked him, you know, is, is the motel room and options and they're doing it in other counties in Southern California and

210
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.530
*Michelle *: Nothing.

211
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:20.790
*Michelle *: And then they threaten me they threaten me that they were going to lower our cash amount

212
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why

213
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:35.790
*Michelle *: Well, because in the state of California in order to receive cash aid, you have to participate in an activity. Well, the activity that I was participating in it was the diploma now program to get my diploma.

214
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.380
*Michelle *: And

215
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:46.920
*Michelle *: With the schools closed down and everything. I haven't been able to turn in all my homework or turn in my school books. I haven't heard from my teacher

216
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:58.050
*Michelle *: And the lady is hounding me to get the certificate to show that I've completed the program and yada yada yada and

217
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:13.830
*Michelle *: I told her I mean I I can only do so much. I know just as much as you do. I've tried to get ahold of my teacher. I have not turned in my school work with me not turning in my schoolwork. They can't issue me a certificate, stating that I've completed the program.

218
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

219
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:26.670
*Michelle *: You know, and she's like, well, I have to input something or they're gonna have to, they look at it as we're not we're not doing what we're supposed to be doing. We're not participating into the in

220
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:38.250
*Michelle *: And I feel like that's bullshit. How can you sit there and say that I'm not participating when I have, I have no control over this. I can't like hell. I mean,

221
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, if you can only do what you can do. You know what I mean.

222
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:52.830
*Michelle *: I can only do so much and everything else is out of my control. But how are you going to lower my income at a time like this.

223
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doesn't make sense.

224
00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:05.610
*Michelle *: And I told her I go you lower my income and you're just going to screw me even more, you know, like

225
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about Community assistance network.

226
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.450
*Michelle *: I have no idea what that even is.

227
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, get a pen.

228
00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:43.170

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.070
*Michelle *: Yeah, it's a

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.340

232
00:24:53.940 --> 00:25:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so if you call them. Tell them you're not in a domestic violence situation, but yet you you know you're trying to find resources to help in your situation and maybe they can give you a direction to go to that.

233
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.340

Okay.

Yeah.

250

255
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:17.490

265
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.210

*Michelle *: Can help us and and

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.210
*Michelle *: Still even

308
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:04.800
Hmm.

309
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:18.210

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you get

312
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A little bit of relief.

313
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

314
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.910
Yeah.

315
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, those are the two that come up

316
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your area.

317
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

318
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:40.710
*Michelle *: Never heard of those

319
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.960
*Michelle *: Nobody is ever

320
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.840
*Michelle *: Talked about them or anything.

321
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, depending on how

322
00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya see it just goes to see helpful definition.

323
00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes they're not out in the

324
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Public you part of it is because they probably have an over number, you know,

325
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You see,

326
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They even have him over in in Ohio. I have them in Ohio. Oh, hi. Oh.

327
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's one in Compton.

328
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So it sounds like they're everywhere.

329
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, really.

330
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's a couple things for you to look into and check out all right.

331
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:04.620
Yeah.

332
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We do that.

333
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.850
*Michelle *: Yeah, definitely.

334
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.820
*Michelle *: It's

335
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just something to get

336
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:24.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you keep your mind busy. You keep occupied. You keep looking and searching something's going to pop up because the churches, put it even if you have to leave it on the voicemail, I need help.

337
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, I need immediate help my floor just came out from underneath me literally right

338
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:34.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

339
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:52.950
*Michelle *: Yeah, I just, I'm, I'm in shock. A little right now because we're at the DHS office. They have like a list of homelessness resources where you can get showers where you can get food, where you can get, you know, all that stuff hygiene like

340
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.540
*Michelle *: Products and all that. And none of those are listed on on it.

341
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Part of it too sometimes, you know, because they are nonprofit.

342
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:13.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes it just doesn't work with nonprofits. They have to be, you know, certified through the state and all these jump through all these hoops and a lot of private

343
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nonprofits they don't want to do that. They don't want to have to jump through the hoops, you know, they've got plenty of people that they can help, they don't have to get through DHS or you know any of the government entities, so to speak.

344
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:29.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

345
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:42.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, again, it's something to look into more resources to check out for you so that you can see. You know what I mean, what you can do in the next couple days and

346
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:49.740
*Michelle *: Ya know, I'm definitely going to look into those clues

347
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:50.640
Okay.

348
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:58.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, you're, you're asking for short term help right now. You're not asking for long term, I'll be asking for short term, you know,

349
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Duty or situation and you weren't evicted you were

350
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:20.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You put in your notice and the virus it and everything is kind of went haywire every sense and you know she's not giving you an opportunity to extend to get through this piece.

351
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:28.170
*Michelle *: St dot right there blows my mind too because when I talked to the sheriff and she pretty much told me that it's it's

352
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:43.530
*Michelle *: For people who are already or had already received an eviction notice it doesn't apply to them the hold on evictions and that the only the hold on evictions is only for those that want to

353
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.130
*Michelle *: evict somebody for not paying their rent.

354
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:57.840
*Michelle *: Which I feel like I mean that shouldn't. I mean, stay at home order hold on evictions, that should be any and all evictions, for lack of payment or not.

355
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And yeah, it doesn't make okay so if you would if you withdrew your

356
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your

357
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Paperwork stating that you're not moving now and you just didn't pay your rent. They couldn't evict you then.

358
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can automate it just doesn't

359
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:23.190
*Michelle *: Know they did. Even us, they gave us a 90 day eviction on the first of January.

360
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:24.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay.

361
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:31.860
*Michelle *: Yeah, and and they they gave us the extension for the month of April, we were supposed to be out March.

362
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.500
*Michelle *: And they gave us another month

363
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.810
*Michelle *: For the month of April and

364
00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.110
*Michelle *: They don't want to extend it again. They don't want to give us another extension. They want us out.

365
00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:53.760
*Michelle *: And I mean, because I've talked to her about it that HUD housing, because we were, we have HUD HUD pays a portion of our rent.

366
00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:08.640
*Michelle *: And, you know, because I asked them, you know, what happens if we just squat year and she you know she she didn't tell me, we would we would lose our HUD, we wouldn't be able to reapply we would lose our HUD

367
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:16.620
*Michelle *: Like, I don't know how it works, or whatever. But it's basically because we would be in non compliance with

368
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.900
*Michelle *: Whatever.

369
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.120
*Michelle *: Because

370
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:28.440
*Michelle *: We'd be a non compliance of our what whatever you want to call it agreement or or

371
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.810
*Michelle *: Whatever you call it.

372
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:31.290
An

373
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.110
*Michelle *: Agreement.

374
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:39.570
*Michelle *: Whatever, I don't know what she's she had a certain word she used

375
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To contract.

376
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:42.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, can

377
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You be in violation of your contract with her. Yeah.

378
00:39:48.840 --> 00:40:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so check out those resources that I gave you. All right. And I, I just, I have to believe that between the churches and and one of those two that you will be able to find something that will help you for the next couple weeks until you can get up to Oregon.

379
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have to believe that. Okay, I just have to, I don't have any other option right now. Good to believe that that's going to you know come together, you know, for you and

380
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, the last case scenario and and it sounds, it probably sounds horrible. But just packing, you know, shipping, some boxes to your, your, you know, your family's house and getting on a freakin bus and just

381
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Leaving the rest. I mean, I've done that several times when I add do. It's a horrible option but

382
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

383
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is an option. If it comes down to it, and you can't get help.

384
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

385
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:55.050
*Michelle *: No. Yes. No, no thought about that. We thought about just trying to sell what we can and just leave in the rest and

386
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.600
*Michelle *: Element.

387
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It sucks. I know.
