142
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.030

144
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:44.250

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:08.100
Michael Hoefer: Definitely, yeah. And the more we're learning about benzodiazepines, in particular as you get older, increased risk of dementia increased risk of falls increased risk of total cause mortality. You know, it's

151
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.060

Moto E (4): Know john and even then I'm I run out of money paying bills. The first week.

272
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:54.990
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. So you're really, you know, month to month and then trying to support a an opiate habit on top of that is is

273
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.980
Moto E (4): Plentiful no yeah

274
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.770
Michael Hoefer: And do you, you know, do you ever have to sell or do things to try to get money for opiates like

275
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.990
Moto E (4): Oh yeah, sometimes

276
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.350
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

277
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:07.890
Moto E (4): I guess I'm

278
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.440
Moto E (4): Not traveling. Yeah.

279
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.570
Michael Hoefer: But other stuff. Yeah.

280
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:27.750
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well, you know, those are the main questions. I need to ask you for our standard intake. I appreciate you answering them all. I know it's a lot. Was there anything that I left out or feel like, is there anything else you feel like I need to know at this point.

281
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.100
Moto E (4): No you you hit the nail right on the head, but every question.

282
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.870
Michael Hoefer: Okay, thanks.

283
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:44.640
Michael Hoefer: All right, well, I think, you know, having given our conversation. I think it's very clear that you know you have what we consider an opiate use disorder and opiate addiction.

284
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:52.800
Michael Hoefer: And I think you would be a really good candidate for Suboxone I mean you've tried it. You also have some family members who have good responses to it and some of the

285
00:23:53.250 --> 00:24:01.710
Michael Hoefer: For some of the medications, you know, genetic response kind of travels and families. So if your son has responded well to it, it's likely that you will as well, which is very cool.

286
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:02.730
Okay.

287
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:11.490
Michael Hoefer: And so the way that we would recommend you start it you know Suboxone is a very safe and easy medication is to take the only thing that's

288
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:26.010
Michael Hoefer: Somewhat, you have to be careful, is when you take that first dose. You got to make sure that you're in moderate opiate withdrawal. So you want to really wait till you take that first dose, because if you take that first dose too early, you can get sick, basically.

289
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.940
Moto E (4): Okay. Oh.

290
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:34.770
Michael Hoefer: So after we're done with this appointment I can prescribe the medication electronically through you. You can pick it up.

291
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:49.740
Michael Hoefer: But I would wait. You know, usually for heroin people I really recommend people to wait at least 12 to 14 hours and wait as long as you can tell, you really in withdrawal. So when you take that first dose it makes you feel a lot better not worse. Okay.

292
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:56.100
Michael Hoefer: And what we'll do is we'll give you eight milligrams, or have you been taking the tablets are the films.

293
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.260
Moto E (4): The film.

294
00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:58.830
Michael Hoefer: Okay.

295
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.040
Michael Hoefer: So we can give you the films, if that's been working well for you.

296
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.880
Moto E (4): And

297
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:09.180
Michael Hoefer: What we want you to just do is cut them in for the first day we want you to just cut them in half and take four milligrams at a time.

298
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:17.730
Michael Hoefer: So what you do is you just you wait till your and, you know, moderate withdrawal. You take four milligrams after a few hours if

299
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:27.660
Michael Hoefer: See how you're feeling and after a couple hours. Take another four milligrams and you can just keep taking it up until a max of 60 milligrams and the first 24 hours.

300
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.450
Michael Hoefer: Just take four milligrams every couple hours.

301
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:37.860
Michael Hoefer: And if you get to a point where you're like, Hey, I feel good. I don't need any more. Just don't take any more. And if you keep feeling like you need more take up to 60 milligrams

302
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:45.930
Michael Hoefer: And then after that first day that first 24 hours, whatever amount you took just start taking that daily going forward.

303
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:46.590
Okay.

304
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:56.550
Michael Hoefer: And you just you, you probably already know this, but just make sure you put it under your tongue to let it absorb if you swallow it or don't put it under your tongue. It won't get in your system.

305
00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:03.480
Michael Hoefer: And don't eat or drink anything about 15 minutes beforehand because it will affect the acidity in your mouth and you won't absorb it as good

306
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.310
Moto E (4): Okay, yeah.

307
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:14.070
Michael Hoefer: And then that's basically it. I can give you from this intake. I can give you a one week supply of the medication.

308
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.240
Michael Hoefer: And then in a day or two, our care coordinator will get in contact with you.

309
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:25.470
Michael Hoefer: And get you connected with a continuity therapist and a position to go to meet with overtime.

310
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.930
Michael Hoefer: And just get you involved in our program.

311
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.100
Great.

312
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.260
Moto E (4): Your health doctor

313
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.120
Michael Hoefer: Oh yeah, absolutely. Are there any questions about the way the medication works or

314
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.120
Michael Hoefer: The program or side effects or anything else at this time.

315
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.130
Moto E (4): You cover you covered it.

316
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:49.560
Michael Hoefer: Okay. All right, great. Well, welcome to our program and I wish you the best of luck and take care

317
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.460
Moto E (4): Thank you.

318
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.400
Moto E (4): All right. Sure. Sure. Absolutely.

319
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.120
Michael Hoefer: Have a good one.

320
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.710
Moto E (4): You too. God bless.
