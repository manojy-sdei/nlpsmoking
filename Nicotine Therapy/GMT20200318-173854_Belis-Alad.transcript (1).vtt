Elijah Nelson: Know controlled substances.

60
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.170
Belis Aladag: So again, you were using it from friends. So you weren't being

Elijah Nelson: I see. Okay.

64
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.470
Elijah Nelson: But before

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.660
Belis Aladag: Before that year. Tell me about what dose, like how high

66
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.320
Belis Aladag: How much

67
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.820
Belis Aladag: hydrocodone has been on

68
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.650
Elijah Nelson: Well, at first it was supposed to be taking like

69
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.070
Elijah Nelson: A day, and there were

70
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.780
Elijah Nelson: 10 I was getting up to like 10 a day.

71
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.870
Elijah Nelson: And it was just, it just, it was like

72
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:07.590
Elijah Nelson: I don't know, like a never ending like battle I stayed liking. I just like it doesn't make me feel the same when I stopped taking it was just like all bad, like I couldn't function right

73
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.450
Belis Aladag: Right. Oh.

74
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.570
Elijah Nelson: Well, my friend was like, hey, you should try this.

75
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.620
Yeah.

76
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.890
Elijah Nelson: I like it because it doesn't like mentally. Like, I feel, clear. You know what I mean, like, I don't feel like

77
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.110
Belis Aladag: It's not altering

78
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.160
Exactly.

79
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.330
Elijah Nelson: I'm still able to function. Fine, I'm not like

80
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.320
Elijah Nelson: Stupid around or anything, you know, okay.

81
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.620
Belis Aladag: Good. Um, okay. So it sounds like you've been I'm

82
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.580
Belis Aladag: Evil on between four and eight milligrams a day.

83
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.780
Belis Aladag: For our purposes, I would rather you stay steady on one dose.

84
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.670
Belis Aladag: And then later on.

85
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.870
Belis Aladag: If you're like, you know,

86
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.830
Elijah Nelson: I think I'm

87
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.270
Elijah Nelson: going on now for

88
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.070
Belis Aladag: Whatever two years or whatever.

89
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.450
Belis Aladag: You

90
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.720
Want

91
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.140
To taper you down.

92
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.850
Belis Aladag: But only if you want, when you want later.

93
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.080
Belis Aladag: Right, so

94
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.460
Belis Aladag: I think

95
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.680
Belis Aladag: My recommendation would be

96
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.750
Belis Aladag: If you feel a this too much. We could do formula.

97
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.260
Elijah Nelson: On it.

98
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.580
Yeah.

99
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.700
Elijah Nelson: You know, if I just take the buyer. So a longer period of time without it.

100
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:52.260
Elijah Nelson: Every day I found that I can go up to two, three A's and I'm okay with that third night.

101
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.280
Belis Aladag: So that's the thing, my recommendation is you take something every day.

102
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:09.780
Belis Aladag: Because the upset. I don't want the whole point of this medication is it prevents those ups and downs that the other opioids cause

103
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.640
Belis Aladag: And then policy.

104
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.450
Issues and

105
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.020
Belis Aladag: This is very stable in your bloodstream.

106
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.930
Belis Aladag: But we don't want to play around that it becomes

107
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.720
Elijah Nelson: The only reason I really do that is because we have

108
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.000
Elijah Nelson: So meeting my god

109
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.240
Elijah Nelson: I don't know. Is it good. It was hard for me to go to the it was hard for me to go to you.

110
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.980
Belis Aladag: Can you can you bring them like closer or

111
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.500
Elijah Nelson: I'm sorry, yeah. I said, I'll have my friend said to me, and it's

112
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:08.580
Elijah Nelson: Like what I have what I have to make that lab right as you are asking anybody else. Yes. No. I went to the I SHOULD WATCH THE MERGER OR product. See a doctor.

113
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.280
Belis Aladag: Yeah, it's okay.

114
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.290
Belis Aladag: It's okay. You're here now.

115
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:13.830
Belis Aladag: And the

116
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.510
Elijah Nelson: Pieces. You shouldn't you shouldn't

117
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.290
Belis Aladag: Have to

118
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.170
Belis Aladag: Be on that, like a scarcity.

119
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.240
Belis Aladag: Mentality if I got to make this lab.

120
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.410
Belis Aladag: We'll do regular visits will

121
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:32.670
Belis Aladag: Do regular check ins and and give you your medication on a regular basis. So I don't see a problem with that.

122
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.250
Belis Aladag: Possible then with four milligrams a day if you're going to

123
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.560
Elijah Nelson: Think, or do you prefer to just stick with me.

124
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.620
Elijah Nelson: I mean, he was they got sick.

125
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.530
Elijah Nelson: You can do six

126
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.170
Belis Aladag: Okay, so

127
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.440
Belis Aladag: I could give you two milligrams

128
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.610
Belis Aladag: Tab or

129
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.760
Belis Aladag: You can take three of

130
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.110
Belis Aladag: You take it all together.

131
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.890
Elijah Nelson: That's what I have, I have eight milligram films and what I'll do is like

132
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.350
Elijah Nelson: Or I'll take a little bit

133
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.630
Belis Aladag: Okay, so I think we'll give you three two milligrams

134
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.250
Belis Aladag: And you take it back to

135
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:23.490
Belis Aladag: Back or all together, however you want to do it. You know how to melt it under your tongue, it gets into your system that way.

136
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.850
Belis Aladag: Okay, so we'll do it that way.

137
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:27.870
Belis Aladag: And

138
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:34.560
Belis Aladag: Does your inch. Well, we don't know about your insurance coverage. But if the insurance prefers tablets over films.

139
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.220
Elijah Nelson: I mean,

140
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.410
Belis Aladag: Whatever works right i mean

141
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.730
Belis Aladag: You prefer the film. Do you want me to put in for the film.

142
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.120
Elijah Nelson: Or do you want. That's usually what I cake, but I guess it doesn't matter.

143
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.760
Belis Aladag: It really doesn't matter. I'll put in for film, but if the insurance is like, Oh, it's so much cheaper for you.

144
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.870
Belis Aladag: To get the tablet.

145
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.710
You can ask them.

146
00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:01.560
Elijah Nelson: I got a call yesterday, basically saying I talk. What I did the evaluation. He went over the prices.

147
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:09.570
Elijah Nelson: I can't afford them right now. I'm waiting for my insurance to kick in for this for the job. I've been working for five months, I've been dealing with the

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.920

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.710
Belis Aladag: I'll see. I'll see which one she's

158
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.600
Belis Aladag: Talking to make sure I order that one.

159
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.040
Belis Aladag: Are you okay

160
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.350
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, the only guys going to lunch.

161
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:29.490
Belis Aladag: Um, okay. So we'll, I'll, we'll make sure that you can get your hands on that and if it can be free. That would be awesome. Let's do that.

162
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:42.780
Belis Aladag: So yeah, I'll put him for that. And we'll regardless of film or tablet, whatever we can get you. It's going to dissolve under your tongue. It's going to be six milligrams a day. And let's just stay steady every day. Same time try to take it.

163
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.260
Belis Aladag: Okay, and tell me

164
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:55.290
Belis Aladag: About the. So how many years ago was this pain situation, what happened exactly. You bet you hurt your back and you went into a pain doctor

165
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.780
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, I went into a doctor over in McKinsey, Tennessee.

166
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:18.480
Elijah Nelson: I, you know, and I established, you know, care with a doctor named Dr blonde and you know I did the whole MRI, they did all that for me in this like to. And basically he just said that he got he can see

167
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.250
Elijah Nelson: a pinched nerve and then like in my lower back and I had it and he could see a lot of

168
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.660
Elijah Nelson: Was it arthritis in my bag. Okay.

169
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.420
Elijah Nelson: I was like, man, I want to young

170
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:34.950
Elijah Nelson: Yeah.

171
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.620
Elijah Nelson: But I saw him, I was like I was doing rehabilitation stuff and I tried to do

172
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.970
Elijah Nelson: Like a chiropractor doctor

173
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.370
Elijah Nelson: And I just told him, it's, I mean I'm just in pain all the time, you know, and

174
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:57.150
Elijah Nelson: He's like, Well, I'm going to refer you over to the pain management, too. So I went to the pain management in place for

175
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.520
Elijah Nelson: Now I've worked with state last year at one point or another, and

176
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.130
Belis Aladag: Repeat that you you blocking put out

177
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.100
Belis Aladag: There for my loan payments, man.

178
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:26.160
Elijah Nelson: I was in pain management for what to say about a year, you know, whenever I was able to get to that, you know, make an appointment actually make it because I travel for work so much

179
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:35.100
Elijah Nelson: So it was kind of hard for me. They worked with me a lot, you know, just trying to make my appointments. Whenever I was at home, I would try to get in there, you know,

180
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:43.830
Elijah Nelson: And then, like I said, a lot. I'm not gonna lie. A lot of it just from friends. They're like, hey, I'll give them to you, you know, and I mean I know it wasn't right. But I just

181
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.460
Belis Aladag: I see. So there was the prescriptions when you

182
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.640
Belis Aladag: couldn't make it. And then there were the ADD ONS from friends in this in

183
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.220
Elijah Nelson: Their life like when I was out with I'd be out of state, then, you know, and I didn't have any you know I

184
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:02.700
Elijah Nelson: I would just call a friend because I can't make an appointment when I'm out of state sure there's a call for any senators.

185
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:17.610
Elijah Nelson: And I never would anything that wasn't prescribed, you know, besides the Suboxone which, you know, I'm not gonna lie. It's been like a monkey on my back, especially at work, you know, because you know I can get into a lot of trouble. And I don't want to get into no

186
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.060
Belis Aladag: Tell me about the work that you do that you had to travel for

187
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.680
Elijah Nelson: I build above ground storage tanks for refineries and

188
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.510
Elijah Nelson: I can show you.

189
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.360
Elijah Nelson: There's one right there.

190
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.890
Belis Aladag: Oh, wow.

191
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.650
Elijah Nelson: Look at that I built I built. Oh.

192
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.390
Wow.

193
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.840
Belis Aladag: Wow. So, so, okay, so it's a physical physical labor kind of job.

194
00:14:42.930 --> 00:15:02.700
Belis Aladag: No one. Okay, so, so when he saw you, and he did the MRI and he said, You got some arthritis. It was from wear and tear arthritis, not the not the autoimmune rheumatoid was the osteoarthritis. Got it. Okay. Because you do physical labor. That's a lot of hard work. Wow.

195
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:03.810
Elijah Nelson: Yeah.

196
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:10.410
Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so right now. Are you still traveling or are you pretty grounded right now in California where you're at.

197
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.020
Elijah Nelson: I'm pretty grounded right now. I mean,

198
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:25.350
Elijah Nelson: They're as long as they keep me busy and that's the thing, you know, like where I go where the work is and i mean i i worked. I would have been Vacaville California for years and

199
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:32.730
Elijah Nelson: I was always able to stay local you know somewhat local sometimes they send me up to Washington or, you know,

200
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.120
Elijah Nelson: Arizona or something once in a while, but there's always a lot of work around this area so

201
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:47.700
Elijah Nelson: Me and my wife ended up trying to get this wild hair. So we want to move out of California and moved to Tennessee and

202
00:15:48.270 --> 00:16:03.390
Elijah Nelson: I worked for a company that would allow me to because I tried that, you know, I, I could stay around that area, you know, within maybe a four or five hour range and have jobs and did I go to like a tank job. That's all I do is build tanks.

203
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.350
Elijah Nelson: And, you know, so it, it seemed like a good idea at the time. You know, and

204
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.820
Elijah Nelson: Unfortunately, me and my wife ended up getting into the wars and

205
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:25.230
Elijah Nelson: Yeah. And then, so I I found myself back out here with a company that was an older guy that I worked on. I first started doing this type of work he

206
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:33.780
Elijah Nelson: He I called him. It was like, look, I'm looking to stay somewhere for a while, kind of like state to claim again and now I'm back in California, but

207
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:42.360
Elijah Nelson: I mean, I still own a home in Tennessee and my kids are out in Tennessee. So it's kind of hard to say how long I can be grounded out here. My kids are out there, you know,

208
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.470
Belis Aladag: Tell me, tell me about the kids. How many kids would hold on.

209
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.190
Elijah Nelson: I got three girls and they're 1311 and five.

210
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:56.340
Belis Aladag: Wow, okay. And there with your wife in the home that you guys own over there in Tennessee.

211
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.710
Elijah Nelson: Me and her get along very well.

212
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.000
Elijah Nelson: There's just something that, you know, kind of had to happen.

213
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:11.760
Belis Aladag: Do you think this hydrocodone the pain pills stuff had something to do with the demise.

214
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:17.820
Elijah Nelson: It probably did you know i mean i know it didn't help any you know because cheat. The thing is you never knew

215
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.840
Elijah Nelson: She knew that I would get prescriptions and

216
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.900
Elijah Nelson: But she never, I don't think she ever really don't think she ever really paid attention. That's, you know. That's probably part of that.

217
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.900
Elijah Nelson: There's a lot. There's a lot going on there so

218
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.360
Belis Aladag: So yeah, both sides. I see.

219
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.430
Belis Aladag: I'm sorry to hear that. And so

220
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:41.130
Belis Aladag: When did you move out away from. So when did the divorce take place. And when did you move here.

221
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:49.440
Elijah Nelson: Um, well, I was still working for the company that out. We moved out there. I was working for that company called Philips tank and

222
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.470
Elijah Nelson: They kept me pretty local you know I did jobs in Indiana and Kentucky and

223
00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.340
Elijah Nelson: And then

224
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:16.080
Elijah Nelson: I ended up quitting that job and coming over here. When after divorce we split up about August of last year, and then the divorce was final around October 21 okay and then that was about the time I came to California and decided that

225
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.780
Elijah Nelson: I'm going to work for. I work for matrix company now here in California, but

226
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:28.710
Elijah Nelson: I see like that. I want to stay grounded on a stay for a while. I make decent money I'm trying to

227
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:35.130
Elijah Nelson: And but it's still hard because I pay right now here and pay for my house that they chose for everything, you know,

228
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:45.780
Elijah Nelson: And I'm trying to get my benefits set up. I mean, I've been working for him for five months. I don't know why I can't get benefits. The way the Union works is if you don't have enough hours in like I started in November.

229
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.030
Elijah Nelson: Of last year when I was able to finally start working for these guys and

230
00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:01.080
Elijah Nelson: I didn't work enough hours by the end of the year to get my benefits for that quarter to start my benefits and then so this quarter.

231
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:13.350
Elijah Nelson: They don't, they do is they don't report my hours until the next month, the middle of next month. So am I trying to call him like, hey, when can I get my benefits. My kids need benefits, you know, and I needed to. Yeah.

232
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:24.450
Elijah Nelson: And then, like I say, when I called in for the evaluation. And they were like, they went over the prices and stuff. I just told him, I was like, I can't do it right now. I just I can't afford it and

233
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.420
Elijah Nelson: That's when our, our, our, on our, on our Johnny or I forget.

234
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.950
Belis Aladag: RJ RJ

235
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:39.990
Elijah Nelson: RJ RJ and call me yesterday. And she's like, You qualify for all of the free on grant and blah, you know, like, All right, awesome.

236
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.400
Belis Aladag: Okay, let's do that.

237
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.770
Elijah Nelson: And then hopefully we can

238
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.000
Belis Aladag: You know retroactively add you know once you get your benefits. We can get you in, you know,

239
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:54.600
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, I mean, I'll have been on them over at the Union, because I never been Union before and

240
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:05.490
Elijah Nelson: So I'm not. I'm learning as I go how this works. And so I've been on I'm trying to get them to my company to claim that are send them the hours that I've worked

241
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.450
Elijah Nelson: So I can get

242
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:12.120
Belis Aladag: Get this moving. Yeah, because you need it, like you said, for your family and yourself.

243
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:23.820
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, especially with all this stuff going on right now. You know, and I'm surprised. I'm just lucky I'm I mean I'm super happy and less than I'm working right now because I know there's a lot of people go into a lot of stuff right now.

244
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.680
Belis Aladag: Financially, yeah. It's such a

245
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.420
Elijah Nelson: Girl world. It's insane. All this stuff happening. But anyway, so you're fortunate

246
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:42.090
Belis Aladag: And I'm glad that they were able to get you in the door here so that we can get you stable. So you it's one less thing for you to worry about, like, oh, am I going to run out. Am I gonna have to ask a friend, whatever, like let's just regularly do this.

247
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.630
Belis Aladag: Do you have any allergies to medication. No, no. Do you have any history of surgeries.

248
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:57.060
Belis Aladag: No, no, any mental health any like depression, anxiety, things like that, you were diagnosed with or given men's for

249
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.480
Elijah Nelson: No, you don't take any other myths. No.

250
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:13.800
Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, what else. Um, is there any risk of like suicidal thoughts or do you have any thoughts like that. Have you had that in the past, any, any nothing so

251
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.190
Elijah Nelson: I love life. Way too much. Okay.

252
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:26.010
Belis Aladag: That's nice. Um, okay, good. So no suicidal stuff. Um, what else do I need to ask you.

253
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.570
I'm

254
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:38.460
Belis Aladag: Your pain. So now on the Suboxone for the past year between four and eight milligrams. Are you pretty well controlled when you're taking it in terms of your pain.

255
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.050
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, I feel great.

256
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.040
Okay.

257
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.920
Elijah Nelson: get me wrong. I like this, nothing makes me feel great. I don't. It's not like

258
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.530
Elijah Nelson: I don't get how not high on that. I just feel good.

259
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.510
Elijah Nelson: You feel bad mood.

260
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.130
You can function.

261
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.420
Belis Aladag: Side effects like some people

262
00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.890
Elijah Nelson: Know what

263
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:04.770
Belis Aladag: A lot or they have constipation or anything. Do you have any issues with these you're okay.

264
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:19.680
Belis Aladag: Um, I think I got everything any family history. I should know about. Is there any family history relevant like I don't know alcohol use disorder. Any substance use disorders any mental illness. No.

265
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.700
Elijah Nelson: No.

266
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:39.120
Belis Aladag: And for you in terms of drugs or you ever, like, did you ever have. Besides, when you have this opioid exposure. It sounds like I'm back in Tennessee with Dr. Blunt after getting established with Dr. Blend is when you started getting this chronic

267
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:49.530
Elijah Nelson: You know, there's like a, it's like a, an angry monster. You're trying to feed. He just doesn't stop. And I just, I was so tired of taking it. I just

268
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.150
Belis Aladag: Yeah, but no other past like

269
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.580
Belis Aladag: Did you have a thing with alcohol or cannabis or do you do any of these things do you drink.

270
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:09.210
Elijah Nelson: I might drink on especially like on a social occasion like Christmas or Thanksgiving, I might have line and stuff. But other than that, I don't drink, you don't. Okay.

271
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:22.770
Belis Aladag: Which is good. Just so you know, because with this medication. It is an opioid, it's a partial opioid so it's a lot safer than everybody else. Everything else but still we don't recommend alcohol. It shouldn't mix with it, you know.

272
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.590
Belis Aladag: Yeah so. Okay, so you got that.

273
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:45.750
Belis Aladag: I think I think I've gotten everything. I'm just gonna put in your prescription. I'm Narcan ok so the risk of overdose with Suboxone is extremely low because there's a cap on the respiratory depression that it causes other

274
00:23:45.990 --> 00:24:02.820
Belis Aladag: Boys. On the other hand, that's why people die they overdose and they stopped breathing. So, um, it's just California law that we prescribe something called Narcan as well. And you can choose to pick it up or not, but I'm going to put in the order, it's something

275
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:15.240
Belis Aladag: It's called Narcan it's it's a reversal agent. So like if 911 is called and someone's passed out and they they spray the person in the nose to see if it'll reverse an overdose.

276
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:16.080
Elijah Nelson: Oh,

277
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:30.150
Belis Aladag: It's a reversal thing and it's, it can save lives. You still need to call 911 if you use it on anybody, you're welcome to use it on other people like let's say you see somebody, and you're like, I don't know, it might feel opiate overdose. You could use it just spray

278
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:36.480
Belis Aladag: And if it's not that that say they had a heart attack or something and it's not going to hurt them.

279
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:43.770
Belis Aladag: So it's not a comfortable substance, but it's just there. If you live with anybody, or you want to have it on your person. It's just something that

280
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.700
Belis Aladag: I bit as well. Um,

281
00:24:48.990 --> 00:25:08.550
Belis Aladag: And then finally, I'll send you. I have your email so I can send you some instructions. But the way we like to do things is by trying to do group appointments. So are you comfortable with that we can move forward and when, like in the beginning. I'll see weekly you do a weekly check in.

282
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:16.710
Belis Aladag: Hey, how's the medicine going, you need a refill. Let's just do that. And then, and then there's a therapist that runs the rest of the

283
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:27.480
Belis Aladag: Session about like, okay, how do you prevent relapse. Do you have any cravings to use or you know what what happens, etc. It's an opioid use disorder type of therapy.

284
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:41.040
Elijah Nelson: I mean, I don't know if I can. I'll do it. I don't have a problem with that. I just said, I don't. As soon as I found this box. And I never looked back on pills. I don't even. They're not even

285
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.510
Belis Aladag: Not even close. Never.

286
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.310
Elijah Nelson: Never. So then

287
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.930
Elijah Nelson: That's a blessing. So

288
00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:56.340
Belis Aladag: It sounds like you found the right medication and that you don't really deviate from the path as long as you have medication.

289
00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:03.630
Elijah Nelson: Even when I don't I just kind of sweat it out, you know, and as an admin been really

290
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:11.340
Elijah Nelson: It hasn't been really bad since that's last Sunday. That's the last, that's the only time that I've really ran out and like it's been like, I don't have no way to get

291
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:22.290
Elijah Nelson: You know, and really, I was just waiting for the mail, you know, I couldn't go another day, you know. Yeah, it was just like, too bad. I couldn't do it. I wanted to. Yes.

292
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:28.770
Belis Aladag: Yeah, but look, it led to something good, you know. And this way you can legitimately have your prescriptions.

293
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:44.100
Elijah Nelson: Actually, and that's what I told my girlfriend said well you know this. I just entered just go do it. Just go hey, I got medical benefits right now. So hopefully retro it, but let's just go over there and see what they say and then even a doctor, I sat in there for four hours. He just

294
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:57.000
Elijah Nelson: He's like, well, we don't we don't we don't prescribe narcotics. And I was like, dude, you're not even listening to what I'm saying, I don't want our cards I want Suboxone. Oh, okay. Here you go. Alright, thanks.

295
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.400
Elijah Nelson: It was weird. I'm like, okay, man. All right.

296
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.280
Belis Aladag: Well, and then and then they connected you with us, which is really

297
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.890
Elijah Nelson: Good. That's, that's really cool.

298
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:18.600
Belis Aladag: Because this is, you know, tele health, you can go anywhere. So even if you do move around. We have doctors that are able to prescribe in different states and stuff. So it should be able to, we should be okay.

299
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:20.940
Elijah Nelson: I'm

300
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.960
Belis Aladag: Okay, last thing is smoking. Do you smoke cigarettes or vapor anything

301
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.830
Elijah Nelson: Or do I do smoke cigarettes I SMOKE ABOUT five a day.

302
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.930
Belis Aladag: Five, six a day. How, how long have you been smoking. Would you say

303
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.890
Elijah Nelson: Well, I've been trying to quit. For the last 10 years but

304
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.660
Elijah Nelson: It's been about 15 years okay 15 years

305
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:51.930
Belis Aladag: So, so that's one thing we can definitely work on you know I can. Have you ever tried like lozenges nicotine losses, where you suck it suck on it like candy.

306
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.060
Elijah Nelson: No, I just the only thing I've really quit. I quit it for about eight or nine months with the debate.

307
00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.950
Belis Aladag: With beeping. Okay.

308
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.330
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, but then

309
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.970
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, I was like, even now.

310
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.820
Belis Aladag: There's some dangers. With that, I don't know if you've heard about the pneumonia issue that

311
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:18.390
Elijah Nelson: I've heard, and I've heard that they're going to outlaw like they're gonna cross the border just now. You cannot fake number. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't know how true that is but that's just what I heard.

312
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:34.170
Belis Aladag: Yeah, there's some so the thing is the thing you're inhaling in the vapor is the issues. There's still chemicals in there that they're not quite sure they're still cancer causing agents in there and then now they found this pneumonia link. And so I'm not sure where we're at with that.

313
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:40.440
Belis Aladag: But, you know, but you probably liked it because it gave you something to do, just like

314
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.000
Elijah Nelson: You know, the cigarette how the

315
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.310
Belis Aladag: Oral habit I tried

316
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.550
Elijah Nelson: I tried to was that pill called I tried that one.

317
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.900
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, I try Chantix I got the weird dreams and all that, but

318
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.700
Belis Aladag: You want to do that.

319
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.220
Elijah Nelson: Right now.

320
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.790
Belis Aladag: You're like, I just want to take one thing at a time. Okay.

321
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:01.920
Belis Aladag: I'm

322
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.400
Belis Aladag: Okay so Chantix seemed to help a little bit in the past, you said

323
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:13.710
Elijah Nelson: It did. I was able to quit for with it, you know, okay, I quit. I quit for a while that was man I'm it's been 10 years ago.

324
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:14.910
At least

325
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:29.730
Elijah Nelson: But I quit with it. It was the hardest part was like that last day, you take the pills. It's like okay they let you smoke up until this point, you know, and it's like we take these pills and then on that last day was put them down and I was able to put them down, you know, and then

326
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.930
Elijah Nelson: I think I was moving around and I stopped taking it.

327
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.360
Elijah Nelson: Yeah, and I started smoking in

328
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.580
Belis Aladag: Yes, it happens.

329
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.050
Belis Aladag: Okay, so

330
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.490
Belis Aladag: So we don't

331
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:51.750
Belis Aladag: We know that we have this drug that might work well for you. So we could do Chantix in the future, just something to think about. Well, I'll keep poking you a little bit once in a while.

332
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.850
Elijah Nelson: About because it's something

333
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.070
Belis Aladag: That's really good for your health that you could do.

334
00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:04.530
Belis Aladag: All right. Okay. So we'll work on that. Some other time and then. Okay, any questions for me.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:21.780
Belis Aladag: You should be able to pick it up. If there's any problems you call our virtual clinic or that number that you have and then our Jane or their team will figure out what the issue is. And

337
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.850

349
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:36.150
And

350
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.840

353
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:57.270
Elijah Nelson: They're starting to like even in the refinery like I thought this week, I think it was yesterday I was on my way to work thinking like, they're going to send us home today because of everything going on a lot of like set la people aren't working, and

354
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:03.360
Elijah Nelson: I guess they have a chevron refinery and El Segundo, California.

355
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.230
Elijah Nelson: And

356
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.140
Elijah Nelson: They shut that down. Like they send everybody home.

357
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:11.070
Elijah Nelson: Oh, because they had, they had a report a case of that Corona in there.

358
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.460
Elijah Nelson: There was a big scare and then they're

359
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:23.880
Elijah Nelson: They're going to do it here, but I think what they're doing is they're they're checking people's temperatures on the way in. So if you're over if you're over a certain temperature send you home.

360
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.530
Belis Aladag: I see that's

361
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.950
