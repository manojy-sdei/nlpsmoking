340
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.850
moto e5 cruise: Okay, I was on Ritalin. For me, it's 317

341
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.760
moto e5 cruise: Well, when they sat the riddle and

342
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:56.550
moto e5 cruise: Don't know why cocaine slows me down sounds funny, but it's the opposite with ADHD. So when I do a hiccup is tremendously family relaxes me challenge you bed.

343
00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:02.400
Natalie Austin: But let's go like what cooking over at or Adderall does. Yeah, we're going

344
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:16.110
moto e5 cruise: To show anyway. So I said to the people at choices and cheer brown and one is I need so much help my ADHD via and I would not be on cocaine at all ever

345
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:21.180
moto e5 cruise: Because I had our rental and all my life in that one out me sit in.

346
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.940
moto e5 cruise: Concentrate period. And so when I jumped me after that I have not been able to do that since then.

347
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:38.070
moto e5 cruise: And so since then I've used cocaine just once a week or twice a week, just to be able to settle down a little bit, because I'm so freaking nightmare. I can handle myself. That's how I Brian

348
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:48.330
moto e5 cruise: And so I said to the doctor. Can you please, how we treat me for my at 18 for one week or two weeks and see that the cocaine drops out of my system.

moto e5 cruise: I'll never use it again and they wouldn't go they wouldn't go for it. Like to control things we don't do that. And so that's the main reason why

Natalie Austin: Maybe I'm picking my nose or something, you know,

902
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.280
Natalie Austin: I'm not really doing that. I'm just saying you need to be

01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:51.120
moto e5 cruise: Okay.

912
