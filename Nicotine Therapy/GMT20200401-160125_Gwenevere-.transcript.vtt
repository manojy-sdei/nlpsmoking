Ateeq Dean: Pay

13
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:55.770
Ateeq Dean: That's the time I woke up, I woke up at 10 and then as I got ready when I love this other text and I got work and then soon as I had time I text you okay yeah yeah

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me let me um let me know how you're doing. What's it like over there where you're working. I mean is, is what's the stress level like over there.

15
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:12.060
Ateeq Dean: It's pretty stressful because I'm working in medical also. And what they're doing is I'm where we're moving residents from

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:23.280
Ateeq Dean: One of our floors and we're clearing, one of the floors out to bring residents from a different hospital, just to bring the workload down and everybody's paranoid about that.

17
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.950
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I had a couple Collins, I had like four coughs this morning.

18
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.840
Ateeq Dean: Uh huh. Yeah.

19
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that it's paranoia when there really is a threat.

20
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.610
Ateeq Dean: Yeah yeah part you know it's bold.

21
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:50.220
Ateeq Dean: I'm paranoid and part, you know, because right now we don't have any cases where I'm at. But that could change anytime and I don't know how I feel about you know, going back

22
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Fashions your, your employers have not been

23
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The most person centered type of employers not they've been sort of money driven so they may not be as conscientious as would be convenient right now, but are they acknowledging the risk and masks and gloves of just, you know,

24
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.090
Ateeq Dean: Leave solution we have bleach and stuff like that but

25
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:36.180
Ateeq Dean: To take that type of workload on. We don't have that type of stuff that we need. Okay. And our quarantine level is pretty poor because everybody that going to be quarantine is over there, rolling around the hallways and stuff like that. And that's not what they're supposed to be doing.

26
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.620
So there's

27
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me what that's like for you to go every day to that work environments. What's up, like

28
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.900
Ateeq Dean: I just feel like I'm going to go in one night and half my boys aren't gonna show up.

29
00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So you're not you're not preoccupied with bringing the virus to your system and then passing it to your family. That's not what you're worried about you won't have enough employees for the job function.

30
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:14.190
Ateeq Dean: And all that goes through me to that goes to my head too because you know as cuz I'm right in front of the door in the mornings I go back to the front and I, I'm the one scanning everybody's temperatures in the morning I wear a mask everything myself.

31
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.760
Ateeq Dean: And I have just get everyone's tab. So I've had to tell people to go home because them coughing and stuff like that, too.

32
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you wearing gloves while you're doing and then that's your hands, you're washing your hands.

33
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.840
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I have. We have sanitizer. So I've been using it a lot. I've been using it to the point where it's like throwing my hands out pretty bad.

34
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.690
Ateeq Dean: Wants to join us this morning I was waking her up. I don't know.

35
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that'd be great.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.910
Treatment plan review.

40
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.740

Ateeq Dean: Going now it's more than seven days. It's going to 13 days now.

47
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, nice. Okay 13 days, got it. Okay. And let me just make a little note down here. I'm trying to keep track of it for you. Okay. For 120 actual those 5.5 grams. Let's see. Last 13

48
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.180
All right.

49
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I can't remember what you decided with Dr. Solomon what you wanted to do. Did you want to stay there.

50
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.750
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I was gonna stay here just

51
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of being

52
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.230
Ateeq Dean: Okay, do you know want us to start

53
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.780
They might fall down.

54
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.850
Ateeq Dean: But I just kind of want to see what's going on because I still have my appointment with the insurance and all that. I want to see if they'll give me a little bit. See

55
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: When the appointment.

56
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: For the 20th

57
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And there I thought that's when it was expiring

58
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.980
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, that's when it expires. And this one is scheduled also oh

59
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.930
Ateeq Dean: If I don't if if I miss disappointment, it's cancelled, they'll cut me off right there and then

60
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So client has and it's a telephone appointment.

61
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.570
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, the telephone appointment.

62
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Appointment was what's the insurance company.

63
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.020
Ateeq Dean: Blue Cross Blue Shield.

64
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Be CBS and

65
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Two and also say and client reports.

66
00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Intent to appeal extension yeah okay benefits.

67
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, cool. Nicely done. Haha. Hi, how are you

68
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

69
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see. I was just reviewing some progress.

70
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right down here and the dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. I'm just curious, Cara. What, you don't have to tell me this. But what is what insurance on do you have

71
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.370
Ateeq Dean: I have Medicaid

72
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.970
Ateeq Dean: It's a Blue Cross Blue Shield also

73
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.380
Yeah.

74
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess what I wonder is

75
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, if she doesn't have a substance use piece. So she wouldn't be in here for that.

76
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's trying to think if there's a way to still continue

77
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well, I'll, uh, I'll let you guys kind of navigate that.

78
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Will navigate it. Yeah.

79
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you're, you're a plan, at least for the time being, you're going to get some information. If you're able to at least visit once a month. That's your plan.

80
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:29.670
Ateeq Dean: Okay, because even if I don't get approved by insurance and all that I kind of want to go to Portugal and they can talk to them about payment plans and how smart.

81
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know if you want to write this down. But Krista binning is the financial person that I've noticed seems to. I've talked with her and she she's the one

82
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That literally can see into the Medicaid, Medicare portal. He's the one knows and around in there like she can see right in there.

83
00:08:48.960 --> 00:09:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But she can check benefits and things like that. So whenever I've heard from her and she said so and so has this dual enrollment or blah, blah, blah. She has this access to these right the actual benefits so

84
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.200
Ateeq Dean: Again, I'm sorry.

85
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Krista bending bi N by N. G. But basically, when you go into virtual clinic, you're going to waste your time. If you talk with the folks right there. The care navigators, they're not going to really be terribly informed on

86
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The product of insurance. They're just not gonna. So just kind of just say, you know what I'd really like to schedule a time to talk with

87
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or let me have an email so that I can be in direct communication with your finance point person. Don't even just because I want to discuss

88
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: My financial obligation, I'd like to continue care here, but I'm I'm having a disruption in my finance amend my insurance carrier, it just short and sweet, because if you go on and on and on you. They're going to end up being like, I can't help you.

89
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Work worse or worse batik you might get misinformation throw your hands in the air and leave when really you could have gotten better different information. So I don't really want you to get

90
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad information. Okay. All right. And I accidentally might do it sometimes too. I won't mean to. But that's not my profession. I don't know what's really going on with it. So you want to directly talk with someone in finance. Okay. Okay. Beautiful. Okay.

91
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're here today with both of you. And can I hear from each of you, how you are sharing with this additional massive global crisis. How are you guys doing

92
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You surfers. Yeah, I'm okay. Okay.

93
00:10:50.910 --> 00:11:04.680
Ateeq Dean: Oh um I stay home. Pretty much anyway. Me and the baby. So I mean there's places we can go know if we need something from the store. The grocery stores and think he goes

94
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:16.650
Ateeq Dean: It's kind of hard. I haven't really the last time I left the house was last Wednesday to go to a doctor's appointment. Yeah, so I think I probably going a little bit stir crazy right I'm

95
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.890
Ateeq Dean: Other nine nothing's really changed too much for me.

96
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So along the lines of the stir crazy part. This might seem abundantly obvious for some people are like, oh, thank you for bringing it up. I never thought about that I

97
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I have been introducing whether it's a support group through through online, whether it's fellowship, but I'm also discussing girls night online.

98
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So setting up a little zoom meeting in here like this with your girlfriends and maybe we have tea or coffee or glass of wine, if you if you do those sorts of things.

99
00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're still making contact. So we still get to get our silly on we still get to do some gossiping and we get to play because this contact is so important. Right. Cabin Fever, like it's a real thing.

100
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm just throwing it out there. Zoom is a really cool place. The reason why I like it. It's not the only one, but I like it because

101
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I like I'm used to the platform. It's really easy to sign in. For me, it's easy to send a quick email and I love, I love that there's this little filter. So I kind of like the features I can change my background, I can

102
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this shared whiteboard that I can write things. So there's features that I like about it. I'll show you one of them. So right here, see right here. I can text and I can say hi.

103
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can share a little things I can share a poster, like let's say I want to talk to my girlfriend's about something fun.

104
00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: going on politically, I might throw it up here and share the screen and be goofy or I could share some pictures right here.

105
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I can show pictures of my baby right here. Y'all can be looking at it.

106
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, you see, you can be happening while I'm talking don't. It's kind of fun. Okay.

107
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, and you think you and I were touching on it a little bit. You've been getting some information in the group setting. Have you instituted any changes based on some of that information.

108
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:35.670
Ateeq Dean: No, I have like me like I haven't really after we talked about in the meeting night left it there. Okay. Yeah. About like the NA.

109
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.060
Ateeq Dean: And all that I'm more like

110
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.450
Ateeq Dean: Focused into what we have here.

111
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:50.850
Ateeq Dean: I like this. Yeah, but, um, I mean for the future. Maybe I'll check into it, you know.

112
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Another piece of that discussion has been around using safety.

113
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether it's and precaution, not only for your immediate family, but for the larger community. How are you to sort of navigating that discussion visiting family members that maybe have

114
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Some vulnerable attributes like they're 70 years old or 18 years old or maybe

115
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're the one going out into the community. What's the dynamics between you two are you an alignment with safety question. Are you two on the same page.

116
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.320
Ateeq Dean: I'm not really

117
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so that's why I'm asking because this is typically I'm, what I'm noticing is people's independent liberties and rights to I get to

118
00:14:43.020 --> 00:15:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: have free will. I get to be my own person. I get to decide what's okay with me. It's starting to shift a little bit because now it's, Will, what is my right to safety, but also how does it impact a greater community. And so it's really on people's minds a lot

119
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.750
Ateeq Dean: It is

120
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we're I'm Kara. And where is it showing up because you said yeah there. There's a little bit of dissonance in here are not on the same page, where is it show up.

121
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:19.860
Ateeq Dean: So he'll grow whose parents live five minutes away. Okay, um, his parents. They live with.

122
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:36.900
Ateeq Dean: His sister and her boyfriend and they're not the most iconic of people. Okay. And they don't really keep the house up I will either like when you walk in, there's kind of an older it's dark. It's dirty and his parents.

123
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.730
Ateeq Dean: His parents

124
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.320
Ateeq Dean: Um,

125
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.340
Ateeq Dean: So she has a lot of like

126
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.760
Ateeq Dean: Health issues and stuff, whatever, and

127
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.850
Ateeq Dean: I just when he goes up there. I just worry about that, like him.

128
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:10.650
Ateeq Dean: Touching stuff and just like being there when he comes home. I just want him to like wash his face and wash your hands and I try not to take it too far. I don't tell them to change clothes and stuff, but I wish he would

129
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:17.940
Ateeq Dean: Yes, I know his, his sister. Still going out she's doing this stuff and I know she's not coming home and watching her hands and

130
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:28.980
Ateeq Dean: In not showering frequently and I just know she's not keeping up the way she should be and that makes me nervous for him and nervous for his parents and it just yeah yeah

131
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to see if I have a really convenient little picture to show you here. I don't know. A teak if I don't think I showed it because you have Dr. Solomon And Not Dr Arielle on this particular image.

132
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if I can find it might be in a different folder. This one might

133
00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.420
give you sort of a visual understanding of how quickly this can already

134
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.570
Okay, I got outlook commentary manager.

135
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.070
Okay.

136
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.490
Open now I

137
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.540
Really like this one I want to find it for you guys.

138
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so good.

139
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I just got to be patient. And then we get there. Okay, so

140
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so this is the visual. Okay, this one a teak

141
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at this. So, this is basically presented, Dr. And another group shared this and this is basically

142
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say this is you here at the top. This is now this is the person right now and you're not let's say

143
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There's three different versions of this story. The first version is you really don't make any changes at all. You continue about your life, you go about your day.

144
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not really taking a lot of precautions within five within. Let's see, with it. Oh, no. I see what I think they're doing this within five days you will have infected 2.5 people within 30 you will have infected.

145
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: 406 people

146
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't make a change. Now if you make about a 50% change. Let's say you stay home maybe two weeks. Let's say you don't allow

147
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The virus which CDC is saying on plastic and metal will sit for as much as three days and on cardboard 24 hours. Let's say that you

148
00:18:52.140 --> 00:19:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Create cautions and safety around that and you socially isolate for two weeks. You will only be infecting 30 people. Yeah.

149
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you pull back even further and you do less exposure at about 75% let's say you isolate for about three weeks.

150
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've only infected, about half a person, not even a whole person and the long term effect of that.

151
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have only over a month period affected 2.5 people. So by creating some safety elements and

152
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Limiting significantly the people that you may contact with and that includes your family. Yeah, you could be minimizing you went from just you affecting 406 people because you can be a carrier for as much as like 14 days and you won't even know that you

153
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.590
Ateeq Dean: Didn't yeah

154
00:19:46.770 --> 00:20:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um, if you make a change, as you know what a meaningful one you could be reducing it for 406 people that you're impacting down to maybe 2.5 that's a massive difference. Yeah, it's huge.

155
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And the changes that can be made. Let's talk about some of these pieces here. I can't control what your mother does. I can't control what your sister does. Nobody can right but we can control things like that. So I'm going to play it out.

156
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And these are just one person's version doesn't mean it's right, doesn't mean it's wrong. It's a version. Okay, so let's say I decide

157
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I in the best interest of my parents because of their age.

158
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they have a history of respiratory of vulnerability of your immune system has been compromised in the past. And because I want to do this chart. I want to not expose my family to me.

159
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to expose them to me because I work around, I am going out and I'm going to work every day. So I'm exposing myself to all of these, these potential. So I'm not gonna bring myself over to my family's house.

160
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only am I going to do that after three weeks I do go visit them and what I do is I have a change of clothes, everything comes off, especially my shoes. They stay outside their house.

161
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And I go in the house I wash my hands and I'm wearing a mask. I don't have them I don't kiss them. I say, oh, I miss you. I want to throw my arms around your budget, but I'm going to be really careful. Hey guys what's up. I talked with them.

162
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And then everything that was in that house goes in a bag. I put my clothes on and I go back with the shoes that never went into the family's house and I go back to this on where you are now.

163
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And the same thing, those shoes. Don't go in the house. So there's this constant mindfulness at the door to door, nothing that was out there comes in.

164
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: A mindfulness around handwashing a mindfulness of not putting those hands in our mouth and our eyes and our nose any of our other offices and there is

165
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This consciousness about the mask is not only for you to not get something, but it's also to not be spreading and it also can be a psychological relief because

166
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It might feel good on an emotional, psychological level to be doing everything that you can like I did everything I could

167
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So we go out and it feels good. Hey, I already know I'm doing everything I can.

168
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm already socially isolating I'm not tracking things in from my workplace bringing it into the home where the dog can like the floor and then the dog kisses me and I kiss my wife and my day. So

169
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It can happen right, boo, boo, boo, just like that, because it's carried in the droplets. So the droplets of course gravity pulls it down and then it's on the floor. We track it possibly in to the home. Now, that's a really all that sort of concern side, I want to balance it out.

170
00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: With the opposite, which is let's also say that there is an infection pressure that's not a term I ever used but Dr up real mentioned it.

171
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think of it as a viral load, which means if someone gives if someone, let's say, standing here and I sneeze directly into their face. That would be a heavy

172
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Infection pressure that would be a high viral load of right. But if instead they're six feet away and I sneeze and most of those droplets basically land down due to gravity and they had before.

173
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But one tiny molecule of it hits this lady's mass. Well, that's not enough event infection pressure

174
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: For me to become a carrier. Do you see it. It kind of has to be enough. It's not a molecule in a wham slam you so I liked hearing that. So it's unconscious and

175
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I also know it has to be enough of it of the virus of the viral load to have an impact. So it's a both

176
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm being careful and I don't have to be paranoid, right, because it does need to be a lot of the viral up pressure at you right there. Okay. It was both. You see how they both kind of balanced each other a little bit

177
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you so a teak I wanted to ask you, when Cara was talking about sister goes out. We don't know what she's doing. She's not being careful not because she has her own independence.

178
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not as mindful of her own parents and that will have an impact on you possibly and then on your family, the family. I'm talking to right now. Yes. So this is the part that I wonder, um,

179
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts about this, this idea of your shoes, your clothes on mask gloves, what comes up for you around your beliefs.

180
00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:14.790
Ateeq Dean: I I use it, but I feel like the type of mouth can be using. It's not the end nine five type of mass. So I feel like it's only going to prevent me from getting somebody else sick but me wearing it is to really not help going to help me out really

181
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's think about that, if we know that it's being transported through aerosol which means through the air, and if a real right in a fast way and effective way is in the liquid and someone sneezes, coughs

182
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be protecting you a little

183
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can help you psychologically and it could help. Watch this. Look, look at the impact you could have

184
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: On Kara thinking you are doing everything you can on your family sending a message that it matters.

185
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are being cautious because look at the message it sends maybe I need to consider what I am doing what I'm not doing maybe sister gets to see you.

186
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Being careful. It's not just what we're. This is why this weird time in this planet's life is where we're taking. It's not just what I'm doing. For me, it's affecting sending a message outward

187
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So indeed, it might not be the ideal mask. But what I'm hearing from physicians, is that bandana even or tea. What are they up to handkerchiefs that are really a dense. We've are effective, something is better.

188
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:46.170
Ateeq Dean: Than I do where I have to hang right here. I have a couple in the car. I have masks and stuff that I go out with and I come back I do wear it. But from what I heard. Rumor wise work and everything that you know they say that it's not gonna, it's not the end.

189
00:26:47.220 --> 00:27:06.390
Ateeq Dean: That's going to protect us. Yes, this is another thing about the co workers telling him all this stuff and he takes it as gospel like he hears all these rumors from work and he

190
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:20.100
Ateeq Dean: Right away, he believes that like he thought they were going to clear out the the floor that they cleared out for coronavirus cases to come in and I had to talk to him and be like, that wouldn't make sense for them to bring

191
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:35.550
Ateeq Dean: severe enough coronavirus cases to a nursing home when you guys don't have ventilators, you're not even properly staffed at the best of times, I thought, and everybody engine is all his coworkers are saying, Oh, they're going to bring

192
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:42.180
Ateeq Dean: rotavirus cases here, they're going to do this, this isn't working, you have to do this like these people don't know anything.

193
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So I had to shut down my computer. Recently, but I had the CDC website up and um

194
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.500
Ateeq Dean: I think

195
00:27:52.530 --> 00:28:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That really sticking with a credible resource. So what you just mentioned was maybe not a very credible source is the water cooler gossip.

196
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Area that that's not always the most credible and it can get our emotions kind of reeling. So if we say I'll limit I'll limit the exposure that I have to maybe a half hour a day I will go in, I will get my updated information and I will stand back and turn it off.

197
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Limiting it

198
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:24.960
Ateeq Dean: That we go

199
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: In and we say, I'm getting my information from a credible source. And I would say that the CDC is a good place to get it.

200
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.130
Ateeq Dean: I'm gonna pull it up again. I gotta read pull all this stuff up.

201
00:28:49.980 --> 00:29:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Either we can just look at it together here CDC, we've got a health such a great little outline, should you get tested caring for seven daily life and coping healthcare professionals and we really just want some basics here. Ah, OK. Got it. Share

202
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's coming up for you. A team around this invitation to limit the credibility right to limit our intake of information from credible sources.

203
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it make you think about you. Do you feel sort of the sense of defensive list like I'm already doing it or

204
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:41.040
Ateeq Dean: No, no. Well, if I was feeling sick or something. Yeah, I would know to, you know, not even I would just tell them, hey, I'm not feeling good, but they still ask us to come in and get our camps read

205
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.030
Ateeq Dean: Ya know, that's what I tell them to to come in and get your temperature

206
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But that might be too late, is what my point is that we can be carrying it for

207
00:29:51.210 --> 00:30:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: 40 days and not know, those are the most risky people because we won't stay home. We won't have a temperature, yet I will have it and be spreading it

208
00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.780
Ateeq Dean: And then when you find out it's too late.

209
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Too late. I've already infected.

210
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. In 30 days 406 people those 406 people have infected 406 people and those 460 will have affected for us.

211
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if no one was taking progression. So the best way doesn't just read it. How do we protect ourselves. This will come from going to get will just come from the Center for Disease Control, not from not from the news from

212
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The disease control and prevention. There's no vaccine.

213
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Not that they're working on it. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person between people who are in close contact

214
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: To one another. Within six feet. So we don't want to kiss him on the cheek. We don't want to, because what I know you want to maybe hug or kiss.

215
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.740
Something

216
00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, family, but we can't do it. Not right now. Yeah.

217
00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:58.620
I mean,

218
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm through respiratory droplets respiratory droplets. I told you about the liquid

219
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's in our breath in our cough in our sneeze. It's in our breath. We have respite. We have a drops of water in our breath.

220
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Droplets can land or noses of other people who are nearby.

221
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And it can be inhaled in the lungs. So you're telling me that that that mask won't work. I think it's going to help a little bit, isn't it, it's going to prevent the pink droplets from getting through. Why wouldn't we do what we can.

222
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:32.640
Do

223
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.110
Ateeq Dean: You

224
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Wash your hands with soap and water. The second that you hit the door and I, personally, I try to limit my hands actually touching the door. Use my elbows back of my hand, want to limit it, so I don't accidentally put that in my mouth.

225
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to wash my hand soap and water is amazing. I want to throw those hands so the the

226
00:31:52.170 --> 00:32:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The first layer of the skin can slough off so I'm washing it down the drain and it's gone. I want to do it for about 20 seconds, you can use the hand sanitizer. You want to avoid putting your hands in your nose in your mouth.

227
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:13.380
Yeah.

228
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see,

229
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.560
Ateeq Dean: We can do

230
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's nothing. There's a lot of different opinion about that one.

231
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um, let me ask you something. How much is this

232
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of conflict between the two.

233
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:38.550
Ateeq Dean: And the beginning there was a little bit more complex. I was a

234
00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:47.580
Ateeq Dean: Right.

235
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.440
Ateeq Dean: I don't know. He was really defensive about everything.

236
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.340
Ateeq Dean: You just thought this was about to be done to the world.

237
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But how do you get, how do you be defensive

238
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And also think it's the end of the world. How do you do both of those.

239
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:23.460
Ateeq Dean: I just, I didn't realize I was snapping at Kara. I personally never a lot, but I didn't. I didn't know I was doing that I was stuck in my own thoughts about all this and it was affecting me negatively. And every time to ask me something or, you know, just talk to me. I would snap at her, but

240
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you already said to her, what your fear is around this guardi really be under and Karen you really get that you understand his fear. He's with you and just he know yours.

241
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.850
Ateeq Dean: I don't know. I don't know if I know. Okay.

242
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a weird time for all of us. Isn't it in our lifetime. This might be one of the ones where we're really at one point during the day, no matter what religion, no matter what you're where you are.

243
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they have the same thought all of us, all of us humans. What if I get the virus. What if my level and gets it. Isn't that amazing so we can look at it as a moment when the global concerns are either unified or we can say everyone

244
00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I think looking at it from a more sort of spiritual perspective and saying, this is an

245
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.480
Ateeq Dean: Opportunity for us.

246
00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: On the same

247
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.500
Ateeq Dean: Got a bottle made it for us.

248
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I call that again. She can't quite get comfortable in. She

249
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:39.840
Ateeq Dean: does matter.

250
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So Cara um you saying you don't even know how you feel sometimes. Yeah.

251
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.510
Ateeq Dean: I mean, I don't think I have the same kind of fear around this, that he does.

252
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.930
Ateeq Dean: I know it's really serious but

253
00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:01.200
Um, I guess we just don't know anybody affected by it. So I'm not like

254
00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.670
Ateeq Dean: Really that scared about it.

255
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:12.930
Ateeq Dean: I just, I still do everything my normal. I mean, I don't really go anywhere. Besides off but

256
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: See that is different.

257
00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.400
Ateeq Dean: Than what we were talking

258
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You were really specific about sisters going out boyfriends going out over

259
00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:34.770
Ateeq Dean: Him in particular. Yeah. Like, because I for me. I don't want anywhere. So I'm not scared for me to do anything but just him to like

260
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:54.090
Ateeq Dean: About the like the shoes I he'll put his head. He takes his shoes off when he comes in the house and he leaves them here like at the front door on the inside, but then he'll get dressed for work at night and then he'll put his shoes on and he'll walk around the house I

261
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.580
Ateeq Dean: Have you taken off the shoes.

262
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:04.680
Ateeq Dean: On and walk everywhere. Walk on the carpet walk on the floor. I just mock this and I don't mean to

263
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

264
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so you guys, do you want to come up with some little, little tricks so that we can remember because it's actually hard to remember, isn't it.

265
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So instead, those shoes are in a bag and it's like a let's you guys have. I have Publix out here. So I say public back. It's like a spouse or whatever you guys use. Yeah. So you just go like this.

266
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Now guess what you'll have time to remember. You'll take in, you'll go you'll be untiring it and you'll go, oh, wait a minute, and you'll look down at your flip flops. You got some slides.

267
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll put those right there and you'll wear those around the house because it's the time it takes to untie that you'll remember. Oh, snap.

268
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it. In fact, I might even take this bag and put it outside, so I don't forget you see it, they're outside then. Oh.

269
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll remember easier because it's a really this routine and I'm the point person. I'm having a hard time with it.

270
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got like three pairs of shoes because one of them. I forgot. And I accidentally warm and I was like, oh no, those were my walk around outside. She's right. So I'm really good.

271
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to remember. Um,

272
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.360
Yes.

273
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you think what is something so simple as

274
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a bucket for it outside it stays in that those shoes stay out there, they only go to work, because look those shoes are out here out here out here out here. They don't come in here outside at work at the store out here out here. They don't come in here and when you come in you.

275
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: throw those clothes in in their own hamper they get washed alone. You take a shower and then you're back. And guess what, you don't, you're not bringing anything in that point you just walk straight into the shower. She's already started it, you're going, you see it. And now, guess what.

276
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've eliminated huge risk. Yeah.

277
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.100
Ateeq Dean: I do that every day when it come on I paid

278
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Happening here is that happening. Yeah. So it's really what would happen if this shoe piece was fixed. What if the only thing is the shoes, what if, what if, that's it. It

279
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that's an easy fix. As long as there's no pride attached to it. But if there's pride, then we're in a we're in a sticky wicket

280
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.280
Ateeq Dean: No, no, my shoes. There's no

281
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:32.760
Ateeq Dean: I

282
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:40.110
Ateeq Dean: Don't know, I probably give me another pair for the inside and then just that I were to work.

283
00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.490
Okay, well,

284
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:56.790
Ateeq Dean: He's taken his shoes off like his parents house when he goes over there. He really can't because sometimes there's like stuff on Lauren. You don't want to walk in.

285
00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.440
Ateeq Dean: And stuff.

286
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But he had if he had I'm

287
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:03.990
Really

288
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where it gets inconvenient.

289
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:08.250
Ateeq Dean: Yeah.

290
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have flip flops. I have three three pair. See what why can't he have some in a bag sitting in his car, he has a parish of old running shoes. It's going to pitch. Eventually, that's where you you stomp around in it takes is a very different consciousness.

291
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.460
Ateeq Dean: We're not only

292
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of the car, we are forced to slow down and be mindful. Yeah. It is a really different time in our life, we may never see this again. I don't know. Yes. No.

293
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.890
Ateeq Dean: Maybe they don't they don't

294
00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:40.890
Ateeq Dean: I don't know.

295
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:56.580
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, even, you know, like I do my parents house. Yes. And I know I shouldn't, deep down, and a lot of times I do go I don't spend very much time there.

296
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:04.560
Ateeq Dean: And I don't have any body or anything like that. My mom usually calls me she's really hungry. By the time she calls me my mom's diabetic.

297
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:13.620
Ateeq Dean: So I'll try to make something here run into her right away and I tell them. I love them and I'm out the door. You know, I try not to spend too much time there.

298
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:21.630
Ateeq Dean: You know, I used to take care of them back when I was living there. But now that I have the baby and everything and moved and all that.

299
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:30.570
Ateeq Dean: It just seems like because I have so much responsibility at the time taken care of my parents, my sister knows there and she doesn't want to pick up that

300
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:47.580
Ateeq Dean: She is doing her best. I'm happy that they are eating, but it's just like, it's not a mouth you know she'll wake up at like two o'clock and if she feels like it. She'll feed them, you know, and my mom, she she can really get around or anything like that.

301
00:40:48.960 --> 00:41:02.940
Ateeq Dean: Feel a tank. Yeah, I still feel like I have my baby. Take care. But I still have my mom to take care of. If I could not go then I would, you know, but I, I still like gold there to make sure that they bait and

302
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And and your sisters. I'm trying to remember hasn't been have some touring to do. She doesn't have the maturity that Kara, I think you've mentioned that there was maybe she needed to kind of grow up a little bit, maybe still

303
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's putting it nicely.

304
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so if there was maturity, then it's a conversation, then it's I have a newborn. I want to follow what my state my country is advising what the CDC is advising and I like to not visit here, but every three weeks. Can you take over the role of making sure she has three meals a day.

305
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe she'll step up.

306
00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Your character.

307
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.020
Ateeq Dean: You know, started two teenage

308
00:41:53.490 --> 00:42:05.010
Ateeq Dean: Boys, maybe two months when they brought her over there, one time and she started smoking, just like she was standing at the back door just standing at the door, smoking, so the smoke was still coming into the house.

309
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:13.530
Ateeq Dean: So she really does not care about anybody but herself. She knows she knew my baby was in the house, too. So we had to just pack up quickly and leave.

310
00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:14.700
Ateeq Dean: She doesn't care.

311
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:21.570
Ateeq Dean: He says something, she'll start a fight with him and she'll start a fight with her parents and be like, Why are you telling people you're hungry.

312
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.770
Ateeq Dean: She said she needs a lot a lot of therapy. She's a whole

313
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Team. Let's brainstorm. So like I said, the maturity may not be there and we're not going to bother with that arguing. So it could be down to huh

314
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Does my mother have the skill set, or just sister have the skill set to have a full

315
00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Three weeks worth of there's lasagna already made in there. There's already enchiladas in the freezer and she can take it out. You see it now. It's already made. And we just need to defrost it. Are you telling me no one in that house has the responsibility to pull that off, you know,

316
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:16.890
Ateeq Dean: Hey. Okay, so his we buy food for them. We go to the grocery store and we buy food for them, his sister has other sister goes to the grocery store. Why so for them it is gone with with both of us buying for their $400 worth of food in the house. Plenty of meals to make

317
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.020
Ateeq Dean: Within a week.

318
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:28.620
Ateeq Dean: And the parents are eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Well, the sister and her boyfriend eat the good food.

319
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:42.660
Ateeq Dean: It's just, it's, it's a completely messed up situation that everyone's trying their best to deal with, but it's she is not somebody that you can reasonably talk to and

320
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And no interest you to have no interest in having mom relocate

321
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: After she was your house.

322
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.680
Ateeq Dean: We would love to. We have a one bedroom house.

323
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah.

324
00:43:54.630 --> 00:44:01.290
Ateeq Dean: We have one bedroom. So even right now the baby sharing, which is fine because she sleeps. Next, yeah.

325
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:08.040
Ateeq Dean: Ideally, we would like to future find a three bedroom house we could bring his parents to stay with us too.

326
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:15.720
Ateeq Dean: And if his other sister to his middle sister has said before, like if she didn't live there.

327
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:23.700
Ateeq Dean: If his older sister didn't live there. She will move it to take care of the parents, but she is such a negative

328
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:37.140
Ateeq Dean: Personality. She pushes everyone away she's the reason that everybody moved out because of his culture of the children stay back and take care of parents, but she has pushed everybody out of there. She

329
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.650
Ateeq Dean: It's it's a homeless. Like, even when I was living there with her. She would steal my thing. She would

330
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:54.660
Ateeq Dean: Like we couldn't keep we had, we had a miniature fridge and his room because we can keep food in the refrigerator last year she at my birthday cake.

331
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.100
Ateeq Dean: It was having a birthday cake.

332
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you kidding me.

333
00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:02.100
Ateeq Dean: Know my birthday. I said, they can have a piece of the whole thing.

334
00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.870
Ateeq Dean: I was so mad. Do you eat a whole birthday cake.

335
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I got the picture.

336
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this idea

337
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Of community is just, it's really the buy in. But you guys are checked in. You guys have it you would do it if you could

338
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Time. It's just not right. It doesn't sound like. Okay. Okay. All right.

339
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:37.980
Ateeq Dean: I mean, I go in and out. I'm not hunting anybody communicating very much. I just say, here's your food. I love you guys so basically we have to go. There's no. Yeah. Do you

340
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it might just come down to shoes. Nearly two extra pairs of shoes. That's $23

341
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there's a pair of shoes. This bag is pops mom's pops house is set for that one, even if their slides. Yeah, going there you go. Do you drop it off. I love you. Love you leave them a little note little something and and then and

342
00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're out the door and then you're in the shoes that you're going to wear to work those shoes. Don't make their way into this home.

343
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a big difference. And you're wearing masks. Your, your wash wash wash wash those hands, but even that can have a profound impact and guess what it does, psychologically,

344
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Kara go and now knows. All right, when there's that dark dirty house. I know my husband is in there and he's not tracking it back in here.

345
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll see what that does, psychologically, it's like, oh, I don't have to keep thinking about that. I don't have to keep thinking about that part just changing two shoes.

346
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:45.330
Ateeq Dean: Would help a lot because I he is. I don't know. He has like a fear of being barefoot, whatever. But I walk around the house barefoot all day.

347
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:47.880
Ateeq Dean: Occur to meet our shoes.

348
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and

349
00:46:48.570 --> 00:47:06.660
Ateeq Dean: Then I'll have my my feet up on like the long part of the couch or I'm in the bed and then I bring the baby in there and she's laying down where my feet were at one time so that I'm thinking, am I different stuff that he's trapped in and then I'm going to leave my baby's head on it.

350
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe a change could be for you to you would join him in the inconvenience part we get a little slippers. So that would they then you're a little clean feet. Oh, in maybe feet.

351
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we could both be doing a shoe thing and you can laugh about and be like, you've got your summers off with yourselves on Me too, me too. And it could be light hearted and not this like only one person to

352
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.100
Ateeq Dean: Make a change

353
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I know exactly what you're saying. I've had to really change. I want to walk around barefoot to and I kind of having to remember to put put shoes on, you know, because I don't want to bring it in bed. That's all you know like

354
00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of

355
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:42.390
creeps me out.

356
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

357
00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I think as long as there's this openness about it you know we're all in this together.

358
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have

359
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All the answers. No one does.

360
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're balancing caution with mental health. I mean, we can't go crazy here. We've got to be able to stay light hearted. We've got to get through our day and enjoy.

361
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Your family. Enjoy. We are not get ourselves too wrapped up in it.

362
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Aside from that, and we're kind of at the top of the hour, but is there other things that are kind of

363
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.970
Ateeq Dean: I just wanted to ask you, I've been wanting to ask you. How's everything in

364
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:21.750
Ateeq Dean: Florida right now.

365
00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, I'm not a big news washer.

366
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:26.730
Um,

367
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I get my information from the CDC i i get concerned that news um they earn their living and they get audiences. Bye bye. You know, if it bleeds, it leads right so

368
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm very careful of every once in a while I'll walk by and I'll hear the news and I'll hear such and such me. I haven't heard anything about Florida. I only heard about New York and things like that so

369
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I was already the person I had already pulled my family in and they couldn't go anywhere. I've already been doing it for weeks. So

370
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: They think I'm a little cuckoo. But when they hear from another source about the shoes like they didn't believe it for me. But they heard it. Oh, physicians are saying

371
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:08.610
Ateeq Dean: With it now. Yeah.

372
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't have street cred, but I am simply getting some credibility. Thank goodness I'm so they're buying into my little stickies, you know, I'll bring something in from Costco and I want it to wait in the garage three days. It has a sticky that has a date.

373
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I wipe it down and I transferred to zip locks and yes they think I'm insane. I don't care if I keep everybody if I keep everybody healthy and happy.

374
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.930
Yes.

375
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's the logic. Right. It's this. I know eventually we're going to get it because it's we're all going to eventually probably get it. But if it means we get it when there are more respirators in the hospital.

376
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.780
Ateeq Dean: Yeah.

377
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: They have been right if I push it off a month or two months. And there's there there's there's more information out there. The longer I can push it away, the better. So that's kind of what I've been thinking

378
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot. Yeah.

379
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't control this. This is, this is, you know, we're. This is an imperfect situation we're doing what we can and we're reactive. We tend to we humans are reactive. We always in our state. Now, now we're going to do this social isolation or. Now we're going to have a curfew or whatever.

380
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: When we could be doing some things to prevent

381
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's all it's a different philosophy. I tend to come from the camp of prevention. And so, you know, I'm the one that's everybody's kind of cooped up in here, but all school. My kids are going to school online now everybody's soaking up all my bandwidth. I'm not thrilled with that.

382
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I was usually the only show going on here.

383
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But he's all like FaceTime, and I'm like, Hey, I saw I earn my living

384
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.220
Yeah.

385
00:50:51.960 --> 00:51:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was pretty cute but mental health is good. Um, lots of people are exercising their outside running and biking. I've never seen so many people outside exercising. I'm like ready

386
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: For that. So I'm telling my family. I'm like, What are you doing when they're running by and they'll say, I'm kind of move over to the email. I kind of move over. I'm like, yeah.

387
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.290
Ateeq Dean: Stay away. Yeah.

388
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And I walk around, I go to Costco with

389
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

390
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wearing a mask.

391
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:23.820
Ateeq Dean: When I go and type Walmart or something. I put my mask on. I do I wear it out. I don't

392
00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:33.600
Ateeq Dean: See, you know, I've worked. I've Where'd my ears hurt from wearing it for so long. Yeah. Yeah. Because if it falls on my ears all night. But you know what, that's fine. I'll deal with that. But I still wear it.

393
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:44.430
Ateeq Dean: I do it, just the rumors. I've heard of work all your way that mouse is not going to protect you and stuff, you know, I still wear it, but I do hear the rumors and stuff, you know,

394
00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a delicate balance. Yeah, no, it can't be so uncomfortable. So maybe being able to alternate between maybe a bandana that doesn't pull on the ears and then switching it with more high risk.

395
00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Patients or, you know, things like that. Just this is the balance. We have to keep our sanity to do. We just have to

396
00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, in what way has this situation brought you to closer

397
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.520
You know,

398
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:24.540
Ateeq Dean: You, yes. I mean, you know, uh,

399
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:30.570
Ateeq Dean: I think it's more open because I called him out about his

400
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.710
Ateeq Dean: Craziness, right.

401
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:47.790
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, and I hope around more around the house like all over could do my work stuff, but then when I come home. I know she does a lot here. I mean, you know, I've stayed. I will say one week and

402
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:55.140
Ateeq Dean: I stayed home before all this all this other stuff happen and I told her. Wow, I was going crazy that we've just been home.

403
00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:02.490
Ateeq Dean: And yeah, I started like nitpicking on little things here and she's like, You see what I go through

404
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:10.590
Ateeq Dean: So I started helping out more with the dishes helping out more about the baby pockets. He's always told me I would love if I could stay at home with her.

405
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:16.050
Ateeq Dean: He realizes what a saving grace, it is to go and talk to grown ups.

406
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Oh, man. We crave that

407
00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:27.840
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I didn't realize you know until you see because I was sick. We all have the stomach bug. Even the baby and I got it.

408
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:48.390
Ateeq Dean: After she got it. So he was having to do everything he was trying to do laundry and everything, and he doesn't ever do laundry. So that was interesting, and he was trying to do just the stuff I do every day and he finally got to see that it's not as easy as maybe I make it look

409
00:53:48.690 --> 00:54:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, no. But that's, but we don't know until we know and so we kind of laugh and say, now we get it when when when Carol says I've got to have adult conversation we you know she means it

410
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Baby, baby, all day. Yeah, baby. All right. Okay. So let's, um, you're going to be meeting with this these folks on the 20th. Let's set another time for us to meet

413
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:33.510

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I look. It's completely up to you know every other week at this point, you've got such consistent attendance, that it's it's not an issue for me if you have enough medication to get you to the search

Gwenevere Abriel: Now, and we'll stick with this. We got it. Is there anything else you kind of want to maybe for me to invite as a focus next time. Is there anything kind of need to zero in on or
