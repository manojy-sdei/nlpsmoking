00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's funny, I know.

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So this will take us very long. We just have to complete your bio psychosocial

7
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's just about getting some of your history is all it is.

8
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.940
Christina Badura: OK.

9
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:56.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can usually we can usually run through it. Within about 2025 minutes. I mean, it's really pretty simple. It's not a three hour ordeal, you know, okay.

10
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very good.

11
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.210
Christina Badura: I forgot all about it.

12
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.680
Christina Badura: And I have my baby. I'm like, crap. I almost had to reschedule. And what know just let her do it now.

13
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.500
Christina Badura: So she's eating lunch.

14
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.860
Oh,

15
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.510
Christina Badura: Older

16
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.200
Right to your

17
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay. I was like, Wait, I thought your five months pregnant right

18
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.170
Yeah.

19
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.400
Yeah, I think.

20
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We got time.

21
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

22
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: First question is what brings you to bright heart.

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.730
Christina Badura: I'm

24
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.950
Christina Badura: The Suboxone

25
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.150
Christina Badura: Cuz my group closed. I think you know that I don't really know how to answer that because I had to switch over, because our group shut down didn't have a doctor anymore.

26
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As your kind of recruit with Dr groups.

27
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay.

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so the next question some of the questions you'll look at me crazy. I'm telling you.

29
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But they're just questions that are on the bio site so

30
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. The second question is,

31
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not here for pain right for pain management.

32
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.070
Christina Badura: No.

33
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:31.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So the third question is your substance abuse history just if you can just run through and give you a summary of your history age of first us started with the age of first use and what it was and how it progressed to the point of recovery for you.

34
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:45.960
Christina Badura: Okay. Um, when I was 16 I tried myth, a few times, you know, not a lot, but somebody begged me to do it. And I finally did it with them.

35
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.150
Christina Badura: And then

36
00:02:49.740 --> 00:03:03.450
Christina Badura: I ended up getting pregnant with my first daughter when I was 17 so I quit doing that. And then I'd stayed clean until I had my son, which was two years after that, I think I was 20

37
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.720
Christina Badura: And then right after I had him. I got like postpartum. I think that's what you call it, and I started getting anxiety really bad.

38
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.790
Christina Badura: So then they prescribed me

39
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.340
Christina Badura: Xanax I'd never took and pills before

40
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.610
Christina Badura: And then so that got me started on pills, a little bit. I took them a little bit and then I moved away and I'd stayed clean for

41
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:36.240
Christina Badura: Like four years or something. And then I started taking pain pills and doing math a little bit with it and and then that got me into heroin, you know, try and heroin, a few times.

42
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.510
Christina Badura: And then that's when I gave my kids to my mom and started

43
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:52.470
Christina Badura: Using meth a lot more and pills hadn't used heroin for a while like for a few years. I was just using method pills and stuff.

44
00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.120
Christina Badura: And then, then that got me into doing heroin and using needles.

45
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how long do you have sober.

46
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.000
Christina Badura: Sober I have this time.

47
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.870
Christina Badura: I have three years in July.

48
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome.

49
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do

50
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have left it.

51
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:28.950
Christina Badura: Had five years and then I relapse for a year and a half or something and then now I have three years.

52
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was the precipitating event around your relapse.

53
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.800
Christina Badura: Um,

54
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:51.510
Christina Badura: I couldn't see my kids, my cousin, my mom died. So my cousin ended up getting my kids and he wouldn't let me see him, you know, and I was like, well, why would I stay clean

55
00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:00.990
Christina Badura: If I can't see my kids I tried for years and he wouldn't let me and then then I thought I could get off a Suboxone so I wean myself off.

56
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.690
Christina Badura: Stop taking it. And then I thought, okay, I'll just use a little bit, you know, because I don't have my kids. I mean, there's no reason to stay clean

57
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.200
Christina Badura: I don't get to see him. So then I started using a little bit and that ended up spiraling out of control where I just went into like the worst using episode.

58
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:32.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes sense. Very much so. You know sometimes when I asked somebody what their what the event was that caused the relapse, you know, to know what it was what really caused the spiral.

59
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:47.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, that's huge. I mean, that's how we stopped spirals from happening again. Right, we become educated we we learned about our process. And so I want to commend you on knowing what you know, was the precipitating event around that.

60
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so how any past substance abuse treatment.

61
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.160
Christina Badura: Um, no. Just the Suboxone and I went to a detox place this last time.

62
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.950
Christina Badura: Right before I got pregnant with the two year old.

63
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.080
Christina Badura: Okay, I went there for like four days and I left and then I went to Suboxone group right away.

64
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.150
So that's an even

65
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you've been there with with them sense

66
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.210
Yeah.

67
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

68
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.640

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past self harm.

77
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.480
Christina Badura: No.

78
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so the next piece of it is just getting information about your family unit when you were growing up.

Yeah.

88
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's really kind of puts you into that victim category with your mom, you know,

89
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.060
Christina Badura: Yeah.

90
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As a kid,

91
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have one sibling.

92
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.220
Christina Badura: Yeah.

93
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.650

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. And you and your mom.

98
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:39.750
Christina Badura: She passed away. We were very, very close until she got my kids and I was using

99
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then

100
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.140
Christina Badura: We stopped talking, I would try to go over there and see the kids and she told me to leave all the time. So,

101
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:53.280
Christina Badura: No, I ended up pretty much kind of hating her for what I blamed her what she put me through

102
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So Katie, did you

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which

108
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:22.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I could go in to all that banter. You know what I mean. Because that's exactly what the diseases. Is it just kind of wipes out everything good, you know, has that one job.

109
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah okay so

110
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about going a little bit further back. How was school for you.

111
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you graduate. Did you struggle in school.

112
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Were you bullied.

113
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you go to college. Tell me a little bit about your schooling history.

114
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.780
Christina Badura: Okay. Um, it wasn't bullied.

115
00:09:50.400 --> 00:10:04.440
Christina Badura: I didn't graduate until I was pregnant with my two year old. I got to my 11th grade and I had my daughter was pregnant with my son and I was in my 12th grade only had two classes left. I couldn't do it anymore. So I dropped out.

116
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.150
Christina Badura: But I struggled

117
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.680
Christina Badura: You know I struggled with math and English. It was hard for me.

118
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.040

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:31.620
Christina Badura: I was a CNA before. So I was thinking like either nursing, but now I'm just thinking maybe go to the prison and do something to get a retirement and get something with retirement.

121
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable.

122
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.020

Christina Badura: Um, I don't have any felonies or any like convictions or anything. I don't know how you say it. I was I've gotten in trouble.

133
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With

134
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.230
Christina Badura: I got caught with pills one time.

135
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.030
Christina Badura: But then they ended up dropping it because they went to the Suboxone group.

136
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:36.360
Christina Badura: I went to jail twice. I don't remember all the first time I went to jail. My boyfriend got his house got raided it took me gel and then

137
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:50.280
Christina Badura: I didn't get charged with anything, you know, because he was the one doing selling the drugs and stuff. So they dropped all that. Then I got caught with morphine and I went to the Suboxone group got clean for the five years. So they dropped that. So that's it.

138
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:51.810
Christina Badura: Okay.

139
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.960

144
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:22.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Working with bright heart. Is there anything particular that you would like to work on that you would like to be able to touch base on while you're working with bright heart.

145

Christina Badura: Well, I don't know.

146
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.840
Christina Badura: I don't know.

147
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As food for thought. Because you have been working, you know, with Tony for a really long time. And so there's that piece of it that you've already got this long history of of awesome treatment. So you know what I mean, it's like

148
00:12:51.600 --> 00:13:06.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If I can think of anything that that you would like to touch base on or you would like to work on that you haven't gotten the information for yet, just let me know and I will bring it to the table.

149
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we can work on it through a group, you know, totally fine.

150
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love bringing different things in. I love for for people to tell me what it is that they, you know, would like to explore and for me to be able to gather the information and bring it into group for me is just fun. I just like doing stuff like that so

151
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.730
Christina Badura: I know you do a really good job.

152
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really good job. Thank you. I enjoy working with you guys I you know I I am in a lot of different groups. And I just, I love my group.

153
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:51.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just think that you guys you know are really close knit and I love the way that you guys have been together for a long time and that, you know, to me, that's important because that's what recovery is all about, you know,

154
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.470
Christina Badura: Yeah, I heard the other groups are like that. They're way different than ours.

155
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:13.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, there are different for several different reasons. Number one, you don't have. I'm not gonna say any of the other providers are not awesome, but I love working with Dr groves, she has this connection with all of you know all of you guys that is pretty amazing, you know,

156
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.780
Christina Badura: Even on a young girl.

157
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that's a big piece of why you know the group you guys is group is the way that it is and the connection amongst yourselves. You know what I mean is huge. It's like you guys came as a unit, you know, I mean, it wasn't like one because

158
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, Ben, brothers, they gave at once.

159
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you know that

160
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.370
Christina Badura: Yeah.

161
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:45.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's pretty amazing. So, and let's see, we're done with your BIOS like that was the last question.

162
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, pretty simple Hongzhi would I be

163
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.250
Here.

164
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just

165
00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:03.930
Christina Badura: There's, I don't know how to really say it or if this is something that I can work on I you know I want to work on.

166
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.720
Christina Badura: Getting my daughter to trust me. She's in her room right next door to mine right now. And I know she can hear me, but

167
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:28.650
Christina Badura: No, I want her to learn how to trust me again. We Don't Talk Anymore and she doesn't trust me, which I understand. She doesn't want to be heard and she doesn't want to go through that. I don't know how I can work on that. I know we need counseling but

168
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:36.060
Christina Badura: Maybe someday. I don't know if we could work on that maybe give me advice someday what to do. I don't know.

169
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She is a teenager.

170
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's definitely going to take time, but what I know I have a 16 year old and what I know is that

171
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They want to be validated and they want to be heard.

172
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they want to see that consistency that you've brought to the table, the past three years, you know, they want to see that continue, you know,

173
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:17.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I think that knowing her knowing that you had five years sober already. It's she's probably still insecure because you haven't been over that five years yet.

174
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.210
Christina Badura: So yeah, I mean, think about that.

175
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:35.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I think that once you, you know, the longer that you stay sober and the longer that you're doing the deal and you're doing you get comfortable in this life, you know, the trust can be rebuilt, but it takes you know it takes time, you know. Yeah.

176
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's my two cents.

177
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.020
Christina Badura: Okay, thank

178
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.400
Christina Badura: You. That's right. I didn't think about that. She probably does. Think about that.

179
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.130
Christina Badura: Yes, I have a long time clean before

180
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and so it's easy for them to

181
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be guarded and to think that they can't talk or that they're not being heard.

182
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what I've learned through my personal experience with my own kids is that

183
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there's always their perception of what happened in our perception of what happened.

184
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what we were what we kind of discussed a second group is dialectical thinking. So knowing that there are more truths to the situation than just ours.

185
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:34.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's her truth. And then there's your truth doesn't mean that your truth is wrong, doesn't mean that her truth is wrong. It just means that using you guys both see this, the situation from a different pair of glasses, you know,

186
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:45.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and just being open to allowing her to be able to communicate her side of things without defenses up with understanding and just really

187
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Validating her feelings, you know, letting her know you hear her.

188
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:53.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

189
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.300
Yeah.

190
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.920
Christina Badura: So,

191
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:03.810
Christina Badura: She won't talk about it with me at all. She says it's in the past, but so maybe one day she'll talk about it.

192
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One day,

193
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they definitely

194
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:13.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, when it comes, it comes so you know it's about when you're

195
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.460
Christina Badura: Ready.

196
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be ready right

197
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, oh yeah, this is what she's

198
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Talking about

199
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:25.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Never know what new form, it's going to come. But you know when it starts to flow in it. Hopefully,

200
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.420
Christina Badura: Okay.

201
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So just remember that it could come in old

202
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.160
Christina Badura: Okay.

203
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, I know that, you know, they definitely kids don't come with handbooks and it is tough.

204
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, raising teenagers, especially when they're trying to figure out who they are and trying to find their own identity, trying to make sense, you know, from the life that they lived trying to, you know, figure out feelings. Well,

205
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's definitely a

206
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hard thing girls and boys to to figure out

207
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that would be what my suggestion would be, you know,

208
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:20.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Boundaries treating her with kindness, you know, and understanding but not being a pushover mom and trying to you know make up for the the past because that can never happen. But what happens is that we try to overcompensate

209
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And kids say, wow, okay. So if I just keep bringing up these things from the past, and I'm going to get what I want. So you want to keep that piece at bay and just set boundaries in a loving manner.

210
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and we, you know, when she brings it up if she brings it up, you know, if something comes out just owning it and saying, You're right, you're right.

211
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I hear you. I know that I heard you. You're right.

212
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, kind of take the argument out of the sale.

213
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:53.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

214
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.020
Yeah.

215
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's kind of take it, keeping yourself off the defensive and it kind of throws the other person off a little bit too because they're ready for that fight. You know what I mean. And when

216
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:23.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You. Yeah. When you own the behavior and you just say, You know, you're absolutely right. I did do that. You're right. You know, I wasn't that great of a you know a mom and I wasn't present for you and I'm really, really sorry for that.

217
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And then all of a sudden

218
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.650
Christina Badura: Did it disconnect on your end,

219
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you went to your name and then came right back.

220
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.330
Oh,

221
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, those are the

222
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.460
tips that I can

223
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, give you

224
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I know

225
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

226
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.960
Christina Badura: All right, go.

227
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:59.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Can I just tell you, I think that you are awesome and you did a great job and I love when you're in group and what you share, you know, you can tell them that you know

228
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's true. It's truth and from the heart.

229
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.100
Christina Badura: Yeah, thank you so much.

230
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're welcome. Okay, so go spend time with your baby and I will see you in group.

231
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.500
Christina Badura: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow morning. Oh wait, no.

232
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.610
Christina Badura: Idea after tomorrow.

233
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Day after tomorrow.

234
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

235
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.110
Christina Badura: Right. Have a good day.

236
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You too.

237
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:21.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bye bye.
