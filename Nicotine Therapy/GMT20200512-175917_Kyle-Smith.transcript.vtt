Kyle Smith: She had six or more symptoms.

128
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:20.760
Kyle Smith: Putting her in this severe category under DSM five criteria for diagnosis of opiate use disorder. So that would be opiate use disorder severe and then the clinical opiate withdrawal scale.

129
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.390
Kyle Smith: She scored

130
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.120

136
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.910
Kyle Smith: I educated her on the

137
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.460
Kyle Smith: Physiologic nature of dependency.

138
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.180
Kyle Smith: We discussed how her continued use of opiates over the years, led to

139
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:02.790
Kyle Smith: an opiate dependency because of regulation of opiate receptors and how when those receptors are not filled

140
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.840
Kyle Smith: Patients like herself go into withdrawal.

141
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:15.300
Kyle Smith: I do think she meets the criteria for opiate dependency and we discussed the options for treatment.

142
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:25.500
Kyle Smith: Including methadone treatments abstinence treatments 12 step treatments. She was aware of these and knew that. Those were his were also open to her. I did.

143
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:45.900
Kyle Smith: Go and explain at length medication assisted treatment or MIT and the use of buprenorphine and counseling to help improve patients overall quality of life as well as approving mortality and

144
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.030
Kyle Smith: And

145
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:55.920
Kyle Smith: Went over briefly the literature and evidence behind MIT.

146
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:19.320
Kyle Smith: I then went and discussed at length how beep an orphan works to

147
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.630
Kyle Smith: Reduce withdrawal and cravings.

148
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:35.910
Kyle Smith: And at that our primary goal and the induction phase was to get people like yourself to feel better physically who are in withdrawal.

149
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:43.650
Kyle Smith: And that buprenorphine does a good job at reducing withdrawal symptoms.

150
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.010
Kyle Smith: I

151
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.620
Kyle Smith: Discuss with her at length, how to take up an orphan films.

152
00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:00.390

153
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:07.710
Kyle Smith: I discussed with her side effects of buprenorphine including constipation, headache, nausea,

154
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.370
Kyle Smith: We discussed precipitated withdrawal at length.

155
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.000
Kyle Smith: I counseled her against the use of lenses.

156
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:31.170
Kyle Smith: Due to the risk of overdose and cardio respiratory arrest the risks of alcohol and potential liver damage I recommended that she not take other opiates or other illegal drugs while she's taken

157
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.060
Kyle Smith: buprenorphine.

158
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.170

160
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:41.730

161
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.610
Kyle Smith: Developing risk mitigation strategies and

162
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:57.300
Kyle Smith: And relapse prevention strategies are important for overall well being and treatment progress.

164
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.350
