00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This is supposed to be.

2
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit like I owe you an apology.

3
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Was waiting, you know, waiting a few minutes, give this person a chance to show up and

4
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.770
Jay: Never do

5
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.150

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Well, I appreciate you meet with me a little earlier and plan.

8
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So remind me again when you get to meet with a specialist to have those that liver of yours and all things you looked at it.

9
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.980
Jay: In July,

10
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're on the on call list.

11
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.520
Jay: That's what they said. But

12
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.120
Jay: I just think they're not doing nothing through all this.

13
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: They kind of hedging their bets thinking that they'll open up in July.

14
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.990
Jay: Yeah, that's missing.

15
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. It's funny, I have like I have that in my mind to like somehow magically

16
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything's going to be better at July. I don't know why.

17
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not based on any facts.

18
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Random

19
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me. Um, what else is going on. I'm sleep eating kind of bring you up to speed.

20
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.870
Jay: Well, earlier I started growing up again real bad and made me sweat movie thing, but it didn't last

21
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.160
Jay: And

22
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.400
Jay: It happened to me once before this week, and I think it's whenever I don't eat breakfast.

23
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.150
Okay.

24
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.330
Jay: I'm in my stomach. I'm good.

25
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, that's a good thing to know.

26
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.580
Jay: When the only two things that have been doing for with those two days is I skipped breakfast.

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're looking at it closely and you might be onto something. And this might not be relevant for you because the the subtext is that in a tablet format.

28
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but it still has to go under the under the tongue or now.

29
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.310
Jay: Yeah, it still has to dissolve.

30
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, I noticed when I was in group, I think it was yesterday. Not everybody knew this.

31
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: About 1520 minutes before you're going to put it under your tongue that you not

32
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Smoke.

33
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.960
Jay: Cigarette not

34
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.830
Do not

35
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't eat. I think it's don't eat.

36
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's, I can't remember if it's don't drink, but I can tell you one thing for sure. It's definitely don't smoke and I'm trying to remember what it is about the constriction of the blood vessels. I think it's the construction of the blood vessels. That's the problem.

37
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.090
Jay: Before so right. Yeah.

38
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so, um,

39
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to check on the food thing that makes me concerned we just identified the foods, really important. Yeah. So, for sure, go with the this don't have a cigarette 1520 minutes beforehand because it does something about you're not absorbing the the medicine.

40
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Which Hello, like that's what this is all about. And I realized when I was listening to the clients. They're like, oh, I didn't know that. And

41
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's hard to do all these little reminders every single time.

42
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm glad I brought it up.

43
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.070
Jay: Yeah, now that I know.

44
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's when you do your problem solving is when you have that first cigarette.

45
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah i would i would definitely put delay in there because I think sort of, I think it is the constriction of the blood vessel that makes it difficult to absorb

46
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So you might not be getting all the medicine that you're supposed to

47
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right, let me get an open here.

48
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we've got

49
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Some nausea returning. It's not pervasive once last week. Once this morning.

50
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

51
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.050
Jay: Well, it wasn't that it was bubbling blabbing

52
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you hadn't eaten anything

53
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, so let's get that transcribed let's really have that in this record, making sure that we're continuing to rule out what is causing the nasza we're looking at eating being a problem like we gotta have food in the stomach here noticing a pattern with that.

54
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And how many hours of sleep. Are you getting

55
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.860
Jay: Or between six and eight.

56
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay that's doable that work for you.

57
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.450
Jay: It goes

58
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Your color today looks a bit pale, what is going on is that the video or is there something be feeling kind of crummy

59
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.370
Jay: Yeah, just since I threw up earlier on still trying to recover. I

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.670
Jay: Think both my stomach still kind of in

61
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.350
Jay: Okay.

62
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be, it is that part of that presentation of nausea.

63
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

64
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.960

Jay: Also, I got a ticket yesterday. My peeled saying its relation. I got a speeding ticket.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.490
Jay: I gotta go see him as soon as I'm done with you.

67
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.550

Gwenevere Abriel: driving fast. It's definitely fun that that would be a hard thing for me to change. I like driving fast I'm I follow a lot of rules, but not that one.

72
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead.

73
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:42.450
Jay: I know my mom go and pick up my medication. So she had a dose. So I had to drive across town to go get it. I was already in bed.

74
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

75
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.270
Jay: So I was just trying to get there. And I didn't realize I was doing

76
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Was doing 62.50 yeah that hurts.

77
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, my last excuse I was actually in New Mexico and

78
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This guy pulls out a whole a whole car full of kids just kids. And I don't know this car and

79
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This area like in a tiny little space that will go from all the way from 55 to like 45 and you won't know what's about to happen. The roads, the same to me this bunch of like tumbleweeds just looks all the same to me. So I can't, no friends I'm clueless.

80
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So a new car, and it's what July 4 we're going to go, you know, gonna go watch some fireworks and I get pulled over.

81
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I got out of it.

82
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This poor guy. He says, uh,

83
00:07:44.310 --> 00:08:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I said what happened. I'm totally serious cases we are speeding like a lot like like what you're like, you know, I mean like really like 100 and danger kind of thing, you know. And I'm like, Okay, I believe you. I'm like, I completely leave you, that definitely sounds like me.

84
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I, can I offer up what I think happened you know I'm trying to kind of explain it. He's like, you know, just disgusted with because everybody you know that they're done that every single person. They're just like waiting for a new story.

85
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't have any mine is not interesting.

86
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But it works. So I think it's the kids in the car, you know. So I said,

87
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a license, registration insurance, you know, so I'm flipping through and I have like five years of insurance cards.

88
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I said, Okay, so I'm reading it and I'm reading it. I'm like, Okay, this one says it's effective date doesn't say the expiration effective. Here's one.

89
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And then another and you can see me right I'm pulling them all out. I just keep them I don't take them out. I only stick them back in my little whatever thing.

90
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can. I mean, you know, and I said, Okay, I'm not finding the one you're looking for. I'm not kidding. Like, I can't find the one I think you really want

91
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also don't know it's not because it wasn't given to me and it just, you can see that I'm pretty good about holding on to them and maybe even though. And so I just kept like my mouth, I was just

92
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Finally, like, hold on a minute, and he must have checked something. I don't know. And he comes back and he's like, okay, you're going to have a warning and thank you. And he's like, You need to get rid of those old ones that just keeps the current

93
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I haven't changed the thing I still have a stack cuz I'm like, well that was two reinforcing it showed my credibility. I'm like, I'm gonna get rid of these is if I

94
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it shows that at least I have my old ones. So anyway, you've really got to pay attention to the speed sites out there. I'm not kidding.

95
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.390
Jay: I didn't think that they would violate my probation for it. I'm crazy.

96
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if like even saying a swear word in Publix going to get you locked up.

97
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.550
Jay: Sounds like it.

98
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to use your manners. Get those elbows off the table.

99
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.410
Right.

100
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not kidding around. Well, I'm glad they didn't take it in.

101
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It kind of a scary moment for you.

102
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.700
Jay: Well, yeah, because I had a bunch of weight on me and they smelled it

103
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:15.750
Jay: Yeah.

104
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.160
But I have my

105
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.570
Jay: Last

106
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Sentence.

107
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.060
Jay: So, can you hear me.

108
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can.

109
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:35.580
Jay: Yeah, they smoke my weed on me, but I didn't have more than bounce on me. So I pulled it out. I'll have to open the jar expecting him to smoothly and stuff.

110
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So interesting right

111
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There are about to pull you in for speeding.

112
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But not not for weed. That's interesting. Okay.

113
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The Times have changed.

114
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So I'm looking at this, a very long note.

115
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you you spent some time telling me stories, you know, the ones that you could remember

116
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and I was asking sort of how it is that you've come to this conclusion that you're a bad kid.

117
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.460
Jay: Yeah, let's do

118
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Smell you sound pretty confident

119
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's the case.

120
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.330
Jay: Maybe that wasn't as bad as I thought.

121
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you think had something to do with

122
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Do remember

123
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That maybe that's what got you the attention that you needed, you couldn't really get attention, any other way. Do you remember anything kind of like that.

124
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:46.950
Jay: Maybe

125
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you'd end up getting your dad's attention from far far away like somehow maybe then he would

126
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: He was you

127
00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.160
Jay: Know. Yeah, maybe.

128
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes we're even though we're little we're pretty bright, you know, we can figure out

129
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How to get the attention we need

130
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't work out real well, though, did it.

131
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So have you had nightmares.

132
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.560
Jay: Recently,

133
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:23.640
Yeah.

134
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.430
Jay: I have. I couldn't tell you

135
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.820
Jay: There's a couple times I've woke up swearing in the middle of the night. That's a telltale sign. I've had

136
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.830
Jay: A nightmare.

137
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.380
Jay: Not one that I can remember. It's been four or five years.

138
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's go ahead and update these since

139
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: 24th is pretty close.

140
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to keep my anxiety in check. Uh huh. So let's just see how it's doing. So thinking about

141
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: how great it was when you started this program.

142
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see if it has gone up. If it stayed the same, or if it's gone down.

143
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think that is

144
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.030
Jay: I think I'm actually being

145
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.210
Jay: I think I'm getting the therapy on you.

146
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's an awesome nice thing to say about therapy.

147
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapy is an interesting thing because it doesn't just sort of sit on a shelf, you know, I mean, it's not like a thing that you take out and you flip the switch.

148
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think is happening in this therapy that's helping you with anxiety.

149
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.850
Jay: I'm because I don't know you. And I'm telling you all my problems.

150
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.480
Jay: That helps me to open up to people.

151
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It helps to open up

152
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's because you don't know me.

153
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.090
Right.

154
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.310
Jay: I have my reservations about this program because it was over the video. Yeah.

155
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.400
Jay: But I never tried everywhere else. And nothing elsewhere.

156
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.450
Jay: And this the longest I stayed in a program

157
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

158
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.320
Jay: Yeah, like a patient

159
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:47.640
Okay.

160
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Usually

161
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.150
Jay: Once I'm going

162
00:14:53.070 --> 00:15:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now here's what I don't know. Yes, it would be flattering to think that somehow it's this program or somehow magically, it's me, but I'm not that naive right so I'm thinking, what is it has a lot to do with

163
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you said, I just don't think the same way anymore. Last time I think you said it. You've said it before, you said, I just, I don't think

164
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The same way I just my way I make decisions isn't based on the same

165
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Logic, or I don't know verbatim what you said.

166
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you think that switch went off for you without thinking change how many months or years ago. Do you think that was

167
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.930
Jay: I think it was about in January, maybe December.

168
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.220
Jay: I just woke up one morning and I was like,

169
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.760
Jay: This has got to stop and I think I was on the phone with you guys a couple days after that.

170
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this

171
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, what do you mean by this has to stop. Be specific. What do you mean

172
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.550
Jay: I was getting high.

173
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.020
Jay: Wing

174
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.710
Jay: That I

175
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:14.820
Jay: Gonna go back to prison. If I give another dirty way I'd already given like three or four, and he let me slide.

176
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:27.810
Jay: And I knew I had a piss test. The next week. It wasn't exactly seven days later, and I woke up that morning, and I wasn't make em. If I will stop now and then I'm going to jail.

177
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.990
Jay: So I chose to flush my drugs that I had on me.

178
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:44.910
Jay: And I went to a friend's house which which is my ex mother in law and I slept on her couch for two days. That was what my parents were in Vegas.

179
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:52.650
Jay: Of a scene at the homeless shelter for like four or five days before. And that's where I was skiing. I was at the homeless shelter.

180
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.750
Jay: Then I went to that friend's house and sit on your couch for two days.

181
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.040
Jay: You know, drag it up real quick and then

182
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.670
Jay: Came home and slept for about a week.

183
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.700
Jay: That's around the time I got on the program with y'all.

184
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.290
Jay: That started smoking weed two

185
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's new for you. The, the, this does. You mentioned it quite a bit like that's, that's something you're the message is received this weed means something to you, you're sending me this message about it and

186
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: How much have you been smoking the year before.

187
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.950
Jay: No. Okay.

188
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.450
Jay: I quit smoking, probably in 2007

189
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So the upside of any

190
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside substance is that sometimes what ends up happening the messages to the self. Well, I'm not really changed. I haven't really changed. I still need something to be okay. So there is a downside to it and that that includes psychiatric medication to

191
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, statistically, what it's what what research will will say is that concurrently having psychotherapy and psychiatric medication has the best outcome, the best therapeutic gain

192
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I encourage people to consider medication management, you know, with its if this anxiety is so

193
00:18:51.360 --> 00:19:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: negatively impacting work relationships. So if it's interfering with those things or depression is interfering with life domains. It's kind of a, it's a good time to consider that maybe having both at the same time be the way to go.

194
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And so for you. Are you on any psychiatric medication, remind me.

195
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:21.150
Jay: Yes, I'm on a rim Ron of 15 milligrams. I'm on Zyprexa 10 milligrams and

196
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.320
Jay: I can't remember the other top of next

197
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.960
Jay: That's also 10 milligrams

198
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So how do you know that it isn't those substances.

199
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how we're rolling out the nausea. We keep you know keep kind of kicking it off this list.

200
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you able to identify what is the active ingredient. Like, which one is it that's helping you.

201
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what I mean, like, how are you going to come away from this knowing more about what works for you.

202
00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.160
Jay: I don't know.

203
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: My

204
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.450
Jay: My psychiatrist is oh Wellbutrin. That's the UK.

205
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: He's real.

206
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.120
Jay: He's real short and like

207
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.790
Jay: He's not going to hear a story. You know what I mean. Okay.

208
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You mean not as in. He's four foot 11 if he has a doesn't talk for a long time.

209
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. Not sure.

210
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.030
Jay: There's nothing to describe my medications in Timmy he's done.

211
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.020
Okay.

212
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that that doesn't prevent you from

213
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing the research and

214
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, now I'm interested. But are you, do you want to know what's actually helping you versus this barrage of all these things coming at you.

215
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.870
Jay: Well, to tell you the truth. I've been off the segments for five minutes. That's why I had my site point me yesterday.

216
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:17.340
Jay: And I had to get my men's okay but I've been offered for a long time. Just because I couldn't take them because I was growing up, so much so I've been on a real roller coaster. This past six minutes.

217
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I have cheese.

218
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's new information. So on one hand, I thought you were ingesting them, Nick. Currently, but it sounds like you're adjusting adjusting the THC.

219
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

220
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: In the Suboxone Suboxone to. Yeah. And for many people.

221
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: They described, whether it's

222
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: An actual chemical change or not. I can't really tell.

223
00:21:48.300 --> 00:22:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But there is this sense that a perception that it brings the anxiety down there is a perception of it, but I can't quite see for sure if it's just

224
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't want to not be taking anything, you know, and whether there's an actual anxiety condition there or not. So it's hard for me to really tell. But this is this is useful.

225
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, when you do, you just met with them, right. You just met with a psychiatrist.

226
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.780
Yesterday,

227
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Did you fill a prescription for all those medicines.

228
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. And did you tell this psychiatrist that

229
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of wish I had known with you beforehand but

230
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you started taking them.

231
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.870
Jay: I took them to the years I took a lesson to me and then I took my bitterness.

232
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Hmm.

233
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I guess I would invite when you meet with that's okay. It's just, again,

234
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.300
Jay: three more months.

235
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

236
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well here's the thing. This is an interest that I have, if you don't have an interest in it won't, it won't be relevant.

237
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll leave it alone. If you end up becoming curious about what's actually helping you, because then you get the sense of, well, I don't want to spend the rest of my life on these things, which is the one that's actually helping me. I can't tell.

238
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Them, then you may want to consider that conversation with that provider and say I really want to know what's helping what and if we pulled them apart, you know, how could I maybe determine what I really need longer term or which one I can kind of let go of

239
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.100
Okay.

240
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:56.850
Jay: They added the fanatics, because that Iran together was supposed to stabilize the mood stabilizers and supposed to help you sleep good

241
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:08.220
Jay: Then they put me on Zyprexa because I was having bad dreams and stuff. And so it was another sleep eight and then the word future was supposed to be for me. Right.

242
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:09.480
So,

243
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.290
Jay: I haven't had none of them. And I've been doing

244
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.080
Jay: I think I've been handling myself. Okay.

245
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.970
Jay: Mentally mentally and tear myself apart. But I'm holding it.

246
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.780
Jay: Holding it together long enough to make some money.

247
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Actually, I want to spend time understanding that because you're. It's like if you're happy and you're you know it, then your face will surely show it. Well, it doesn't

248
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell that you're tearing yourself up inside

249
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the things I want to hear about

250
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.690
Jay: It's just I don't like being around people. I'm constantly thinking, somebody's going to rob me or hold me or

251
00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:07.170
Jay: They're gonna invite me to their house and just me because you know I got enemies are you know I there's and that's what's always going through my mind and I put a wall up and try not to think about it.

252
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.010
Jay: Because I know I need to go out here. Excellent.

253
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see if I get this. It's actually on your mind like 80 90% of the time worry that you're going to get jumped in some way get hurt.

254
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're in danger.

255
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.360
Jay: Yes. Something's gonna happen.

256
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So as at 90 closer. Is it a different number.

257
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.220
Yeah.

258
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot.

259
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:34.950
Yeah.

260
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And we as the audience, right, and looking at you. We can't tell. And even worse because the tele health, like I miss even more cues that I would probably pick up on. But I can't pick up on them because I'm way over here.

261
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are able to cope with that fear.

262
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you need to make money.

263
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's the money going, what's it going to, I'm just curious about it.

264
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.150
Jay: Seeing. That's a crazy thing I really don't have no go.

265
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

266
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.990
Jay: I'm just sick of of

267
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.190
Jay: Spinning on my Mom's money, you know I'm saying

268
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.370
Jay: I'm trying to I'm trying to be a better so can be a better person.

269
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so specifically are you as soon as you get the money. Are you saying, hey, I want to pay for your there's a pot of money somehow that you're contributing

270
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.030
Jay: I've tried to give it to her. She don't want it.

271
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

272
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.800
Jay: Well need it. I got enough money to buy my secret gas and in some

273
00:26:50.490 --> 00:27:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. OK, I see it. I see it. So you want to be this good person. But then the way you know how is through hard work and effort. And so you go out and do it. And then it's not accepted.

274
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.570
Jay: No, it's not that it's not accepted. She, she knows I'm gonna need it later on.

275
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

276
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:16.470
Jay: She doesn't she doesn't, you mean I'm trying, I'm trying to

277
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.190
Jay: Pay her back for all the years that she's been with me on me.

278
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But she doesn't need it.

279
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you having any emotion right now as you're talking about it.

280
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:34.560
Yeah.

281
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know I can't tell. That's what's so pathetic about this this Telehealth. Are you feeling sad.

282
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: She sees what you're doing.

283
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: She can see it.

284
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a complicated process.

285
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been a part of it feels good to work hard and be able to give back. I bet some ways that feels good.

286
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But that debt.

287
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So big

288
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not where the tears are coming from.

289
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you don't know this.

290
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.370
Jay: You're not

291
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A parent yet.

292
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But she really does.

293
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want you to be healthy and happy.

294
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Money and stuff. It comes and goes, but there's only one you

295
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You had some invest years

296
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Where opportunities to really follow where your passion is and things that you know interest you just were kinda

297
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Occupied by that life and surviving and then prison and not life and then surviving and then it just kind of kept going, kept going.

298
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it was okay.

299
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To save the money for something

300
00:29:48.570 --> 00:30:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If your mom was just hell bent. She ain't gonna take it right and you were going to save it for something that you would feel good about there would be an investment in you, that's long overdue.

301
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What what might

302
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.900
Jay: Want to put a system in my Jeep.

303
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a sound system. Yeah.

304
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

305
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You like that music would be a way to cope

306
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: With that fear we were talking about earlier.

307
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.080
Yeah.

308
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever have a sound system like that before, like what you want.

309
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.840
Jay: You have no movie.

310
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.400
Jay: Okay.

311
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say

312
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This music that's in vehicle.

313
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you see that being something that's going to help you then to the next thing that you want.

314
00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.430
Jay: I don't know, maybe

315
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe. Okay, so let's let's hold hold music for just a second, that music might be

316
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: A way to sort of emotionally regulate. It's a discharge. It's a way for distraction. It's a way to feel better.

317
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But it might not. So coping isn't quite the same as advancing right you've been coping.

318
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Various ways you've been surviving your life, but it's not quite the same thing as investing

319
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a little surprised that you are going to

320
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That you picked your sound system.

321
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little short term. So I was thinking maybe he'll say something more long term something

322
00:31:49.230 --> 00:32:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Bigger something that has like lots of steps involved and it's kind of far out into the distance, and it's something that you would work hard for something you want that maybe you gave up on a long time ago.

323
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:09.450
Jay: Every time I do that and I failed. That's always an excuse for me to use

324
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, tell me one of what you call a failure. Tell me when when you failed.

325
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.570
Jay: Okay, whenever I was younger. Doesn't have to be recent

326
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:43.890
Jay: Opening I got this girl, she was pregnant and whenever I got with her. I didn't know if it was mine. She told me it was it, but I thought that it was, it turned out not to be, but I still stayed with her anything I got two jobs, the whole time she was pregnant and

327
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.380
Jay: We bought the house next door.

328
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:55.680
Jay: I mean, I was right next door to her mom's I did everything I could to provide you don't say

329
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.840
Jay: Oh yeah, and

330
00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:04.350
Jay: Just for her to go and get highlight it was like three weeks before was do

331
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.690
Jay: Oh, yeah.

332
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

333
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:10.410
Jay: And

334
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.860
Jay: That day i just i

335
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: didn't know what else to do. You were completely shocked by her behavior. No.

336
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.020
Jay: I didn't go back to work, except to pick up my check. And I went, bought a bunch of math and

337
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're done.

338
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:35.190
Jay: I was done for three or four years.

339
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Really go off the rails, you are gone.

340
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:43.500
Jay: I don't

341
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.990
Jay: I don't accept failure. Well,

342
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you don't.

343
00:33:52.920 --> 00:34:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's gonna be hard as a human. I know, because for messy and and we're not omnipotent, you know, that means God like we're not perfect, or

344
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:15.660
Jay: That's why I don't try to plant because if I can reach it rip. I get set back. It's just another

345
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:19.830
Jay: It's another tool for the drugs. Not saying

346
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:23.700
Jay: Trying to find better coping skills for it.

347
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in it. We're doing it together. We're getting there. Okay, we, we can't do it all at once. This is outpatient right we can't. We're not doing intensive outpatient, so we're going to get there. Just don't give up before the miracle happens. Okay, um,

348
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If you

349
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Get truly disappointed in yourself or someone else.

350
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just reach out to me.

351
00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't have to be fancy. You can say this fucking day sucks send an all know all know because you don't do that.

352
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I never forget that from you.

353
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will call and I will do whatever I can to get you back on the rail.

354
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it could be just a slip and you come right back.

355
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus the efforts completely, which is a while now. I've failed at sobriety and now I'm just going to stay this way, which is what a lot of people do really give up on themselves, but that's a relapse that that those three years. That's a true relapse, which is different than

356
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have enough coping skills. I was presented with a high stress environment and I forgot my new skills. I forgot to breathe. I forgot to reach out to when I forgot.

357
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: All I felt was these emotions and it was all I could do. And I just, I did what I used to always do. And I just used, and then I remembered

358
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And I threw it away and I went and I slept in on a car I slept in a desert or what whatever but you got back on track. You don't have to do it that way, we go all the way into a relapse. You can catch it. Believe it or not,

359
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's early phase and come right back okay doesn't have to be that other way.

360
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.790
Jay: Know how hard it was to coordinate

361
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That helps how miserable. You work.

362
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.660
Jay: Yeah.

363
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

364
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's called a negative reinforcer it's the buzzing seatbelt.

365
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.660
Oh dear. She's so funny.

366
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you

367
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Opposite our it's funny. Okay.

368
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not talking to you flipped.

369
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Joe and thinks it to 10 instead of one second.

370
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me. I really want to I want. I want you to have this. I really liked this article, and it was on perfectionism.

371
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that it. It's the way it's language is

372
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Simple it's not fancy, you know, it's not all the psychobabble stuff. I don't, I don't think it is.

373
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I have shared this in

374
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: In group.

375
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Goodness going to read it with you do feel like I

376
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.220
Need to tell this client that she's an hour off.

377
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:41.820
Very much.

378
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just send me a quick text, I need to be gentle. Here are problems.

379
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.650
Okay, let's see how that goes.

380
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna share the screen. Alright, this what I'm about to do is the insight part for some people, the insight is the key to happiness. It's the key to mental health and they're like, it answers my why questions. And so, you know, that's what psychology can offer

381
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not everything. It's a piece of it and it's pretty cool to kind of see oneself in in psychological theory.

382
00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And to say, oh, hey, that's me. I'm not alone. And I kind of get how this came about. So insights, a pretty handy thing to have. But it's not the same thing as a therapeutic gain that's going to come from some of the interventions that you and I do together.

383
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But I still think it's useful. So let's see. Let's see what you think of this

384
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the insidious effects of early childhood difficulty is perfectionism perfectionism takes many forms, but hinges on unrealistic.

385
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: unattainable ideals ourselves.

386
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You with me. Yes.

387
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I can only see can see always see me. I don't like that. I want to see you see if I can. I'm like staring at myself like I see me talking to myself so exit full view, if I can get this to switch

388
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It hinges on unrealistic and unattainable ideals.

389
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: For ourselves others and the world constant striving for an illusory perfect world can lead to relationship conflicts burnout and fatigue in our pursuits and a deep sense of anger and frustration about ourselves and others.

390
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: When reality fails to live up to our lofty vision right where reality doesn't match expectation

391
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Childhood perfectionism tends to get set up and childhood.

392
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We are faced with stress abuse or neglect that we had no control over. I think they should change that.

393
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's the past. This is really key. This is the key. This is the actual part that creates

394
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This perfectionist and it's right in here when I enter visual is experiencing this kind of invalidating environments stress abuse, neglect.

395
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: When you realize that you have no control over it. This could be due to discord or divorce in our families, or perhaps a family struggle with poverty illness, mental health, substance use, or worse.

396
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: As a young child, these events threaten to overwhelm our undeveloped nervous system.

397
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Which counts on a stable and consistent outside environment in order to be regulated.

398
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This is nothing, there is nothing more important to a child in a sense of safety and connection with our primary caregivers.

399
00:41:49.140 --> 00:42:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And when this is impinged cut off children must this we're getting right to it here. Children must come up with a reason to understand why their basic needs are not being met.

400
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Children cannot emotionally, mentally, or even physically handle the reality that the world is often a painful place where bad things can happen to us and others for no apparent reason.

401
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to maintain a sense of control over ourselves just picture you're like little you like five your for your tiny

402
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But still, Jay. There's a sense of even that young we want control over our environment. That's the phenomenon that's happening here. So in order to maintain a sense of maintain a sense of control of our lives children have to come up with a narrative that's a story that explains why

403
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: These bad things are happening.

404
00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It is normal for a child to believe that they have control over their environment and then events that occur in reality are the result of their own actions or thoughts.

405
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is it. This is where the perfectionism get started. It is normal for trial to believe that they have control over their environment.

406
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And that events that occur in reality of the result of their own actions or thoughts since they have not yet made a link between cause and effect. So right here, this is where the it's my fault. Get started.

407
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That that part. Makes sense.

408
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:41.400
Yeah.

409
00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Children need an explanation to we naturally want to have a sense of control. And what ends up happening is we can't control others we end up controlling ourselves and therefore blaming ourselves.

410
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This is called magical thinking in developmental theories and let's a child that there is an alternative version reality where these bad things would not have occurred.

411
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If they did something different. If only the child had done something different, these bad things would not have happened.

412
00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This might sound maladaptive at first glance, but looking more closely at this strategy, it serves a purpose for a child belief that we could stop bad things from happening. If we try harder.

413
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If we were better if we were more perfect allows a child to retain a sense of control over their world. I'll be at false

414
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This false sense of security protects them from being overwhelmed in a scary world.

415
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And allows them to create an illusion of safety.

416
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But it now hinges on them, rather than the adults around them.

417
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It hinges.

418
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: On you. You control all

419
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If you stay perfect if you never fail.

420
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing bad will happen this concept gets developed really young.

421
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, these aren't conscious. These aren't things that go on in the conscious mind.

422
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This false sense of security protects them from being overwhelmed in a scary world and allows them to create an illusion of safety that not hinges on them, rather than the adults around them.

423
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This protection, also known as a defense mechanism, however, comes at a huge cost. It requires a sacrifice of our intrinsic sense of so

424
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If we were really good at our core these things would not be happening to us.

425
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But since bad things are happening, we must not really be enough in some way.

426
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The logical answer to this problem. According to our mind, right, is to strive to improve ourselves, whichever way our mind deems most likely to prove to the world that we are good, which, by the way, ought to also stop these bad things from happening.

427
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So we begin, of course of perfectionism, which may show up in academic athletic artistic performance being socially popular being a good girl or a good more being nice, being pretty etc.

428
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: These behaviors may get reinforced by our families. Oh, good boy. Great job. Yeah. Yeah. And you're so wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

429
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right to get reinforced for our families, our communities via praise, but secretly we have started down the slippery slope of perfectionism. Because no matter how good we are

430
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The problem we have been facing are not really being created by us at all, and therefore will not go away just because we're good was never about your being good to begin with.

431
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But little you the one that solved the problem at a tiny age of four or five

432
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This problem solving approach is still operating in adulthood.

433
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Our minds are not very accurate at looking out

434
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Actual actual experience and how well our strategy is working for us. Instead, we start to double down on being perfect.

435
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Even when being perfect is not really going to stop bad things from happening or help get all our needs met.

436
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to check in with you and make sure I haven't lost you.

437
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:07.560
Jay: Know I'm here.

438
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:08.520
Okay.

439
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So far, what are you hearing and will kind of

440
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring

441
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.140
Jay: Yes, it is.

442
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.870
Jay: News to me.

443
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah of course all I'll get it. I think I've sent it to people in a text to I'll get it over to you and attacks you want that in a text.

444
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.930
Jay: Yeah, if you want to email a PDF. You don't matter.

445
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll get it to you.

446
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

447
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we're halfway through.

448
00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're you have just that page, you got like three three or four paragraphs. There's not much left to it. Okay.

449
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And there might actually be more to it online.

450
00:48:58.170 --> 00:48:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But one of the reasons why.

451
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to

452
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Run after group was because a lot of you guys present with this you present with a core belief of

453
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not enough.

454
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter what I do. It doesn't. It doesn't matter. I'm not going to be enough. I'm not enough. I'm not enough. And if we whittle away the lie don't like failure, failure if we take that away, what's left with

455
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that your core that you're a good person that you don't have to actually do anything that you're good.

456
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And enough just because you weren't born

457
00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I didn't think so. That's why I got the article and a lot of you guys have that. And a lot of you also have what's called a really high a score, which speaks to adverse childhood experiences.

458
00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't heard that a lot a lot from you, your memory is not awesome in most of the time you spend talking about how bad you are

459
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And we did I let you do that all session last time really got into it.

460
00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not sold yet.

461
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: After work harder at that but

462
00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I do want to hear. I want to hear. Also, maybe some memories or maybe, maybe you could investigate a little bit with your mom and say,

463
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, how was I treated as a little boy by my stepfather. I don't remember.

464
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe getting a little history taking from your sister, and we get some collateral information and maybe you'll remember you hear some of those stories, maybe some of that will come up. They may also come up in our talking

465
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

466
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that over to I'm going to see if this

467
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants to meet with me and see what we can do next week.

468
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.670
Jay: May 27 we got for

469
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: 1133 1111 yeah I have that too. That's great. How did we, how did we do that. Why, why was I so proactive. That's great.

470
00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a superstar.

471
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, I really am. I'm a whole week ahead. I'm feeling. Brilliant. All right. Well, I sure I sure hope you. Okay, so we've got don't smoke super, super right before 20 minutes before the

472
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Under the tongue business. And then we have then eat before I would say just go for go for eat before the medicine so you don't throw it up, but just cut out that the tobacco right before and see if that makes a difference for you.

473
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.660
Jay: So eat before

474
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's only get us only change one thing, and then we're we're doing that rollout thing, then we can really tease it apart and see if it really is.

475
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We're changing one variable in our little experiment here we're just changing. I won't be smoking 20 minutes before I put this under my tongue. It's the only thing we're going to change. And we'll just watch

476
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:24.720
Jay: Okay.

477
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have to do all your thinking later.

478
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:32.820
Jay: All right.

479
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:34.590
