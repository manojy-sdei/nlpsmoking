331
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.730
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, you can do. You know, one of the times.

332
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.540
Crystal Cook: When wearing

333
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.660
Kathleen Marshall: Where you can go down a little better light.

334
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.270
Kathleen Marshall: On you. That's better. Yeah.

335
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.290
Okay, yeah, that's

336
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.050
Kathleen Marshall: Good. And the other one.

337
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:28.830
Kathleen Marshall: Good all normal. And then I'm just bring the phone, a little bit down so I can see your face the bottom of your face and open your mouth.

338
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:37.590
Kathleen Marshall: And stick your tongue out good. Then take your one hand and push on your neck. See if you feel any lumps or bumps.

339
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:39.960
Crystal Cook: No.

340
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.080
Kathleen Marshall: And then do you have full range of motion of your neck.

341
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.520
Kathleen Marshall: Or not anymore.

342
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.030
Crystal Cook: No, just like that. So,

343
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:48.960
Kathleen Marshall: Far, okay.

344
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.640
Yeah, okay.

345
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.280
Crystal Cook: You have to turn

346
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:59.700
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, and then just with your eyes look over to the side. Just move your eyes looking

347
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:05.340
Kathleen Marshall: To decide. Yeah, just, you know, like, see my eyes. Let's move your eyes.

348
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.960
Kathleen Marshall: To the side. Yeah.

349
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.360
Kathleen Marshall: And then to the other side and look up with your eyes and look down.

350
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:23.160
Kathleen Marshall: Good. Then I'm going to have you take one hand and just push on your belly. On the right side, right under your ribs and tell me if you feel any pain.

351
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.690
Kathleen Marshall: No, and then the lower side on the right, same thing.

352
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.730
Crystal Cook: No.

353
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.930
Kathleen Marshall: And then the left side load on any pain.

354
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.110
Kathleen Marshall: And then the left side right under the red

355
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.210
Crystal Cook: No. Okay.

356
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.410
Kathleen Marshall: No stomach problems, you don't have any acid reflux.

357
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.590
Crystal Cook: Now got old Sir no sir

358
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.810
Kathleen Marshall: You have had an ulcer before

359
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.500
Yeah.

360
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:52.200
Kathleen Marshall: How do you know that

361
00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:01.530
Crystal Cook: They've done it as made me take a strong and a silver balloon and blowing it actually I hadn't bacteria from it. My stomach, but

362
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:02.610
Kathleen Marshall: Uh,

363
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.090
Kathleen Marshall: Huh. H. Pylori

364
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.420
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, yeah. Did you get treatment for it.

365
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.910
Crystal Cook: Yeah, I was on a Prozac.

366
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.020
Kathleen Marshall: When we're

367
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.150
Crystal Cook: Probably

368
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.450
Crystal Cook: I think it's about 2013

369
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.440
Okay.

370
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.740
Kathleen Marshall: Have you ever had any belly surgeries, besides the C sections and the two wall.

371
00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.480
Crystal Cook: None, okay.

372
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:36.030
Kathleen Marshall: And then either bring the phone down to your leg or if you can bring your leg up so I can see kind of around your ankles.

373
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.640
Crystal Cook: You see,

374
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.750
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, good. And the other one.

375
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.250
Kathleen Marshall: Good.

376
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.500
Kathleen Marshall: That's good.

377
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.180
Kathleen Marshall: And how about her arms.

378
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.560
Kathleen Marshall: You, you might need to move them one at a time. But you have full range of motion with your arms.

379
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.080
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, good. And the other one.

380
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.160
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, good. Okay. All right.

381
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:16.470
Kathleen Marshall: So let me tell you about right heart health. And then about Suboxone before I get into what we might treat you with, um, tell me. When was your last dose of any Percocet.

382
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:18.630
Crystal Cook: Earlier.

383
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.020
Kathleen Marshall: Like an hour or hour

384
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.910
Crystal Cook: Maybe two hours ago.

385
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.170
Kathleen Marshall: Two hours ago. OK.

386
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.930
Crystal Cook: Yeah.

387
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.970
Kathleen Marshall: It's ok with me. But that's what you're here for. Okay.

388
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.850
Crystal Cook: Yes, I don't want him to know that Adam snuck off, you know,

389
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.220
Crystal Cook: They're trying to me. They really are.

390
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:46.980
Kathleen Marshall: So I asked that you're not feeling any withdrawal right now, I would imagine, right.

391
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:47.700
Time.

392
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.830
Kathleen Marshall: For you. How many hours do go before you start feeling

393
00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:02.700
Crystal Cook: And I can go buy that for hours and I'm wanting another one, maybe four hours six hours, something like that.

394
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.080
Kathleen Marshall: You start craving. Are you feeling any symptoms done like nausea or

395
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.130
Kathleen Marshall: Trend ARIA

396
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:14.760
Crystal Cook: I get shaky like

397
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:15.900
Shaky.

398
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:29.790
Kathleen Marshall: So bright heart health, you know, we're in this an online platform and the way we work. So you have a medication check in.

399
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:41.280
Kathleen Marshall: With me in on your physician that will be prescribing the medication. I see you at the beginning, once a week, so that we know you know how your dose is doing.

400
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:50.460
Kathleen Marshall: How your cravings are and any problems that are coming up and then prescribe you we prescribe generally at first couple of your week

401
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.070
Kathleen Marshall: Or

402
00:27:54.810 --> 00:28:03.870
Kathleen Marshall: Usually a week at a time. But we're seeing you on a Thursday. And we have a group on Tuesday evenings at around the same time seven o'clock.

403
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.670
Kathleen Marshall: And it says zoom group.

404
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.870
Kathleen Marshall: So everyone just come

405
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:21.570
Kathleen Marshall: In and it's your place to vent to get support from other people that you know you don't know and they don't live right near you. So it's helpful because they're they're strangers in a way and it's safe. In that sense, you know, you're not

406
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.160
Kathleen Marshall: It's not your neighbor or

407
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.670
Something

408
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:37.860
Kathleen Marshall: And I check in with you there and check in about your medications and prescribing your medications. From there, at some point, we're still working on North Carolina payment plan with coronavirus there's been ups and downs.

409
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:43.860
Kathleen Marshall: With kind of how the government is reimbursing but we'll get a therapist in that meeting as well and they will

410
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:54.870
Kathleen Marshall: Leave the meeting. And then you also get to meet with the individual therapist. Once all of that is coordinated for right now it's just with me and then the group.

411
00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:03.180
Kathleen Marshall: And then each week, you do a survey of all the BAM you check into the virtual clinic, just like you did today.

412
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:14.820
Kathleen Marshall: And when you check in before your group meeting you will get assigned to do the band takes about 10 minutes and it helps us keep track of your symptom and your cravings and how you're doing with that.

413
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.240
Kathleen Marshall: The other thing is, you know, they sent you.

414
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.010
Kathleen Marshall: Probably blood work orders.

415
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.450
Kathleen Marshall: How they told you about that yet.

416
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:36.090
Kathleen Marshall: No. Okay, so we send initial blood work, which just helps us know your liver function because the medication that we'll talk about can affect can have an effect on your liver. If you have underlying liver

417
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:36.540
Problems.

418
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:53.970
Kathleen Marshall: And it checks for hepatitis and just other kind of basic labs that we look for when we prescribe Suboxone we don't hold back on prescribing it on before we see those labs, but we like to see them within a week or two, so that we know every okay

419
00:29:55.050 --> 00:30:04.740
Kathleen Marshall: After that you do a urine drug screen with us once a month and the most important thing about that to remember is when you get it in the mail, because it's mailed to you.

420
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.870
Kathleen Marshall: Don't open the package from bright heart health, so you'll know it's coming but let you know when you receive it. Just keep it in a package.

421
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.640
Kathleen Marshall: To log on to the virtual clinic and, you know, tell them you have your drug screen.

422
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:28.650
Kathleen Marshall: And someone will zoom meeting with you and walk you through the steps so that the test is valid, you basically hold up the sample after up and they they can read it right off of there.

423
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:41.580
Kathleen Marshall: So that they can read the results right into us, it's very convenient because you don't have to go to the, you know, any facility or laboratory to do it by. You just have to remember not to open it. Because then we don't know what people have done with it.

424
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.200
Kathleen Marshall: No. And when what our role is is

425
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.970
Kathleen Marshall: We're trying to support you in your recovery. We're not trying to catch you.

426
00:30:51.030 --> 00:31:04.560
Kathleen Marshall: We're not trying to say, oh you slept. You had a relapse. We know people have relapses we're looking for you to be honest with your recovery and tell us you know beforehand. I had a relapse. This is what's going to be on my drug screen, you know,

427
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.080
Kathleen Marshall: So that we're all in this

428
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.650
Together.

429
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.220
Kathleen Marshall: It's all our way through that people are uncomfortable.

430
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:25.710
Kathleen Marshall: See it on our drug screen we can address it. So hey, what's what's going on. Do you need more support do you need, you know, another counseling session like what's happening with with you that this is going on. So we don't use it as a we got you and you're kicked out or

431
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.730
Kathleen Marshall: Something like that.

432
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:46.050
Kathleen Marshall: So, so our program. So the medication that that I would be prescribing that I recommend for you is Suboxone which, you know, I've used a few times. He said, but this one is will be legitimate and generally will use it before to do a task or film.

433
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:58.020
Crystal Cook: I need to do. I would rather not have no appeal form because I just feel like if his appeal form is going to be the same thing is if I wouldn't take a Percocet.

434
00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.040
Crystal Cook: Okay.

435
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.060
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah I would rather

436
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.810
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah. Do you mean just it would trigger you

437
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.570
Crystal Cook: Yeah, I'm scared would

438
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.100
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, yeah.

439
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.290
Kathleen Marshall: So in the past and you got Suboxone off the street. Did you get the film form the strip

440
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.900
Crystal Cook: Yes, yeah.

441
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:22.290
Kathleen Marshall: That's generally what I prescribe but some people have a preference for, you know, the tabs. Sometimes the table.

442
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.780
Kathleen Marshall: None of them have a pleasant, but

443
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.930
Kathleen Marshall: Some people tolerate one better than the

444
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:38.280
Kathleen Marshall: Other films, you know, when you take them. They are placed under the tongue and the generally overprescribing just party not putting multiple

445
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:50.940
Kathleen Marshall: So one film or a piece of a film at a time, you put it under the tongue. Some people say how to have a little bit of water before you put the film under it'll help it dissolve. You have to wait till it fully physicals

446
00:32:51.450 --> 00:33:04.200
Kathleen Marshall: Can take 15 minutes for some people but you want to make sure all the way dissolves and the drug itself is a combination of two drugs that has been an orphan in it and a lot so on.

447
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.480
Kathleen Marshall: And so the buprenorphine.

448
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:14.040
Kathleen Marshall: Is the drug that you're looking for. That's what's treating your addiction. So when you take regular opioids off the street Percocet.

449
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.210
Kathleen Marshall: Heroin any

450
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.770
Kathleen Marshall: People are getting off the street.

451
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:28.890
Kathleen Marshall: For that they're getting from a doctor for pain. Those attached, you know, to all the opioid receptors in your brain. They help control your brain, but they also cause that as you know that high.

452
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:29.850
Crystal Cook: And

453
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:40.590
Kathleen Marshall: As you come down, you feel low and you feel craving So buprenorphine is partially a way to think of it as almost like it partially attaches

454
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:45.930
Kathleen Marshall: Good attaches on but it doesn't turn on the receptors in the same way.

455
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:54.690
Kathleen Marshall: So it helps because it does control the breathing, but it doesn't give you that high, and then the withdraw, you kind of get on a regular Joe

456
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.250
Kathleen Marshall: And you're just steady

457
00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:04.770
Kathleen Marshall: You feel like yourself. Oh, and if, when we get to adults. That's good for you, you're not having cravings for opioid another time.

458
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:11.670
Kathleen Marshall: So the but the point, the one part to know is that buprenorphine will attach

459
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.770
Kathleen Marshall: Onto your brain, all those receptors.

460
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:26.190
Kathleen Marshall: A lot stronger than a regular opioid so that means if you are not in withdraw when you take Suboxone it will knock you into withdrawal, because it will grab

461
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.530
Kathleen Marshall: All the opium and all the all the heroin right off.

462
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:40.950
Kathleen Marshall: So when you start Suboxone it's really important that you are in a moderate amount of withdrawal. You want to be feeling you

463
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.640
Kathleen Marshall: Know the longer you can go the

464
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:57.480
Kathleen Marshall: The easier. Your initiation. We call it you're starting the Suboxone will be so I generally say you want to have at least three of the symptoms of withdrawal meaning like you're feeling

465
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.190
Crystal Cook: Restless, you're

466
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:09.390
Kathleen Marshall: Sweating. You're yawning, you know, maybe you look at your pupils and you see they're really dilated, some people get runny nose or teary eyes.

467
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.810
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, and then the valley sentence nausea or diarrhea.

468
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:23.130
Kathleen Marshall: You want to be having a few of those symptoms before you start the Suboxone because then you'll know that you're in withdrawal and when you

469
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:24.690
Crystal Cook: Work a box on it's going to

470
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:25.890
Kathleen Marshall: Make you feel better.

471
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.730
Kathleen Marshall: Not make you feel worse by knocking you into withdrawal.

472
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.080
Crystal Cook: So,

473
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.890
Kathleen Marshall: The other part of the Suboxone is no oxygen.

474
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.480
Kathleen Marshall: And that heart.

475
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.050
Kathleen Marshall: When you talk about some under the tongue.

476
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.120
Kathleen Marshall: Doesn't really get on board.

477
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:42.360
And

478
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:55.350
Kathleen Marshall: The reason. And the last one is there is so that people don't try to steal Suboxone from you or or take it from you and try to get high because if you melt them down.

479
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.230
Kathleen Marshall: And injected or swallow it.

480
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.780
Kathleen Marshall: Down in the loft sonya will block the effect

481
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.630
Kathleen Marshall: So there's no kind of highs or lows, so it's it's really a safety measure that they put it in there.

482
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.320
Kathleen Marshall: When I prescribe Suboxone I also

483
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.970
Kathleen Marshall: Prescribe can

484
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.910
Kathleen Marshall: Are you familiar with that at all.

485
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:16.260
Yeah.

486
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.600
Crystal Cook: So I've never

487
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:20.220
Crystal Cook: Good.

488
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.900
Crystal Cook: I've seen it. I've never

489
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:32.610
Crystal Cook: Used it a friend of mine goes, yeah, he was used to shoot crack cocaine cocaine and he had some you stab in your bag or whatever.

490
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.960
Crystal Cook: He got them down to

491
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.260
Crystal Cook: The hospital, get him on them.

492
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:47.160
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so I'm giving you. It's a narc handle that you score in your nose and if in case of an of an accidental overdose.

493
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:59.730
Kathleen Marshall: On you. It could be used on you you if you have a friend who's on drugs and overdoses. You can use that. I'll send you an email that has a link to how to use that I just prescribe it the one time because

494
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.110
Kathleen Marshall: It's good to have at home.

495
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.060
It's not a controlled substance.

496
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.400
Kathleen Marshall: And

497
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:16.800
Kathleen Marshall: The important thing is if you ever were to have an overdose or treat someone for an overdose. You want to call 911 after because the Narcan are short acting

498
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.500
Kathleen Marshall: It'll block the effects of the opioids, but you can

499
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.600
Kathleen Marshall: Go right back into the overdrive.

500
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.420
Kathleen Marshall: So you call 911 if you ever need to use that. OK.

501
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.310
Kathleen Marshall: So the Suboxone that way that we use.

502
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.290
Kathleen Marshall: Comes in that film.

503
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.760
Kathleen Marshall: And I called in.

504
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:46.470
Kathleen Marshall: You know comes in a film in a container and a silver container. You can cut it inside of the container at the wrapping that it's and you can put it inside of there, if we

505
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.120
Kathleen Marshall: When we're using less than the whole

506
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.540
Kathleen Marshall: Strip.

507
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.230
Kathleen Marshall: And then take it out so that you don't get your fingers on it to

508
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.680
Kathleen Marshall: Cut it

509
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:59.880
Kathleen Marshall: So generally, I'm going to calculate here, the amount of opioid use so I'm

510
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:11.430
Kathleen Marshall: Everyone's body is different. That's why I will be working, you know, with you to figure out the right dose for you.

511
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.790
Kathleen Marshall: Generally when you're starting so

512
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.680
Kathleen Marshall: I want to be, you know, in about

513
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.530
Kathleen Marshall: 12 hours of withdrawal. We're thinking eight to 12 hours dealing with that.

514
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.400
Kathleen Marshall: That illness.

515
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.200
Kathleen Marshall: I'll have you take a film and cut it.

516
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.710
Kathleen Marshall: I would cut it with the amount

517
00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.400
Kathleen Marshall: I would cut it in half.

518
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.430
Kathleen Marshall: I'm going to prescribe an eight milligrams film.

519
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.230
Kathleen Marshall: And you're going to cut it in half.

520
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.360
Kathleen Marshall: And take the first film.

521
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.010
Kathleen Marshall: Under your Tom

522
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.590
Kathleen Marshall: And then wait

523
00:38:50.730 --> 00:39:01.320
Kathleen Marshall: At about four hours. If you're still feeling. What's your all take the other half of the film. Okay. And so then you will take a full Fallon. And then later on in the evening.

524
00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:05.190
Kathleen Marshall: Eight hours later later another half of a film.

525
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.800
Kathleen Marshall: Feel taken one and a half, and I'll send you an email that list this again. So you have it.

526
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.660
Kathleen Marshall: You can actually look at it and paper.

527
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.120
Kathleen Marshall: The next day when you wake up.

528
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:20.340
Kathleen Marshall: You'll be talking a full film in the morning and a full film in the evening.

529
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:25.770
Kathleen Marshall: And then we'll check in next week and see a thought is controlling your pregnancy.

530
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.260
Kathleen Marshall: Usually that's a dose that will

531
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.330
Kathleen Marshall: cover most of your brain.

532
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.940
Kathleen Marshall: And hope you feel like you don't have any cravings.

533
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:39.330
Kathleen Marshall: And you don't feel too sleepy during the day and that you're functioning like yourself. So I

534
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.160
Kathleen Marshall: That's the prescription. I'm going to spend

535
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:53.910
Kathleen Marshall: It's the half stone and then four hours later, another half film, and then later on that evening, another half film and then the following day and every day after that.

536
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:54.900
Kathleen Marshall: To film.

537
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.340
Kathleen Marshall: One in the morning and one

538
00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:58.710
Crystal Cook: Okay.

539
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.210
Kathleen Marshall: Does that make sense.

540
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:02.430
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, okay.

541
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:11.430
Kathleen Marshall: So the group that we have now. I think I mentioned Tuesdays at seven is at a time, you're available.

542
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.310

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.660
Kathleen Marshall: Eastern Time.

546
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.490
Crystal Cook: Okay.

547
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.150

Okay.

550
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:40.200
Kathleen Marshall: So I'm gonna put you down as being in that group. So that means this Tuesday. You just check into the virtual clinic. Give yourself about 20 minutes or so before you check

551
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.160
Kathleen Marshall: In and can do that.

552
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:49.110
Kathleen Marshall: And then you'll be checked into the group every week, the group number changes and they give you the zoom number and then you'll find in. Okay.

553
00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:56.280
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, and then you and I will touch base and see how you're doing. And if we need any dose adjustments.

554
00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.150
Kathleen Marshall: I am going to see here

555
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.150
Kathleen Marshall: That I have your information directly

556
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:15.060
Kathleen Marshall: Now let me tell you, as with any opioids or and buprenorphine is

557
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.100
Kathleen Marshall: Actually what we call partial agonist.

558
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.320
Crystal Cook: It's the same risk that

559
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.330
Kathleen Marshall: You're on. Now there are, there is a risk.

560
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.910
Kathleen Marshall: But much less of overlap.

561
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:32.340
Kathleen Marshall: There very minimal risk on Suboxone. That's why it's considered so safe and and that's why it's used as a prescription medication. This

562
00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:32.730
Way.

563
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.050
Kathleen Marshall: There is danger if you're combining things like

564
00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.480
Kathleen Marshall: Alcohol, which I call in your collection. I don't

565
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.730
Kathleen Marshall: Have any issues with alcohol.

566
00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:43.290
Crystal Cook: No.

567
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.900
Kathleen Marshall: Do you like it. I didn't ask, how would your cigarettes.

568
00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:46.890
Kathleen Marshall: Drink at all.

569
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.100
Crystal Cook: I used to your

570
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:55.290
Crystal Cook: It's not your, you know, I'm not allowed to hear but it's been a long time.

571
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.670
Crystal Cook: Of that when I was young.

572
00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.900
Kathleen Marshall: So that if you're taking any sedating medicine like over the counter core going to sleep.

573
00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:06.030
Kathleen Marshall: Or for anxiety.

574
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.130
Kathleen Marshall: Or get prescriptions for

575
00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.360
Kathleen Marshall: Anxiety or

576
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:16.890
Kathleen Marshall: Prescriptions for pain you know gabapentin are they, that's when it gets in the when you see dangerous combination

577
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.360
Kathleen Marshall: But you don't have any of those, you know that you're taking right now so

578
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.340
Kathleen Marshall: Just to be aware of that you

579
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:30.180
Kathleen Marshall: Want to know, you always want to tell people I see a new doctor for

580
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:30.510
Crystal Cook: Something

581
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.610

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:34.860
Crystal Cook: Insurance earlier.

614
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:43.230
Kathleen Marshall: And I don't know how much it will be. It's sometimes I get an Rx favor coupon. And this is not

Crystal Cook: It's supposed to be a discount for Suboxone

621
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.190
Kathleen Marshall: You got a discount card for connection.

622
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.420
Crystal Cook: I downloaded. I think it says I have to go print it off somewhere.

623
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.580
Crystal Cook: Okay. How much have they run. They run. I mean, I have no idea.

624
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:30.390
Kathleen Marshall: Some people's and, you know, insurance, your favorite coupon will make it 40 or $50 but I've seen some that are hundred 150 so

625
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:40.740
Kathleen Marshall: It just depends, I can search. Another pharmacy, if you give me your city just to see if they come up with a coupon. I don't know if that's different than the card that you have

626
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:44.880
Crystal Cook: I'm

627
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:50.490

628
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:58.440
Crystal Cook: Yeah, I do. All mom. Normally I use Walmart because they got some for dollar plans and stuff, a lot of

629
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.390
Crystal Cook: Medications in the past cheaper.

630
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.710
Crystal Cook: Yeah.

918
01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:25.710
Kathleen Marshall: And usually we kind of round robin and everybody says how they're doing for the week, or if they had something challenging if they, you know, and you share as much as you want.

919
01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:38.940

920
01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:45.960
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, everyone has to participate in that part. Because otherwise, I don't know, but sometimes it's you know if there's a reason you're very uncomfortable.

924
01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:08.790
Kathleen Marshall: But some people you know don't want to say that even though that's the point of the group is to just put it all out there. But if there's some reason that you didn't want to

925
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.230
Kathleen Marshall: Something happened that week.

926
