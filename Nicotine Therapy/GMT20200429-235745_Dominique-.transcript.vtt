00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.460
Dominique Pozo: Hi there.

3
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.450
Dominique Pozo: Hi, can you hear me.

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.550
Erika Romero: Yeah. How are you, Dominic

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.770
Dominique Pozo: I'm doing well. How's it going with you.

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.290
Erika Romero: I'm doing okay doing okay.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.920
Dominique Pozo: So,

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.450
Dominique Pozo: So what would you like to focus on today.

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.240
Erika Romero: So, um,

10
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
Erika Romero: This week was a was a pretty difficult week for me. Um,

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.090
Erika Romero: You remember I told you about my daughter and how my daughter's an addict and

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.760
Erika Romero: I just found out that

13
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:07.290
Erika Romero: She was, she was sober. UM, WE BROUGHT HER UP HERE WHEN SHE WAS A after she had a my last granddaughter. We had brought her to our house and

14
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:16.800
Erika Romero: She was so over for a while and then her night got into it and I had to evict her

15
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.600
Erika Romero: However, so she got into a program that

16
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:33.060
Erika Romero: Helps with pregnant pregnant and pregnant women that are addicted and women who have children that you know are

17
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.840
Erika Romero: Who are recovering

18
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.030
Erika Romero: And so they helped her get an apartment and stuff and

19
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:55.620
Erika Romero: Come to find out this last week this last week was just really tough because not only was did I find out about my daughter, but then I found out about my niece, too. And we'll get into that in a minute.

20
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.670
Erika Romero: I found out my sister had come to town. She lives in San Antonio and

21
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.130
Erika Romero: She

22
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.490
Erika Romero: She stayed with my daughter for a few days and I guess they had gotten into a fight.

23
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.960
Erika Romero: Over drugs or something or another. And I guess. So I guess my daughter's back on drugs again and

24
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.230
Erika Romero: I'm my granddaughter is in the middle of all of that and

25
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.340
Erika Romero: Then I found out about

26
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.850
Erika Romero: My niece. I told you I had raised her

27
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.060
Erika Romero: Like she's my daughter I raised her since she was a little, little girl. She was probably about three or four WHEN I GOT CUSTODY OF HER.

28
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.180
Erika Romero: And so

29
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.600
Erika Romero: I just found out because she had left her for her abusive boyfriend and they are addicts also

30
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:09.660
Erika Romero: And I had found out that she because for Easter I had been trying to get in touch with her to find out about her, you know, spending Easter with us and

31
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:23.400
Erika Romero: And I didn't hear from her my niece and I didn't hear from her. And I, and I didn't hear from her. So I finally contacted her dad and her dad told me that she went back to her boyfriend.

32
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:34.530
Erika Romero: So she's got a little girl, and they're both the two babies are about the same age. They're just a couple months apart.

33
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.000
Erika Romero: And

34
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:46.980
Erika Romero: And so it's been really hard for me to deal with that situation of both situations because I'm

35
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.340
Erika Romero: You know, I don't know how to

36
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.140
Erika Romero: I don't even know what to do anymore, you know,

37
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.290
Erika Romero: And the girls are grown they're adults and

38
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.820
Erika Romero: All I can say on on there. And is that, you know, they're grown and they have to make their own decisions and they have to

39
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.730
Erika Romero: Make their own statements.

40
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.620
Erika Romero: But

41
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.600
Erika Romero: What scares me is that they have these two babies.

42
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.090
Erika Romero: In the middle of all of this. Yeah, and I feel so I feel so helpless because

43
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.570
Erika Romero: Because I already lost two granddaughters

44
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.000
Erika Romero: To the state in

45
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.750
Erika Romero: And I just know that that's where I wanted me out. Ultimately, this is going to head.

46
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.870
Erika Romero: With my granddaughter.

47
00:04:49.500 --> 00:05:07.710
Erika Romero: And once the and my daughter and I aren't speaking. So there's no chance in hell. She's gonna do the smart thing and give you know let me have her and give her a chance to have, you know, her sister and her life.

48
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.150
Dominique Pozo: How do you know that have you have you checked.

49
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.040
Erika Romero: My daughter is a very vindictive very does

50
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.030
Erika Romero: Evil human being when she's when she's getting high and I'm

51
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.930
Erika Romero: We've we tried to contact her and she won't she won't

52
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.040
Erika Romero: She won't answer us

53
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.380
Erika Romero: Um,

54
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:49.260
Erika Romero: But the last person that my daughter wants her children with his me when she's in this in this situation.

55
00:05:50.610 --> 00:06:02.490
Erika Romero: And I'm which which makes it really hard because I've, I've really done everything that I could to try to be there for her and support her and and her in her girls.

56
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.570
Erika Romero: But that's why I lost the other two because

57
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.510
Erika Romero: Her way of

58
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:25.950
Erika Romero: Getting even with me or, or, you know, I'm getting the last word, so to speak, is by using the kids, you know, and the kids. She because she knows that that's the very heart of me.

59
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.450
Erika Romero: And she would rather she would rather have the kids in CPS custody, then

60
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.690
Erika Romero: Have them with me and

61
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:54.030
Erika Romero: And that's just, that's just all been vindictiveness. That's all it is. Because I've never done anything to warrant that kind of feeling or that kind of behavior for her.

62
00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:04.650
Erika Romero: But everything that goes wrong in her life. It's my fault in her eyes, you know, and so the best way to get even with me is to

63
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.950
Erika Romero: Is to use the kids against me.

64
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.090
Erika Romero: And so I'm

65
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.750
Erika Romero: You know, I'm scared that that's that's where we're headed. And because

66
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.360
Erika Romero: Then, because I am I lost my, to my two oldest boys.

67
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.660
Erika Romero: I can't get them from the state once they go into states custody. That's it.

68
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.530
Erika Romero: I can't get custody of them from the state.

69
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.040
Erika Romero: That's why when I'm when my granddaughter, the one that I have cuz

70
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:54.360
Erika Romero: When I WHEN I GOT CUSTODY OF HER. I GOT CUSTODY OF HER before

71
00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:02.370
Erika Romero: She before that chance ever came about. You know what I mean, because I knew that. That's where that was heading to

72
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:10.710
Erika Romero: Because my daughter was using his drugs, all the way up until the end of her pregnancy, all the way through a pregnancy.

73
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.640
Erika Romero: And so on, she was out on the streets and

74
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.070
So,

75
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:29.010
Erika Romero: I knew that that was the only way that I would get custody of her was to make sure that I intervene before they had a chance to get their

76
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.620
Erika Romero: Their, their hands on her.

77
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:43.560
Dominique Pozo: So, so I mean I'm hearing a tremendous amount of grief and loss and just, it seems to be touching a really tender place and

78
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:54.330
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering what you need, what you can give yourself during this time where it seems like you're, you're kind of powerless around some things at the moment.

79
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:55.740
Dominique Pozo: I

80
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.350
Erika Romero: Mean I don't, I don't really know. Because right now, this is just so I'm

81
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.750
Erika Romero: So, so a new. You know what I mean. This is such a new situation.

82
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.470
Erika Romero: As, as far as like, you know, I'm

83
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.750
Erika Romero: Fresh, you know,

84
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.990
Erika Romero: And it really don't know how to how to manage it right now.

85
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.330
Erika Romero: I really don't. I don't know how to process everything that's going on.

86
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.040
Erika Romero: It just scares me because these girls are dragging these these babies through this

87
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.930
Erika Romero: And they just, they just deserve so much better.

88
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.580
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

89
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.090
Dominique Pozo: It sounds very painful that this

90
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:05.730
Dominique Pozo: Story keeps getting resurrected for you around for, you know, it started with your two boys and then it's happened with your other granddaughter, and now

91
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.860
Dominique Pozo: It's just feels like a story that's repeating itself. That's very painful.

92
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:12.540
Erika Romero: Yeah.

93
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.280
Erika Romero: Like it was. Yeah, that's the thing is that, is it just like what are those nightmares.

94
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.950
Erika Romero: That you know you have night after night that don't go away.

95
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.130
Dominique Pozo: Is this taking away from your attention and presence with the grand daughter that you are

96
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.780
Dominique Pozo: Able to we're able to

97
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.790
Erika Romero: A matter of fact that's I think that's

98
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.480
Erika Romero: Really that I really try to focus more on

99
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:58.980
Erika Romero: In trying to focus that it is that her into something that's positive for her because, you know, these, these kids just deserve better.

100
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.570
Erika Romero: And so I try to make it into something positive, but

101
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:14.640
Erika Romero: It's something that that I've just been dealing with the, you know, all week long. I just don't in it.

102
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.460
Erika Romero: It directs a lot of anxiety for me.

103
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.740
Erika Romero: Because I don't like that helpless feeling yeah that powerless feeling

104
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.340
Erika Romero: When I when I lost my voice.

105
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.510
Erika Romero: Was that was the hardest thing I've ever been through my life.

106
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.230
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

107
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.490
And I

108
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.150
Erika Romero: Had to learn how to cope with that.

109
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.530
Erika Romero: And I had to learn how to

110
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.040
Erika Romero: Because I really got steamrolled by this system.

111
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.340
Erika Romero: And at that time.

112
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.590
Erika Romero: That was a very helpless from for me a very

113
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:24.420
Erika Romero: Because I was on my own. I didn't have anybody to support me. I had no family. I had, I had nothing, it was just me, myself and I, and so I had to learn how to

114
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:34.770
Erika Romero: How to do dependent on myself and notes and like I said in group yesterday. My therapist. Once I got into therapy.

115
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.440
Erika Romero: She became my backbone.

116
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.020
Erika Romero: And so she helped me to learn how to

117
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.730
Erika Romero: To to be strong and

118
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.260
Erika Romero: Not to feel not to be so helpless, you know,

119
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.230
Erika Romero: And so I am

120
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.410
Erika Romero: I think I told you last week that

121
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.190
Erika Romero: For me it's easier just to throw people out of my life rather than do

122
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.580
Erika Romero: Field let them hurt me.

123
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.450
Know,

124
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.450
Erika Romero: And I think

125
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.680
Erika Romero: That stems from that.

126
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:27.060
Erika Romero: From being that powerless person. You know what I mean. And and defending myself and and standing on my own two feet, and I

127
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.190
Erika Romero: Because I decided I wasn't, I wasn't gonna let people hurt me anymore.

128
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:57.120
Erika Romero: And so now when I feel like this in this is that this is what my dog gets out of here. You know, this is what she she thrives off of is knowing that this is how I feel, you know,

129
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.700
Erika Romero: And

130
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:07.140
Erika Romero: Then I've cut off communication with her because I got tired of her

131
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.440
Erika Romero: Doing that, to me, you know, in

132
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.590
Erika Romero: Playing on my emotions and

133
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.000
Erika Romero: And and hurt taking from me that power that I've learned

134
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:28.020
Erika Romero: Over the years to to stand firm upon you know that that straight than that.

135
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.550
Erika Romero: But, um,

136
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.250
Erika Romero: You know that those are my grandbabies and so it makes it

137
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:46.740
Erika Romero: It makes it to where I can't you know most people I can just say, okay, what whatever I don't care you know

138
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.830
Erika Romero: But these are my grandbabies and

139
00:14:51.120 --> 00:15:03.270
Erika Romero: And I do care. You know, and I think the thing that bothers me the most is that this is literally. This is what my daughter thrives on, you know, this is what

140
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:21.330
Erika Romero: She gets her kicks off of is to know that this is how I feel that this is what she's making me feel because if I'm not bending to her and giving her everything that she wants regard regardless of what it is.

141
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.000
Erika Romero: Um,

142
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.080
Erika Romero: Would you excuse me for just a second. Let me grab a tissue. Okay.

143
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.150
Erika Romero: I'm sorry Domini

144
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.260
Dominique Pozo: That's okay.

145
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.950
Dominique Pozo: I just wanna

146
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:30.180
Dominique Pozo: I want to just reflect back what I'm hearing I'm hearing that you've made some really conscious choices to

147
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:48.000
Dominique Pozo: You know, allow who around who you allow into your life and how much you allow them in and sounds like you've been doing, you know, you've been doing your work around setting boundaries with your daughter and not letting her in so close because you know what that results in

148
00:16:51.360 --> 00:17:05.850
Erika Romero: Yeah, yeah. And that's hard for it that that's hard just normally as a parent, you know, to, to distance yourself yeah and and to put those boundaries in place, but

149
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:14.280
Erika Romero: Over the years, I mean that she hasn't given me any other option, you know, I've because I've tried and tried and tried with her.

150
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:15.720
Erika Romero: And

151
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:22.890
Erika Romero: So I've had to figure out how I can protect myself.

152
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.660
Erika Romero: And and the best way that I can protect myself is by

153
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.880
Erika Romero: Cutting her out of my life because she's just so painful for me, you know, I'm

154
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.140
Erika Romero: At work costs. It's my grandchildren.

155
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:45.120
Erika Romero: Grandchildren are the ones that are always in middle of this. I mean, my daughter had my

156
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.930
Erika Romero: granddaughter literally snatched out of my arms by CPS because

157
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.340
Erika Romero: Because I kicked her out of my house for using drugs.

158
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.560
Erika Romero: So her way to get even with me was to take the baby.

159
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.490
Erika Romero: Because I wasn't gonna let her do my house. And so now she's doing it with this baby to

160
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:20.070
Erika Romero: You know, and it like I don't know if I told you but you know it took me a while, a few months because my daughter was here after this, this baby was born.

161
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.390
Erika Romero: She was there for about six, six or seven months.

162
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:33.750
Erika Romero: And I think probably the first three, three months or three or four months. I didn't have much to do with the baby at all and

163
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.860
Erika Romero: And it was that was a hard

164
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:48.570
Erika Romero: hard choice for me. But it wasn't really a conscious decision, it wasn't something that I said, Okay, I'm not gonna have anything to do with Eva because

165
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:56.850
Erika Romero: I'M A, B, or C. I. I think that was a subconscious kind of decision.

166
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.500
Erika Romero: Um,

167
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.480
Erika Romero: Because that that was my safe card. You know what I mean. And

168
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:12.180
Erika Romero: And then, of course, I let my guard down and and I started getting attached to the baby and

169
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.600
Erika Romero: Then, no, you know, we're back at the same we're back in the same place. You know what I mean it.

170
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.600
Erika Romero: Back in the same boat went with her and

171
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.310
Erika Romero: We ended up having to kick her out again because she

172
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:39.570
Erika Romero: She says she starts huge fights with me over the most my new things and she starts getting very physical and so call the police and

173
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:48.480
Erika Romero: Yeah, she'll sit and or I'll call the police and have them at try to get them to escort her off the premises.

174
00:19:48.990 --> 00:20:01.410
Erika Romero: And she'll stand in the background screaming at me screaming. Don't hit me. You're going to hit me. Don't hit me. I have the baby at my hands, you know, that kind of stuff you know and and

175
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:15.720
Erika Romero: Where I'm not even at that point. You know what I mean, where I'm hitting her I don't hit her. Um, I don't. And I would never even dream of hitting her with a baby in her hand, you know,

176
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:26.010
Erika Romero: Um, but, uh, she's done that to me on on a couple of occasions where I've tried to call the cost of her escorted because she's elevated to that.

177
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:40.500
Erika Romero: To that point where I can't handle her anymore, and she will literally the last, the last time she was here, she even hurt herself. I don't know what she did.

178
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:49.830
Erika Romero: But she put scratches on herself and when the cops GOT THERE SHE TRIED TO TELL THE COPS THAT I did that to her.

179
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:57.210
Erika Romero: And I had to show them my hands and and stuff and show them. I didn't, you know, I don't have any marks on me.

180
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:12.000
Erika Romero: You know, and there's no way in hell that she's gonna allow me to stay hit her and Bruce her up. She bang your head on something and gave herself a knock on her head and scratches on her arm and she did all that to herself.

181
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:23.100
Erika Romero: And here I am with her daughter and without even thinking about what would happen to that to my granddaughter. You know what I mean, if it took me to jail.

182
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:41.400
Erika Romero: It was something that she was trying to do so that she could get even with me. You know what I mean. For for throwing her out, you know, and everything. That's the only way that she knows how to destroy me us through my children or through my grandchildren. I'm sorry.

183
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:53.670
Dominique Pozo: So Erica. So I have a question. So this sounds like not it's not changing. This is what's going on, it's not changing. What can you do to continue

184
00:21:54.180 --> 00:22:06.660
Dominique Pozo: Making the change from your own self, and in your life and it doesn't take away the deep pain, but I'm just wondering is there. What would you like to do with all, you know, how would you like to move forward with all of this.

185
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.740
Erika Romero: All right, I, to be honest with you, I really don't know.

186
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:27.450
Erika Romero: I don't know. I mean, for me, I'll eventually get get through this. You know what I mean it. This is just all so new and then you know I have both of both of the girls that are

187
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:51.990
Erika Romero: Making some really stupid choices right now. And like I said, I really don't care what they do with their lives, they're growing their, their grownups you know 2526 years old. They're already grown up. I can't fix their lives. I can't direct their lives anymore. I've done my job and so

188
00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:03.930
Erika Romero: What they do with their own selves, that's their problem. What bothers me is the fact that they're dragging these babies through this and

189
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:11.970
Erika Romero: That and it's such a, you know, it kind of seems like it was like us on both sides, you know,

190
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:23.700
Erika Romero: And this news came from about both the girls within just two days of each other, you know, and it like floored me and

191
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:30.390
Erika Romero: You know, and at that point. That's just what I felt so so helpless.

192
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.610
Erika Romero: Been scared.

193
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.700
Dominique Pozo: Scared for the little ones.

194
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.410
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

195
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.240
Dominique Pozo: Well,

196
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.790
Erika Romero: I don't want to see. I don't. I honestly, I do not want to see another one of my grandchildren.

197
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.450
Erika Romero: Be taken into custody yet.

198
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.860
Erika Romero: I just, I just don't want that ever

199
00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:00.030
Dominique Pozo: Is there anything that you imagine you can do to to prevent that from happening.

200
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:16.770
Erika Romero: I don't know. I don't know what I can do, and that that's that's the biggest. That's the biggest problem, you know, because neither one of them are going to are going to bend right now, you know, and say oh yeah you know the right decision is

201
00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.170
Erika Romero: You know, send the baby to go live with my with my mom, you know,

202
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:28.440
Erika Romero: Of all the people out in the world, you know, because I'm the baby to go live. My mom. Yeah. Right. You know,

203
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:35.400
Erika Romero: But knowing that that would, you know, ultimate ultimately be the best decision.

204
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:44.910
Erika Romero: She could make for that, that the ABM but that that's for both of the girls, you know, the my granddaughter.

205
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:56.460
Erika Romero: My little granddaughter is my daughter's meal ticket you know she gets she gets benefits to the states through the states. If you don't have email. She has nothing

206
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.050
Erika Romero: She has nothing to acknowledge it can't be in that program. She can't be in that apartment.

207
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.260
Erika Romero: So her, you know,

208
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:13.500
Erika Romero: Yeah, even as her meal ticket and she hasn't, you know, she doesn't know who the baby status. She has no idea so

209
00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:31.080
Erika Romero: You know, there's not even a father to step in the picture and say, you know, let me get custody of his baby ensure ensure write this out all the way until the end. And then before you know it, she'll be the baby up and states custody.

210
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.940
Erika Romero: You know, and then by that time, it's

211
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:53.820
Erika Romero: Too late for me, you know, because I can't, I can't go to the state, regardless of what changes I've made in my life or or show, you know how well taken care of my granddaughter is, you know, they don't give a crap. All they all they care about it is, is 28 years ago.

212
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.030
Erika Romero: You know, a file was made.

213
00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.850
Erika Romero: You know where they took my children.

214
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:20.070
Erika Romero: It wasn't because of abuse. It was because I was a drug addict and I wasn't able to properly care for for them at that time. So neglect. That's something that can be fixed and and was fixed. And so, you know, but all they see is a file.

215
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.910
Erika Romero: That's it.

216
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.370
Dominique Pozo: Huh. So this, this sounds like

217
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.650
Dominique Pozo: A situation that is not

218
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:39.210
Dominique Pozo: You can't really do much at this point. So what can you do for yourself. This next week.

219
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:46.380
Dominique Pozo: Sounds like you're still kind of in shock and processing everything that's going on. Yeah.

220
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:54.000
Erika Romero: I don't know it. Like I said, it's something that are going to have to deal with.

221
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.800
Erika Romero: But it's all just so new.

222
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.500
Erika Romero: I mean, and so

223
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.940
Erika Romero: eventually get through it. You know, I just

224
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.380
Erika Romero: Until then, until then I'm

225
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.120
Erika Romero: Just something that's going to be sitting on my plate for a while, you know,

226
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.390
Erika Romero: But eventually I'll get through that I'm not one to two

227
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.460
Erika Romero: To relapse.

228
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.570
Erika Romero: Or fall back go backwards. That's not me.

229
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.690
Erika Romero: So you know I don't want you to worry about that.

230
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.090
Erika Romero: Well,

231
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.190
Erika Romero: It's just like I said, it's just also news. Oh, it's just

232
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.870
Dominique Pozo: Some, yeah. You're in

233
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.200
Erika Romero: My mind right now and that that okay that's just whirling, you know, and

234
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:52.020
Dominique Pozo: But

235
00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:00.480
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm wondering, and I know this is kind of off the, the kind of the crisis of what's going on, but

236
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.610
Dominique Pozo: Have you journaled at all in the last week or so and

237
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.250
Erika Romero: I have it. I have it.

238
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.080
Erika Romero: I know I probably shared it and

239
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:20.250
Erika Romero: I don't know, I've never really been much oh one on journaling and so

240
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:28.770
Erika Romero: I've never been one that's had a diary or a journal or, you know, that kind of stuff. He knows growing up.

241
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:30.630
Erika Romero: I'm

242
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.310
Erika Romero: I'm just hearing

243
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.230
Erika Romero: It is kind of hard to get into that habit, you know,

244
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.850
Erika Romero: Putting putting stuff down on paper.

245
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.630
Dominique Pozo: And just hearing such

246
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:49.440
Erika Romero: Pain and

247
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.160
Dominique Pozo: I'm

248
00:28:53.250 --> 00:29:03.060
Dominique Pozo: I was going to say, I'm just hearing too much pain. I am wondering if you know just having the journal to write in whenever you feel a big wave or flood coming through.

249
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:14.190
Dominique Pozo: You know if that would be a good outlet for you to be able to, you know, let it out and keep processing through it not holding it in

250
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:17.850
Erika Romero: Yeah.

251
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:20.640
Erika Romero: I can try.

252
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.420
Erika Romero: That I don't know how much of a promise. I can make

253
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:34.530
Erika Romero: It just, it's not one of those things that comes natural. For me, it's me when I deal with things I deal with them differently and

254
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:47.220
Erika Romero: I'm writing them down isn't isn't something that I've ever done. Like I said, so it would have to be something that I would have to kind of get used to, you know, get into the habit of doing

255
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.040
Erika Romero: But I can try.

256
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:57.120
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering too. I've noticed the two times that will first when I mentioned journaling, then you talked about it.

257
00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:05.340
Dominique Pozo: Your hand went right to your neck and and I'm just wondering if you can bring it back there. And I'm curious because the body holds so much information and

258
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:14.820
Dominique Pozo: And I've been watching you kind of rub your neck like this. And I'm wondering, what if you place your hand there and just sit with it. What's going on, what's going on in there.

259
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.620
Erika Romero: That's my tension.

260
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:31.680
Erika Romero: Tension spot. So when I get when I get stressed. That's where you know that's huge. Usually, where I grab ahold of that or the back of my neck is, you know, and I don't know if that's just kind of like that.

261
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:43.530
Erika Romero: That place where I kind of just squeeze or if that's where my attention is coming from. But I've noticed that about me, too, is that whenever I get stressed. That's where my head goes back here.

262
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.440
Erika Romero: To the back of my neck.

263
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.680
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, let's see if you can we put your hand back there and just take a moment and

264
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.640
Dominique Pozo: Take a few deep breaths holding holding that part of your neck. Yeah.

265
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.920
Dominique Pozo: Just imagine you know if there was like a healing color.

266
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:17.010
Dominique Pozo: Imagine that you're kind of infusing your next space with that healing color. What would that be, and really take your time and using your breath.

267
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:24.960
Dominique Pozo: So as you're inhaling imagining the color and as you exhale, imagine that color spreading through your neck.

268
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:45.060
Dominique Pozo: And then while you're here, just if your neck could speak. Would it just keep your hand there and it says. It says, if your hand is listening. If your neck could speak, would it say anything.

269
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.250
Erika Romero: I think it would say

270
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.290
Erika Romero: That

271
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:05.250
Erika Romero: There's a lot going on that.

272
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.040
Erika Romero: That I'm your support.

273
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.080
Erika Romero: Your support between your, your head and your

274
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:18.990
Erika Romero: And your body, your art.

275
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:26.220
Erika Romero: Color is

276
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.250
Erika Romero: Like a teal blue

277
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.110
Dominique Pozo: What does that bring up as you do all that.

278
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.880
Erika Romero: I just get tired of being drugs and

279
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.580
Dominique Pozo: Who can you turn to, to kind of hold you up.

280
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:11.220
Erika Romero: I don't know.

281
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:24.030
Dominique Pozo: Doesn't sound like your husband. This is the kind of support that you're needing right now is that I carry other

282
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.650
Erika Romero: Yeah.

283
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.770
Erika Romero: I tried to talk to him about it the other day, and next thing I know is

284
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.390
Erika Romero: I gotta go feed the dogs.

285
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.230
Erika Romero: Don't know if he just doesn't know how

286
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.930
Dominique Pozo: So, am I correct me if I'm wrong, but what I'm also hearing is that you're kind of alone in this. Right now you don't have

287
00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:58.800
Dominique Pozo: Kind of like

288
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.760
Dominique Pozo: Maybe day to day deep support that would be really helpful right now.

289
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:07.560
Erika Romero: Yeah.

290
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:08.310
Yeah.

291
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:10.290
Erika Romero: But that

292
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:18.540
Erika Romero: That's why I always have to learn how to depend on myself and be that that strength for me because

293
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:28.380
Erika Romero: Whether or not. I've been in a marriage or or whatever that so always been to, I could depend on most

294
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.090
Erika Romero: I'm the only one that understands you know

295
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:41.250
Erika Romero: These kids ate his, you know, so he doesn't have any emotional connection to my daughter or

296
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.510
Erika Romero: My

297
00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.050
Yeah.

298
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.400
Dominique Pozo: But it doesn't sound like he's able to offer you much empathy right now, either.

299
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.140
Yeah.

300
00:34:53.730 --> 00:35:04.200
Erika Romero: My mom. My mom is such a basket case that when I try to talk to her. I can't even get an a word in edgewise. She has to

301
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.560
Erika Romero: talk talk talk talk talk talk over everybody and

302
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:16.020
Erika Romero: She don't do much listened either, but that's always been my mom so

303
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.580
Erika Romero: That's nothing new.

304
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:40.950
Erika Romero: But, as usual, I'll be okay. Our through it, you know.

305
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.630
Erika Romero: I just thanks for letting me

306
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:47.730
Erika Romero: Fit.

307
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.560
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

308
00:35:52.620 --> 00:36:01.620
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm wondering, I think. Switching gears might be a good thing. And I'm wondering if you can grab a pen and a paper. If you have Microsoft cramps or something. I

309
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:09.570
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering, I'd love to see what the part of you that does take care of yourself. What does she look like. Let's get a visual for her.

310
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:19.620
Dominique Pozo: So you can really call on her when you need her. You can really call on her and it can be it can be it can look like you. It could be an animal that could be a whole other

311
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:27.720
Dominique Pozo: Image, but just really take a moment and think into a few consider that part that holds you because sounds like

312
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:41.940
Dominique Pozo: You don't have anyone else to right now. So that part that you can depend on. That's really strong and big and and capable. What does she look like, or he maybe it's a masculine part of you. Who knows.

313
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:10.500
Dominique Pozo: And after you illustrate this part, maybe just write a few words around like, you know, describing her to

314
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.620
Erika Romero: Are you ready

315
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.090
Dominique Pozo: Yes, yes.

316
00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:29.940
Erika Romero: I can, I can show you if I turn it sideways.

317
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.810
Dominique Pozo: Okay, yeah. Wow. Well, you tell me about her.

318
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:35.790
Erika Romero: Okay, so

319
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.840
Erika Romero: These parts up on the top here and here. I don't know if I can

320
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:50.190
Erika Romero: Hear in here. This is kind of like that electric part of me know that part where that

321
00:40:52.590 --> 00:41:05.610
Erika Romero: Yeah, electrifying kind of thought process comes out around her is like a box. Okay. And on the side here is

322
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.190
Erika Romero: Our little like real

323
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:17.610
Erika Romero: Wavy lines. And so that's kind of like that pressure coming in. So the box around her is

324
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.300
Erika Romero: Is that, is that protection is that

325
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.010
Erika Romero: Those, those barriers from the pressure coming in from

326
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:34.890
Erika Romero: From the

327
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.150
Erika Romero: You know those

328
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:53.220
Erika Romero: electrifying thoughts you know the the box around her is more like that safeguard your hair standing up because I, she's a little bit on the wild side.

329
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.180
Erika Romero: Matt scientists kind of

330
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.960
Erika Romero: gives her that

331
00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.030
Erika Romero: makes her

332
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.310
Erika Romero: That crazy, crazy part of her

333
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:17.940
Erika Romero: That the hands holding that all that back. You know what I mean. And so that that's kind of what she looks like right

334
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:19.710
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

335
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:28.800
Erika Romero: So that's that anxiety that stress that madness. That's kind of coming from her, I guess.

336
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:38.850
Erika Romero: And she's trying to protect herself, and that's where she is in her little box.

337
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:48.360
Dominique Pozo: From her neck down if you could write what message does she have any like words of wisdom or some sort of message for you.

338
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.310
Erika Romero: Um,

339
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:52.350
Erika Romero: See

340
00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:03.060
Erika Romero: I don't know if you'll be able to read it because it's in pencil, but it says you are strong and brave nothing in you can be broken. That can't be fixed.

341
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:03.960
Huh.

342
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.030
Dominique Pozo: Huh.

343
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:16.920
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think you know what what's happening in your world is just, it's so big and it's so much and it's it's it's gonna

344
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:33.150
Dominique Pozo: I imagine continue to elicit suffering for you yet this voice is reminding you, okay, you've got the strength, you can get through this, you know, just a good reminder when it feels overwhelming, you know,

345
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:46.710
Dominique Pozo: Do you think it would be helpful to put her up in your mirror and just have her there to remind you, you know what, you carry the strength you carry

346
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.770
Erika Romero: Sure again.

347
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.490
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

348
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:59.580
Dominique Pozo: Because, I mean, I imagine, Erica. This is heartbreaking. It's the biggest heartbreak. And so, you know, to just know that

349
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.450
Dominique Pozo: You have this other part of you that is

350
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.490
Dominique Pozo: Claiming her strength and her her limits and her

351
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:09.270
Boundaries.

352
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.580
Dominique Pozo: You've done a lot of work. I mean, to get to that.

353
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.280
Dominique Pozo: Place and to even have access to that is huge.

354
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.010
Erika Romero: Yeah, I agree.

355
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.150
Yeah.

356
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.380
Erika Romero: I guess it just, it's just kind of like

357
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.580
Erika Romero: Going back in time, you know, to me,

358
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.020
Erika Romero: That feels like

359
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.910
Erika Romero: Going back into a place that I fought so hard to come from.

360
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.100
Erika Romero: You know,

361
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.160
Dominique Pozo: It's kind of like a rewind.

362
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:50.460
Erika Romero: Yeah.

363
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:54.690
Erika Romero: Yeah.

364
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.090
Erika Romero: When I lost my kids, it was, it was hard. It was the hardest thing.

365
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.750
Erika Romero: That I ever would do and

366
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.800
Erika Romero: And it keeps happening. And you know, I spent a lot year

367
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.320
Erika Romero: Reclaiming my life and

368
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.830
Erika Romero: Standing on my own two feet and becoming

369
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.010
Erika Romero: Who I am today and

370
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.830
Erika Romero: It almost felt like

371
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.280
Erika Romero: You know having to go through this with my daughter over and over. It sounds like

372
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:42.690
Erika Romero: That just kind of keeps bringing, bringing that all back you know

373
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:49.230
Erika Romero: Keeps trying to and keeps pulling me into this place that

374
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.580
Erika Romero: That I fought so hard to free myself from, you know,

375
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:58.590
Erika Romero: Then those feelings and emotion.

376
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:12.090
Erika Romero: But I think, I think the hardest part for me is just knowing that my daughter thinks so little of me that this is how she

377
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:17.280
Erika Romero: She thinks that it would be to get you with somebody, you know what I mean.

378
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.250
Erika Romero: And it wouldn't even her own children.

379
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.700
Erika Romero: Don't matter enough to her to

380
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.510
Erika Romero: To to take care of that. You know what I mean to write that.

381
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:49.470
Dominique Pozo: Very sick behavior. I mean to you want to use children to pretty much as you say a free meal ticket and then to really manipulate with them against you. It's, it's very sick behavior.

382
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.760
Erika Romero: Yeah, I know.

383
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.640
Erika Romero: Yeah, and that's, you know,

384
00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:01.560
Erika Romero: Who knows if someday you know i i get reconnected with my grandchildren. You know, I don't know.

385
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:09.540
Erika Romero: How do how do you explain that to them. You know what I mean. Yeah, because she will. And so

386
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:19.500
Erika Romero: You know somebody's got to tell them you know they're going to want to know why they are, where they are. And, you know, why didn't. Why didn't I step in

387
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.680
Erika Romero: To be there for them, you know, and how do you explain that to a child, you know,

388
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:37.620
Erika Romero: OR LIKE MY GRANDDAUGHTER THAT I HAVE NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT TO HER later on in her life as to why her sisters are here, you know,

389
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:48.210
Erika Romero: Yeah, I don't even know how to begin or were you know what words I would even use it and I've thought about that so often about

390
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.640
Erika Romero: About that, you know, I know. That's so far into the future.

391
00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:53.970
Then

392
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.850
Erika Romero: maybe by the time she gets old enough to comprehend what what else going on.

393
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:13.350
Erika Romero: You know, show that maybe I won't have you know that I won't have already found the words and two, and I'm able to describe to her what happened but

394
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.690
Erika Romero: You know, how do you tell that to to a child, you know,

395
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:27.960
Erika Romero: That your mom cared so little about you that she let your sisters, go to CVS and, you know,

396
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:38.010
Dominique Pozo: I, I, I, actually, I'm not quite sure if it's that mom care so little about them mom is just completely, you know, taken by her addiction.

397
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:47.100
Dominique Pozo: At the moment, all that mom cares about is getting her fix, you know, and I think it's a different put weight place to put the focus that

398
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:56.220
Dominique Pozo: Is really difficult for a child to understand yet that's actually what's happening mom can't even be there for the kids because she can't be there for herself.

399
00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:04.020
Erika Romero: Yeah, but that's not even that's not even the whole story. I mean, I could understand it. That was the story. You know what I mean.

400
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.230
Erika Romero: I mean she

401
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:28.290
Erika Romero: She's, she's deliberately taken these kids away from me you know and and even tried to have this one taken for me, just for out of revenge sake, you know, just to get even with me, you know, kind of sick person is that, you know, I can

402
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:48.030
Erika Romero: Play if it was just her if it was just her dicks. And I can say that, you know, while your mom was sick, she you know she wasn't added, but she's so far beyond that, you know, she's just such an evil person and and these kids are the ones they get stuck in the middle of it.

403
00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:59.340
Erika Romero: So not only does it break my heart that these kids have to go to CPS but then you know it, it kills me to know that these kids are stuck in the middle of all this bullshit.

404
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:00.210
What

405
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:09.360
Dominique Pozo: Do you believe that the drugs have actually impacted her you know her make her cognition her mental capacity.

406
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.160
Erika Romero: Oh yeah so

407
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:27.540
Dominique Pozo: It's all connected. You know, you sure it's not just the addiction, yet I do believe that the drugs have damaged her centers of the brain that you know are able to have empathy and compassion and and actually extend past so

408
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.260
Erika Romero: I guess so.

409
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.390
Erika Romero: Yeah, you know, that's the thing is that

410
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.370
Erika Romero: And I would

411
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:41.160
Erika Romero: I beg to differ with you just a little bit because my daughter who hasn't

412
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:50.520
Erika Romero: It hasn't always been on crowds, but she's always been that kind of a vindictive person. You know what I mean.

413
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:58.560
Erika Romero: So I, I suppose, from the time she turned about 10 or 11 is when she started getting like that and

414
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:04.380
Erika Romero: The drugs have impacted that a whole lot, you know,

415
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:06.810
Erika Romero: But

416
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.130
Erika Romero: It's not just only the drugs, you know, for her.

417
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:22.260
Erika Romero: And I don't know. You know, I've had her in treatment. Over the years, I've had her in in therapy. I've had her in

418
00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.090
Erika Romero: You name it. I've done it with her. You know what I mean.

419
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:45.150
Erika Romero: We never have been able to get to the root of the problem, you know, and it's more more so because she's refused to just follow through with anything. And so, you know, we start getting into her treatment and then

420
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:53.640
Erika Romero: Before you know it, she's run away or she's you know skipped out of the treatment facility or whatever.

421
00:52:54.690 --> 00:53:03.150
Erika Romero: Um, and, you know, and then we're back to square one. So we never really got to the root of the problem with her, but she's always been like that.

422
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:03.630
Dominique Pozo: Even

423
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.280
Erika Romero: For me, I mean it's just

424
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:09.060
Erika Romero: It's just magnified that be bigger.

425
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.990
