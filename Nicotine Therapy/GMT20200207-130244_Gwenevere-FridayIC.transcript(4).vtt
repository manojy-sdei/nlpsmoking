5
00:00:47.910 --> 00:01:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Not bad, actually. I've been, you know, pretty considered I accidentally woke up at like 430 so it's like well I can get a little extra reading this morning. So I got up. I was like, all I'm awake usually wake up. So what's the difference

6
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me get in an Inuit for us.

7
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm probably going to want to do a little bit more of the yam. Dr. Do you have the ability to set that up this morning.

8
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.810
olivas: Yeah.

9
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: With the two objects about a way

10
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You take the care that and then I'm going to get in this database here somehow

11
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your mood.

12
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your overall mood and

13
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been feeling your mood.

14
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.440
olivas: Yeah.

15
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.160
olivas: I'm

16
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.230
olivas: Happy

17
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see we needed to review calls or anything 230. Yeah, we do. Okay, so let me just jump in here and make a little me just make a statement for each one of these goals.

18
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to work on assertiveness, so

19
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your goal.

20
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.360
olivas: And

21
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Had a little bit in January of I, I was not

22
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I was not uncomfortable. Right. So that sounds like somewhat comfort in redirecting a friend slash coworker normally would have been a Pleaser in that moment.

23
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't be everything to everybody. So when you reflect, you know, over the last month.

24
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see yourself sort of making some improvement around assertive communication and in sort of confidence. I think there was a piece of that too.

25
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.040
olivas: Yeah, I'm feeling better. I'm feeling more comfortable and

26
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.380

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And your ability to rely on your actual experience and right

30
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, solving a problem in the moment, things like that. Not deferring elsewhere, but are you noticing, you're able to sort of in a calm sort of relaxed body able to make decisions.

31
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Give directives, yeah.

32
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.780

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm feeling more comfortable in my job and responsibilities.

34
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.660
Mm hmm.

35
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything more on that.

36
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Assertive part that you had noted that you

37
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.700

52
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to work on assertiveness, which you can use for your respective quite heard it. I can hear it in leader and delegate, but it's still a general

53
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can grab a story that evidence is that

54
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.530
I'm

55
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.290
olivas: What else my

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.780
olivas: Case workers.

57
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.110
olivas: came up to me last week and says,

58
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:14.670
olivas: I don't have my audit done and it's not going to be done. So if you guys have to write me up, then I guess I'm going to have a write up because it's just not going to get done.

59
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.960
olivas: So I so what what do you have done what. Tell me what you have

60
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:34.680
olivas: So we went and looked at his paperwork and he had most of it done in his computer. But he hadn't crossed check the hard files to have the right date.

61
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.260
olivas: For his treatment plans and everything is automated.

62
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.710
olivas: So he said,

63
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.850
olivas: I'm just been so busy as info swamp. So I said, well,

64
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.910
olivas: Okay. So, tomorrow you have

65
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.390
olivas: I see you have blocked.

66
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.070
olivas: For an hour a home visit a couple of home visits, I said.

67
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:22.170
olivas: You might want to cancel those and work on your audit so that you can get it done. I said, I don't want to get in trouble and not turn anything. So we need to try and work on this. And then as much time as you have to finish this because it's it was due at the end of the day.

68
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that like for you to to say you need to finish this to walk them over to literally look at what he has got into problem solving and gave him a recommendation of how to allocate his time and summary of you need to finish this.

69
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.420
olivas: What was that like for yeah it's not good i i'm

70
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:59.220
olivas: Felt good knowing that I knew, I knew it had to be done and I knew that his work needed to be turned in. And what they were looking for from us. So it was I was comfortable and telling him.

71
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:17.910
olivas: We got to get this part done I'll help you. I tell them, I'll even I'll help you. I'll say if you need help kind of push back on all my ideas. He didn't even like that do this well. There's no way I can cancel those home visits. And I said,

72
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.310
olivas: Well,

73
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:30.450
olivas: It looks to me like you don't have any other options like this is the last, that's the last hour of the day. And if you're not working on it.

74
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:49.500
olivas: You know at this point going to those home visits, you're not going to get, you're not going to meet your hours for the month as it is. So going there isn't even important anymore because if you're not meeting, you're not going to make sure our unit.

75
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.210
olivas: So I would really recommend

76
00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.900
olivas: Counseling loan that our to have to work on it. You can have it back, how

77
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Distressing was his pushed back

78
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:18.750
olivas: He had a reason for, like, Well, no, because if I if I just had a cat. Although the because look at my week next week. And he's trying to show me all his birthdays and

79
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:31.590
olivas: I really have to get the home visits in and I'm like okay but decided is more important, they've told us, they've been telling us this week, we've known about this for a week.

80
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's good. What I'm asking is how distressing. Was it

81
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.970
olivas: Was your

82
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.230
Briefs wedding.

83
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.390
olivas: Work for you.

84
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it, we got it like zero to 100 we've got 100 being sort of this I'm enraged can't think straight

85
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I want to run out of the room.

86
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of at that zero is

87
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still able to look them in the eye and your voice stays real calm and you're staying poised very clear, you know, and so the heart isn't racing. Um, what, what was it like

88
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:20.100
olivas: Um, I wasn't out. I kept my composure and

89
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.520
olivas: Have my tone and

90
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.210
olivas: Trying to drive home the point that

91
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.470
olivas: This is important. We've known about this.

92
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.410
olivas: But I do want to use all our time that we have left to get it done.

93
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you when you look at this goal. I want to work on assertiveness.

94
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you met your goal. Do you want to create a new one.

95
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.510
olivas: I'm

96
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.160
olivas: More work at it. I'm feeling that way.

97
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.330
Anywhere.

98
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.180
olivas: I'm feeling better.

99
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:08.040
olivas: Getting it done and and having to be the bad guy, you know, and

100
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.400
olivas: I don't want to

101
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:20.640
olivas: I want to be afraid to do it because I still sometimes I still feel a little anxiousness

102
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:32.280
olivas: And having in the moment of, okay, I have to wrap this up some state. I'm gonna have to, you know, this agree with what they're saying.

103
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

104
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What is

105
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that never completely goes away. What is that if you knew that that was normal.

106
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.050
olivas: Um,

107
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:56.520
olivas: I'd be I'd be okay with that because I I still know that I know my responsibilities and I know what needs to be done and

108
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It kept you from taking action if it like you like like didn't leave your office you decided I would rather avoid conflict. Well, then we have something that's not adaptive, but it might just be because you are

109
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we're the social people because you have awareness. Right.

110
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And habits attunement with others, you may still get a little bit of nervousness. Now I. That's what I was asking you earlier was how you felt when you were doing it.

111
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So really, one of the things that I had identified that might have assisted you was to identify identifying the environment people or the setting that you find

112
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: most challenging and asserting your, your needs your wants preferences. So, and this is at work, which is you can do it anywhere but

113
00:13:48.690 --> 00:14:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a particular type of person, is there a certain setting. Is there a certain environment that you can kind of zero in and you really what's left where you want to work. Would you say on assertiveness.

114
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.700
olivas: Well, I guess. With this particular

115
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.400
olivas: Coworkers he

116
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.940
olivas: He questioned everything that we have set in place he be

117
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.970
olivas: Intelligent and

118
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.290
olivas: compensable attitude comes across as kind of a know it all.

119
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:45.510
olivas: And why do you do things this way that's that's outrageous. I can't believe that there's such little oversight and the notes and nobody looks at them to

120
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.310
olivas: Double check our work and and it's like, well,

121
00:14:51.480 --> 00:15:04.920
olivas: That's just how it's always been like, I guess you can talk to the boss. If you feel it, you know, you have something to contribute and you think something can can come something, there's a better way to do it.

122
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:12.450
olivas: Feel free to talk to, you know, the box. But for now, this is what we have to do.

123
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:14.610
olivas: Okay.

124
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

125
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What needs improvement. I can't, I can't hear it because at this point I can hear you're able to meet his resistance. And this is an example someone that pushes back at you.

126
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.660
And you gave him a solution. Tell me.

127
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you hoping that assertiveness will be without any of the angst and the nervousness.

128
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.920
olivas: Yeah.

129
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.170
olivas: Yeah.

130
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say

131
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Over time,

132
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll, you'll see, just as you have that it's gotten easier.

133
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's

134
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Take time really getting like this is not about me this resistance. You know, I just have this job to do. These are the member right this. These are the tasks of the job. This is what I'm asked to do. Are you willing to do your, your tasks.

135
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of, you know, infrastructure and and systemic concerns that you have maybe or are for a broader audience in a meeting or you know somewhere week that can get solved, but that's a bigger

136
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: bigger issue that would distract from what needs to get done in the next hour.

137
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That all won't get fixed in the next hour. But what I'm asking for can. So let's do what we can do in the next hour.

138
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, right. And I think if you knew that there's going to be a little bit still present

139
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It means you're, you're still a caring person. You know, I think my guess is it's not going to go completely away.

140
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, meaning that you make out of it and then you regulate you go, okay, wait, no, I've thought it through. This is the appropriate thing this fits my job description.

141
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't tell this person. I'm not doing my job. Well, then my fear is getting in the way. Okay, I need to go talk to them.

142
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. All right, that's not happening then assertiveness right isn't isn't present

143
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

144
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll tell you what.

145
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how stressful. That one was, let's go zero to 100 how distressing. Was it

146
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll all extend target date and we'll find ways to continue to work on that communication with my mother, maybe a little statement about that one. That's a goal of yours. How you doing with it.

147
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.480
olivas: Um,

148
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.740
olivas: We've been back and forth a couple of times.

149
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.710
olivas: Nothing.

150
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:46.380
olivas: Yeah.

151
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice Your Your these both of these goals are very they're very general.

152
00:18:53.970 --> 00:19:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication. There's no action. It's not something we can measure it, we could say you've been communicating. So maybe this goal is done. So I just, I wonder if what's needed here, both with work on assertiveness.

153
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That could be a lifetime, right, that can be a lifetime goal.

154
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: ever stopped doing that really work on our style of it and sort of nuance and same with communication with Mother if they're a little vague there so general and I focus so much on on measurability and

155
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And things like that. This both of these are hard for me because I want to be like well, have you reached it or not.

156
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:38.790
olivas: Yeah.

157
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be helpful, but I can't tell what you want to do with communication with Mother, I don't know what you want to do it.

158
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:45.690
olivas: Mm hmm.

159
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication with all it says, Well, what about it. What do you want to do with it.

160
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.690
Yeah.

161
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.620
olivas: I guess I want to get the elephant out of the room about if we're gonna

162
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:16.050
olivas: Have a relationship. I mean, it's like we always do we get into this huge fight and then start happening again. And it's like nothing happened. And then we don't discuss what happened.

163
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.480
olivas: Um,

164
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.640
olivas: I guess I still feel like I need to discuss what

165
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.970
olivas: The problem in with her.

166
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you need to actually discuss that's talking to her.

167
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know the difference between talking to her being the outcome you want versus talking to her, and having her show she heard you validates you sees you hears you understand you.

168
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are different outcomes. So what do you want that represents communication with Mother. What, what do you really want

169
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:09.930
olivas: I'm always been afraid to open up a can of worms with her because of

170
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.760
olivas: Fear of what she's going to throw at me.

171
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.790
olivas: Because there's always

172
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.770
olivas: Will never be wrong and

173
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.610
olivas: Always have dinner.

174
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she's been doing this for a long time she's better at it than you are.

175
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.080
Yeah.

176
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.540
olivas: So I don't want to

177
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:47.910
olivas: And I know that's why I avoid her. I know, that's why I avoid even going there with her. So I just keep it.

178
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's see which piece would feel good. Just imagine that we're able to tell her.

179
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you there's a discussion. You want to have

180
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And she was quiet long enough to listen or you wrote it gave it to her an email or something.

181
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: With that Saturday satisfy communication that she just listened to you.

182
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you got to tell her uninterrupted

183
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.300
olivas: Yeah, that would be that would be good to be heard.

184
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Heard okay then. And that's different. So now I'm thinking. So watch what happens. Imagine that you just wrote her an email, you got it all down on paper and you hit send.

185
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the experience of being heard.

186
00:22:54.180 --> 00:23:00.090
olivas: No, I want her to understand my word. I want her to

187
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.850
olivas: Understand my

188
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.250
olivas: Frustration and

189
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what about her as shown you that she's capable emotionally capable of doing that.

190
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.680
olivas: I don't know, she's capable, see what she wants to hear

191
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.320
olivas: I don't know if she'll ever

192
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:43.980
olivas: Ever actually

193
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So you realize that you set yourself up a goal that has nothing to do with you.

194
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Based on someone else's action we I can't make her here you

195
00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Maker here you

196
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't be

197
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Something non threatening to her. She, she's got a story. She's got to stick with it.

198
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You set yourself up for this impossible outcome.

199
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:33.960
olivas: If it

200
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Was just I want to write this letter. I want to get it off my chest. I want to know she read it. Hey, could you just let me know if you read it.

201
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: She writes back read it.

202
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

203
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.100
olivas: Yeah.

204
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it. These are things you

205
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do something about

206
00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: This is setup for just chronic frustration and

207
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably a lot of other things you know that continuation of shame and

208
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not liking yourself because you're avoiding her, you know,

209
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Hasn't changed what, why, why would you want your children to hang around anyone who hasn't changed now. Well, why would you want you to be around someone who's not kind

210
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Not maladaptive that's adaptive

211
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Now if you want to see yourself. Ask and say, hey,

212
00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Combination of assertiveness and communication. I'm going to do it once or twice. I'm going to invite it maybe a couple times a year. I'll say, hey,

213
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't normally have these kind of talks, but

214
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to share with you.

215
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.200
olivas: Something

216
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you open to listening and understanding the mom. Is that what you want to do that first invitation.

217
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.230
olivas: Would be a good

218
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.310
olivas: Way to open the door.

219
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:15.990
Okay.

220
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well then, then you know you also heard yourself say just now. I don't think she's ever going to be able to understand and hear me.

221
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe it's not if you're willing to accept the fact that the answer may be no and the response. Maybe I'll never understand you.

222
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But if that's kind of what it's going to take for you to sort of finally accept

223
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What is

224
00:26:51.480 --> 00:27:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this other way, you're doing it is you're giving yourself a hard time blaming yourself for this avoidance that you're doing. So somehow it's your fault. Now that's natural to avoid someone who's, who's doesn't respect boundaries, who's sort of manipulative and

225
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But if this task, right here, see communication with mother is what it's coming down to is you want to see yourself reach out to her if that's going to feel good in and of itself. You're going to like yourself. Having done that, at least I opened it up.

226
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Then okay then. Is that, is that really the task that you want to do.

227
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.360
olivas: I don't want to do it.

228
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.140
olivas: I i I've avoided it for so long that

229
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.870
olivas: I just have her at arm's length and

230
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.500
olivas: And I've been okay with that. But I feel like she's

231
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.560
olivas: Like she's saying.

232
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.930
olivas: I miss you.

233
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:12.240
olivas: When can you come visit and and I feel like, Well, how can we do that.

234
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:19.530
olivas: Without what's wrong. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.

235
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So you need to, kind of, I think, get a sense of what you're willing to accept.

236
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What bottom line is for you.

237
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If there are certain things that she does that, you simply will not tolerate. Then you can name those I want you know I wanted this has got to be your own deal Carolyn, it's, you know, but maybe it's something like, hey, I

238
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of pulled back because, you know, each time we we talk, it seems like I'm

239
00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I end up saying something that offends you, or something happens and

240
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really confused about it because I feel like I'm getting more and more direct and more honest and

241
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Carolyn me, are you able to identify what the problem is with, are you able to say, I kind of see what's going on here. In order for me to hang out with you more. I need this mean, what do you want for

242
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.790
olivas: It to be easy. I don't want to have to feel

243
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.760
olivas: Like I have to

244
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.300
olivas: Watch what I say.

245
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

246
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.510
And you don't have what

247
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want her to do differently.

248
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this stuff I don't want to watch what I say. You don't have to that you have control of that's the assertive stuff that's the self confidence. That's you. Just saying.

249
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to get hung up on looking at her face looking at her response to something, letting that thread of really, really old abandonment.

250
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: dictate what I feel. Instead, I'm just gonna do what I want to do once you really, I think, come to terms with that it's freeing and you're just like,

251
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I i I'm happy I want to spend time with you but you're going to see a really candid woman here you're going to see someone who's just says exactly what she wants, and does

252
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been doing it more at home. I've been doing it more work. And it kind of like it might be different for you, Mom. I've cut back on sort of focusing in on. I'm kind of making you happy, I need to sort of focus on

253
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of a lot of what makes me happy to and

254
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever it right. Whatever your truth is I don't know what it is.

255
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But this part. Watch what I say. You don't have to watch what you say. You just have to live with her reaction that you have control over.

256
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're sitting here saying, you said the worst thing she may never change if you really believe that an accepted it and you can hang out with her all day long.

257
00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to do her thing, and you're going to be like well

258
00:31:49.050 --> 00:32:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: These 20 minutes we're not bad. These last 10 it's getting kind of uncomfortable. I can see she's doing her normal game. And I think you know what I'm going to head on back to the house. Maybe we can connect with next weekend and go by.

259
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Not trying to change her accepting what is the one

260
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.120
olivas: Yeah.

261
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Do you, you don't have to be small. You don't have to do that thing you've been doing for so so long pretending to be something you're not he

262
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do your thing, but detaching from a change in her behavior would probably serve you.

263
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:33.840
olivas: Yep.

264
00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.030
olivas: Not

265
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.800
olivas: To accept that it's not gonna

266
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: As a side note, if you happen to see something different, which you have

267
00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You set a come. It's just book just little blips you'll notice them and it will be nice. Just don't attack them acknowledge

268
00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That was nice. Look at her. Maybe she's, she's got a little self awareness today.

269
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't take don't expect that it's going to be that way forever.

270
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But these different pieces. One of them is, if you want to see yourself set up that invitation.

271
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's the goal, then I'll write it down, then that's the goal.

272
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:36.930
olivas: Yeah.

273
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll be some more precise thing real timeframe, like, okay, I want to invite her this month tomorrow this weekend. I want to do it in person. I can see what I'm going to do it. I want to know, how do you want to do it. When do you want to do it.

274
00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.790
olivas: Talking about

275
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.400
olivas: Going down there to visit so at

276
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.210
olivas: One of these weekends coming up.

277
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.360
olivas: I can take a trip down there.

278
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And what are you going to say to her.

279
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.210
olivas: Tell her that

280
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.370
olivas: I want to work on this.

281
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.470
olivas: But

282
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.300
olivas: To get my

283
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.830
olivas: Clear the air.

284
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

285
00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It might help since she's not familiar with this really what clear the air as a metaphor, so be really clear about what you

286
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Want

287
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.020
olivas: Because that's going to her some

288
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Some boundaries, some structure on what to expect from you so she doesn't freak out.

289
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What is clear is that she might think about that just unload on her.

290
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:24.990
olivas: Would you

291
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, how hard

292
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:30.420
olivas: Would you want to

293
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to that meeting. If someone says, I want to

294
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.980
I want to meet with you. Oh.

295
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.530
olivas: Yeah, that would

296
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:38.910
olivas: Be

297
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Like oh, they're really going to rip me a new one.

298
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Really want to really go specific

299
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:57.240
olivas: Okay.

300
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.500
olivas: I want to talk to her about

301
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.440
olivas: Everything that been going on in the difference between a lately.

302
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:17.430
olivas: I want to talk about why it was that way and move forward and

303
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.650
olivas: What we can and

304
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a question for

305
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.400
olivas: Listen.

306
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you think she'll say to that.

307
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.440
Okay.

308
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I notice now accepting and willing versus getting her to behave differently.

309
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot less pressure right if you just say

310
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I would like to just be heard just

311
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me talk to you about what was it, why I've had the distance lately.

312
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe explore how we can move forward and maybe my ideas are our ideas we can exchange about what we what we can fix what we can and can you, can you just listen.

313
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.600
olivas: Okay.

314
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that getting closer to what you really want to do as a first step here.

315
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.370
olivas: Yeah, okay.

316
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how can I be helpful. What's, what's coming up for you or concern.

317
00:37:52.290 --> 00:38:06.930
olivas: Just doing IT doing it to the extent that she when she first headset and said we need it off because it's like there was a lot of miscommunication what happened and

318
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.590
olivas: Kind of left it in my

319
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:20.130
olivas: Court. Okay, so I knew, call me please call me when when you've got

320
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The she opened the invitation and you've just been kind of stalling on it.

321
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.370
olivas: I'm okay.

322
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's instead just just take today and just pretend on her, don't just run it through like what you're saying.

323
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to do

324
00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Ties at once you're ready to tell her. Maybe you'll edit some things you'll add some things you'll notice, maybe I'm not saying it the way I want to have had to kind of clear that find another way to say it.

325
00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Though

326
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you picture with her. You're at coffee or in her living room, where are you

327
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:03.330
olivas: The mobile

328
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the childhood kitchen is it. This is not the

329
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.130
olivas: One more.

330
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. All right, so we're there. And then kind of it's handy to have some distraction stuff to kind of keep it's nice to be actually doing something where we're not just

331
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a possibility that you're making some food proper doing something together. Is that a possibility.

332
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.310
Yeah.

333
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

334
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.370
How would you start

335
00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.320
olivas: Well,

336
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.260
olivas: I want to talk to you about

337
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.760
olivas: This whole mess and

338
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.050
olivas: Why we're not, we haven't spoken in so long.

339
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.720
olivas: Been several months that we

340
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.720
olivas: Haven't talked to each other and how it see each other and

341
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.810
olivas: I wanted to clear the air and make make sure we

342
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.650
olivas: Talk about it. We never talked about thing.

343
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To get defense.

344
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're going to be defensive. We never talked about things.

345
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.110
Second thing.

346
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.360
olivas: I don't know is expensive. I know you know the true

347
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

348
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Carolyn, what I've noticed so far is a lot of

349
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: We, we haven't been doing this. Oui oui oui oui oui oui, you haven't done yet. Is the new approach.

350
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Which has to do with

351
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: owning your own feeling now getting out crossing the boundary on to her side, which you don't like when she does to you.

352
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Staying on your side and owning your truth I

353
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Have this is me. I have been avoiding

354
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about what I've been going through over these last months because I'm afraid.

355
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.240
olivas: The difference

356
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What you were doing was analyzing for the both of you.

357
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We haven't been talking about.

358
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You have your side of the story. Maybe she'll share hers.

359
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you wouldn't like it if she did that, she said, well, we, we just are never gonna be like bloody blah, blah, blah.

360
00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:39.120
Yeah.

361
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

362
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You just talk about yourself, Mom.

363
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

364
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes, it's riskier. But there's no room for

365
00:41:52.290 --> 00:42:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way it can be misunderstood. It's this is how I felt feel this is real. I have

366
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What once you try it, see how that feels to talk to me that way. I'm going to be her try it again.

367
00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Another meeting, you know, like, I'm glad I'm here. I love up

368
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.100
olivas: I

369
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.440
olivas: Want to talk to you about why I've been

370
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.720
olivas: Avoiding you

371
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.270
olivas: I felt very sad out on

372
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.910
olivas: So,

373
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.010
olivas: That

374
00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:55.950
olivas: Every time something happens to my sister to shut me up.

375
00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, take a deep breath.

376
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:18.960
olivas: Um,

377
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.020
olivas: I don't understand.

378
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.970
olivas: I don't understand it as it hurts my feelings.

379
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:32.610
Okay.

380
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, it's very possible. If you keep going on and on and on. This won't get addressed. So if you don't let quiet happen.

381
00:43:47.730 --> 00:44:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You move on to the next thing, and you just with this just clearing the air, you're never going to get maybe the even the remotest possibility of seeing him, her eyes that she understands what you're saying.

382
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That out is an expression

383
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any possibility. She's gonna she's going to be. I don't shut you out. I have texted you. Every time something goes on. I tell you, when she goes to the hospital. You see,

384
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a possibility that you can be more specific about shut out still a little

385
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.320
olivas: Nothing to do with me.

386
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.500
olivas: And I'm

387
00:44:48.240 --> 00:45:00.060
olivas: I was trying to find out where she was and what was going on and I even called the hospital and they wouldn't give me any information. And when I asked you.

388
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.950
olivas: If he would call them and give them permission to talk to me.

389
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:06.780
olivas: You said

390
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.290
olivas: That I can't do them.

391
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That is behavior that is the definition of shout out. So I feel shut out. I feel an included

392
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Unimportant and dismissed right getting into actual feeling words. When, you know, for example, Mom, dad got hospitalized and I really wanted to

393
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Get in there and help and understand and the support and I couldn't, I couldn't get there because you wouldn't give me consent to call go and you were saying you were sick. That's, I felt shut out and I now here's the thing.

394
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If you stop there and you say,

395
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to understand it because I'm making up a story about why you did it. And I want. I'm here today to check it out to check my assumptions.

396
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, do you know why you did that.

397
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.410
I mean,

398
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Even you know when we're sick. Well, then we want to lean on family more like

399
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.470
olivas: It.

400
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't make sense to be a mom. Maybe there's big piece that I just don't get our. Do you know what was going on. Like, how, how was shutting me out, helping you. How did that help you

401
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I couldn't help my sister and I got even more scared and and I made up a story that and that's the thing. I don't know what's the story you made up about that. Carolyn, what she did.

402
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.710
olivas: He did it.

403
00:46:54.450 --> 00:47:02.910
olivas: couldn't be bothered. She didn't want me to bother her with my questions or with my with anything.

404
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:08.730
olivas: That fell on me. I'm just so heartbroken and

405
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.480
olivas: So,

406
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.410
olivas: I didn't think that I felt like she

407
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:24.060
olivas: doesn't leave me alone. Don't, don't bother.

408
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And that might very well be exactly what was going on in the air is telling her how that impacted you then there's more how that impact you.

409
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I if I say well I was sick, and I had enough pressure and I didn't want to deal with your questions.

410
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.280
olivas: Maybe feel

411
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.010
olivas: Unwanted and

412
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:04.920
olivas: Unimportant and I was just trying to

413
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.620
olivas: Help my sister. However, I could. I didn't know what was going on.

414
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.210
olivas: I love her. And I just, I was worried

415
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.990
olivas: I was hoping that she would give me some information.

416
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.530
olivas: Okay, you're not feeling good. So, okay.

417
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:36.210
olivas: I can call and figure it out, but they're not going to talk to me there. I already tried that.

418
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And what are you afraid of will happen in the future.

419
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: while you've been avoiding her. Okay, so what are you afraid of will happen in the future.

420
00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:53.820
olivas: Something

421
00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.180
olivas: Let me down with a

422
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.700
olivas: One liner that that good to

423
00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.070
olivas: Me often

424
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So far, I want you to do it right now we don't have a lot of time. So I'm going to give you a one liner, you're going to

425
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to remember that what you're here to do stay in the moment be authentic, be honest be direct and assertive and communicate what's on your mind.

426
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Which also can occur in the moment.

427
00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:29.910
olivas: Yes, there's

428
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Here the air about history, but it can also happen.

429
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: A new one right in here. And that's right. Gonna could throw the whole agenda off.

430
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You could shut yourself down right

431
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you know how to say and and just now what you just said, is an example right now. I'm feeling shut down, shut up. I'm cut cut off and

432
00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This is why I'm here right now long, that's a great example because what was your intent in saying that, what were you hoping I would do.

433
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A when you said that just now. It's a good example of why I've been kind of like avoiding connecting and talking with you for these last months. It just happened, Mom. This is a good way for me to understand

434
00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: How that's helping when you said you see it here now happening now. You already know it's going to happen. He's the reason why you've been avoiding her

435
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that you can be in this immediate moment hold onto yourself not go to. I'm a bad girl Yeah get small stay in your strength.

436
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And find out what it's doing to serve her in her snippy little comment. Give me one that she might say,

437
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:02.280
olivas: Well,

438
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:10.320
olivas: I'm surprised that you care, you don't you don't live here. You don't call you don't check in on her.

439
00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:23.700
olivas: So why would it matter to you because you you're not here. You don't see her, like I do, you don't see the payment goes through. I'm the one that had to deal with her, not you.

440
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what are you feeling right now. Carolyn Sun just came up

441
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:29.760
What is

442
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what are you feeling that's what she's doing.

443
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.470
olivas: She's not make me feel

444
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:44.970
olivas: More again. It makes me feel

445
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:52.200
olivas: Like, I don't care. I know I did you

446
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Did You Do you not care about your sister.

447
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.690
olivas: I do and I love her.

448
00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Not true. Then if I say something

449
00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I get to be wrong. Just because I'm your mother.

450
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm wrong. I'm projecting and blaming you, because I don't want to sit with the fact that she just called me out. I don't want to do it.

451
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not the boss of your emotions. I don't make you feel anything you don't you confused by what I'm doing that I get, but you just, you know, whether you care about your sister and I can't make you care not care. Just because I say it.

452
00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, to hold on to your truth. What I say need not move you across the chessboard, you know who you are, if you care. It doesn't matter how many times I say you don't care about your sister.

453
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't there there. You weren't there. But if you actually feel guilty about it.

454
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a different conversation. Carolyn.

455
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good, fine.

456
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you don't have to be offended by someone misunderstanding you this is I'm going to own it. This is my agenda. I don't want

457
00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: To talk about what you're talking about. So I'm going to say, well, I'm surprised you didn't care. You don't live here. You don't color you don't

458
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:17.190
I would

459
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's my coping mechanism.

460
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Choose not to be offended. Hold on to your truth. Just because I say something. Yes, you can recognize it as familiar used to get small. But now, if you could put some distance between that

461
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It represents the on your whole point of going down there to see her. This is old. That's it. Mom, you just did it.

462
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:47.520
That's the thing.

463
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so instead of getting can be like, Oh my gosh, this is perfect. It just happened.

464
00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm right. I'm trying to tell you about how I had felt sort of excluded and shut out and all of a sudden

465
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you just said you're surprised. Now we're talking about your surprise. Mom, can we spend a little bit more talking about, you know, listening to, I feel, you see, because what I did was make it about me.

466
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, well, I'm surprised you care I that moment I turned it from listening to my daughter to about will pour me

467
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Up if you stop making such a like heavy thing about like oh my gosh yeah this is a perfect example.

468
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.620
olivas: Um,

469
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we could talk about your surprise a little in a little bit. Mom, but

470
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear me out. I really want to make sure, because I know a lot of months have passed where I couldn't clear the air on this and be really clear.

471
00:54:51.030 --> 00:55:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, there's that version or the other one which was that thing that that statement you just made. Mom, that's a good example. I feel shut out right now. I feel I don't feel heard and so now we're going to talk about your surprise and I'm not going to get heard, can we do

472
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: My mom.

473
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And Carolyn, you're going to find out limitations for her very quickly if

474
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You're asking a very mature insightful response. She has not done work.

475
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be like

476
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: A hash. She can't do it.

477
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:28.560
Yeah.

478
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The whole time. Don't let go.

479
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:34.170
Yeah.

480
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.910
She doesn't

481
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you feel.

482
00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:40.800
olivas: Yeah, my

483
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Summary might just be you know what mom, I think our, our style of

484
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication just just may have changed, or I've changed so much around it that

485
00:55:55.230 --> 00:56:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just about acceptance. Maybe I accept sort of your style. And let me let me let me know mom my way is a lot more direct and

486
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot less what I'm calling for this people pleasing and I really just sort of them zeroing in on a very authentic communication. So there might be times when I pull back.

487
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't understand that. Like that thing you did mom with I'm surprised at it. Uh, I don't understand the intention of you're saying that because it just is it just hurts me

488
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like you don't see that. Of course I care about my sister, like what

489
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.080
olivas: No.

490
00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's very confusing and either kind of talking literally about what just happened 20 seconds ago, or I think I'm just going to kind of just let you know i'm going to operate on some acceptance some radical acceptance and I

491
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Will just kind of keep it light and fluffy.

492
00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if we can kind of get along that way. But I'm going to ignore.

493
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm like my next client just came in here.

494
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, Carolyn. So what do you think

495
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure. Here, like I want to review some more.

496
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.050
Okay.

497
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can even do the MTR around what what you're doing what you're talking about. Okay.

498
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I have someone at seven. So yeah, it can be six on the 14

499
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a that's not going to do anything for Valentine's Day at six in the marina doesn't three offer anything

500
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.400

Anthony Garcia: Pretty much since I've been down the point to five.

520

Gwenevere Abriel: How long does it take to get back to sleep.

521
00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.610
Anthony Garcia: To be honest, I would say maybe 30 minutes

522
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And what are you doing to

523
00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:58.560

525
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.580
Anthony Garcia: Just lay there.

526
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I do recommend that that diaphragm matic breathing, actually, that can help.

527
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Progressive

528
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: muscle relaxation, which I can go over with you, has can be helpful to

529
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Know started

530
00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What else besides kind of wakeful sleep and you're waking up three or four times a night half hour fallen asleep. What else is you're noticing is going on.

531
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:45.510
Anthony Garcia: Oh, I noticed that I don't have as much anxiety and more as I used to. I guess.

532
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:53.100
Anthony Garcia: Even when I'm having stressful moments and stuff. I'm just not really that stressed anymore, you know,

533
00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Me an example of where that's very tangible for you.

534
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:09.060
Anthony Garcia: I would say like my daughter, you know, eat like she's 13 now so Texas there after school. Hang out with friends and stuff and

535
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:29.520
Anthony Garcia: And yesterday I went to Family Dollar to grab me some m&ms. And as I was coming out of the store. I seen her and about like 10 of her friends hanging out there in front of Family Dollar so she's seen me. She got like kind of surprised but I gave her a hug told her.

536
01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:42.840
Anthony Garcia: I asked her how she is she doing okay. Is everything okay he said you have $1 on their be home in about like 30 minutes before it gets dark. And I got in my car and I went home, you know, and

537
01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:55.500
Anthony Garcia: She came home about 20 minutes later and usually how I would say I would have been was, I would have got mad. I want to pay cussed out or something in front of her friend maybe embarrassed or something.

538
01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.410
Anthony Garcia: Put her in the car and brought her home.

539
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: School or something, huh. She's skipping school or something.

540
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:10.170
Anthony Garcia: No, no, no, no. It was after school because this was about 530 when I when I was coming home.

541
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So, as a parent, what's the problem behavior that she was engaged in it. And what, what would you have customer over what was she doing wrong. I don't understand.

542
01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:22.620
Anthony Garcia: I told her to be home after school. Oh.

543
01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go. Got it.

544
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:31.290
Anthony Garcia: Right when when I dropped her off in the mornings, most of the time. Like right now, today, I'm not going to be able to she's gonna have to walk to school.

545
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:37.260
Anthony Garcia: But I usually drop her off. And when I dropped her off. I always tell her be home right after school.

546
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:46.290
Anthony Garcia: You know, and if she has like some kind of after school game or something just text me let me know and then she has to tell a grandpa so

547
01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:55.020
Anthony Garcia: But she didn't tell me nothing. I didn't know nothing in the next, you know, it's 530 and almost dark time and she's out there still and

548
01:01:55.650 --> 01:02:13.770
Anthony Garcia: I was surprised. You know, I ain't gonna lie. I was a little bit angry and upset, but I didn't lash out at a right then and there, and I didn't lash out of her later on either, but I did explain to her as I actually got home and stuff that this is what I expect of her stuff like that so

549
01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. No.

550
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:26.220
Anthony Garcia: She didn't yell at me. She didn't call me like names and stuff. She didn't slammer doors. I mean, she I think she was more surprised. And I was like,

551
01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:30.930
Anthony Garcia: To me yesterday was

552
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.480
Anthony Garcia: Different, you know,

553
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.330
Anthony Garcia: So I was like, kind of proud of myself, you know, I felt like I acted more like the

554
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:46.770
Anthony Garcia: Actual like a human being, you know, like now like childish person.

555
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.770
Anthony Garcia: That's how good you know

556
01:02:50.310 --> 01:03:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, okay. I like it. That's a really good example. What about let me poke over here on, I want to say $3,000 for a place. Now I know you're not over at your sisters. I have not had an update on this for a long time. Where are you at with it.

557
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.870
Anthony Garcia: So since then, I have not saved, any money.

558
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.860
Anthony Garcia: But I am paying off my debts.

559
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:33.150
Anthony Garcia: I have student loans that I've been working on. But I got put into forbearance until April. So I'm good for payments on that for a while but I started catching up on that. I got two credit cards that I've been catching up on trying to pay down

560
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:34.230
Anthony Garcia: Time.

561
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How much is left on the credit cards total

562
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:51.330
Anthony Garcia: I think I got 147 on one and then like 170 something on the other and then both my limits are 300 on both. But just like two weeks ago I was over 300 on both of those.

563
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

564
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:53.850
Anthony Garcia: Well, good coming down.

565
01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:03.810
Anthony Garcia: I'm hoping that when I get down to zero that they'll maybe like bumped me up to like 500 500 on both. And I'm just going to leave those for like emergency

566
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:12.360
Anthony Garcia: Not gonna use the cards at all unless it's like an emergency. Maybe during the week I needed a gas to get to work like on a Thursday or something.

567
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:24.480
Anthony Garcia: Use it for gas, maybe some cigarettes or whatever and then kind of keep it low that way, always have the kind of them are going to merge on. I know that's not like a real emergency fund, but I guess.

568
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:26.460
Anthony Garcia: That's better than nothing, you know,

569
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:28.860
Anthony Garcia: My sister still got my money.

570
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:36.510
Anthony Garcia: She hasn't asked me about it. I don't tell him nothing about it. I haven't spoke to her in about two weeks.

571
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:40.740
Anthony Garcia: Okay.

572
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:43.620
Anthony Garcia: With anything away.

573
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:51.750
Anthony Garcia: Since I left her house, but she still has, I can say 3000 but I think it's like in the 20 something hundred range.

574
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Last time you told me it was 2700

575
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:59.970
Anthony Garcia: That was that's where it's at, because I have not put any more money in it at all.

576
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.090
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I was. This is what gave me any either. So by

577
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: August, it's been it's been at that number for a while.

578
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.570
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I haven't put any away. I've been trying to take care of other things.

579
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:21.180
Anthony Garcia: Desktop did get really, really slow for November, December in January, I have all the girls birthdays Christmas.

580
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:25.050
Anthony Garcia: For those months. So I got through it.

581
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:43.230
Anthony Garcia: It was stressful. I didn't think it was going to happen the way I thought I was like making myself like over crazy about it. And then after the few little things that happened and gives you a little, few gifts here. Everybody was happy. And it's gotten me, you know, so

582
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times have you, let's say, over the last month. How many times have you gone to the casino for any reason.

583
01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:56.280
Anthony Garcia: Probably four times five times.

584
01:05:57.570 --> 01:06:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many times did you gamble five out of five.

585
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:12.690
Anthony Garcia: Four out of five. The one of the times I didn't have money. We just me and my homie Robbie went to go watch the games football games. I didn't gamble at all that day. But the other four times yes I did gamble.

586
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How much money have you lost total

587
01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:21.480
Anthony Garcia: Us and I would say maybe $600

588
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:30.930
Anthony Garcia: It could be a little bit less could be a little bit more but that seems about right. Catch I don't spend too much, but

589
01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When you use to, you know, prior to treatment. How many times were you were you gambling, a month.

590
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:39.240
Anthony Garcia: Palio most

591
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:47.910
Anthony Garcia: 1234 I would say maybe 10 times a week. I mean, a month 10 times a month.

592
01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's a little improvement there.

593
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:53.970
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I mean there is

594
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.330
Anthony Garcia: I'm still a little bit disappointed at myself.

595
01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:02.760
Anthony Garcia: I really wanted to make this year. A year that I did not go gamble.

596
01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.460
Anthony Garcia: It hasn't happened yet.

597
01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.360
Anthony Garcia: I do congratulate myself.

598
01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:16.950
Anthony Garcia: I don't know about congratulate, but I do like telling myself that you're doing a good job.

599
01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:28.170
Anthony Garcia: I'm not going like every day, like there was a time there was going before work, you know, yes. Yeah, so I don't do that anymore.

600
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:41.400
Anthony Garcia: When I do go on like Mondays, because they do give me some free play there. I'll do like to use it. I have not spent my own money during that time.

601
01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:50.940
Anthony Garcia: I know once the weekend comes I get a little bit bored. I don't really have like friends, friends, where I can hang out with

602
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:57.810
Anthony Garcia: People that I can really like talk to and I don't know it's just like, I don't really have much, you know, so

603
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:05.550
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, just seems like that's like the only place I feel comfortable and

604
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:22.440
Anthony Garcia: I feel comfortable there, I guess. And you know, it's like I sit there. Sometimes I be I told myself, I'm not going to gamble. I'm going to go. He just check things out for a minute and never happens that way sometimes I don't even eat some Ray want to get in there, go straight to the machine.

605
01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, you're still, you're still lying to yourself, Anthony. No, nobody nobody's going to go to their, you know,

606
01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To the neighborhood where they used to get their stuff right and be like, Oh, I'm just here to

607
01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to the gaming store or something. I mean, that, that's silly. You're not going to put yourself in that danger, you're not quite ready to let this go

608
01:08:52.260 --> 01:09:01.650
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, no, I, I think, yeah, I have been lying to my seconds I tell myself I can control myself and and never have the Anthony

609
01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You said out loud, I'm addicted to this.

610
01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:11.820
Anthony Garcia: Yes, I know. And to me, I don't see it as an addiction, you

611
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:19.500
Anthony Garcia: You said I know and I'm trying to like convince myself that it's not, you know, and it's

612
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:27.090
Anthony Garcia: But it's funny because sometimes when I'm in there. It almost feels like I'm on a drug.

613
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:34.770
Anthony Garcia: Sober it feels like I'm on a drug. I feel like weird, you know, uncontrollable, you know, and

614
01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:38.910
Anthony Garcia: I don't know. And then, you know, I leave sometimes and I

615
01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:51.030
Anthony Garcia: Was like, I could have done this. I just bought this, I could have done this and I could have done that. And that's what causes me like a almost like in a panic attack to where I get like

616
01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.550
Anthony Garcia: I don't know if there's like a mother.

617
01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:56.190
Anthony Garcia: Passed out, I guess.

618
01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, all that energy could be going into something else. But let's focus elsewhere for a minute. Let's come away from that. I think we should probably write out some goals ones that work for you on that topic, but let's just come over here to some other stuff.

619
01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the major goals for you is managing stress and anger that's got it. It's a goal that it moves throughout several tasks.

620
01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the things that I can identify that I thought would help is to learn and implement implement conflict resolution skills to resolve in our personal problems. So I want you to picture.

621
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

622
01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking with your dad because that's the big one. That's, that's the, that's the one that gets you even thinking about your dad can piss you off.

623
01:10:50.190 --> 01:11:08.760
Anthony Garcia: I know it, like, yeah, I don't know. I don't want to get too detailed. But yesterday. He was walking up the stairs and right away in my head. I was thinking like what dumb ass, you know, for no reason. And I don't know, I just felt bad you know I feel bad that I think that way. Oh.

624
01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:19.320
Anthony Garcia: And he didn't do nothing. They just came downstairs, got himself some water out of the fridge right and then went back upstairs. I don't know, just pissed me off. Why

625
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you know that you have projected these

626
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Thoughts, you just did what a dumb ass, you know, you've projected them on to him as it sounds, what he's thinking about you. You guys do you anyway. I met him. I don't know if he's doing the same thing but you project, project, project, project all the time.

627
01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: He must think I'm an idiot. He thinks I'm an idiot.

628
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: To say you're an idiot.

629
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I don't know. Are you making that up in your head.

630
01:11:51.840 --> 01:12:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, but you do it to him right you're calling him a dumb ass and you're thinking, maybe he's thinking you are a dumb ass.

631
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:11.100
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I mean I can see it that way. But I don't just do it with him. I, I guess I kind of do a little a lot

632
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

633
01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I like

634
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I was trying to get up the stairs.

635
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sarah right way to go up the stairs.

636
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not funny. It's very serious. Um, let's see.

637
01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to, I know it, you gave me an example right of open how you're still projecting, you're still having these negative thoughts, but this is very much not a direct communication. I know you didn't call him a dumb ass as he was walking up the stairs.

638
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into what I think is, is, is going to be helpful.

639
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you, let's see. Let's get behind. Maybe some direct communication that you have engaged in with your father, where you didn't project he thinks I'm an idiot. And I can't talk to this man, he's an asshole.

640
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all. Just hypothetical. Can you picture having spoken to him directly over the last 30 days about something where you thought oh haha. That was better than I thought.

641
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.660
Anthony Garcia: I know I couldn't think of anything. No.

642
01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.450
Anthony Garcia: We barely speak.

643
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.010
Anthony Garcia: I mean,

644
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:46.260
Anthony Garcia: There's times where I come home, I take a shower, we discuss what we're going to do for dinner. And that's the extent of our communication to each other, you

645
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want it to be any different.

646
01:13:54.210 --> 01:14:00.450
Anthony Garcia: I sometimes I say, Yeah, I do. I wish, I wish that we would be able to expand time and stuff but

647
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.950
Anthony Garcia: With the communication thing. It's just almost like

648
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.710
Anthony Garcia: I'll speak to him and he didn't even understand what I'm saying. And then he'll go up into some other like topic.

649
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:27.510
Anthony Garcia: But completely out of it, and I'm like, did you even listen to what I told you, you know, he says, yeah, yeah. So I asked him, like what did I say that, and he can really answer me and and that's when he starts getting like upset because I'm questioning me

650
01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:34.530
Anthony Garcia: Just like I just gotta leave the room. You know, it's like, sometimes even he'll start, start talking about still eat.

651
01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:51.180
Anthony Garcia: You know, and then you could just like you can like hear him stop talking like, I don't know, I feel bad, but I don't know I just sometimes I just can't stand hearing. You know, it's like, you know, making it. I don't know, said to me, he's still back in like the

652
01:14:52.290 --> 01:15:02.100
Anthony Garcia: 60s and 70s, like he never moved you never like adapted like the rest of us to the 2000s, you know, as you just saw, old school and

653
01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:11.880
Anthony Garcia: The stuff that he says is so old that it doesn't. I don't know. It's hard to communicate with them, he doesn't understand what I'm saying, I don't understand what games, he said.

654
01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:13.770
Anthony Garcia: Okay.

655
01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Go get go get the two two objects next to the phone. I'm going to run out for 60 seconds and I'll be right back.

656
01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, the two tall objects. Let's see if we can do a little bit of work around this, this, this, this is going to continue to be a challenge for you until it gets worked through. I'm thinking there's a lot I history back there.

657
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You got your two

658
01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Objects.

659
01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:40.920
Anthony Garcia: Still exactly where they were.

660
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great. I'm so glad you left them there. Um, okay. Then I gotta run out got, I've got to be. I'll be right back. I promise. If you need to use the restroom, this would be a great time. So I'll be right back.

661
01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me go back to where we left off before. Okay.

662
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we were doing before was sort of exploring some negative thoughts.

663
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And the goal of this particular kind of work. The and dr is to loosen up the long history that you have associated

664
01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: With that negative cognition and it might be really big like lots of stories. Lots of experiences associated with this this belief about yourself.

665
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a couple of things happen desensitisation happens where you can visit those thoughts, a lot easier. And then what also can happen is integrating positive ones. Okay, I'm going to look and see how far we got here.

666
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So we started with.

667
01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative cognition of

668
01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I could have made better choices and the event. You never told me the event. It was

669
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked for a sentinel event currently was at 70 body scan noticed distressing C to D Krista 40 I think about things. I could have done.

670
01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I remember. You never told me the story, but you don't have to. I could have made better choices. I could have said something I gave up and the emotion was shame you labeled yourself a coward, your body was

671
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Aware of I felt it everywhere in the body.

672
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And I asked you to come up with what you wanted to be thinking at that time, you know, what's a positive thought you could have had during that event, things could be better if I had said or done something helpful.

673
01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And the positive belief about yourself that would have been preferred was I am persistent

674
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It is what bugs me the most. I just gave up.

675
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't give up for something in this matter, I don't normally give up. I don't know why I did. Okay. And then we went into sort of this worst case scenario, the worst piece, the worst image of this negative cognition and you said, I'm ashamed.

676
01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember any of that.

677
01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.510
Anthony Garcia: I do. You do. Okay.

678
01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And we move through this and then the distress moved down to looks like.

679
01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: For

680
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You started thinking about your daughter and working today.

681
01:19:51.060 --> 01:20:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And you ended by saying there I am, I am. I am persistent I am persevering and it was true at about a two.

682
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Minute move to a five.

683
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And you realized

684
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to think more positively about myself.

685
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I am courageous you noticed that was a positive thought a positive cognition.

686
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's kind of stated a two.

687
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where we left off.

688
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little bit more work there. Okay.

689
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like you to do is let me see your eyes. I want to see how close these

690
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:39.630
Anthony Garcia: These

691
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Back and forth here from those two objects. Alright.

692
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.570
Anthony Garcia: Well, where I was last

693
01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, let me see you looking it does that strain the eyes right there. Does that hurt them doing them. Okay, and you want to keep your, you want to keep your, your face stationary and just, just the eyes moving horizontally like that. Okay, cool.

694
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so first this morning.

695
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony What I want you to do is I want you to think of a safe place. I want you to think about a place that you know

696
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you've been somewhere before it was in the mountains or it was maybe Korea or somewhere that it just sort of embodies all of the qualities of safety and peace.

697
01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to pull that up into your imagery

698
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.730
Anthony Garcia: To be honest, I mean it's just my safest place right now it's like all

699
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right where you are now. Yes.

01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:03.570
Anthony Garcia: I feel like

707
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:12.480
Anthony Garcia: I feel like I can like, I don't know, just be me be free, do what I want.

708
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.690
Anthony Garcia: That's what it is, you know, okay.

709
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:20.010
Good.

710
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like to do is

711
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of bring you back to see

712
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.450

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I am courageous.

714
01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

715
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That negative

716
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative event, did you want to tell me what the event was

717
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:50.280
Anthony Garcia: No.

718
01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: No, okay, that's fine. You don't have to tell me

719
01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So the key here is to

720
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll you remember it right, I'm gonna I'll say let's do an inhale exhale and let it go. And then just gently paying attention to what comes up what thought comes up and just kind of let my next question guide what the sharing is okay.

721
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to pull up the worst picture of that event.

722
01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, in your mind,

723
01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it in there.

724
01:23:33.210 --> 01:23:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to tell me how true is it from one to seven.

725
01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are courageous.

726
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:48.420
Anthony Garcia: Seven being the highest. Yes.

727
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:51.330
Anthony Garcia: I like three

728
01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.120
Okay.

729
01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's have

730
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you watch the different partners are going to look at those two objects at the speed that I kind of set. Okay, so hold the worst part of that image SORT OF PULLING BACK INTO THAT I'M PERSISTENT I'm persevering and I am courageous. Okay.

731
01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice inhale together.

732
01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Men just turn the reflection to what you're noticing.

733
01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:24.030
Anthony Garcia: My mind's kind of everywhere right now, I'm just, you know, I, when I think about this.

734
01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.990
Anthony Garcia: I get sad, you know,

735
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's shift a little bit. I'd like to integrate. See if you you actually do have your knowing I don't have your protective and you're nurturing and you're wise figure in here. Did I do that with you guys and learning here.

736
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have that.

737
01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:53.670
Anthony Garcia: I don't know.

738
01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do that then know how I missed that.

739
01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a nice feeling. So what I want you to do is I want you to picture can be real or imagined or combination of both.

740
01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture what a protective figure might be real or imagined.

741
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, what comes up.

742
01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:27.360
Anthony Garcia: My mo.

743
01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, okay.

744
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And so she's sort of has these qualities of protection and when you bring it up in your in your awareness. Do you have a sense of feeling safe.

745
01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:48.900
Anthony Garcia: Yeah Oh safe with my mom and comfortable. So, okay.

746
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. And now I want you to picture a nurturing figure

747

750
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then for a wise figure real or imagined has those qualities of wisdom.

751
01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.730
Anthony Garcia: I would say maybe like my sister.

752
01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I'd like you to take a moment and just sort of picture them all together in the same space interacting with one another.

753
01:27:58.890 --> 01:28:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're there as an adult.

754
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice what's going on in that imagery

755
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: With your team.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.050

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

766
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little

767
01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Installation of those those images. Okay.

768
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold them in your in your awareness really picturing interacting and being a part of and almost surrounded by those qualities

Gwenevere Abriel: laughing and talking and eating and feeling happy.

772
01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when you're ready, open your eyes. And we're going to do some slow iterations. Okay.

773
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just watching

774
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: held together.

775
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: An exhale

776
01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice

777
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.000
Anthony Garcia: Some

778
01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:26.520
Anthony Garcia: Anxious like

779
01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice a thought pass through your mind.

780
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:36.870
Anthony Garcia: I did, I noticed that I kind of missed those days.

781
01:30:49.800 --> 01:31:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that say about your belief about yourself right now. See if you can identify that. See if you can go to. Right now I am to be can identify a belief, you've got going on. I am

782
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.550
Anthony Garcia: Get it, I am

783
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: If these are hard to get to. Don't be hard on yourself. These are hard so

784
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm anxious I miss those days you miss them.

785
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you feel anxious. Once you tell me where you feel the anxiousness in the body will come back to the belief in a second.

786
01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know you're anxious

787
01:31:38.850 --> 01:31:42.210
Anthony Garcia: affiliates, just like in my arms are just like moving

788
01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.450
Anthony Garcia: You know, I feel

789
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.010
Anthony Garcia: Sad still, you know, I guess.

790
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:58.500
Anthony Garcia: miss those days you know hasn't happened in a long time. So,

791
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

792
01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:17.160
Anthony Garcia: I left there seems like we don't see each other very often. I don't go over there. They don't ask me to come over there. We still do a lot of eating and stuff that don't happen no more. Last time I even see my mom and my sister with about two

793
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:20.190
Anthony Garcia: Two and a half weeks ago, I guess.

794
01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Now see if you can find it. What does that say about

795
01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The meaning you just what you just said what meaning do you make about that.

796
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So then go to

797
01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What I believe about myself when I think about they haven't invited me over. I miss those days, I feel sad. See if you can find it.

798
01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am I believe about myself. These are hard to get to just be patient with it.

799
01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

800
01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:01.200
Anthony Garcia: I am worried

801
01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to be thinking about yourself.

802
01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:10.920
Anthony Garcia: I would like to be think that

803
01:33:12.570 --> 01:33:25.770
Anthony Garcia: I could get through anything. I don't have to. I wish I didn't have to analyze everything and and and start thinking all the negative stuff that comes up because I'm analyzing things

804
01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:27.810
Anthony Garcia: I

805
01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:37.890
Anthony Garcia: Want to stop making up stuff in my head because then it stops me from like really asking or dueling or going somewhere.

806
01:33:40.650 --> 01:33:44.910
Anthony Garcia: Just feel like a worry about things too much. Okay.

807
01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So the negative belief is I worry and is it over analyze

808
01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.990
Anthony Garcia: over analyzing things

809
01:33:52.440 --> 01:34:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to be thinking I can get through this. What would be the opposite of over analyzing in the absence of interpreting people's behaviors. Right.

810
01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be what would be going on. And if you weren't analyzing what what you'd be doing

811
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:29.280
Anthony Garcia: Acting you know like like action know we're doing so you know actually doing something. Is that a singular saying I'm doing in my head. No, but you know actually doing the action.

812
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I can take action.

813
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:36.510
Anthony Garcia: Take action you

814
01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Know right yeah and

815
01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:44.400
Anthony Garcia: I'm not talking like violent action or nothing like that. But I'm talking like

816
01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:57.360
Anthony Garcia: I'm just saying something, you know, when I feel like saying something say when I feel like doing something, do it when I feel like not doing nothing. Don't do it, you know.

817
01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I can take action.

818
01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is that right now.

819
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I can take action. And you know what

820
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:14.130
Anthony Garcia: Maybe a one and a half, two

821
01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:39.330
Anthony Garcia: There's a lot of times throughout the day where I want to say something or do something or

822
01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:43.740
Anthony Garcia: You know when it's like, I don't know. Once I start thinking

823
01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:46.770
Anthony Garcia: I'll think myself out of, you know,

824
01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:57.780
Anthony Garcia: And then it just, it's gone. You know, and then by the end of the day, I'm like, thinking in my head. Like, damn it, I should have done that, you know, okay, yeah. I missed an opportunity

825
01:35:58.980 --> 01:35:59.310
Okay.

826
01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.040
Alright.

827
01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do let's do a little faster.

828
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the desensitization part pull up that negative image that she had earlier.

829
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That worst thing that really represents you know I

830
01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I wasn't courageous. Right. Right. That was the negative belief, then

831
01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And

832
01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you hold this one instead. So pull up that negative image and why don't you see if you can sort of bring up the

833
01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I overanalyze

834
01:36:52.740 --> 01:37:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold that in there. So get that image and I overanalyze I worry hope but just pick one of those. Okay, this one's going to be a little faster.

835
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready.

836
01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's prevent together.

837
01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In the next

838
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming what's coming up.

839
01:37:51.660 --> 01:38:06.750
Anthony Garcia: I just, I noticed that I'm not as, like, I usually I get like sweaty really sweaty palms and and feeling very nervous. And I was like, that's it kind of feeling in my gut that nauseous feeling in there.

840
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.690
Anthony Garcia: I don't get that anymore.

841
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now you're not having it.

842
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.510
Anthony Garcia: Oh, or in the last few weeks, I guess.

843
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:27.810
Anthony Garcia: Every even thinking about this, like right now you're telling me to think about the most worst moment. And when I think about it. I get sad. You know, I get sad because I could have

844
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:31.260
Anthony Garcia: Said something done something

845
01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.320
Anthony Garcia: Been courageous.

846
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:35.490
But

847
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:37.920
Anthony Garcia: I don't know, it just

848
01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:48.150
Anthony Garcia: It's it goes away fast and it used to not, you know, used to be like linger there all day long. Think about all day long.

849
01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay here.

850
01:38:50.670 --> 01:38:52.140
Anthony Garcia: So now I just feel

851
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:59.190
Anthony Garcia: I don't feel bad. You know, I get sad per second. And then, I don't know, I just

852
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:02.400
Anthony Garcia: Feel. Okay. You don't have to

853
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.810
Anthony Garcia: That's what I'm doing right now because

854
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:18.150
Anthony Garcia: I feel like I'm feeling better. You know, I don't feel sad below I felt sad for second and now I don't watch by happy.

855
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your level of distress right now from zero to 100 let's

856
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:24.810
Anthony Garcia: Let the stress.

857
01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:27.750
Anthony Garcia: I mean, I have no distress at all.

858
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's put in. Now let's do a slower iteration, let's bring in this positive one, which is I get through things you find the one that's at the core for you. I get through things I take action.

859
01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's another one that's maybe even deeper than that.

860
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want to be thinking when you think of that worst image I want to be thinking about myself.

861
01:39:58.650 --> 01:40:00.150
Anthony Garcia: I want to be thinking that

862
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:04.140
Anthony Garcia: I'm

863
01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:08.400
Anthony Garcia: Like I

864
01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:12.210
Anthony Garcia: Feel like I could

865
01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:15.450
Anthony Garcia: Be who I know. Okay.

866
01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.030
Anthony Garcia: I'll feel like myself.

867
01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I am myself. Okay, let's go with that first image. Okay. Pull it up and then positive thought of self. I am myself in this field slower.

868
01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together. Nice. Inhale.

869
01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

870
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it go

871
01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: See what passes through your mind what emotions.

872
01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Physiological sensations.

873
01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice

874
01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:40.350
Anthony Garcia: I notice

875
01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.190
Anthony Garcia: I get disappointed because

876
01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:46.920
Anthony Garcia: In my head I'm thinking that

877
01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:56.040
Anthony Garcia: I could have been courageous. Well, I'm thinking in my head I am courageous. I can be myself.

878
01:41:58.590 --> 01:42:00.390
Anthony Garcia: Feel I am brave.

879
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:07.620
Anthony Garcia: And then I kind of get upset at myself because that's not

880
01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:14.430
Anthony Garcia: How I felt at that time you feel like that now or not.

881
01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:17.610
Anthony Garcia: Just doesn't feel like that's me, you know,

882
01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel that that wasn't

883
01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.060
Anthony Garcia: A factor or know

884
01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Which which is true. Right now I am courageous. I am myself or I am

885
01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be, what's the negative thought

886
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a coward. I'm

887
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:44.610
Anthony Garcia: An idiot

888
01:42:45.330 --> 01:42:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm an idiot. Okay, wait, which is which is more true right now. I'm an idiot, or I am myself.

889
01:42:55.230 --> 01:42:56.970
Anthony Garcia: I'm an idiot, because

890
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:00.960
Anthony Garcia: I didn't

891
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:07.350
Anthony Garcia: Act, you know, there was no action at that time it was none at all.

892
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:10.320
Anthony Garcia: Like, pretty much, let

893
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.800
Anthony Garcia: More my happiness, though, like that.

894
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:19.560
Anthony Garcia: I just let it go. It's nothing like it wasn't like a main method.

895
01:43:20.610 --> 01:43:21.390
Anthony Garcia: And now.

896
01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:31.440
Anthony Garcia: I'm sad every day. I'm pissed off every day. But I had that happiness. I was happy. I mean I had

897
01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:35.430
Anthony Garcia: I when I look back at it. I can remember just

898
01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:42.210
Anthony Garcia: Loving to wake up in the morning, go to work, come home. I never

899
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:46.500
Anthony Garcia: Thought during the day, like, Oh, I gotta go home and do this or

900
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:56.940
Anthony Garcia: This has got to happen or a damn kids are a, you know, I just felt great. You know, I felt needed wanted

901
01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:08.280
Anthony Garcia: It was a good life, you know, and when I had a chance to fight for that life. I didn't let it go. I just

902
01:44:09.450 --> 01:44:22.770
Anthony Garcia: Medical like nothing is so simple, just to give it like nothing. And that's what I'm disappointed about is because most people would have try hard.

903
01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:36.630
Anthony Garcia: Done something sent something, you know, even if they felt like embarrassed, they would have still done it. That's how courageous like people are even like people that I think in my head like this dude's a pussy.

904
01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:48.210
Anthony Garcia: He probably did something in his life to fight for his life for by for his happiness or truth or whatever he was looking for at but me.

905
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:56.700
Anthony Garcia: I told myself, I'm not scared of anything in this and that but I was scared to fight for my happiness.

906
01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's bring some of those figures in right now. Once you to just turn your attention really turn that effort into working awareness of protection in your mom nurturing and your mom. The wisdom of your sister.

907
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: just imagining that presence with you.

908
01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you did pull up that image chair.

909
01:45:30.210 --> 01:45:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're referring to

910
01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you open your eyes. We're going to do a slow iteration.

911
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to those two things the same time.

912
01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

913
01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:32.700
Anthony Garcia: Let go.

914
01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just quiet your mind.

915
01:46:42.090 --> 01:46:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Just observe

916
01:46:47.610 --> 01:46:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up.

917
01:46:56.670 --> 01:46:57.810
Anthony Garcia: I feel like

918
01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:06.030
Anthony Garcia: I'm still proud of myself, even though I did all that I'm still proud of myself because

919
01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:09.150
Anthony Garcia: I

920
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.120
Anthony Garcia: Chose to give away.

921
01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.820
Anthony Garcia: My happiness.

922
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.430
Anthony Garcia: So someone else could be happy.

923
01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:35.580
Anthony Garcia: So I, I feel like I gave something or someone. I did something for someone, I did it by the best thing that could have happened for them. I did that. But in order for me to have done that.

924
01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:50.790
Anthony Garcia: I get everything that I I became everything that I'm not. And I think that's stuck with me for a lot of years now, and I just can't find my way back to that to who I used to be.

925
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:58.020
Anthony Garcia: Just feel like this is not me. I don't feel comfortable how I am now.

926
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:01.050
Anthony Garcia: I don't like it.

927
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with the positive cognition, I am myself.

928
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with I am myself. You mentioned earlier, and that negative image, you had earlier.

929
01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you pull those two things up right worst part of that event, the most salient part I am myself.

930
01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

931
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I am myself.

932
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, with me. Inhale.

933
01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

934
01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go.

935
01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

936
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Gently see what awareness comes up.

937
01:49:35.490 --> 01:49:36.930
Anthony Garcia: feel sick me

938
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you feeling it.

939
01:49:39.450 --> 01:49:40.350
Anthony Garcia: Mostly Western

940
01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And what font just passed by. What was the imagery there.

941
01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.280
Anthony Garcia: They're

942
01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:52.890
Anthony Garcia: Just an idiot.

943
01:49:56.250 --> 01:49:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm an idiot.

944
01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:58.410
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, cuz I

945
01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:14.730
Anthony Garcia: I think I'm right about everything. And in reality. You know what I really think about it. I was full of crap you know sucks because

946
01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:16.200
Anthony Garcia: I

947
01:50:17.490 --> 01:50:19.080
Anthony Garcia: Believe in my crap you know

948
01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay there. I'm full of crap that's a negative cognition.

949
01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look let's do something present moment. What do you want to believe about yourself, if I'm full of crap is the negative one. What do you want to believe about yourself right now.

950
01:50:40.230 --> 01:50:41.430
Anthony Garcia: I want to believe I'm

951
01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.870
Anthony Garcia: true to myself I want to be true to myself.

952
01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I am true to myself.

953
01:50:51.150 --> 01:50:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

954
01:50:54.540 --> 01:51:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It did just now did a current trigger come up did a an image of the future come up, or was it mostly just about that past event.

955
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:11.100
Anthony Garcia: Mostly about the past event, but it also has something to do with like the future because

956
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Grab one in the future. Once we don't have a lot of time. But let's do one of those get get that worst hypothetical thing in the future, grab it like the Oh no. What if it's this

957
01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see it, like, oh, you use your imagination, the most salient

958
01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We're sort of fear image there, and now I am true to myself how true is that right now 127

959
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief. I'm true to myself how true is that today, right now.

960
01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay, hold on, in there. I'm true to myself. There's that future hold it there.

961
01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice slow iteration.

962
01:52:48.690 --> 01:52:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your stress level right now.

963
01:52:53.070 --> 01:52:54.750
Anthony Garcia: I would say maybe like a three.

964
01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.500
Anthony Garcia: There's, there is a little bit of stress.

965
01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:02.010
Anthony Garcia: There's a little boy was earlier. Yeah.

966
01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: A three out of 100 still pretty low is, do you think it's higher because you said is that higher than a three when

967
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:14.100
Anthony Garcia: All of 100 I would say maybe like 30 then. Yeah.

968
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay 30 so how true is

969
01:53:18.630 --> 01:53:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief about yourself. I am true to myself.

970
01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.490
Anthony Garcia: Just normally

971
01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It went down from from one to

972
01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Say I want to go down.

973
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:36.720
Anthony Garcia: I don't think there's like a down from it. I think it's the same

974
01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.520
Anthony Garcia: Data. Yeah.

975
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:39.180
Anthony Garcia: So,

976
01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We're leaving today with I'm true to myself at a one.

977
01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you able to share with that worst thing is in the future that that fret event that piece.

978
01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:56.820
Anthony Garcia: Of me being alone by myself and

979
01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.130
Anthony Garcia: With nothing

980
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So if I'm, if I sit with I'm true to myself.

981
01:54:06.090 --> 01:54:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It stays at one and I'll

982
01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Be alone.

01:54:16.290 --> 01:54:23.220
Anthony Garcia: And said, you know, that's I think my worst fears to be alone and sad with nothing.

985
01:54:25.410 --> 01:54:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's put that in a container.

986
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:30.750

Gwenevere Abriel: Spend a lot of time with your team.

991
01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're making a decision whether to speak your truth.

992
01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: First immerse yourself in that presence of I have all the protection and qualities of protection and nurturing and wisdom.

993
01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Be very present and make sure you check and you've got a great communicating body it's right. The six stomach is this real is this true because your stomach's gonna chill. It's going to be like, Oh, I'm feeling good. Now I'm gonna

994
01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, now I can speak I feel good and safe. This is my truth and it's OK.

995
01:55:34.290 --> 01:55:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So the work is just sit there with it, invite that imagery and no one's going to know you're doing this. Okay.

996
01:55:41.970 --> 01:55:54.600
Anthony Garcia: Also like do it with the image of the people are thinking, go to my sisters and try to get them together and maybe I can talk to them or something but

997
01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But

01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You have those qualities that your mother that you see in your mother, you have the ability to have this protective nature inside of you.

1002
01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you can see it in your mother Anthony and you see it in your sister means you have it in you let it saturate you can picture it and it is in fact you

1003
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:42.360

Magan: Maybe like 20 minutes

1037
01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:40.230
Magan: It doesn't take very long.

1038
01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see, see what we can do.

02:00:46.230 --> 02:00:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, but I'm trying to see if this is just this morning or

1051
02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:53.460
Magan: What's been

1052
02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:54.540
Going on.

1053
02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You're frozen. I don't know if you can hear me.

1054
02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:36.180
Magan: Hello.

1055
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You're frozen there for a while.

1056
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.380
Magan: Oh, and did you not hear me.

1057
02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I definitely did not your foot frozen.

1058
02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.700
Magan: Oh, I'm sorry.

1059
02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:56.880
Magan: Okay so me. So next week, I have to go back to Arizona. Okay. Well, I have to go to Arizona starting off back. Um, and

1060
02:01:58.050 --> 02:02:07.740
Magan: Me and my sister and my brother in law and the baby are going to be going because my dad asked us to come and help him move to his new house that he bought

1061
02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:20.160
Magan: On Wednesday, my sister. I told her that my schedule change for work and I can't watch the baby on Wednesdays.

1062
02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:38.400
Magan: And I had to take the kids to the doctor's appointment, say I gotta work. I stayed awake. I took them to their doctors appointment and then I was headed to can you grab your book bag mechanic, grab your book bag and then I was headed to

1063
02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.730
Magan: Hold on, I'm mixing it up. I'm sorry.

1064
02:02:47.370 --> 02:02:49.020
Magan: Your backpack McKenna.

1065
02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:52.170
Magan: I'm

1066
02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:55.020
Magan: Okay.

1067
02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:56.850
Magan: So,

1068
02:02:58.260 --> 02:02:59.400
Magan: I was going to work.

1069
02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:11.130
Magan: got home from work and I was really, really tired and she texted me out of nowhere and she's like, I need help, watching the baby because

1070
02:03:11.850 --> 02:03:27.510
Magan: Jonathan has to go to court and I have to go to work and you know when the baby was born, she advised me that I don't mind it ever shoved in my face that you watch the baby for me and that you help me out because I have plenty of options.

1071
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:37.260
Magan: I can choose anybody else to watch the kids to the baby. So you're not absolutely needed. There's plenty of help.

1072
02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:39.960
Magan: Doesn't feel that way at all.

1073
02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:49.710
Magan: And she asked me to watch baby and I watched her and I said, Can you please get her by one or two or 12 o'clock because I have to go to sleep because I have to work.

1074
02:03:50.580 --> 02:04:06.750
Magan: And she said yes, make sure we're there and two o'clock rolls around and still no Jonathan and it just irritated me because it felt like I gave an inch took a mile and for somebody who doesn't need me, quote unquote, she really seemed like she did.

1075
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:16.170
Magan: And she was like, Well, I don't have anybody else who can watch the baby and like I thought you had all these people. And she's like, look, Jonathan family sick.

1076
02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:19.650
Magan: And Brittany and Joel count. Watch the baby.

1077
02:04:22.230 --> 02:04:22.770
Magan: So,

1078
02:04:26.730 --> 02:04:29.040
Magan: It was just more stress there.

1079
02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:38.340
Magan: And then, and then I'm stressed about God, Arizona. I'm irritated because like

1080
02:04:40.230 --> 02:04:51.120
Magan: Taxes are coming in and like the money's going straight to Andrews account. He didn't even ask if I wanted the money put into my account. You know, because we're claiming to have my children.

1081
02:04:51.960 --> 02:05:01.170
Magan: It just, just like everything is controlled by him and he mandates and dictates to me how things are going to go and like this morning.

1082
02:05:02.490 --> 02:05:07.410
Magan: Because because you're fighting with me. He's telling me that I'm the one that has a horrible attitude.

1083
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:20.940
Magan: And I'm like, well, I come into the house and his snapping at he he doesn't say hello to me, he asked me if I went to Walmart last night because there's a charge on the debit card and they said, Yeah, I did.

1084
02:05:22.410 --> 02:05:30.840
Magan: And he didn't say hello not. Good morning. How's your night. Nothing. Just Did you go to Rome it last night and that I'm the one that has the attitude.

1085
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:32.430
Magan: And then

1086
02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:41.520
Magan: At which point I just get a little frustrated and I just come, you know, I'm not going to entertain this conversation I'm done with it. Don't talk to me.

1087
02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:47.880
Magan: And he just keeps cussing and yelling and you can grab your iPad, you

1088
02:05:53.670 --> 02:06:02.730
Magan: And I'm just really I'm really, really irritated. Because when I say I'm going to do something I do it on Tuesday I picked up his kids from school.

1089
02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:20.970
Magan: Even though you know I didn't get any sleep. I went and picked them up. Then I went to such as McKenna, I made dinner, I get the whole shebang. I did everything that I said I would do. But that still doesn't do the shift that he says he's gonna do because my behavior is not like

1090
02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:23.610
Magan: That that's how it feels to me.

1091
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:41.310
Magan: Yeah. Are you angry.

1092
02:06:42.090 --> 02:06:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: No, definitely not. I'm really just just listening to all of the

1093
02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Other stressors that you have

1094
02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of them. And I, I'm listening also see that you know you're, you can't put your full attention on

1095
02:07:00.810 --> 02:07:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This so you're distracted and I'm just listening.

1096
02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.360
Magan: Okay. Did you understand

1097
02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:25.830
Magan: No, baby. It's not your fault that we're arguing

1098
02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:31.440
Magan: It's not your fault at all. Please don't think that this is the value because it's not

1099
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:33.210
Magan: I'm sorry.

1100
02:07:36.090 --> 02:07:38.850
Magan: sad about you. I love you very much on your

1101
02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:49.650
Magan: Adult behaviors and it's adults not acting like adults were acting silly and shouldn't be arguing and fighting in front of you guys. I'm sorry I

1102
02:07:54.600 --> 02:08:00.240
Magan: Know it's okay. It's not okay at all and I am very sorry for my behavior.

1103
02:08:22.890 --> 02:08:24.150
Magan: Hello. Yeah.

1104
02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:24.660
Hi.

1105
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can hear you see your little ones are

1106
02:08:32.010 --> 02:08:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to take responsibility for what's going on and they blame.

1107
02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:35.190
Me.

1108
02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:42.180
Magan: Yeah, they're all my son said to me that

1109
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:47.190
Magan: He goes, I'm glad to that you've

1110
02:08:52.890 --> 02:08:55.560
Magan: Been yelling in telling me it's my fault that

1111
02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You broke up. Did you say

1112
02:09:02.730 --> 02:09:03.270
He's

1113
02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Say one more time.

1114
02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.070
He said that

1115
02:09:09.810 --> 02:09:18.000
Magan: I'm glad that you are taking us to school mommy and not Dan do because because Dan do would have yelled at.

1116
02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:23.280
Magan: Me and said that it's my fault is why you guys are fighting

1117
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:29.250
Magan: No.

1118
02:09:30.570 --> 02:09:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely not.

1125
02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:48.870
Magan: It's not, it's not his fault but

1126
02:09:50.160 --> 02:10:02.370
Magan: They often feel like when we're fighting like it's their fault. And he goes, Mom. I'm scared. And I said, Why are you scared and he says, I'm scared that you guys are going to break up.

1127
02:10:04.890 --> 02:10:05.280
Magan: And

1128
02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:14.100
Magan: I know that both of my children love Andrew

1129
02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:19.710
Magan: But I do know that this isn't healthy for anybody.

1130
02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know those

1131
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:28.440
Magan: Guys just I don't

1132
02:10:34.230 --> 02:10:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're there in the car with

1133
02:10:35.250 --> 02:10:36.750
Magan: You. Now you said

1134
02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.280
Magan: Yeah, we're I'm driving them to school right now.

1135
02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: We can sort of postpone talking about

1136
02:10:50.910 --> 02:10:52.230
Magan: Oh, can you hear me.

1137
02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:52.860
Yeah.

1138
02:11:00.150 --> 02:11:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can do while

1139
02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We're moving and they're still in the car is

1140
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:04.440
Magan: Kind of see

1141
02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Any improvement for you on a goal you have

1142
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:10.530
Magan: About feeling

1143
02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:15.810
Magan: The whole. Can you hear me.

1144
02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:19.140
Magan: The whole point of him.

1145
02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:24.480
Magan: The whole point of him going back to the job at the library was to be

1146
02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:37.740
Magan: Four and to help out with the kids and take them to school and pick them up because of the hours that I work and then he utilizes it as a punishment against me.

1147
02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:41.220
Magan: And it's like, well,

1148
02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:47.220
Magan: The whole reason why you left the job at parking, which was lot more money was because

1149
02:11:48.690 --> 02:11:54.330
Magan: You. You were supposed to help out with this ship that's harder for me to do because the hours that I work

1150
02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:04.560
Magan: But now it's no its own Megan's behaving the way that I don't like. And he would we just said, take your own fucking kids to school like that.

1151
02:12:06.090 --> 02:12:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And or your

1152
02:12:07.290 --> 02:12:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or your kids hearing the right now.

1153
02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:12.330
Magan: They heard they heard they heard that.

1154
02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we talk about stuff that's this one, you have a goal, we can pick that up when they're on the car like feel you. What are your goals is feel comfortable in developing friendships.

1155
02:12:28.590 --> 02:12:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Deep. Have you made any inroads in that goal.

1156
02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:33.120
Magan: Um,

1157
02:12:34.830 --> 02:12:45.030
Magan: I well I did tell James. I don't know if you recall about James being overweight and he makes comments about himself.

1158
02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I remember

1159
02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:50.880
Magan: When I told him you know I feel

1160
02:12:52.830 --> 02:13:00.810
Magan: I didn't say I feel not. What if I feel sad when you say those remarks about yourself.

1161
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:07.710
Magan: Something along those lines. I don't know if those were the exact words, but I did practice.

1162
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:15.120
Magan: State how I felt regarding his remarks about himself.

1163
02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How's it go

1164
02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:18.960
Magan: He goes

1165
02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:23.550
Magan: He essentially said that that's the way that he is and

1166
02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:34.680
Magan: She's he's always been one to to say things like that and you know it's he uses it as an icebreaker like

1167
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.350
Magan: As like a funny joke.

1168
02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:48.660
Magan: You know, and it definitely doesn't feel that way it doesn't feel like an icebreaker. It doesn't feel like a funny joke. It feels like he's knocking himself.

1169
02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:57.570
Magan: And so i just i just i didn't push any further, but I did kind of vein.

1170
02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:16.470
Magan: As regards to everything else i don't i don't really talk to people. I just, I go to work I do my job and I come home and I take care of the kids and

1171
02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.920
Magan: I it's like

1172
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:22.980
Magan: I like do is

1173
02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:30.540
Magan: Take care of everything that needs to be taken care of in business and I don't really have time to

1174
02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:33.270
Magan: Well, it's not that I don't have time.

1175
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:36.510
Magan: If I wanted to make time I could

1176
02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:41.460
Magan: If it was absolutely necessary.

1177
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But your goal was to feel more comfortable.

1178
02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:48.270
Magan: And that

1179
02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.900
Magan: You are. I'm not

1180
02:14:52.890 --> 02:14:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so little progress.

1181
02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:58.740
Magan: Yeah. So not so much progress there.

1182
02:14:58.830 --> 02:14:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. OK.

1183
02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, let's see what else we got here. Um, okay, we've got, I want to decrease my anxiety. So

1184
02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's different than you have real life.

1185
02:15:19.170 --> 02:15:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: stressors that

1186
02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And that those are events that pull on your resources. Those are demands. What you do with it. How you experience it. That's anxiety.

1187
02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you see these are the stressors that will continue. Everyone's got them.

1188
02:15:44.190 --> 02:15:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you aware of your job when it gets tight.

1189
02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:58.680
Magan: No, I'm grinding my teeth right now and it's really tight. I'm really anxious right now. I feel ashamed of myself.

1190
02:16:02.070 --> 02:16:04.380
Magan: But in anything right now. I feel shame.

1191
02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you did wrong.

1192
02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:17.610
Magan: I feel shame because it's all in front of my kids.

1193
02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:21.060
Magan: And I

1194
02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:35.490
Magan: It's very hard for me when he antagonizing me like that or gets under my skin or talks to my children with a raised voice or in a derogatory way that I don't like or towards me.

1195
02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:45.210
Magan: I become hostile like it really angry. It's that similar to 100 thing happening again. It's not the

1196
02:16:46.650 --> 02:16:58.500
Magan: I'm done, you know, engaging in this behavior. I'm going to walk away from the situation and it feels like I'm trapped because I need him to handle business.

1197
02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:00.870
Magan: You know, it feels like

1198
02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:04.950
Magan: How

1199
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:14.880
Magan: Just because we're arguing or fighting. I still take care of the things that need to be taken care of with him in mind and I respect the things that you need, or does

1200
02:17:17.310 --> 02:17:17.820
Magan: Um,

1201
02:17:20.190 --> 02:17:30.510
Magan: And I didn't, I didn't take that deep breath. I didn't, I didn't take step back. I didn't come down. I didn't, I immediately became angry.

1202
02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:53.430
Magan: Because I came home and the first thing that I felt was attacked and I'm tired. I haven't gotten sleep and I just got off of an eight hour shift. And I've worked all night and he doesn't seem to care. And so, even more so, right now it seems so much easier to become angry morning, sir.

1203
02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:57.930
Magan: You as well.

1204
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm guessing in the next five minutes.

1205
02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:07.080
Magan: Yeah, we just went through the military.

1206
02:18:13.650 --> 02:18:14.700
Magan: It's just

1207
02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:17.760
Magan: I find it that

1208
02:18:19.410 --> 02:18:22.170
Magan: The exercises that we practice together.

1209
02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:30.990
Magan: I find it most difficult to do them with him.

1210
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:33.300
Yeah.

1211
02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:36.420
Magan: I really really do and

1212
02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:54.270
Magan: I can, I can practice it more and I can be more cognitive of myself in other situations, even with people that I really don't like work or people in my day to day life, but with him. I find it extremely difficult.

1213
02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're almost dropped him off. How about we do this, you

1214
02:18:59.550 --> 02:19:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus on your little ones.

1215
02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to walk away from the screen you come back. Okay, and we're going to continue

1216
02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:10.320
Magan: Okay, thank you.

1217
02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:12.120
Magan: Okay.

1218
02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:14.940
Okay.

1219
02:19:18.210 --> 02:19:18.930
What's going on.

1220
02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:25.740
Magan: Baby boy, but I'm really sorry about this.

1221
02:19:27.630 --> 02:19:28.320
I really am.

1222
02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:35.010
Magan: I know it seems that way. But Mommy. Mommy makes mistakes too and

1223
02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:40.440
What

1224
02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:43.770
Magan: I said,

1225
02:19:44.850 --> 02:19:48.840
Magan: It's not, it's not healthy for you guys to be around this kind of stuff.

1226
02:19:50.610 --> 02:19:52.950
Magan: So healthy to start off your day like this.

1227
02:19:55.200 --> 02:20:03.300
Magan: I really want you guys to try to put your best foot forward today, everything is OK, I will talk to Dan do when he gets home.

1228
02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:12.240
Magan: It's situated. But everything's gonna be all right. McKenna, are you okay

1229
02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:14.370
Magan: Matter bubble

1230

Feeling good.

1231
02:20:23.310 --> 02:20:23.520
Magan: One.

1232
02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:30.960
Magan: Well, when you get home from school today.

1233
02:20:36.690 --> 02:20:55.410
Magan: I need some sweet. So you really don't need to go to the nurse's office JJ. If you go for your inhaler last year running the fever or your phone beating or something. That's when you would need to come, but I just to have a head cold, everybody gets a cold call

1234
02:21:06.690 --> 02:21:11.760
Magan: Yeah. Now she called me yesterday because she said she outside. Yeah.

1235
02:21:13.050 --> 02:21:13.290

Magan: School time. Why do you like

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:40.290
Magan: What is the matter with you today you have

1240
02:21:41.550 --> 02:21:45.240
Magan: To be every time I do something, you get mad at

02:21:48.030 --> 02:21:48.210
Me.

1242
02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:54.630
Magan: Look what day. I love you very, very much.

1243
02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:35.160
Magan: I'm trying to

1244
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:40.440
Magan: Hold on, I can't see the screen.

1245
02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:45.210
Magan: Can you, can you hear me.

1246
02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I can hear you. But the screen is frozen.

1247
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.010
Magan: Yeah, it's because my

1248
02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:55.110
Magan: This is like not my morning at all. Okay.

1249
02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:56.010
We're okay.

1250
02:22:57.330 --> 02:23:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want you can sign back and if you want when you get back home.

1251
02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:01.380
Okay.

1252
02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:09.150
Magan: Can you see me now.

1253
02:23:13.770 --> 02:23:16.380
Magan: So Andrew said something to me last week.

1254
02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:21.570
Magan: That really pissed me off after I got a session with you.

1255
02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:33.120
Magan: And granted, he wasn't dead asleep when I was meeting with you on Friday. So he wasn't in the room or anything like that.

1256
02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:41.400
Magan: But he came out and at the very end when I when I said that I am enough

1257
02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:47.100
Magan: She came out and

1258
02:23:48.420 --> 02:23:51.510
Magan: She got really angry.

1259
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:54.720
Magan: And he was like,

1260
02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:01.770
Magan: Dr brielle isn't man hater.

1261
02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:07.110
Magan: And she's not right about everything.

1262
02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:11.130
Magan: And she's just trying to get you to

1263
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:21.510
Magan: Say, I don't know the exact words that he said, but it was actually that that you don't know everything and

1264
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:27.390
Magan: Especially when it comes to him and I and that you hate men.

1265
02:24:29.310 --> 02:24:38.430
Magan: That's that's literally what he said to me, and I was like, what, what are you talking about, and he goes, you know exactly what I've talked about

1266
02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:52.620
Magan: And you discussing stuff with me and I was like, You know what, or about me and I was like, You know what, believe it or not, I know it might be hard for you to believe, but now that that conversation was about is actually me

1267
02:24:54.870 --> 02:25:03.030
Magan: And it really like it really pissed me off that he said that and it's like it's bothering him that

1268
02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:05.160
Magan: I

1269
02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:10.950
Magan: That I have. I don't, I don't know.

1270
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:23.460
Magan: Did I have someone that I can depend on outside him somebody like talk to you outside of him. I don't know what's bothering him about me talking to you.

1271
02:25:27.390 --> 02:25:28.890
Magan: But apparently, it does.

1272
02:25:32.310 --> 02:25:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So is there anything about that that

1273
02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:36.120
Magan: Surprises this

1274
02:25:36.270 --> 02:25:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of a pad a pattern.

1275
02:25:39.090 --> 02:25:39.660
Magan: And

1276
02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:40.740
Magan: It just

1277
02:25:40.830 --> 02:25:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to be in addition to your life. It

1278
02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Could have been someone else.

1279
02:25:47.130 --> 02:25:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Could have been a friend.

1280
02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:49.800
Magan: Right, that

1281
02:25:52.650 --> 02:25:53.100
Magan: This is

1282
02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Typical or is this a real departure from from its

1283
02:25:56.310 --> 02:25:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Character behavior.

1284
02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:06.690
Magan: This is typical. But I think you know it was escalated because

1285
02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:09.450
Magan: I think

1286
02:26:13.290 --> 02:26:18.120
Magan: You know, like my dad and my mom or my dad, my sister and my dad.

1287
02:26:19.650 --> 02:26:27.000
Magan: Said to me like cuz I'll always say like, Oh, he's trying harder doing more. He's been trying war.

1288
02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:33.810
Magan: When when they'll make a comment about him and how he is towards me and my kids.

1289
02:26:35.070 --> 02:26:37.410
Magan: And my dad told me he's like he's always trying

1290
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:42.630
Magan: That's all he's been doing for 10 years just trying more

1291
02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:48.240
Magan: I think that he feels very threatened.

1292
02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:49.920
Magan: By Mike

1293
02:26:53.160 --> 02:27:04.440
Magan: And I don't know what hurt from our appointment, because I don't think he heard anything. The only part that he came out and may have heard. Well, I'm pretty sure you did here was when I said I am enough

1294
02:27:05.850 --> 02:27:07.530
Magan: That was it. But

1295
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:13.080
Magan: It was like he thought that was directed at him. I don't know.

1296
02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:22.950
Magan: Like, how could I don't understand why he all of a sudden

1297
02:27:24.330 --> 02:27:27.630
Magan: After my appointment ends with say that blend a today.

1298
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:36.540
Magan: And like that you have a problem with nails.

1299
02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:47.850
Magan: And I'm like what a second hughley met her one time. And he's like, that's right. She doesn't even know. But she definitely has formed an opinion of me and

1300
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:59.100
Magan: Follow the law. And I'm like, What the fuck are you talking about like nobody I hadn't conveyed anything to him saying when says this, he says that

1301
02:28:01.290 --> 02:28:04.020
Magan: I just don't understand why he would be bothered.

1302
02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:07.500
Magan: By us meeting.

1303
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:11.400
Magan: I don't know.

1304
02:28:14.850 --> 02:28:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're saying you don't know. But then I hear you talking about how you do know.

1305
02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:26.790
Magan: I do and I don't, because I don't understand where that came from. Out of nowhere like it literally came out of nowhere.

1306
02:28:28.350 --> 02:28:40.440
Magan: And then I do because it's Andrew and Andrews arrogant and Andrew likes things to be about him and anything that's not is a threat and

1307
02:28:42.570 --> 02:28:51.030
Magan: My giving anybody attention, including myself, is a threat to him, right. That's exactly what I took from that. It's like

1308
02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:57.630
Magan: You're not even here for him or for us. You're here for me.

1309
02:28:58.710 --> 02:29:04.410
Magan: And I attended that appointment for myself, not for him, not for us for me.

1310
02:29:11.610 --> 02:29:12.810
Magan: Anybody who has

1311
02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:27.150
Magan: I'm not plugging in.

1312
02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:31.470
Magan: Okay, I'm sorry. Sorry. Plugging in

1313
02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It gave me a time to

1314
02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1315
02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How much reading. Have you done i mean the the Internet offers lots of

1316
02:31:31.290 --> 02:31:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of handy information around

1317
02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Narcissism

1318
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: The label is correct or not.

1319
02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: If the the strategies might be

1320
02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Helpful for you to stop sending all that energy trying to wonder why he's doing what he's doing.

1321
02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:54.450
Magan: Well, I always prayed.

1322
02:31:55.050 --> 02:31:58.260
Magan: I do try this one statement that you told me

1323
02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:09.570
Magan: This is not about me, it's about him. Yeah, it's so hard to think that when I when he's attacked

1324
02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:11.940
Magan: Me.

1325
02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:14.130
Magan: Or my kids.

1326
02:32:15.150 --> 02:32:26.850
Magan: Like Jared left to Gatorade on the sinks is on the counter this morning and how he spoke to Jared piss me the fuck off. Jerry, are you gonna. Are you finished with this Gatorade. Are you gonna do something with it.

1327
02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:31.050
Magan: And I turned it over. I said, Stop talking to my child like that.

1328
02:32:32.130 --> 02:32:33.600
Magan: Like the only stuff out.

1329
02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

1330
02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Your statement to him your demand right stop talking to my child like that. Are you hoping that he will change that Andrew will change.

1331
02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:49.200
Magan: I think a part of me is

1332
02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And how much evidence has there been that he will change based on your demands and pointing out his areas that he needs to improve

1333
02:32:59.010 --> 02:33:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been with him for a few years, right, what evidence you have that your demands and polite requests heartfelt requests either style have gotten him to change in a meaningful way.

1334
02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:22.110
Magan: To us to say that got me thinking yesterday with my dad. It's like

1335
02:33:23.370 --> 02:33:25.080
Magan: I do see his effort.

1336
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:31.260
Magan: For example,

1337
02:33:34.290 --> 02:33:37.920
Magan: Him trying to have a better relationship with earth and McKenna.

1338
02:33:40.770 --> 02:33:50.340
Magan: Taking the time to listen to them being more patient with McKenna's needs because she has ADHD and it's a little bit different for her.

1339
02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:52.230
Magan: I'm

1340
02:33:55.650 --> 02:34:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, the Gatorade is not an example of patients, but you have an example of patience.

1341
02:34:00.930 --> 02:34:01.440
Magan: I do

1342
02:34:03.570 --> 02:34:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1343
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:17.400
Magan: So it's, that's the thing that I get stuck with because I do see his effort and it's not consistently the same and it's not as bad as it used to be. And I do see the heat try

1344
02:34:18.570 --> 02:34:19.260
Magan: But it's

1345
02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:21.630
Magan: It's

1346
02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:31.500
Magan: Those old behavior. So come back up and same me local papers, come back up for me as well.

1347
02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:33.420
Magan: And

1348
02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:47.850
Magan: I don't yell at his children. I don't particularly like his children. Sometimes I really don't. I don't like the he parents more than anything.

1349
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:50.550
Magan: But I have to accept it.

1350
02:34:53.430 --> 02:35:02.370
Magan: When he's asked me to modify things especially behaviors. I've had to do. So he's literally put our marriage on the line for literally

1351
02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:06.330
Magan: And I've never done that to him.

1352
02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:09.180
Magan: But

1353
02:35:10.410 --> 02:35:11.850
Magan: More and more lately.

1354
02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:17.490
Magan: Like an adult like right now. This is the first fight that we've had in weeks.

1355
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:35.790
Magan: Like several weeks. And that's big for us. We don't fight as much as we used to. Mainly because I'm not around. Also, because I just don't fucking care, I don't want to give him my energy. I don't want to give him my good energy or my bad and I don't want to give him anything

1356
02:35:38.130 --> 02:35:38.700
Magan: And I

1357
02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:42.510
Magan: I wanted to say so badly.

1358
02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:47.550
Magan: I want

1359
02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:56.730
Magan: I want to break. I think I want a break from you. I don't know if this is what I want anymore.

1360
02:35:57.450 --> 02:36:04.650
Magan: And I'm scared to lose my home. I'm scared to lose my comfortability I'm scared to lose my lifestyle. I'm scared to start all over again.

1361
02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:17.880
Magan: And scared because I'm 33, you know, two years old and I'm getting older and who's going to want me and I'm scared because I have two children, and two mouths. I have to feed that depend on me and I'm scared because

1362
02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:22.500
Magan: I feel very alone.

1363
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:25.650
Magan: Even in our marriage.

1364
02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:34.830
Magan: And I just don't know if he's what I want anymore if I if I want this anymore. I'm

1365
02:36:36.450 --> 02:36:37.140
Magan: I don't want

1366
02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:40.110
Magan: I'm obviously not happy.

1367
02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:48.090
Magan: And I don't, I don't know how to make him. See how serious I am about my needs in our marriage.

1368
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:51.870
Magan: Yeah, and

1369
02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:58.800
Magan: I have listened to his needs. I've met a lot of his needs. Not all of them.

1370
02:37:00.390 --> 02:37:06.420
Magan: I've at least put effort in trying to meet the majority of them have met some of them, but not all of them.

1371
02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:18.150
Magan: But I just want I wanted so badly just say I need a break. I need a break from you. I need space from you.

1372
02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:20.040
Yeah.

1373
02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:27.720
Magan: I just don't. I don't.

1374
02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:31.980
Magan: I don't know what I'm like without him.

1375
02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:35.850
Magan: I don't

1376
02:37:37.350 --> 02:37:39.060
Magan: I don't know. I'm like, without

1377
02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:41.370
Magan: Every single

1378
02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:48.390
Magan: Course, Megan like just as Megan.

1379
02:37:55.710 --> 02:37:56.160
Magan: But

1380
02:37:57.810 --> 02:38:00.330
Magan: This morning, it's just me accepting it.

1381
02:38:01.950 --> 02:38:05.100
Magan: As it is dealing with it as it is. As usual,

1382
02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you don't have to make a decision about

1383
02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether there's a separation or not a separation or whether you want to be with him or not right now.

1384
02:38:31.530 --> 02:38:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't. You don't have to make that decision right now.

1385
02:38:37.980 --> 02:38:40.560
Magan: breaks my heart when oil told me that he scared.

1386
02:38:41.730 --> 02:38:43.890
Magan: Because he does a mommy and daddy breakup.

1387
02:38:52.050 --> 02:38:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the fear, what's your, what's your fear.

1388
02:38:58.830 --> 02:39:06.780
Magan: Damage them more than I'm Marty damaging them now, either by staying with him or by separating from him and more except

1389
02:39:08.610 --> 02:39:09.660
Magan: That I don't know.

1390
02:39:11.130 --> 02:39:14.910
Magan: What's the good outcome. And that's the bad outcome. I don't know any outcome.

1391
02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:23.100
Magan: I'm afraid that I'm going to remove somebody that they love from their lives, somebody that they care about somebody that they know

1392
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:28.410
Magan: They're just kind of stuck along for the ride because of my choices.

1393
02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:31.140
Magan: And I'm afraid that I'm making.

1394
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:34.920
Magan: Horrible ones that are going to

1395
02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:39.120
Magan: Do destroy them.

1396
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You're saying that I was by breaking up right now. You're fantasizing about the breakout being the destructive event.

1397
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:56.310
Magan: No. Not even just the breakup even saying together that Aikido that none of this is healthy. None of it is

1398
02:39:58.170 --> 02:39:59.490
Magan: It's my healthy

1399
02:40:03.150 --> 02:40:04.860
Magan: And I'm frustrated

1400
02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:09.030
Magan: I want to be heard. And I'm not

1401
02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And I gotcha. I sure do. Your eyes are opening Megan.

1402
02:40:21.210 --> 02:40:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yours, you know instantly. You know, you remember I said it's it's going to come down to your actually you're going to like something you're not going to like it with your eyes opening your preference for whether you want to be around this or not.

1403
02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:35.100
It will come

1404
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't have to have it all figured out right now. Okay.

1405
02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to be fine.

1406
02:40:45.690 --> 02:40:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You are just fine. And you had horrific things happen and you're fine. Okay, you have your love. They have your very honest way of speaking to them so they don't go crazy.

1407
02:40:59.130 --> 02:41:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You did not have what you are giving those children yet to speak their truth and you validate them. You don't say. Shut up. You're making that up. Knock it off. You make sure they're not going crazy.

1408
02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and they can be done, they get to go play because you basically said this is this is for us to work out. This is grown up stuff. You just go play and do your thing. You don't have to worry about. Everything's gonna be fine.

1409
02:41:29.610 --> 02:41:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You will always love you no matter what we get all riled up has to do with you and but the key is

1410
02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the crazy part

1411
02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you're in tune with them. And you're saying what you said. Like, just because I can hear a little bits in the car, right.

1412
02:41:49.890 --> 02:41:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important, which you're doing focus on that you you're going to all these worries about the damage that you're doing to them, but you're

1413
02:41:58.590 --> 02:42:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on this journey of growth and you're doing better each

1414
02:42:05.430 --> 02:42:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that

1415
02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:11.520
Magan: Night. I do see a lot of changing

1416
02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:17.790
Magan: I do. And I think that's also part of this with him.

1417
02:42:19.350 --> 02:42:21.480
Magan: Like that comment last week.

1418
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:27.780
Magan: I think he sees my meeting with you in the growth that I'm making as a threat.

1419
02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That just

1420
02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that ok though that

1421
02:42:35.940 --> 02:42:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That your impression

1422
02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't check it out, meaning he won't give you

1423
02:42:39.450 --> 02:42:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The accurate information, but your assessment of it.

1424
02:42:44.490 --> 02:42:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a reasonable one and move on. You assessed it as probably that's what it was. Because for someone to attack they feel threatened. So that's it. That's probably correct.

1425
02:43:03.930 --> 02:43:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Your reality.

1426
02:43:07.470 --> 02:43:07.920
Magan: Is

1427
02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have anybody saying you're not crazy right you don't have anybody saying what you're seeing is real. This is real, have you

1428
02:43:18.150 --> 02:43:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You rehearsing

1429
02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The skill of paying attention to your gut paying attention to your intuition is this, is this okay, is this acceptable. Is this real you're getting practiced at it right now.

1430
02:43:33.210 --> 02:43:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And at some point you'll either

1431
02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Find a way to

1432
02:43:37.170 --> 02:43:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Some happiness and maybe it'll be a settling in.

1433
02:43:40.470 --> 02:43:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: There may be

1434
02:43:41.070 --> 02:43:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Leaving i don't know but you don't have to figure it all right now.

1435
02:43:47.370 --> 02:43:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I tell you if it turns out that

1436
02:43:52.380 --> 02:44:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're interacting with is is is some sort of that sort of quintessential on narcissism race. That's what it turns out it is

1437
02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did the other day when you just said, I just don't want to give them any energy

1438
02:44:12.750 --> 02:44:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a great strategy.

1439
02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he needs you having a big reaction, he needs it.

1440
02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you don't give it to him.

1441
02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: He's got some choices to make.

1442
02:44:32.490 --> 02:44:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You can escalate it

1443
02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: He can give up and turn towards someone else to be an energy vampire. I don't know.

1444
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what do you want to do. I mean,

1445
02:44:52.290 --> 02:45:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to keep playing the game of trying to get him to explain himself as if underneath it. There is beneficence that really at the heart of that he's doing it because he

1446
02:45:02.310 --> 02:45:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: really loves you and all those behaviors. The yelling and you know that it was really because he loves you. Like if you keep asking like maybe at the bottom of all this, it was loving kindness.

1447
02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:17.220
Magan: You know,

1448
02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:25.770
Magan: I know that a lot of his behaviors are not loving kindness very manipulative. He's very controlling

1449
02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:32.640
Magan: He wants. Even the way that we interact with each other. He has to control that.

1450
02:45:33.870 --> 02:45:38.010
Magan: His behaviors are so repetitive so predictable.

1451
02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:39.720
Magan: Nice.

1452
02:45:41.430 --> 02:45:42.300
Magan: I just

1453
02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:45.000
Magan: But you sit there and

1454
02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You still let yourself get surprised. And that's the part you could make a difference.

1455
02:45:52.740 --> 02:46:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how to predict what's going to happen. I think you know a lot more than you're you're acknowledging they are predictable. People are predictable once they get into a groove. If it's I just need to see

1456
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Megan have strong emotion. I need to know that I can get her to have a strong emotion that if you really get that and you no longer offer it.

1457
02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You can either come in and be my hero and Russian and I, gosh, and I'm just so grateful. Note that Nope. Not that one. Not how, how could you not the rage.

1458
02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: All of it forever is just, oh boy. I really thought we had it figured out. I thought you were picking him up this a shrink and you being it for me. Alright, guys.

1459
02:46:40.650 --> 02:46:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go.

1460
02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: raging and just the just the insult. How could you, you still act surprised. Now, you know, something like this was gonna happen. I do believe you know

1461
02:46:55.770 --> 02:47:05.340
Magan: No, I did because you're right, because as we were fighting. I was waiting for it because I knew it was going to come. I knew it was. And you're absolutely right.

1462
02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:14.130
Magan: It's gonna find something, something that he knows that will severely inconvenience me and make my life harder, they will have a reaction.

1463
02:47:15.090 --> 02:47:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: you rewatch this is hard to swallow. But when you do this.

1464
02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Dang it.

1465
02:47:22.530 --> 02:47:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: If you really get that that's exactly a win for him. It means to just fueled exactly his need, oh, I have this much impact on this woman. If you really got that.

1466
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then if you knew your power was just this what on the internet. They're calling, like, you know, it's this trendy little Gray Rock expression you just like this. You're like, I'm nothing. You're like a but you're just nothing

1467
02:47:50.310 --> 02:47:50.820
Magan: So no

1468
02:47:53.580 --> 02:48:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Other calling a great rock. I'm like, I like it. I'm going to use that. Now, I like it but picture. There's nothing special about a great rock you pass by it all the time.

1469
02:48:01.470 --> 02:48:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like, I was like, what, either. Maybe I cast one. I don't even know. Maybe there were a few of them. But there's nothing special. So you you just are just this, you're just

1470
02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I had, I was remembering that that today you you would be taking the kids in

1471
02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: inconvenient. Okay. Alright guys, let's, let's see. So data you need to get this and you need to get that

1472
02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

1473
02:48:32.250 --> 02:48:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: He is going to be. Wait a minute.

1474
02:48:36.270 --> 02:48:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I just leveraged

1475
02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that usually gets her so upset.

1476
02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:53.340
Magan: You're going to feel calm.

1477
02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:56.280
Magan: And what's your access what I'm thinking.

1478
02:48:58.710 --> 02:49:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So these are the things that

1479
02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you decide to go that route. And it's not too different than what you were doing earlier because I heard it, you're like, I'm just, I'm not home and it's just disappearing. You're just basically you don't engage. If you decide to go that route.

1480
02:49:12.570 --> 02:49:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's things like this. You might want to write these down. I don't know, but

1481
02:49:22.530 --> 02:49:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Please.

1482
02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:23.580
Magan: Hold on.

1483
02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one.

1484
02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Maintain realistic expectation

1485
02:49:58.950 --> 02:50:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's number one. Number two.

1486
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:05.610
Magan: Radical. Wait, hold on the main to

1487
02:50:07.020 --> 02:50:07.680
Stick.

1488
02:50:14.610 --> 02:50:15.930
Magan: Can you give me an example.

1489
02:50:16.770 --> 02:50:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I can. I'm just worried that my next client will come in and we'll kind of want to give you this list just in

1490
02:50:21.690 --> 02:50:24.870
Magan: Case. Okay, go ahead, go ahead.

1491
02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Number to radical acceptance.

1492
02:50:33.150 --> 02:50:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, don't engage

1493
02:50:37.710 --> 02:50:38.700
Magan: Is that the same one.

1494
02:50:39.570 --> 02:50:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's number three.

1495
02:50:43.230 --> 02:50:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And don't forget, don't defend and explain

1496
02:50:54.540 --> 02:51:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously continue setting boundaries. Continue setting boundaries. What you want what you like, what, what you prefer.

1497
02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Number six. Kind of have in your mind, a list of really benign neutral topics that you can talk about. In other words, you're going to set the tone of

1498
02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So he does that, let's say, let's say you knew already knew.

1499
02:51:15.180 --> 02:51:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, my next clients here, but it's be something like, oh yeah. Hey, Andrew just run through the basics of my schedules, the same as last week, I'm probably going to spend this weekend. I'll do some review of this and this and then I'm going to go shopping. I'm is that, you know,

1500
02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And

1501
02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:40.260
Magan: Any children see. So there's no

1502
02:51:42.270 --> 02:51:44.460
Magan: Number six is a list of new journal write

1503
02:51:45.570 --> 02:51:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A list of neutral topics that you already have on your mind.

1504
02:51:48.330 --> 02:51:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are what you talk about talks about intensely

1505
02:51:53.490 --> 02:51:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotionally provoking topics that try and manipulate you just focus on the things you want to talk about the ones that are neutral.

1506
02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:02.490
Magan: Okay.

1507
02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the deletion. Yeah, the big piece. The biggest one. When I said maintain realistic expectations.

1508
02:52:12.330 --> 02:52:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how don't yell at my kids right

1509
02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You were hoping for. It's not real. It's not you were hoping for a change.

1510
02:52:24.690 --> 02:52:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Be realistic.

1511
02:52:26.730 --> 02:52:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: each moment it's running to that list in your mind, am I being realistic or is this one of those moments after really accept this is how he is. Hey, guys. Um, and, you know, address him just to address your son I guys let's let's go play

1512
02:52:46.110 --> 02:52:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep keep hammering away trying to expect.

1513
02:52:49.500 --> 02:52:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This change.

1514
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, when are we meeting again.

1515
02:52:55.290 --> 02:52:56.010
Next Friday.

1516
02:52:57.420 --> 02:53:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got you written in there and that's what we'll do.

1517
02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:02.850
Magan: Thank you.

1518
02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry about today.

1519
02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Play with this.

1520
02:53:06.750 --> 02:53:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: With this list. See, see if it gives you some some ideas about how to hold on to your, your strength when you're around someone trying to trying to hurt. Just remember any reaction, whether it's really happy.

1521
02:53:21.060 --> 02:53:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And grateful.

1522
02:53:24.210 --> 02:53:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The same outcome.

1523
02:53:27.780 --> 02:53:30.090
Magan: Okay, so it's still a reaction.

1524
02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. Great. Rock.

1525
02:53:35.490 --> 02:53:37.350
Magan: Okay, alright. Have a good day.

1526
02:53:38.370 --> 02:53:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You too. Bye.

1527
02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Gluten Morgan.

1528
02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You just waking up.

1529
02:53:54.330 --> 02:53:54.960
Nicole Roybal: Showered

1530
02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:57.330
Nicole Roybal: You did, yeah.

1531
02:54:01.170 --> 02:54:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and you. What are you eating there for breakfast. What do you mean

1532
02:54:06.330 --> 02:54:07.020
Nicole Roybal: Honestly,

1533
02:54:12.060 --> 02:54:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm happy Friday.

1534
02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:17.550
Nicole Roybal: And not the best thing, but something in my stomach.

1535
02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. So where are we out on the roller coaster of relationship.

1536
02:54:25.140 --> 02:54:30.840
Nicole Roybal: I'm not talking to him. He's doing for me to give them the key to our apartment, but I've been kind of holding it. Oh.

1537
02:54:32.130 --> 02:54:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Why trying to wouldn't mind doing that for

1538
02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:50.370
Nicole Roybal: I'm on the list and I deserve to have that key. So, but the thing is I'm not paying rent or nothing. So then I guess it's basically is so I can, but it will have been court. And I think you were taken to court, but

1539
02:54:51.390 --> 02:54:54.300
Nicole Roybal: I just want to give it back to him. I know that like finalizes

1540
02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:59.670
Nicole Roybal: Our relationship like that means it's over, for sure. I think that's why I don't want

1541
02:55:01.770 --> 02:55:02.250
Nicole Roybal: To talk

1542
02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:09.510
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. Also my grandma's really sick. How I told you about her. I told you about her prolapse rectum. Right.

1543
02:55:10.890 --> 02:55:26.190
Nicole Roybal: So I guess it's getting worse and we took her to the last like two weeks ago and she hadn't showered or base sense to the doctor and so with all that stuff happening in her, but it's like bleeding and stuff. It's like clotting of sound good. She can infection.

1544
02:55:27.540 --> 02:55:36.480
Nicole Roybal: So we've been going over that we've been trying to go there. As much as we can, but my mom doesn't really ever out the car she if she's not at work. My dad's at work. So they only have one car so

1545
02:55:37.530 --> 02:55:45.780
Nicole Roybal: We're going there today. And the main thing is I shouldn't have food to eat all week because she can't even stand up so late start shaking all crazy so Shane's done but

1546
02:55:46.020 --> 02:55:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way you could stay with with your grandma.

1547
02:55:49.770 --> 02:55:58.860
Nicole Roybal: Well just she has a nice smoke cigarettes and I felt like she wouldn't be okay with it. Like I feel like she'd be really mad at him and I don't want to tell her that

1548
02:56:00.030 --> 02:56:05.730
Nicole Roybal: Was the only reason why I don't say that just because of how I smoke cigarettes and need oh they hate me.

1549
02:56:07.230 --> 02:56:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And since the last card.

1550
02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:18.390
Nicole Roybal: They weed on and then he was like, there's a smoking period. So that's like the main thing that's like holding me back from staying there but

1551
02:56:18.990 --> 02:56:28.170
Nicole Roybal: I know if I tell them I even asked my older sister. She's like the closest with them my oldest sister, and she's like, No, don't tell them that like they might even like this on me. I was like,

1552
02:56:30.270 --> 02:56:32.040
Nicole Roybal: But they are very like strict like

1553
02:56:33.090 --> 02:56:35.910

Nicole Roybal: But, um, but, yeah, so everyone that's what I'm doing all day today like distract you from stuff and just have been kind of like really depressed, honestly.

1562
02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:16.050
Nicole Roybal: It's kind of staying in bed watching TV.

1563
02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:20.640
Nicole Roybal: watching other people's relationships fail.

1564
02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:24.360
Nicole Roybal: I guess reality shows

1565
02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So you still want you still want this relationship with your boyfriend.

1566
02:57:31.650 --> 02:57:36.750
Nicole Roybal: I feel like I don't know like this. I think of all the cons and also he wouldn't allow me to do it.

1567
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:49.770
Nicole Roybal: At all, was that I would like for my leg. I would like to be building out my friends and just the way I want and stuff like that and certain other little things of how he's always like negative towards me.

1568
02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:59.670
Nicole Roybal: And I want someone better. That doesn't seem like that that wants to be with me or accept CDs. But then there's also the part that part of me that

1569
02:58:00.210 --> 02:58:08.520
Nicole Roybal: They loved him and I miss him. And it's been five years, you know, like I can't just forget that. And it feels like he can't like, it's so easy for him.

1570
02:58:09.930 --> 02:58:12.240
Nicole Roybal: And honestly, it's really killing me like I just don't

1571
02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:20.610
Nicole Roybal: I don't like being thing away from him is my best friend even believe means still my best friend. He's been my only friend for five years. So it's just, it's hard to

1572
02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: See miss the friendship and

1573
02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:30.420
Nicole Roybal: companionship and just having someone that's there.

1574
02:58:31.830 --> 02:58:33.600
Nicole Roybal: Now love my family, but that's different.

1575
02:58:38.310 --> 02:58:41.970
Nicole Roybal: At least I have somebody is no bloody bush just

1576
02:58:43.260 --> 02:58:45.270
Nicole Roybal: It's hard. I'm so tired of being sad.

1577
02:58:46.680 --> 02:58:57.360
Nicole Roybal: And always fighting everything inside of me everything inside me tells me go to the store and dream and get some shots but I can't because I don't want to do that. I don't want to go back with

1578
02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, the reality. Nicole is that

1579
02:59:03.630 --> 02:59:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're struggling with right now. We'll be right where you left it right after you get sober and the alcohol wears off your only choices to keep

1580
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.820
Nicole Roybal: My I know

1581
02:59:17.160 --> 02:59:31.500
Nicole Roybal: Oh, like alcohol my system feels like of course that's gone. But it's just like I feel like the person in my mind like it's tiny to drink, just walk away and say show me not to. So I just lay in bed and just to have anyone to go class lately. Just because I don't want money.

1582
02:59:32.520 --> 02:59:39.150
Nicole Roybal: Because I'm just, I feel like I'm very vulnerable. Right. I'm not going to go and fix to that and bug you because I know you're so busy.

1583
02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So it feels like the the that

1584
02:59:44.670 --> 02:59:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Addict inside is really dominant

1585
02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:49.860
Right.

1586
02:59:52.260 --> 02:59:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The voice of addiction telling you to

1587
02:59:53.790 --> 02:59:55.800
Nicole Roybal: Go, it is what I'm sorry cut out

1588
02:59:56.130 --> 03:00:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is dominant so that for. Yeah. Yeah. It's very dominant and you're feeling like you don't want to do anything. And you're just kind of hanging out in bed.

1589
03:00:07.500 --> 03:00:07.920
Okay.

1590
03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:14.970
Nicole Roybal: So silly everyone and everything.

1591
03:00:17.430 --> 03:00:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's spend a little bit of time kind of keep working on the preparation phase here okay so

1592
03:00:26.010 --> 03:00:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you I was asking you, I think last week to

1593
03:00:31.890 --> 03:00:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Develop in your mind and protective here.

1594
03:00:34.710 --> 03:00:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're having a hard time coming up with someone and you were able to identify some quality about me. Right.

1595
03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And

1596
03:00:49.050 --> 03:00:52.350
Nicole Roybal: It's been hard to get to that place just because of all the other thoughts in my mind.

1597
03:00:55.020 --> 03:01:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's turn our attention away from kind of where it's been this last week and turn it towards these other more positive images. What about a nurturing figure, are you able to come up with someone either real or imagined that embodies

1598
03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone that wants

1599
03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And promotes your personal growth and development. Is there anyone that you think of

1600
03:01:21.180 --> 03:01:32.130
Nicole Roybal: Like I feel like my mom does. But then there's also the other side. I don't think negative Nikki, but it's just, I don't know, like there's also the other side of her that when she shouldn't be like different

1601
03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:37.260
Nicole Roybal: You know, just once you sober. He asked you to it supports what she's doing. She still supports me, but it's just different.

1602
03:01:38.340 --> 03:01:42.870
Nicole Roybal: Because I feel like it's not coming from her, like you said, it's coming from the other person.

1603
03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:44.160
Well,

1604
03:01:45.240 --> 03:02:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we'll put because it'd be nice to have this imagery that's very pure and it's not mixed and conflicted. So maybe something about Mom That's also a quality and someone else that you can think of real or imagined can be in a book TV show.

1605
03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:12.780
Nicole Roybal: Someone that I can trust.

1606
03:02:13.350 --> 03:02:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: He said, well, nurturing figure is someone that promotes your growth and development.

1607
03:02:28.050 --> 03:02:32.310
Nicole Roybal: Not I can think of. Honestly, like it's really hard on the lights are coming to think of someone like

1608
03:02:36.270 --> 03:02:41.280
Nicole Roybal: Even like you said like, even in a TV show, like, I don't know. That makes me go blank. Even I don't think that I'm

1609
03:02:50.970 --> 03:02:59.010
Nicole Roybal: I guess my, my best friend. Tiffany has always been there but that's someone that I actually ever widening out with recently but

1610
03:03:00.330 --> 03:03:03.210
Nicole Roybal: I just haven't, I guess, cuz I don't know I don't know I

1611
03:03:04.290 --> 03:03:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean, either.

1612
03:03:05.580 --> 03:03:09.330
Nicole Roybal: But that there's a reason there's a reason. I just don't know what it is, honestly.

1613
03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: My best friend, Tiffany. Maybe we can figure that out a little later. But let's keep building these figures. So what so picture being around Tiffany right now.

1614
03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What might she say or do, or that quality of encouragement to be your best self to develop and grow. What does she do or say

1615
03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:35.880
Nicole Roybal: She say

1616
03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:45.570
Nicole Roybal: I'm a strong woman and I'm better than this. And I can get through this and it just takes time that she knows me

1617
03:03:46.590 --> 03:03:51.420
Nicole Roybal: She knows that I can. I'm stronger than this person when bringing me down and maybe it's better

1618
03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:53.760
Nicole Roybal: Because now I finally

1619
03:03:57.750 --> 03:04:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Tiffany's able to see your strengths, you can say you're strong woman.

1620
03:04:02.850 --> 03:04:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you

1621
03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:09.540
Nicole Roybal: Joyce Elsa. We've known each other since fourth grade. So she really

1622
03:04:11.490 --> 03:04:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. Oh.

1623
03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Honey here. Cool.

1624
03:04:16.530 --> 03:04:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Yeah.

1625
03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:18.270
Yeah.

1626
03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:25.170
Nicole Roybal: You can make sure like she's working. He has a big families. I think that might be why I like to go around because

1627
03:04:26.490 --> 03:04:37.860
Nicole Roybal: I'm only one that really likes kids only for like an hour and then I'm just like, Oh, you guys, again, it's just for them. And then also just seeing what her and her family all happy in their house just

1628
03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:41.430
Nicole Roybal: Feel like everyone has me. Okay.

1629
03:04:41.850 --> 03:04:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's lift off of that. That's right. That's going to bring up that

1630
03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Business and

1631
03:04:50.850 --> 03:04:53.940
Nicole Roybal: Sorry, I think I just figured out why. I don't want to go over there. I just

1632
03:04:56.040 --> 03:05:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's the kids and seeing, seeing that perfect little life. And boy, I don't have it right now.

1633
03:05:03.570 --> 03:05:03.870
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

1634
03:05:05.550 --> 03:05:08.940
Nicole Roybal: You should people that are listening for five years already at least proposed to

1635
03:05:11.550 --> 03:05:15.060
Nicole Roybal: At least everyone in my life, everyone all my friends from my school

1636
03:05:17.580 --> 03:05:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's find another figure. Now we're going to go over to someone that is wise.

1637
03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yellow or imagined.

1638
03:05:32.970 --> 03:05:33.600
Wise.

1639
03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:49.200
Nicole Roybal: I really don't know.

1640
03:05:51.150 --> 03:05:59.820
Nicole Roybal: How would you describe wise like they're just like their wisdom, their older, they are not even older they decide know about life, like, what, how would you explain how

1641
03:06:00.390 --> 03:06:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That works sometimes

1642
03:06:02.310 --> 03:06:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You can picture someone who

1643
03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe if you saw it or read it. This person has a lot of lived experience they're knowledgeable and they're confident in the information that they have. And maybe they can share it with other people.

1644
03:06:31.440 --> 03:06:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: They know what to do. They know how to do it, they've got a history of doing it, they can maybe teach it. They're wise.

1645
03:06:42.930 --> 03:06:44.670
Nicole Roybal: That's honestly I don't

1646
03:06:48.390 --> 03:06:51.780
Nicole Roybal: Know it's hard to think of people in my life, or my

1647
03:06:52.440 --> 03:06:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: For you're pushing hard on unreal. You know, you can go imagined.

1648
03:06:57.150 --> 03:07:04.650
Nicole Roybal: You can go fictitious that on its own finding that a lot harder to do than having someone in my life and

1649
03:07:04.680 --> 03:07:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me I'm

1650
03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Some movies that maybe you've seen

1651
03:07:18.240 --> 03:07:22.140
Nicole Roybal: You can do anyone that would have had a smart person aren't any comedies or anything.

1652
03:07:24.990 --> 03:07:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, sometimes there's

1653
03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:31.950
Nicole Roybal: Oh, I'm thinking like Avengers, for some reason really wise and that was like Tony Stark.

1654
03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:36.810
Nicole Roybal: He's an asshole. But he knows what he's talking about.

1655
03:07:40.740 --> 03:07:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So Tony Stark. The Iron Man.

1656
03:07:44.580 --> 03:07:45.060
Yeah.

1657
03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's funny.

1658
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:51.570
Nicole Roybal: Person but share

1659
03:07:54.390 --> 03:07:54.690
Okay.

1660
03:07:56.250 --> 03:08:01.500
Nicole Roybal: Kim is a human as well like real life is like probably like wise done a lot

1661
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But he's real smart.

1662
03:08:06.300 --> 03:08:09.210
Nicole Roybal: Or how he from America's Got Talent on to

1663
03:08:10.980 --> 03:08:14.550
Nicole Roybal: Do it for me to but holes, but there's, there was

1664
03:08:16.920 --> 03:08:18.840

Nicole Roybal: Many men gal. Yes, I think it was last name.

1666
03:08:24.750 --> 03:08:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's this sort of

1667
03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Edge to him there. It's either comedy or they've got this or sort of sarcasm.

1668

Gwenevere Abriel: When you have forgotten.

1688
03:10:07.710 --> 03:10:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Continues

Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's there.

1690
03:10:12.930 --> 03:10:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And confidence to get through whatever comes your way.

1691
03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe picturing Gwen and Tiffany maybe having some interaction.

1692
03:10:32.370 --> 03:10:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready, bringing in the wise figure

1693
03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, you'll hear sounds around you just you pay attention and then let it go.

1694
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So pulling in that was figure quality.

1695
03:10:52.140 --> 03:10:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Of being really smart, right. How are your

1696
03:10:57.450 --> 03:10:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Tony

1697
03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: picturing them all interacting and you're there as an adult.

1698
03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What might they be doing this year they're

1699
03:11:19.380 --> 03:11:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Interacting with them.

1700
03:11:22.560 --> 03:11:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up.

1701
03:11:26.610 --> 03:11:27.990
Nicole Roybal: Look, baby. Tell me that.

1702
03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:37.920
Nicole Roybal: To suck it up and that this is what the wise one will be saying, suck it up, people are going to ours and

1703
03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:44.820
Nicole Roybal: You're gonna get through this. It's not like you're dying god doesn't give you nothing. You can go

1704
03:11:47.550 --> 03:11:53.130
Nicole Roybal: To be saying something more nicer like more in a nicer way. It's the same thing, just

1705
03:11:54.810 --> 03:11:58.920
Nicole Roybal: That strong enough. And this is just

1706
03:12:00.180 --> 03:12:02.610
Nicole Roybal: Another hill of getting over

1707
03:12:04.260 --> 03:12:09.990
Nicole Roybal: For that fall over. And now I'm down. And the only way to goes up now. Okay.

1708
03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:15.930
Nicole Roybal: She's here for me.

1709
03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're strong enough and she's also there for you.

1710
03:12:30.690 --> 03:12:36.660
Nicole Roybal: It's weird, our relationship like we won't hang out for like a year, but then really see each other. It's like no time has passed so crazy.

1711
03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Your quality of

1712
03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Sci Fi in this space. What did you notice around the protective figure

1713
03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:59.700
Nicole Roybal: I okay so when you first like when you first let me close my eyes to get back to me and and nurturing that made me like almost cry. But then I started doing like the breathing.

1714
03:13:01.530 --> 03:13:07.770
Nicole Roybal: And and then you said you've brought the wise people in and then that's when I felt more like stronger.

1715
03:13:08.610 --> 03:13:23.970
Nicole Roybal: My I stopped needing to cry. And I just like stopped feeling sorry for myself. And just finally accepted, I have to get my stuff together. I mean, my life is what I make it. I have to just figure it out and do it. Gotta do

1716
03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And

1717
03:13:29.100 --> 03:13:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This last piece, I can see

1718
03:13:36.060 --> 03:13:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear anything about the protective figure

1719
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.270
Nicole Roybal: What

1720
03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that change. Oh.

1721
03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:42.180
Is it changing

1722
03:13:44.130 --> 03:13:56.400
Nicole Roybal: Like yeah like I felt more I guess like confident, which is more like I feel like protective in a way because I'm being more protective of myself and actually caring about myself, instead of

1723
03:13:58.110 --> 03:14:10.710
Nicole Roybal: Worrying about what everyone else is thinking, feeling doing like I gotta stop doing that because when I do, I noticed I'm just caring about everyone else's and myself. And we're like, putting others needs before

1724
03:14:12.810 --> 03:14:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it, is it possible, it

1725
03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:15.660
Is

1726
03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Possible that the protective figure is really, you are an adult. Is that what I may

1727
03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:22.110
Or

1728
03:14:29.250 --> 03:14:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know if you need me to repeat that.

1729
03:14:30.900 --> 03:14:31.140
Because

1730
03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to repeat that.

1731
03:14:34.290 --> 03:14:35.160
Um,

1732
03:14:38.430 --> 03:14:47.370
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I guess, maybe. But then I get the same time, I like it came from just having

1733
03:14:48.390 --> 03:14:53.340
Nicole Roybal: Support itself to like all of us just like protecting me or the caring about me. I just

1734
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:57.150
Nicole Roybal: A barrier people that actually truly care about

1735
03:14:58.500 --> 03:15:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wanted to make a make sure when you actually visualized

1736
03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Me like whether I was there. Just wondering

1737
03:15:12.150 --> 03:15:15.120
Nicole Roybal: Because you said you and Tiffany And then as it kept going to work.

1738
03:15:16.260 --> 03:15:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. It was just them three and me okay here. Yeah, I don't know, I, for some reason, so maybe. So again, I'm hearing bits and pieces. So I want to make sure. So it started maybe with with Gwen and then maybe it became you

1739
03:15:31.350 --> 03:15:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's Tiffany And then these is that possible.

1740
03:15:35.370 --> 03:15:38.370
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, cuz I wasn't there. It was you. And Tiffany

1741
03:15:38.580 --> 03:15:39.180
And when

1742
03:15:40.380 --> 03:15:41.280
Keep going. Tell me.

1743
03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:51.540
Nicole Roybal: I want to make sure you're getting it and then you brought the wise people in that it was Tony and how he and then and then you weren't there. And then I was Sir

1744
03:15:52.560 --> 03:16:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's let's spend a little bit of time with really go go there again and see see you as this as this woman with the quality

1745
03:16:07.950 --> 03:16:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Of being able to bring in

1746
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing people bringing in wise people into your space, bringing them into your life and surrounding and see what you have as a skill.

1747
03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The same as me. What do you and I have we both have this quality when we both have

1748
03:16:38.400 --> 03:16:38.700

Gwenevere Abriel: Now you don't need it outside in me. You can bring it yourself. You can care about you. And guess what, it becomes

1753
03:17:01.050 --> 03:17:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Confident and then it becomes safe.

1754
03:17:05.640 --> 03:17:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Caring is really important. You've got to care about yourself and then safety. Why then, there it is.

1755
03:17:17.370 --> 03:17:21.540

Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of this installing of the of the FDR part. Let me just see if you have because I'm assuming you're on your phone right now. Right.

1759
03:17:52.410 --> 03:17:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you happen to have to kind of tall objects about a foot and a half apart next year. Yep. Uh huh.

1760
03:17:59.940 --> 03:18:00.120
And

1761
03:18:01.170 --> 03:18:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your phone about, I would say maybe shoulder width apart, kind of put them next to your phone about shoulder a foot and a half, let's say,

1762
03:18:15.570 --> 03:18:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now let me see your those those water bottles are not like this. They're like this, right.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. So I'm gonna, I'm going to point to the different corners and you're going to look at the top of those objects.

1768
03:18:46.050 --> 03:18:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just looking for whether your eyes are straining. This would be straining where you have you know how you look all the way left and it pulls muscles. That's too far, all in looking for

1769
03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a nice back and forth.

1770
03:19:01.680 --> 03:19:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're getting a horizontal movement.

1771
03:19:04.680 --> 03:19:05.040
Okay.

1772
03:19:06.210 --> 03:19:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're in those objects are in front of you so that you're in the middle, right. You're dead right in front of them. Is that right,

1773
03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:13.860
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, because I

1774
03:19:14.670 --> 03:19:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, cuz I can see that one water bottle.

1775
03:19:17.550 --> 03:19:26.400
Nicole Roybal: I know it's trying to frickin it says my I haven't also have like on a pillow inside of like my makeup bag and like whole setup.

1776
03:19:27.750 --> 03:19:29.760
Nicole Roybal: I'm trying to get the phone down upon these pillars.

1777
03:19:30.930 --> 03:19:31.470
Nicole Roybal: I think I got

1778
03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Goal is

1779
03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: For for the eyes to be moving left and right. So what I don't want is what the eye stays center and then only goes left. I don't want center love centered left. What I want is all the way I want. Right, left, right, okay.

1780
03:19:47.970 --> 03:19:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me, let me just see you looking left and right. So just kind of follow the direction of I'm pointing out

1781
03:19:56.790 --> 03:20:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You can kind of see my hands out of the corner of your eye, you don't have to actually look at me.

1782
03:20:01.410 --> 03:20:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, scoot back just a little bit.

1783
03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:06.180
Nicole Roybal: Just a couple days on details to it wasn't sure.

1784
03:20:07.980 --> 03:20:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see if you're sitting there. So now let me just kind of look at the different corners. Yeah. You don't need to look at me.

1785
03:20:18.270 --> 03:20:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they the same level.

1786
03:20:21.630 --> 03:20:25.680
Nicole Roybal: Some such iconic over and tell you this. I'm just not understand it because it's too full.

1787
03:20:44.490 --> 03:20:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's not a desk, you don't have a chair to stick that thing on or something.

1788
03:20:50.250 --> 03:20:54.420
Nicole Roybal: No, not randomly. Okay. Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay.

1789
03:20:54.720 --> 03:20:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so now let's see. Let's see if you're looking left and right here.

1790
03:21:04.500 --> 03:21:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, I think that can work.

1791
03:21:09.570 --> 03:21:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this.

1792
03:21:11.430 --> 03:21:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm going to be doing today is I'm going to be asking you to pull up a memory. It'll be pulling up one that's kind of unpleasant and part of this is is

1793
03:21:24.780 --> 03:21:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There's different different things will be doing. One of them is desensitisation around a negative belief about yourself. Another one is installing some positive beliefs about yourself and some positive imagery

1794
03:21:38.640 --> 03:21:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And

1795
03:21:40.470 --> 03:21:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: In general,

1796
03:21:41.580 --> 03:21:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you spend more time thinking about the past.

1797
03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative events or are you kind of as you're worried about the future.

1798
03:21:51.750 --> 03:21:52.410
Nicole Roybal: The future.

1799
03:21:53.400 --> 03:21:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Be all alone. Is that the one

1800
03:21:56.280 --> 03:22:07.470
Nicole Roybal: I'm just cuz I'm not really at a good place in my life. Right. We're working. I don't know where I want to work with. I wanted my life. And so I always guess. Okay, no idea where I wanted to

1801
03:22:08.130 --> 03:22:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, all right, I think we're getting somewhere. So it's a lot about the future.

1802
03:22:12.660 --> 03:22:13.140
Nicole Roybal: And

1803
03:22:13.350 --> 03:22:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe the President, let me just check one more time.

1804
03:22:16.650 --> 03:22:19.920
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I guess. Well, they're both. Yeah, yeah.

1805
03:22:20.370 --> 03:22:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what tends to trigger the thought, Oh my gosh, I, I realized, again, I don't know what I want to do. Where am I going to go, what do I like what do I want to do, is there something that happens that triggers that

1806
03:22:36.510 --> 03:22:38.820
Nicole Roybal: No, not really. Just

1807
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:47.250
Nicole Roybal: Maybe being here. My parents might trigger that is like being back here parents house. Yeah.

1808
03:22:48.450 --> 03:22:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, so

1809
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:56.790
Nicole Roybal: I haven't been to it so early. I'm very much, you know,

1810
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier you getting old early, are you

1811
03:23:00.690 --> 03:23:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. I gotta see was talking

1812
03:23:03.810 --> 03:23:05.670
Nicole Roybal: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I keep interrupting you.

1813
03:23:20.280 --> 03:23:20.730
Nicole Roybal: Sorry.

1814
03:23:25.980 --> 03:23:26.160
Nicole Roybal: Yes.

1815
03:23:27.390 --> 03:23:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Mentioned once that staying at mom's house, resulting in a level of distress. At about 65 like from zero being like, I'm fine. I'm gonna relax. But everything's okay and 100 is the worst thing that's

1816
03:23:43.350 --> 03:23:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever happened okay but 65 like it brings up a distress of 65. Is that still feeling true right now.

1817
03:23:53.940 --> 03:23:55.920
Nicole Roybal: It's not as bad. Honestly, like it.

1818
03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:08.640
Nicole Roybal: In the past, and I've had to stay here. It was a lot worse. But I started by on purpose. I think I never realized side. So recently I started right on purpose. That way they kicked me out that Daniel would have to cook.

1819
03:24:10.830 --> 03:24:18.390
Nicole Roybal: Them. So I'm not doing that. This time, obviously. And so that actually incident, very few leads and I honestly

1820
03:24:20.280 --> 03:24:32.400
Nicole Roybal: My little brother always fight and then like my my jag on Friday morning with a shower and, like, just like little things like that. So, like, that's where the stress comes from is just like it's their house and I'm kinda like I'm innovating don't belong here.

1821
03:24:32.700 --> 03:24:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: From zero to 100 how to

1822
03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:49.980
Nicole Roybal: Struggle. I feel like it's not as bad as it was, but still like it 660 55 okay still up there. It's just, I'm sorry, I don't know why I have to tell a little story about it. It's just, okay, sorry.

1823
03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: 65 I don't belong here.

1824
03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

1825
03:24:57.240 --> 03:25:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what are the thoughts that are the most distressing to get triggered pretty recently, but really get you quite upset. What are the thoughts.

1826
03:25:14.340 --> 03:25:17.550
Nicole Roybal: Well, Daniel, of course, pretty much anything that's him.

1827
03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a subject.

1828
03:25:19.770 --> 03:25:20.850
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, okay.

1829
03:25:28.140 --> 03:25:28.710
Nicole Roybal: Um,

1830
03:25:30.990 --> 03:25:41.820
Nicole Roybal: I guess being alone being without him. I'm having a fight and someone else when everyone out there. My age as kids are on drugs or

1831
03:25:45.570 --> 03:25:47.130
Nicole Roybal: Dating. Again, I guess.

1832
03:25:47.550 --> 03:25:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold that right. Hold on.

1833
03:25:51.210 --> 03:25:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm alone.

1834
03:25:54.030 --> 03:25:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the negative thought I'm alone.

1835
03:25:57.900 --> 03:26:04.800
Nicole Roybal: Being alone. I'm not alone, but just being alone, like, because I have people around me, but I just, I feel

1836
03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel alone. Got it.

1837
03:26:08.850 --> 03:26:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And how does stressed. Are you right now as you feel that I feel alone people around me, but I feel alone.

1842
03:26:29.190 --> 03:26:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel alone to over exaggerate. So that's I'm saying, I'm not sure.

1843
03:26:33.570 --> 03:26:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you're fine. Just tell me. It can always change feelings change.

1844
03:26:39.930 --> 03:26:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's intense right now and you're you're crying a little bit right you're feeling it. And what's the emotion, you're feeling

1845
03:26:51.660 --> 03:26:54.000
Nicole Roybal: We honestly four weeks.

1846
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a statement that's like a judgment about yourself. So why don't you

1847
03:26:59.910 --> 03:27:00.690
Since you went there.

1848
03:27:03.930 --> 03:27:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the emotion to sad. But let's go back to this this thing. You just did finish the sentence, I am

1849
03:27:15.690 --> 03:27:16.770
Nicole Roybal: I am

1850
03:27:22.860 --> 03:27:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I am better than this. A positive thought or a negative thought

1851
03:27:30.390 --> 03:27:32.310
Nicole Roybal: Like, it's a little bit of both. Honestly,

1852
03:27:33.420 --> 03:27:38.490
Nicole Roybal: It's just like, it's like I'm better than this, then it's because I'm thinking, bam solo

1853
03:27:41.070 --> 03:27:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me about week to tell me what what belief you have about yourself without word. I think there might be something there.

1854
03:27:53.850 --> 03:27:54.780
Nicole Roybal: Is because

1855
03:27:56.670 --> 03:28:05.550
Nicole Roybal: I feel like I'm weak because I should be in a better place in my life. At this point, I'm already going to be my 30s and I just

1856
03:28:06.780 --> 03:28:11.760
Nicole Roybal: I am nowhere anywhere close to being where I should be I should be

1857
03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:20.520
Nicole Roybal: Already with a good job and figured out what I want to do with my life and I have no idea. And that really, really, really gets me. Okay.

1858
03:28:21.540 --> 03:28:21.840
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1859
03:28:22.050 --> 03:28:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: We got it then. And it's a very current event.

1860
03:28:25.620 --> 03:28:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Its current assessment and judgment is something I think it's very present

1861
03:28:32.430 --> 03:28:33.000
Yeah.

1862
03:28:34.650 --> 03:28:41.910
Nicole Roybal: My dad taught me all day every game to get a job. You need to figure out, you're doing, you need to get a job. He's always like pushing it into it freakin brain.

1863
03:28:43.710 --> 03:28:44.190
That's what

1864
03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what it used to do.

1865
03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:48.690
Nicole Roybal: So my dad does now.

1866
03:28:48.930 --> 03:28:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it. Okay, you should get a job.

1867
03:28:51.300 --> 03:29:04.410
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, it's like fishing in mind and like I know I do. But like I could tell you I'm not in the right state of mind. Yeah, my therapist Celtic I like you like slowly work into that. Like it doesn't matter. You need to get a job and get mine.

1868
03:29:05.610 --> 03:29:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold. Stay right there. Stay right there.

1869
03:29:10.020 --> 03:29:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can find

1870
03:29:12.270 --> 03:29:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Find the space of

1871
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I should be in a better place.

1872
03:29:19.890 --> 03:29:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I should be

1873
03:29:23.520 --> 03:29:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm assuming, with a good and a good relationship, whatever those shifts are you have a whole list of shins.

1874
03:29:31.080 --> 03:29:32.460
Yeah, right.

1875
03:29:34.140 --> 03:29:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And the predominant belief about yourself is what I am.

1876
03:29:41.790 --> 03:29:42.090
Nicole Roybal: Well,

1877
03:29:43.980 --> 03:29:45.960
Nicole Roybal: I had said better than this, but

1878
03:29:49.470 --> 03:29:51.210
Nicole Roybal: I feel like I'm just being

1879
03:29:52.800 --> 03:29:54.120
Nicole Roybal: Like I am as a whole.

1880
03:29:56.040 --> 03:29:57.030
Nicole Roybal: Just you're asking

1881
03:29:57.420 --> 03:30:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it. Let's go at it like this. I want you to picture that it's your dad.

1882
03:30:04.080 --> 03:30:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture that it's your dad saying you should be

1883
03:30:09.570 --> 03:30:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: In a home with kids in a better relationship in a good job. I want you to picture that it's not coming from you. I want you to picture your dad's doing it.

1884
03:30:18.720 --> 03:30:19.170
Okay.

1885
03:30:20.610 --> 03:30:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens to your belief about yourself. Then when you picture him doing it. You're not doing it to yourself, but it's coming from outside someone else's saying that about you into you.

1886
03:30:34.170 --> 03:30:36.960
Nicole Roybal: Do you believe about you. I feel like crap like this.

1887
03:30:39.930 --> 03:30:40.980
I feel small.

1888
03:30:44.190 --> 03:30:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I am nothing

1889
03:30:48.390 --> 03:30:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you want to think about yourself. When someone shares their own value onions. Okay, go slow.

1890
03:31:00.450 --> 03:31:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I am nothing is the is the negative thought, okay, we just found it.

1891
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If that negative feedback, right, that criticism and judgment is coming out, you

1892
03:31:17.040 --> 03:31:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to know what's the ideal belief, you'd like to have about yourself.

1893
03:31:25.080 --> 03:31:26.940
Nicole Roybal: When people are time you stuff like that.

1894
03:31:27.090 --> 03:31:27.810
Haha

1895
03:31:33.090 --> 03:31:35.730
Nicole Roybal: Well, I think they need a my own business.

1896
03:31:36.090 --> 03:31:36.570

03:31:39.390 --> 03:31:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. I'm with you keep

1898
03:31:42.990 --> 03:32:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Us and Nicole, they're not, they're crossing over getting in your business. So now come back to you. Again, I want to know when they're not minding their own business and getting up in your face telling you how to live your life. I want to know what you want to believe about yourself.

03:32:21.720 --> 03:32:24.960
Nicole Roybal: Borrowing money to pay my bills. I won't be able to do it all by myself. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you there. So we're going to do a little bit of this.

1924
03:34:10.560 --> 03:34:11.700
Nicole Roybal: I don't know why I do that.

1925
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get distracted. Stay here.

1926
03:34:16.650 --> 03:34:17.610

03:37:18.210 --> 03:37:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So, open your eyes. And you can look at those. The top of the objects.

1963
03:37:40.170 --> 03:37:42.900
Nicole Roybal: Again, there's a laggard behind to

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's going to need to change.

1965

Gwenevere Abriel: An inch might help just sort of straighten your posture just even inch

1966
03:37:59.640 --> 03:38:00.120
Okay.

1975
03:38:41.760 --> 03:38:44.370

1976
03:38:45.810 --> 03:39:00.660
Nicole Roybal: Being able to have money to raise a family and I can share that they're able to live a good life. They want to be in sports, it could be in sports. I have the money for it. You know, like, stuff like that, since I was never able to be traveling to say

03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

2074
03:49:17.610 --> 03:49:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To begin,

2075
03:49:20.430 --> 03:49:27.330
iPhone: And I know I'm not supposed to have my head on, but my heaters broken in my house. Oh, it doesn't matter.

2076
03:49:27.780 --> 03:49:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine.

2077
03:49:29.640 --> 03:49:32.910
iPhone: And I'm sorry, I'm having a lot of anxiety right now so

2078
03:49:34.980 --> 03:49:36.900
iPhone: Almost skipped it just

2079
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What, like what what's running through your head. What are those thoughts.

2080
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:50.910
iPhone: I don't know, it's just like just anxiety. Like when I woke up, I mean, it's obviously because I relapse. I mean, I just

2081
03:49:52.380 --> 03:49:59.220
iPhone: But I barely got back on the Suboxone yesterday at lunchtime. So, my body's still feeling pretty

2082
03:49:59.670 --> 03:50:10.230
iPhone: pretty crappy. Yeah, so I'm just having that I just had once that gets back to my system and I, you know, I'd start doing what I'm used to do any again, I'll be fine. That's just

2083
03:50:11.760 --> 03:50:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, sometimes we push through some discomfort and I think you're worth it. So let's let's keep pushing through. Okay. Now, is there anything where there's a concern in her personally like you think I'm going to be like lecturing you or something. Is there any doubt in here.

2084
03:50:28.860 --> 03:50:38.790
iPhone: Nice, just like I don't even know what things. It was about. It was just, I had anxiety, just right. Like I woke up at 6am with anxiety and

2085
03:50:39.810 --> 03:50:48.780
iPhone: Took my first starts. Usually when I used to take a trip. So I took it and I felt better and fell back to sleep at nine. And then I got up at 9am was just having bad anxiety.

2086
03:50:49.680 --> 03:51:02.010
iPhone: And it was it's been like that pretty much since I stopped using but I mean it's expected. It happens every time it just takes time for the Suboxone to start working again. I know it'll come

2087
03:51:02.400 --> 03:51:10.020
iPhone: Uh huh. I mean, I know and I'm, I mean, I messed it up. It's just, I do have questions for you though.

2088
03:51:10.650 --> 03:51:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go for it.

2089
03:51:13.410 --> 03:51:17.310
iPhone: And I guess like I could start by just telling you what happened so on.

2090
03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:29.160
iPhone: All of last week I had the flu and strep throat and so I ended up missing group on Friday and so on Sunday.

2091
03:51:31.380 --> 03:51:42.840
iPhone: I was feeling good again and I was ready to go back to work. I was about to get in that on the highway and the thought just came across my head that I would be able to buy one pill and

2092
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:46.830
iPhone: Take it that night and be fine and not

2093
03:51:47.970 --> 03:52:04.140
iPhone: Do it again. I remember feeling and believing that like with all my heart that I can take one that night and make it to work the next day, because it was the Super Bowl. I was. That was it. I was going to watch the Super Bowl and take a pain pill and so I took it.

2094
03:52:05.310 --> 03:52:21.510
iPhone: woke up the next morning and that we ended up that it was snowed like half a foot here so we didn't work all week. And so my head just kept telling me okay well I can take it again tomorrow. I can take it today too because I don't have to work and then on

2095
03:52:25.050 --> 03:52:39.960
iPhone: Wednesday I told my mom Wednesday morning is when I had the last pill Wednesday 8:30am so I that night I ended up going to the emergency room and they admitted me and they kept me till noon yesterday.

2096
03:52:40.620 --> 03:52:41.010
iPhone: And

2097
03:52:41.400 --> 03:52:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna what diagnosis. Do they have no

2098
03:52:44.280 --> 03:52:52.410
iPhone: I, I went I went into the hospital, basically, and just told them hey look, I've been on Suboxone for almost a year I relapsed

2099
03:52:53.100 --> 03:53:03.750
iPhone: I my last pill. I had was this morning and I don't really know what else to do it other than to come here because I was hurting so bad, like the withdrawals. I wanted to just get through the night.

2100
03:53:04.230 --> 03:53:13.920
iPhone: So I could take my Suboxone instead of taking other pain pill, you know, because that's what I would have resulted to instead I was. I didn't want to be on them anymore and

2101
03:53:15.330 --> 03:53:27.420
iPhone: So I went and just told the doctor that and the doctor basically told me he was like okay well you have three options. I can shoot you up with morphine right now and you have to go through all of this again tomorrow, or I can keep you here.

2102
03:53:28.080 --> 03:53:37.140
iPhone: And we will give you out of and through the night, just to keep you kind of comfortable and asleep so you can get to that mark where you can take your sandbox and and that's what they did.

2103
03:53:38.340 --> 03:53:46.770
iPhone: So, but he was actually the new er director and he's a he was the Suboxone doctor so he kind of I got lucky that

2104
03:53:46.830 --> 03:53:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You got so lucky. I don't even know how to tell you I was I. My mouth is like

2105
03:53:51.270 --> 03:53:58.110
iPhone: Because most er doctors have no clue. And every time I've gone in before they don't know what Suboxone is or they don't know

2106
03:53:59.130 --> 03:54:03.090
iPhone: Yeah, so, but it was rough and but my question is, I don't

2107
03:54:05.580 --> 03:54:07.020
iPhone: I don't understand why.

2108
03:54:08.700 --> 03:54:20.790
iPhone: I get that thought, you know, whenever things start going so good. It's not when things are bad. It's when things are really good. I truly believe I can get that one night, have fun and or something and

2109
03:54:22.350 --> 03:54:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's going to be at the heart of our work together. This you you're, you, you, you, you identified a key trigger right and this is going to going to feed what we focus on. So some good thing happened here. Okay.

2110
03:54:39.420 --> 03:54:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to really find out what's going on with that that intolerance for fun, happy just being

2111
03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:51.630
Here, just chill.

2112
03:54:53.820 --> 03:54:54.930
You want this.

2113
03:54:56.370 --> 03:54:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't just be here.

2114
03:55:01.170 --> 03:55:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to spend time doing that I have. I'm just a little bit of a question. I'm trying to walk this through them and just see something

2115
03:55:14.280 --> 03:55:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I Sunday, I felt good and Super Bowl was Which Day Is that Sunday.

2116
03:55:20.820 --> 03:55:21.840
iPhone: Yes, Sunday night.

2117
03:55:24.630 --> 03:55:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you stop taking Suboxone

2118
03:55:28.050 --> 03:55:32.550
iPhone: I took one I took one Sunday morning. I didn't take it at lunch.

2119
03:55:33.960 --> 03:55:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you stopped stopped lunch on Sunday. Yes.

2120
03:55:38.520 --> 03:55:48.210
iPhone: Well, the last one I took was Monday morning or Sunday morning. I mean, I didn't take the one at lunch on on Monday on Sunday. I mean, I got it.

2121
03:55:48.270 --> 03:55:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it right now.

2122
03:55:52.020 --> 03:55:56.790
iPhone: And I took the pain pill about 830 that night about 14 hours later.

2123
03:56:01.410 --> 03:56:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Who would who were you planning on spending the Super Bowl with

2124
03:56:05.190 --> 03:56:13.650
iPhone: I was by myself at home. I mean, I was literally just that's what the crazy thing to me was looking back was my brain told me that I was just gonna

2125
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:25.350
iPhone: Be able to enjoy this one night and then it was gonna make me enjoy it better and my body or, I don't know, like that's what blows my mind is why I decided that it would be okay or that

2126
03:56:26.670 --> 03:56:37.650
iPhone: Why, I thought I would be able to just do one because I know for a fact every other time of the day, or if you'd asked me the day before I would have told you, hell no, I can't take one.

2127
03:56:39.180 --> 03:56:40.590
iPhone: Never stopped, but

2128
03:56:41.370 --> 03:56:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's focus on the

2129
03:56:44.340 --> 03:56:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Back a little bit

2130
03:56:46.620 --> 03:56:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

2131
03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You. This is not your first relapse. How many of them have been around.

2132
03:56:58.050 --> 03:57:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you you had a slip or relapse.

2133
03:57:03.360 --> 03:57:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were about to be alone. How many of them were like that.

2134
03:57:11.940 --> 03:57:19.380
iPhone: I don't think any of them. I mean like I was, I mean my grandma was here, like I was around family still

2135
03:57:19.560 --> 03:57:35.310
iPhone: But oh my god was my grandma was here, she lives with me, but I was just at home alone, but like I wasn't, it wasn't none of them were based off of me being alone, though I was always going to be around somebody to okay

2136
03:57:37.830 --> 03:57:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And so going back in in history.

2137
03:57:43.080 --> 03:57:50.070
iPhone: Well, I guess the last relapse and sep tember it was I was alone, and I was whenever I was on bed rest.

2138
03:57:51.900 --> 03:57:52.440
Okay.

2139
03:57:54.210 --> 03:57:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So I heard something else. I heard I had all week off from work.

2140
03:58:01.440 --> 03:58:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what you've taught me in the past is your, your, sort of go to coping skill is or

2141
03:58:09.180 --> 03:58:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

2142
03:58:11.700 --> 03:58:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The I had no idea that was going on. You didn't tell me

2143
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:16.740
iPhone: So this thing.

2144
03:58:16.980 --> 03:58:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That you identify I may not agree, but you do is this distraction has really helped you stay focused distraction, most people I get your mind out of that network with all of those links to substance use.

2145
03:58:32.730 --> 03:58:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't. You didn't say, Holy shit.

2146
03:58:38.280 --> 03:58:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have the one thing that keeps me sober.

2147
03:58:42.420 --> 03:58:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The red flags could have been going off, you could have been, like, Oh my gosh, and you could have gone to your list of things and really acknowledged in real time. This is no joke. I have to get busy.

2148
03:58:56.190 --> 03:58:59.340
iPhone: That's what, that's what the thing I'm telling you is like

2149
03:59:00.780 --> 03:59:09.060
iPhone: It feels like any other time of my life before that one moment when that thought came into my head. That's how I was thinking, but

2150
03:59:09.480 --> 03:59:19.830
iPhone: Because I didn't work. The whole week before either because I had strep throat in the flu. But I was fine. I was. I didn't have any desire of using and then it's literally once that

2151
03:59:21.000 --> 03:59:34.140
iPhone: I don't know what set that thought off in my head. Oh no, I do. Someone had just texted me and said they were just, they were just like, Hey, I have these and I had done a good job of blocking at all. The past ones up

2152
03:59:34.860 --> 03:59:37.230
iPhone: My phone numbers, whatever. Well, someone had

2153
03:59:37.260 --> 03:59:44.430
iPhone: just text me and said, Hey, I got some of these 30 milligram pills. What the what I was taking, but it was somebody that

2154
03:59:45.000 --> 03:59:56.550
iPhone: Normally would never send me something like that. So I didn't have their number blocked and that's what got the thought started in my head was maybe I can just take one and

2155
03:59:57.630 --> 04:00:02.220
iPhone: I don't know. I decided to do it, there's no excuse. I mean, I, I did it.

2156
04:00:04.890 --> 04:00:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: See I'm

2157
04:00:05.730 --> 04:00:07.560
iPhone: Terrible about it now but I

2158
04:00:08.580 --> 04:00:11.670
iPhone: Damn, I don't understand myself even

2159
04:00:12.000 --> 04:00:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We're spending time investigating this is a very complex dis ease. This is not simple. Okay, this is complex. So just don't have to rush to it. Let's take our time.

2160
04:00:28.020 --> 04:00:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

2161
04:00:34.770 --> 04:00:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You told me earlier that you

2162
04:00:38.970 --> 04:00:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You said I don't have a lot of experience and just being fine and enjoying things on a sort of low level, I have to dial it up.

2163
04:00:53.550 --> 04:01:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back in time. I want to hear the earliest recollection of where you were intolerance, where it was not okay for you to be just having a good time. But it wasn't okay you had to amp it up, go back

2164
04:01:09.300 --> 04:01:14.580
iPhone: I've said this in meetings before, as far as I can remember, I've been restless irritable and discontented

2165
04:01:16.380 --> 04:01:28.950
iPhone: I mean, like, since I was a baby. I remember feeling that feeling of but back then. I thought it was like I needed a new toy or I needed a new this but I was always never content. I feel like I was born this way.

2166
04:01:32.160 --> 04:01:34.380
iPhone: But I remember feeling that my entire life.

2167
04:01:36.990 --> 04:01:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's powerful and i and i and i and i can hear by how easily you're able to put words to it. But that's a very different thing, then the body, maybe have have had gotten a hold of you just being you.

2168
04:01:56.130 --> 04:02:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: In this sort of low low level, you know, calm, we're just in a relaxed body and everything's fine. But I don't know is where in your storyline.

2169
04:02:09.300 --> 04:02:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a threat response to that.

2170
04:02:12.480 --> 04:02:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just wonder how just play with me on this one. Just go. Go back and I know you have the memorized little phrase, and I get that it's convenient. It'll get us somewhere, but go a little deeper, go to see if you can catch an image of yourself just hanging out.

2171
04:02:31.050 --> 04:02:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just doing you

2172
04:02:34.860 --> 04:02:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And if something negative happened.

2173
04:02:38.370 --> 04:02:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it wasn't okay that you could just do you

2174
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: wasn't enough wasn't okay

2175
04:02:47.640 --> 04:02:55.770
iPhone: I don't know, I feel like always, if I was alone as far back as I can remember. I was always wanting to be with someone else or doing something

2176
04:02:56.610 --> 04:03:05.070
iPhone: If I was at home. Whenever I was a kid by myself I was miserable. I was feeling like I was being left out, and I should have been with my friends or

2177
04:03:06.360 --> 04:03:23.280
iPhone: As far back as I can remember. The only time I remember being able to just sit and be content would be like after I wrote my dirt bike for the day and came home and then I could just sit there. But other than that, I didn't have times where I could just sit there like that and be alone.

2178
04:03:24.600 --> 04:03:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me just check in, could you picture yourself at age seven

2179
04:03:29.310 --> 04:03:29.730
iPhone: Yeah.

2180
04:03:30.960 --> 04:03:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you see right around that age. That's like what third grade or something.

2181
04:03:38.820 --> 04:03:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you see where you're like, oh, restless was an image that

2182
04:03:43.290 --> 04:03:52.950
iPhone: I just been in my room. I gotta remember this one specific time where I even stole the phone and went out to the backyard and called My grandma was like hey can you take me

2183
04:03:53.670 --> 04:04:08.580
iPhone: To castle and and to play pub. But, but it's just this place here that we have, but because my mom wouldn't. It was like a Sunday afternoon and I was just sitting at home. I remember. And I felt like all my friends were out doing stuff and I wanted to be gone and doing stuff with them and

2184
04:04:11.190 --> 04:04:14.730
iPhone: I don't know, literally, as far as I can remember. I felt like that.

2185
04:04:16.440 --> 04:04:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I hear you.

2186
04:04:17.730 --> 04:04:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep going. Go back to

2187
04:04:20.130 --> 04:04:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A little younger set

2188
04:04:25.230 --> 04:04:30.120
iPhone: I mean I seriously as far back as I can remember, I've never been. I'm trying to get

2189
04:04:30.840 --> 04:04:31.470
iPhone: In there with me.

2190
04:04:33.840 --> 04:04:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Back.

2191
04:04:35.160 --> 04:04:39.030
iPhone: I even remember preschool, like I was always feeling like I

2192
04:04:40.770 --> 04:04:51.720
iPhone: Like for example, like I had a cousin that went to preschool with man like I always felt like his aunt would take him to go or his mom. My aunt would have to always take him to go do

2193
04:04:52.650 --> 04:05:05.940
iPhone: Like out to eat or get McDonald's on the way home, and my mom would just take me straight home to eat dinner that she would cook and like would make me mad if I didn't go with my aunt, because I wanted to go out, have fun and play with my cousins instead of go home.

2194
04:05:07.200 --> 04:05:11.970
iPhone: I mean, that's what I'm saying. I don't ever remember a time where I was content.

2195
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:23.580
iPhone: Except this last I mean the only time I can remember is whenever I'm doing good on Suboxone like am working, that's the only time I feel normal.

2196
04:05:25.170 --> 04:05:26.910
iPhone: That's the only time I've ever felt normal

2197
04:05:34.290 --> 04:05:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And when your

2198
04:05:37.500 --> 04:05:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Mother, let's say, let's take her when she describes you. How does she described you really early age as a little guy.

2199
04:05:47.940 --> 04:05:56.430
iPhone: I don't know going. Honestly, I have to ask her. I didn't know she'd say, rowdy, though, for sure, that'd be one of the words, but I don't

2200
04:05:58.530 --> 04:06:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you ask them some time to say, Hey, um, do you remember any age where

2201
04:06:06.900 --> 04:06:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I was sort of comfortable in my own skin. I could kind of play alone, and I could just kind of entertain myself.

2202
04:06:17.130 --> 04:06:28.350
iPhone: Oh, she'll tell you know we were talking about this the other day with my my cousins that were in town, she'll tell you that I won't, but I never was. But I was always the one running around trying to do something.

2203
04:06:31.350 --> 04:06:35.250
iPhone: And my little brother's the exact opposite of me. That's why it always gets brought up.

2204
04:06:37.350 --> 04:06:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now who's in the house now.

2205
04:06:40.620 --> 04:06:42.570
iPhone: Nobody just me and my dog.

2206
04:06:44.460 --> 04:06:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you know it was going to be like that today.

2207
04:06:47.520 --> 04:06:48.060
Yes.

2208
04:06:49.290 --> 04:06:54.180
iPhone: Well, I knew my grandma was gonna be working from nine to 12

2209
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you woke up anxious this morning. Yeah.

2210
04:06:57.960 --> 04:06:58.410
Very

2211
04:06:59.580 --> 04:07:00.570
iPhone: At six o'clock.

2212
04:07:03.870 --> 04:07:08.850
iPhone: And then I took a strip and went back to sleep and woke up anxious again and I know

2213
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:23.310
iPhone: That's the thing about every time I've gotten back on the well this is only the second time of me relapse in and it being on fentanyl every other time it's been hydrocodone or oxycodone or something in

2214
04:07:24.780 --> 04:07:40.140
iPhone: The fentanyl is a lot worse on my body. So, but every morning for about a week after I get back on the Suboxone that'll happen to me, I'll feel like that and then I'll kind of just get back into the groove of things, I guess.

2215
04:07:44.490 --> 04:07:53.040
iPhone: I just don't know what like because even right now. I could swear up and down. I'll never touch a pill. Again, I'll never go through that pain. I had to go through two days ago again.

2216
04:07:54.150 --> 04:08:02.670
iPhone: But that's what I said. The last time, too. And that thought. I just wanted or if there's even a way to keep that thought from creeping in. I don't know.

2217
04:08:03.900 --> 04:08:06.750
iPhone: That's what scares me because it's happened to me so many times.

2218
04:08:07.980 --> 04:08:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So the brain just for just a little while.

2219
04:08:12.960 --> 04:08:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So, the brain has lots of neural connections to the reward that it got

2220
04:08:20.760 --> 04:08:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may be connected at the substance use history that's connected, probably to having fun, it's got lots of memory to it. Lots of connections. Let's the images, having fun.

2221
04:08:34.890 --> 04:08:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You started to feel good after the flu.

2222
04:08:39.930 --> 04:08:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That might have been all it took you are in this network.

2223
04:08:44.250 --> 04:08:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot feeling good is good. In fact, feeling good. In fact, I could feel good. In fact, there's this here, this little text just came through. I could feel good. I can keep having this feeling good. You were in network you already over there. You didn't have work to distract you.

2224
04:09:00.810 --> 04:09:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't have to be some big complicated thing you just kept staying and you were staying curious and that you kept on that side of the brain where let's say it's over here. Here's the network huge lots of connections in history to it.

2225
04:09:14.100 --> 04:09:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, didn't have the convenience of distraction with work.

2226
04:09:21.810 --> 04:09:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What was in place.

2227
04:09:24.420 --> 04:09:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a habituation

2228
04:09:26.160 --> 04:09:27.030
iPhone: And routing.

2229
04:09:27.330 --> 04:09:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going boxing I'm making something up.

2230
04:09:32.250 --> 04:09:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have been focused on learning a new technique would have been focused on the experiential exercises of movement.

2231
04:09:42.570 --> 04:09:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You or you volunteered somewhere, whatever this other neural network, you would have been

2232
04:09:52.530 --> 04:09:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever.

2233
04:09:53.940 --> 04:10:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You are monitoring, you are modifying you literally created another connection over there in that negative network.

2234
04:10:03.540 --> 04:10:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You did more of it. You want to know why you spent time with it. You could have done, and you've been here on this for years gone and done right the next right thing but you didn't use minutes or seconds entertaining this and the

2235
04:10:20.340 --> 04:10:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Connected to adult consonant said this is going to be

2236
04:10:26.100 --> 04:10:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember all the great

2237
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:29.310
iPhone: Doesn't when I thought that to it.

2238
04:10:29.310 --> 04:10:39.540
iPhone: I swear I there was no like back thinking of consequences or nothing. There was no thinking of how the withdrawal is going to feel or the anything this

2239
04:10:41.940 --> 04:10:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here, this is all so Super Bowl.

2240
04:10:46.770 --> 04:10:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be grateful feeling great. Great. Well, good.

2241
04:10:50.400 --> 04:10:50.550
iPhone: And

2242
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This anticipation

2243
04:10:53.910 --> 04:10:55.110
iPhone: feel so good.

2244
04:10:55.620 --> 04:10:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Your old up of interpretation. Awesome.

2245
04:10:58.350 --> 04:10:59.760
iPhone: See in that looks like.

2246
04:11:00.720 --> 04:11:01.560
iPhone: You're just going to pull up

2247
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:02.160
Your

2248
04:11:03.180 --> 04:11:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Motion for getting it done.

2249
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That is why it is so crucial which not only have a list of things to do. You've got to have this these relapse prevention behaviors. And that's, and I've been telling you, I'm very subtle and not a bossy kind of person, but I'm like, it's just work. That's all you got, huh.

2250
04:11:26.040 --> 04:11:31.140
iPhone: Yeah, I know I've been trying to find I just haven't done a good job. I haven't prioritized

2251
04:11:31.170 --> 04:11:32.790
iPhone: Doing that, which I should have

2252
04:11:33.330 --> 04:11:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so it's that one, but it's also a hope you hear that this is the brain. Now it's set up.

2253
04:11:39.600 --> 04:11:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's wired so that you get those opening rewards. Now you've screwed it up with the drug use, but the mechanism.

2254
04:11:47.460 --> 04:12:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is still a good one. It wants you to have reward because it gets you to eat gets you to procreate. And it gets you to, you know, enjoy a sunset. It gets you. You know, you get a little dopamine hit when you feel really understood and loved and so we need it.

2255
04:12:04.500 --> 04:12:04.860
iPhone: Yeah.

2256
04:12:05.310 --> 04:12:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: This done with it. The drug. Okay, so you want to say, well, how did I do this. Yes.

2257
04:12:14.460 --> 04:12:16.770
iPhone: Sorry, let me the phone answering

2258
04:12:23.850 --> 04:12:24.240
iPhone: Sure.

2259
04:12:28.410 --> 04:12:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That you get from a drug is so seductive, you're going to get this huge rush

2260
04:12:36.450 --> 04:12:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming back once you got in there. You're like, this is going to be great. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be great can be great. It's gonna be so awesome. It's gonna be great. Oh my gosh, my so it's gonna be great.

2261
04:12:46.260 --> 04:12:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That you just over there on the wrong side of the brain. Okay.

2262
04:12:50.700 --> 04:13:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't. You can't say I'm a ship for it. You just gotta go. There are so many memories attached to. It's going to be fun. It doesn't have any of the negative ones. It just doesn't

2263
04:13:03.810 --> 04:13:05.430
iPhone: Know what, just me out is like

2264
04:13:05.880 --> 04:13:23.280
iPhone: Every single day and every four months before that, and even in this moment right now thinking about going and getting a pain pill and getting high tonight makes me have more anxiety. Like I would never even think of it in my wildest dreams, right now, which is why

2265
04:13:24.450 --> 04:13:36.330
iPhone: Whenever I told my mom that I relapsed, it was so hard for her to understand that what how, you know, like it was hard for me to put into words because I really didn't even understand, you know, yeah, and

2266
04:13:37.350 --> 04:13:40.080
iPhone: This is the first time that I've ever been able to

2267
04:13:41.610 --> 04:13:48.150
iPhone: Kind of correct myself the way I did and three days without going to jail or detox or rehab or

2268
04:13:49.170 --> 04:13:55.440
iPhone: And I told her I was like I'm trying my best. I just wanted to let you know, to be honest, because this is what you asked me to do.

2269
04:13:56.190 --> 04:14:10.650
iPhone: But I told her I was like, I'll talk with my therapist to try to figure it out. But I don't know on it. I kept telling her, I don't know. He had even an hour before I had that thought I could have told you that I'll never touch a pill again and truly believed it.

2270
04:14:11.730 --> 04:14:20.700
iPhone: And I don't think that's what blows my it blows my mind to. I don't. And I know that she thinks that's bullshit like that they think is

2271
04:14:21.090 --> 04:14:25.170
iPhone: Because whenever I'm in my right mind even on the Suboxone and I'm doing good.

2272
04:14:25.980 --> 04:14:40.260
iPhone: I, I look at you know like I was talking to you about Keegan, like, it can be so easy for you just to pull yourself out of it. But it's hard it's it's a lot harder. Whenever you're doing it and I could never put into words to someone that hasn't been through it.

2273
04:14:41.100 --> 04:14:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get behind the good stuff. The Good Stuff is you

2274
04:14:48.810 --> 04:15:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Told me told your mom, you could have given yourself more exits by lying to her you close some exits that's admirable

2275
04:15:02.430 --> 04:15:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you didn't lie.

2276
04:15:06.570 --> 04:15:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

2277
04:15:09.450 --> 04:15:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There might also be some pieces. I remember thinking when you first told me that she had the flu. I mean, when you think about how similar the

2278
04:15:18.450 --> 04:15:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Flu is kicking it

2279
04:15:21.060 --> 04:15:21.810
iPhone: Draws yeah

2280
04:15:22.590 --> 04:15:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what you feel good.

2281
04:15:24.780 --> 04:15:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's connected. I'm feeling good. Well, maybe I can keep this going. And so maybe some piece of that was going on.

2282
04:15:33.390 --> 04:15:34.200
iPhone: Well, that's

2283
04:15:36.240 --> 04:15:41.010
iPhone: Because last week when I had the flu. I told my mom. I feel like I'm withdrawing

2284
04:15:41.190 --> 04:15:46.140
iPhone: Uh huh. I told her that that's exactly what I told her. That's what I felt like

2285
04:15:46.770 --> 04:15:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And and the body may be registering that. And so then what do you do when you're feeling what you guys call I'm sick.

2286
04:15:56.580 --> 04:15:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And it just got stuck in there.

2287
04:15:59.850 --> 04:16:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's talk about something else.

2288
04:16:06.480 --> 04:16:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk about the difference right now between

2289
04:16:10.860 --> 04:16:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You just saying this is just a blip, it'll never happen again and that there's nothing that you need to do differently.

2290
04:16:20.430 --> 04:16:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could see this as a very serious thing just happened. You were on Suboxone

2291
04:16:28.860 --> 04:16:30.270
iPhone: That's how I do my

2292
04:16:30.300 --> 04:16:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: best of intentions and

2293
04:16:34.860 --> 04:16:36.210
iPhone: That's how I see it.

2294
04:16:36.390 --> 04:16:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do not ask something so this

2295
04:16:40.080 --> 04:16:40.650
iPhone: Is coming in.

2296
04:16:42.120 --> 04:16:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: At something

2297
04:16:45.690 --> 04:16:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This same thing may happen again.

2298
04:16:47.760 --> 04:16:48.690
iPhone: Can you imagine

2299
04:16:48.780 --> 04:16:49.560
iPhone: Every time you have

2300
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Like knowledge like anxiety like flats, or some piece of this that immediately feeling the go to guy.

2301
04:17:00.690 --> 04:17:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may all

2302
04:17:02.880 --> 04:17:03.360
Because it goes

2303
04:17:04.410 --> 04:17:05.100
iPhone: Consequence.

2304
04:17:06.540 --> 04:17:06.990
Over there.

2305
04:17:11.100 --> 04:17:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Other

2306
04:17:11.820 --> 04:17:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Chains sites work.

2307
04:17:14.940 --> 04:17:15.180
Your

2308
04:17:18.540 --> 04:17:19.080
iPhone: Question.

2309
04:17:19.320 --> 04:17:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let me do this.

2310
04:17:21.060 --> 04:17:21.390
All right.

2311
04:17:22.410 --> 04:17:25.620
iPhone: Fine. Go ahead. Go ahead. My mind's not all there still

2312
04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, okay, do it again later but

2313
04:17:32.130 --> 04:17:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't know how important this is. I turn you see that your way. The doing it your way ain't gonna work.

2314
04:17:40.890 --> 04:17:41.190
iPhone: It's

2315
04:17:42.090 --> 04:17:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Not gonna believe me. You're not gonna believe what I'm selling you won't buy what I'm selling

2316
04:17:50.130 --> 04:17:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You let me get. Let me get it out. This is huge.

2317
04:17:55.320 --> 04:17:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Liquid. It was connected to the flow.

2318
04:18:01.980 --> 04:18:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are spending time working out and going to the gym, you have all these friends all this don't mean reward network here.

2319
04:18:15.420 --> 04:18:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain may

2320
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Include going over there.

2321
04:18:21.540 --> 04:18:22.200
iPhone: Okay.

2322
04:18:23.190 --> 04:18:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I want this to grow. I wanted to be bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger keep listening, all these connections happen to reward.

2323
04:18:31.470 --> 04:18:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Experiences friends, family fun activities.

2324
04:18:39.900 --> 04:18:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: have now been connected to each other.

2325
04:18:46.380 --> 04:18:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This

2326
04:18:48.150 --> 04:18:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Other network, it starts

2327
04:19:07.560 --> 04:19:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If pieces of it they fall away.

2328
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:14.100
What we

2329
04:19:17.490 --> 04:19:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Are still fall away me all the things that I learned in school are gone. Don't revisit them anymore.

2330
04:19:23.610 --> 04:19:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But this stuff.

2331
04:19:25.860 --> 04:19:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to spend my time.

2332
04:19:30.540 --> 04:19:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And what did you have you had nobody around and you had no work.

2333
04:19:39.210 --> 04:19:51.210
iPhone: Yeah, that's why my question to you was because I've been texted before like but at different times of the week and people asked me the same thing. Hey, I have this, what do you want some

2334
04:19:51.870 --> 04:20:00.480
iPhone: But it beyond a Tuesday in my mind automatically think, oh, there's no way in hell. There's just no way because I know I have work, whatever, whatever, but

2335
04:20:01.020 --> 04:20:10.290
iPhone: I've even been tested on a Sunday, where I knew I had to work Monday and been thought. Nah. There's just no way I can do it.

2336
04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:17.400
iPhone: But this Sunday I, we were off the Monday after and we because they wanted to watch the Super Bowl. So I just

2337
04:20:18.360 --> 04:20:29.970
iPhone: Below i i remember truly believe in, in my head, I could just do it. And so that's, I didn't ever look at it as you're saying maybe my brain is connected back to that week before it.

2338
04:20:31.020 --> 04:20:38.190
iPhone: Or the it feeling good after the flu or I'm never thought about any of that. So,

2339
04:20:38.250 --> 04:20:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of us, when we think about our thoughts, we can't. We're not too.

2340
04:20:45.630 --> 04:20:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

2341
04:20:48.000 --> 04:20:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's literally

2342
04:20:50.490 --> 04:20:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: gushy saying this, right, my dream.

2343
04:21:00.840 --> 04:21:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna have to work hard getting habituated to other behaviors.

2344
04:21:08.730 --> 04:21:10.140
It's not a small thing.

2345
04:21:11.220 --> 04:21:11.460
iPhone: That we're

2346
04:21:11.490 --> 04:21:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about hobbies. It's not a small thing, but you're spending time with other people that are influencing

2347
04:21:20.670 --> 04:21:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: On they have no connection to drug use and that part of your brain needs development.

2348
04:21:30.450 --> 04:21:31.290
iPhone: Yeah. Does

2349
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Needs to fade away. And yes, what do I think, do I think you need to get a new phone number. Yeah. Do you need to drop that one all together, so nobody can text, you know, Mo.

2350
04:21:41.940 --> 04:21:44.520
iPhone: I changed it on Wednesday. That's why you

2351
04:21:44.880 --> 04:21:45.180
Do it.

2352
04:21:46.290 --> 04:21:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But you see that I couldn't have told you how important

2353
04:21:48.930 --> 04:21:49.110
iPhone: That

2354
04:21:49.500 --> 04:21:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't even like work it out. You still had exits.

2355
04:21:55.170 --> 04:21:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You are still

2356
04:22:00.390 --> 04:22:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Evaluating me, we found that on a real time.

2357
04:22:05.370 --> 04:22:12.210
iPhone: Well, I guess that's the thing about this time is, I still had ways to get pills and get high. This time, but I chose to stop.

2358
04:22:12.600 --> 04:22:20.010
iPhone: Before it's always been me having to get to that point of having no more exit. But having to tell my mom because I'm hurting

2359
04:22:20.640 --> 04:22:29.610
iPhone: And so I can get somewhere. This time I still had three pills in my pocket and was trying to go to the hospital, you know i just i whenever I told my mom that morning.

2360
04:22:30.300 --> 04:22:40.680
iPhone: I gave them to her and she threw him away and we told her that I promised I would go to the emergency room that night. I've never been able to do that before but I

2361
04:22:42.240 --> 04:22:43.020
iPhone: I still don't.

2362
04:22:45.810 --> 04:22:48.870
iPhone: It's just hard for my brain to wrap around that.

2363
04:22:51.330 --> 04:22:53.970
iPhone: I have to work on forever and ever and

2364
04:22:54.180 --> 04:23:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know. But what if it's just this simple entertained it a fraction of a second too long. Just keep it simple.

2365
04:23:04.530 --> 04:23:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You went there and with that fraction of a second too long.

2366
04:23:10.680 --> 04:23:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Deep Neural Network.

2367
04:23:14.190 --> 04:23:15.870

2379
04:24:26.610 --> 04:24:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's be realistic and you ain't got no work today watch you got no work. Now, fortunately, you had this today with me and I'm glad you're here. But that may have been enough, you know, to sort of say, Okay, I want to, you know, keep this accountability in place. I want to keep it there.

2380
04:24:45.660 --> 04:24:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But what else can you be doing. You got to get into your life. We got to build this other this other network of reward.

Gwenevere Abriel: This is how it's going to go.

2383
04:24:58.350 --> 04:24:58.740
Because

04:25:00.300 --> 04:25:00.810

04:25:08.670 --> 04:25:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you do not build this other stuff.

2389
04:25:14.400 --> 04:25:23.340
iPhone: It brings you happiness. And that's the been so hard for me. I don't know if I'm making excuses in my head. For this reason, because

2390
04:25:24.390 --> 04:25:32.490
iPhone: I've been in Clovis my whole life. So I know every single drug dealer every single word and I see them everywhere around town so

2391
04:25:33.150 --> 04:25:42.450
iPhone: I don't know. That's my excuses. Like, I don't want to go. That's why I don't leave the house. Most of the time, because I don't want to go. I don't want to see anybody because I don't want to see.

2392
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:52.110
iPhone: Any of the old that's why whenever I'm gone at work during the week and Emeril I feel great. Like I feel like I'm free. And then I come home on the weekends and I'm just fucking miserable and

2393
04:25:52.740 --> 04:25:59.430
iPhone: But also, like you said, that could just be me telling myself that I'm making all up in my head. I don't know. Yeah.

2394
04:25:59.970 --> 04:26:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Same reason you changed your number I'm trying not to eat a bunch of sugar. I'm cutting back on sugar. I wanna you know it's not good for the for anything of the immune system. And I just go ahead and I'm just done still have all the sweets in my cupboard.

04:26:20.940 --> 04:26:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would I do that it Trevor, if it turns out that you just have to get up out of this city.

2397
04:26:26.460 --> 04:26:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life is worth it. But I can't tell you that right now. I CAN'T. I CAN'T MAKE YOU HEAR ME

Gwenevere Abriel: You're not giving yourself a chance

2403
04:27:09.480 --> 04:27:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To have groaning happen, you still have all these traders traders traders traders are the worst thing you could be doing is isolating staying home. No, I need you out.

04:27:31.260 --> 04:27:42.090
iPhone: Clovis just for. It doesn't matter if things are going good. What if I'm just, it makes me have almost an anxiety attack just to go to Walmart and Globus because I don't want to see my family.

Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on just

iPhone: I just my head also tells me I'm bothering her. She has power over me. Other people texting her asking the same shit, which I know is wrong, you would rather me text you but I don't have a single other person here other than you, that I could talk about this stuff with so I

2418
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:13.350

Gwenevere Abriel: Don't say anything. Just sit with that just sit there with that.

2501
04:36:41.220 --> 04:36:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Awful thought and I get it, but you are a grown ass man. Hold on. Don't get offended. I'm just using slang, just to be silly here. Okay, growing up is so

2502
04:36:55.980 --> 04:37:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we want both we want her pretty shiny things we don't want to be convenience.

2503
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But just like that. Tough love might have come down with your brother, your mom might have finally just said I had it with you, she could do that to you. And would you give up on yourself like that to keep that pretty car.

2504
04:37:21.270 --> 04:37:26.940
iPhone: No, I mean, I had a truck. I gave up before that one for the reason being

2505
04:37:27.480 --> 04:37:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna get you're just you're a young man, you're going to get pretty shiny things again.

2506
04:37:32.400 --> 04:37:32.820
Yeah.

2507
04:37:35.850 --> 04:37:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't quite get how important recovery first everything else. I mean, I

2508
04:37:43.080 --> 04:37:45.480
iPhone: Get it, I just don't put it into practice, I

2509
04:37:45.480 --> 04:37:47.310
iPhone: Understand, and I know I just

2510
04:37:47.310 --> 04:37:47.610
Don't

2511
04:37:48.720 --> 04:37:49.170
iPhone: I don't

2512
04:37:50.250 --> 04:37:50.430
And

2513
04:37:51.600 --> 04:38:03.840
iPhone: The reason being is because I haven't found those meetings that I can get to him fatalis or online. And that hasn't been fresh on my mind. I haven't been reading my book, like I used to. Because I was going to meetings every day and

2514
04:38:05.250 --> 04:38:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I have, I have to put in more effort I

2515
04:38:09.630 --> 04:38:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be giving you a hard time like

2516
04:38:11.130 --> 04:38:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This really confrontational. It's not really my style. I prefer to do the breadcrumbs and you pick them up along the way but I'm so I'm approaching it a little bit more directly

2517
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're ultimately going to make you're going to make the decision.

2518
04:38:29.130 --> 04:38:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't, how much more can your mother tolerate of damaging this trust you've developed with her, how many times

2519
04:38:37.410 --> 04:38:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, maybe if you did it. Now you are inconvenienced by the car being changing that the lifestyle changes and it's just an efficiency and Portela so wherever but

2520
04:38:52.050 --> 04:39:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What I message that would send that no bullshit. You're taking this serious like you never have before. No one's making you do it I as an adult did it.

2521
04:39:06.840 --> 04:39:07.350
iPhone: Work.

2522
04:39:07.800 --> 04:39:08.100
iPhone: For me,

2523
04:39:08.460 --> 04:39:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do for you that you're the one that said, I've got to actually put it into action and no one make you do it. Your mom's out making you do it the what that sends back to the self efficacy in the self esteem. No one can take from you again the power, the adult feeling of I got this.

2524
04:39:28.290 --> 04:39:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I faced inconvenience I faced all of that. I did it anyway. That's how important my health is and my happiness. That's how important it is knowing can mess with me now, you get a little text.

2525
04:39:41.460 --> 04:39:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I just fucking gave up my truck.

2526
04:39:44.460 --> 04:39:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to hear your shit I just gave up my whole lifestyle. Fuck you. Okay. Right now you're in it.

2527
04:39:51.600 --> 04:40:09.510
iPhone: On your boy that I feel like that's what happened to me this week because whenever I was getting checked out of the hospital, like literally as I was walking to the car. Someone texted me. Hey, I have another somebody that owed me money. So it would have been a free two pills and

2528
04:40:10.710 --> 04:40:24.030
iPhone: I was like, I am literally getting checked out of the hospital. I'm never touching a pill. Again, please don't ever text me again and I'm in that thought process right now I just have to keep going with it and do the whole thing.

2529
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Help you

2530
04:40:26.970 --> 04:40:30.780
iPhone: I just needed to know that. I mean, I just, I just, I'm just type person I just

2531
04:40:31.650 --> 04:40:41.460
iPhone: I let me tell you how I was thinking because my brain right now. I felt like it was not working correctly. I wasn't in a spot where I could make right decisions.

2532
04:40:42.120 --> 04:40:50.220
iPhone: About what to do with my life right now. And that's why it's hard because I didn't have anyone to ask other than you but

2533
04:40:51.000 --> 04:41:03.210
iPhone: Now I'm just kind of more confident and what I need to do because I've already been thinking about it last night and the day before about how I just can't stay in Clovis, and I know how to make it happen. I have to do it.

2534
04:41:04.500 --> 04:41:05.010
iPhone: But

2535
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.750
iPhone: I mean, there's

2536
04:41:07.980 --> 04:41:08.550
iPhone: Just

2537
04:41:08.790 --> 04:41:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's getting in touch. This is actually believe it or not, and

2538
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:14.760
iPhone: That's what I want. That's what and that's what I want.

2539
04:41:15.300 --> 04:41:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever take pride in the fact that what you're about to do. It's not actually a little thing. This is actually an existential dilemma. This is I'm really on my own. I am my own person.

2540
04:41:33.810 --> 04:41:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I can take care of myself in this world. I am there for myself. There's no bombastic father and there's no no it's not going to be this extreme that's going to finally get me off my ass know it can be subtle and slow and methodical, oh my gosh, but once you get it, you are going to see

2541
04:41:54.240 --> 04:41:55.920
iPhone: That nobody can trip up

2542
04:41:56.220 --> 04:42:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to know in real time. I am a man. I'm a grown person. I got this. I can save myself. I am here for myself.

2543
04:42:07.890 --> 04:42:09.240
iPhone: No one can hear from you.

2544
04:42:09.450 --> 04:42:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't

04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: play this out.

2546
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a big deal. What you're about to do, but

2547
04:42:14.490 --> 04:42:20.340
iPhone: I mean, I feel good about it right now, but whenever that first hit me on Wednesday. Whenever I told my mom and she was like

2548
04:42:21.180 --> 04:42:28.590
iPhone: Okay, you will. You got to do it on your own. I'm not helping you. I'm not getting you to know detox or nothing. And then it kind of hit me like oh fuck this is

2549
04:42:29.370 --> 04:42:37.410
iPhone: That was the first time I didn't have someone that was willing to get me into a detox. So I had to figure it all out. I had to do it on my own and

2550
04:42:38.430 --> 04:42:56.520
iPhone: But I'm at. It made me feel a lot better. The way it got handled where I'm at right now compared to spending 1500 dollars if somebody's money and driving me four hours somewhere and having to come get me a week later, after I miss work and miss all these upon whatever like I've just

2551
04:42:57.630 --> 04:43:03.030
iPhone: It's been really hard, you know, just having to put my foot down and do it. But I did it and

2552
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It was one call it one thing at a time. None of education, job learning new skill. It's never everything was always one.

2553
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Little step at a time don't overwhelm yourself with all of it. Just go commit to it 54321 countdown and already started an action calling places and tell us how do I move this car along

2554
04:43:27.780 --> 04:43:40.890

2581
04:45:44.760 --> 04:46:00.120
iPhone: Filled it but I didn't take it because I knew I wasn't allowed to with you guys. So I was going to ask the doctor if he could give me some more Clonidine or any or anything to help with the withdrawals, like the or something for like the diarrhea. It's

2582
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:01.200

04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:12.270
iPhone: Even with the Suboxone I'm kind of going, I don't need it for long. Just like two to three days or whatever but

Gwenevere Abriel: Without

2588
04:46:19.170 --> 04:46:31.890
iPhone: The cold sweats and and that's pretty much it. Everything else the Suboxone pretty much took care of, okay, and is asking for assistance.

04:46:33.690 --> 04:46:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: With is how many milligrams of

2590
04:46:38.940 --> 04:46:40.320

2592
04:46:45.840 --> 04:46:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And it's really hard for me to

2593
04:46:51.870 --> 04:46:51.960
Put

2594
04:46:53.760 --> 04:46:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It on the bottle. Does it say to take them at different times of the day.

2595
04:46:59.610 --> 04:47:05.190
iPhone: Let me see. I'm all, I'm almost positive mind does because the doctor knows I take them like that.

2596
04:47:07.980 --> 04:47:08.760
iPhone: Sensual talents.

2597
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.740
iPhone: To ways

2598
04:47:15.240 --> 04:47:19.770

2599
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:23.040
Okay.

2600
04:47:27.690 --> 04:47:28.080
Okay.

2601
04:47:30.570 --> 04:47:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is an awkward position for me so I

2602
04:47:35.040 --> 04:47:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Other doctors. Okay. And this is this is a doctor Solomon and I are on the same page, except right here.

2603
04:47:43.230 --> 04:47:45.420
iPhone: You feel they should be taken at one time.

2604
04:47:45.810 --> 04:47:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, walk through this

2605
04:47:48.840 --> 04:47:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the amount of medicine that needs to be in your bloodstream and it lasts in your bloodstream for 36 hours work if it only was in there for

2606
04:47:59.070 --> 04:48:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Eight hours. Why, then, of

2607
04:48:00.270 --> 04:48:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Course, we would ticket eight hours later, the whole point is to get the right amount in your bloodstream and then by the time you're asleep, and then it wears off. And in the morning. Then you take it in its last so long acting opioids, you

2608
04:48:17.100 --> 04:48:18.510
iPhone: Never thought about it like that.

2609
04:48:19.050 --> 04:48:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You are never getting the right dose all day long. So I have a really hard time with it. I've expressed it just a tiny bit for him. We

2610
04:48:25.680 --> 04:48:29.100
iPhone: Let me try it. I'll try it. Then I'll try it for two days.

2611
04:48:30.210 --> 04:48:35.310
iPhone: I don't mind trying. If it it'll make me feel better. I'm serious. I don't mind sharing it all.

2612
04:48:36.180 --> 04:48:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The rest of my caseload does

2613
04:48:38.370 --> 04:48:42.030
iPhone: Well, let me try. I'll try it tomorrow, okay, and

2614
04:48:42.090 --> 04:48:42.750
iPhone: If it doesn't

2615
04:48:43.320 --> 04:48:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Give medical advice on attaining

2616
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:48.060
iPhone: What I'm watching other people

2617
04:48:48.060 --> 04:48:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

2618
04:48:48.450 --> 04:48:53.790
iPhone: But that makes sense to me. That makes sense. Because for me, I start feeling like these.

2619
04:48:55.020 --> 04:49:06.390
iPhone: Like this feeling of withdrawal coming on. And by the time I'm ready to take my next one, you know, and that happens twice a day because I'm taking them like that. So I understand that I would much rather just take them and then

2620
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're going to feel good and then the quantity is going to help with a tiny bit of you may not have any symptoms. Frankly, I think you're going to feel good right away.

2621
04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's a lot of medicine.

2622
04:49:18.000 --> 04:49:18.360
iPhone: Yeah.

2623
04:49:18.900 --> 04:49:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when you know later on if if at night.

2624
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're having trouble with sleep then then the quantity really helps with that in the cold sweats if if something, anything left that typically is done when people are tapering though you've never had a chance to just completely feel good. I don't understand it anyway.

2625
04:49:39.360 --> 04:49:50.730
iPhone: I don't get it. Yeah. Well, no, I've been feeling good, like the past the before I relapse those these last three four once he got me to three a day I was feeling great. And I was doing great, but

2626
04:49:52.410 --> 04:49:53.850
iPhone: Then I relaxed, but

2627
04:49:55.200 --> 04:50:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, anyway, let's just I'm sending him this message on my next client just walked in and a set appointment.

2628
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Next time, let's really hammer down concrete behaviors that are going to manifest into the universe that you are not full of shit. Okay.

2629
04:50:16.080 --> 04:50:17.490
iPhone: All right. Thank you.

2630
04:50:17.850 --> 04:50:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean.

04:50:18.840 --> 04:50:19.560
iPhone: Yeah, I

Gwenevere Abriel: Just do the next right thing. I'll see you soon.

2633
04:50:23.280 --> 04:50:23.760
Thank you.

2634
04:50:29.340 --> 04:50:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

2635
04:50:31.650 --> 04:50:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

2636
04:50:32.580 --> 04:50:33.300
Sorry.

2637
04:50:34.380 --> 04:50:35.280
Jackie: I gotta deal with it.

2638
04:50:36.540 --> 04:50:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, that's fine. I have plenty of people I see in the car. All day long I see him in their cars. I was just it

2639
04:50:42.330 --> 04:50:48.600
Jackie: Was just yeah this is the first time I've had to do this so I'm like, What do I don't my phone. So I'm sorry if it gets distracting.

2640
04:50:49.620 --> 04:50:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me just see something

2641
04:50:54.090 --> 04:50:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me open up a note.

2642
04:50:57.990 --> 04:51:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And once you tell me a little bit about maybe after that group, we were talking about shame and guilt and kind of what stuck with you around that topic.

2643
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:10.320
Jackie: I feel like

2644
04:51:11.760 --> 04:51:23.850
Jackie: So Shannon was the bad one, right, like the one we're okay. I feel like I have I never even really noticed it, I guess. I thought it was kind of natural. I guess I have a lot of shame. I think I think so too.

2645
04:51:25.020 --> 04:51:25.290
Yeah.

2646
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I do believe

2647
04:51:30.660 --> 04:51:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I am. I am.

2648
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: disappointed in myself that one.

2649
04:51:39.330 --> 04:51:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Somewhere in there.

2650
04:51:40.530 --> 04:51:41.940
Jackie: Yeah, no.

2651
04:51:46.080 --> 04:51:46.980
I agree.

2652
04:51:48.240 --> 04:51:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get a note in here. So, um, so you thought about it, and you say,

2653
04:51:55.500 --> 04:52:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If you look back, just take this last week just analyze your own week and kind of go, Hmm, I wonder if I got shame activated or gone into A SHAME SPIRAL and you'd know you're in a SHAME SPIRAL because you started calling yourself names.

2654
04:52:11.280 --> 04:52:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can figure out a couple of events where that happened throughout this last week.

2655
04:52:20.130 --> 04:52:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You are frozen Frozen frozen.

2656
04:52:26.100 --> 04:52:26.490
Jackie: Hello.

2657
04:52:26.640 --> 04:52:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're back.

2658
04:52:28.140 --> 04:52:31.080
Jackie: I'm sorry, I don't know what that was. I hope this isn't going to be a problem.

2659
04:52:31.740 --> 04:52:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it will probably go on and off.

2660
04:52:36.690 --> 04:52:38.850
Jackie: Sorry weapons. It's okay.

2661
04:52:39.480 --> 04:52:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the one losing out on it. I'm just

2662
04:52:41.490 --> 04:52:42.120
Jackie: I know

2663
04:52:42.450 --> 04:52:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're losing out on the service now me, I'm good.

2664
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:47.280
Jackie: Point. Yeah.

2665
04:52:49.560 --> 04:52:49.920
Okay.

2666
04:52:51.360 --> 04:53:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, you're here, we're talking about important stuff. Don't get distracted by by the technology as long as see you're coming back here. If it completely poops out. That's another matter. But you're back. So don't worry about it.

2667
04:53:05.760 --> 04:53:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so what I had asked you was to track back in the last month. Now that you have this this sort of refined understanding of the distinction between shame and guilt.

2668
04:53:16.110 --> 04:53:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants you to track back this last week and see chicken. See, was I in shame because I sat here with a label about myself.

2669
04:53:25.140 --> 04:53:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I kept feeding it with evidence that it's true. I'm a shit. I'm a, I'm a disappointment. I'm, I'm just, I'm a bad person. Look, look, here's another piece of evidence and you sat there and you didn't actually

2670
04:53:38.550 --> 04:53:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Take action and do anything about it. Or maybe there's evidence throughout the week that you went, oh

2671
04:53:48.360 --> 04:54:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh, I forgot to get vegetables in everybody's food. This week, all I needed. I need to amp up the veggies and then you went shopping. Have you made sure there was vegetables. That's action. It's getting in the solution. See where you saw one or both.

2672
04:54:05.400 --> 04:54:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

2673
04:54:07.560 --> 04:54:24.510
Jackie: I often do the, oh, I need to do this. Like, for example, you wrote a vegetables. That's a really good one. Like, I'm like, oh, I need to make healthier dinners for my kids and I want to do it, but like, everything gets in the way, the lack of time.

2674
04:54:26.550 --> 04:54:31.710
Jackie: It's like, oh, something always gets in the way, but I often feel guilty about. Yeah, things like that.

2675
04:54:32.460 --> 04:54:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that, then that's guilt. So you would know it. If you just went to the next time you saw an opportunity to follow through with something a standard that you believe in it. All you did was just go do it.

2676
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you went into name calling and crying and you went down this deep spiral which which happens for you.

2677
04:54:58.140 --> 04:55:09.540
Jackie: Both um I don't spiral so bad. Where I'm like crying, but like in my head, I'm like, oh my god, you're so dumb, like I vocalize that a lot like if I mess up even in school or something.

2678
04:55:09.990 --> 04:55:20.040
Jackie: I'll say like, Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so dumb or, I don't know, I find myself talking negatively like that about myself. Often, so I, I just think it's just something I'm so used to. Yeah.

2679
04:55:20.100 --> 04:55:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example of I'm so dumb. Give me a story that led to I'm so dumb.

2680
04:55:26.670 --> 04:55:32.310
Jackie: Okay. Like, for example, this just happened this morning, which is why I'm in the car. I had to have a meeting with

2681
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:41.040
Jackie: Someone from my school. One of the like administrative people and she gave me her number. And she was like, well, here's my number, save it in your phone, but

2682
04:55:41.490 --> 04:55:53.970
Jackie: I want you to text me and I was like, Oh, you want me to text you like right now. And she was like, No, no, like text me because I prefer text over calls. And I was like, oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm so dumb. I didn't even realize that

2683
04:55:56.760 --> 04:56:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so dumb. So you took just a basic linguistic miscommunication to I'm so dumb.

2684
04:56:04.860 --> 04:56:05.220
Jackie: Yeah.

2685
04:56:06.450 --> 04:56:06.930
Jackie: That's like

2686
04:56:08.820 --> 04:56:09.180
Jackie: Yeah.

2687
04:56:09.720 --> 04:56:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a little heavy handed so I feel it's interesting because I I think we just missed one week, but I feel like it's been a long time since I've connected with you.

2688
04:56:20.940 --> 04:56:21.360
Jackie: Um,

2689
04:56:22.350 --> 04:56:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like that to you or no.

2690
04:56:24.840 --> 04:56:37.500
Jackie: It does. I feel like, yeah, I mean, it feels like a lot of time has gone by, but maybe because I'm so busy and so much happening that it just everything's a blur. It feels like okay, there's so much going on.

2691
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember feeling some progress in

2692
04:56:45.720 --> 04:56:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Checking

2693
04:56:48.000 --> 04:57:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That negative appraisal because it shows up in the. I'm sorry. Do you remember feeling some progress around it. And now if you sort of split screen. See it see it there. I can see I was catching myself doing that. And now how you're doing.

2694
04:57:04.200 --> 04:57:11.880
Jackie: I, yeah, I noticed that I was more conscious about saying sorry. Um, I feel like I kind of slipped up and I'm doing it again.

2695
04:57:13.410 --> 04:57:19.140
Jackie: But I think that's because like I've gotten lazy, not because I can't control it. But just because I like

2696
04:57:20.430 --> 04:57:26.100
Jackie: I got lazy. It's not like I take the time to like catch myself before I do it right now.

2697
04:57:26.700 --> 04:57:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. So it's just it's just lazy. Okay, so, so maybe

2698
04:57:34.650 --> 04:57:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe just changing the language a little bit and saying that it actually takes effort.

2699
04:57:41.220 --> 04:57:42.570
Jackie: Right, it does. Yeah.

2700
04:57:43.020 --> 04:57:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It does take effort.

2701
04:57:44.850 --> 04:57:53.820
Jackie: And I didn't even realize it, but the whole me saying like, I'm sorry. I'm so dumb or I'm so STUPID or like now that you mentioned it i i do that a lot.

2702
04:57:55.980 --> 04:58:02.010
Jackie: Probably as much as I say, sorry. Honestly, I didn't even realize until you said it. But yeah, I do.

2703
04:58:02.490 --> 04:58:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not only. I'm sorry, but you'll also say something disparaging about yourself.

2704
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:09.420
Jackie: Oh, yeah, yeah.

2705
04:58:10.320 --> 04:58:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Woman

2706
04:58:11.460 --> 04:58:14.370
Jackie: I don't know what it is. It just, I guess. I don't know what it is.

2707
04:58:17.700 --> 04:58:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And

2708
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We weren't making some inroads I think around the why you you can't kind of identify kind of where that came from.

2709
04:58:35.400 --> 04:58:36.060
You're frozen.

2710
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're coming back. I can hear audio waiting for video to come back.

2711
04:59:06.570 --> 04:59:08.370
Jackie: Right. Are we, I think so.

2712
04:59:09.930 --> 04:59:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you saying that today you've lost whatever sort of breadcrumbs. You are getting to understanding where this came from. Is it gone now.

2713
04:59:22.680 --> 04:59:23.040
Jackie: Yeah.

2714
04:59:25.500 --> 04:59:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's fine. I opened. I had time while we were frozen to pull up the previous note.

2715
04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:33.060
Jackie: Can I okay

2716
04:59:33.420 --> 04:59:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring us back to the progress that you were making

2717
04:59:36.300 --> 04:59:36.990
Jackie: Please do.

2718
04:59:38.700 --> 04:59:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm

2719
04:59:41.580 --> 04:59:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Good sentences or they're not always beautiful, but it's the gets the idea so

2720
04:59:48.060 --> 05:00:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It bring makes me a little nervous. I'm ready to go from two strips to one strip eventually having thoughts. Okay, now I'm going to be asked to boxing and go back to old things no self confidence. I don't know, I feel like someone needs to know.

2721
05:00:04.800 --> 05:00:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Client offered. This is me. Let me see, to do

2722
05:00:08.940 --> 05:00:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: intrusive thoughts. Okay you hadn't done homework assignment did not work on homework assignment of the. I'm sorry, because I feel like I did not do something. I was told to do.

2723
05:00:23.370 --> 05:00:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So you you believed in the. I'm sorry. It sounds like you thought, well, I needed to be sorry. It happens instantly took four days to forget about the homework I thought internally, think before I speak, pay attention to what I wanted to say.

2724
05:00:38.100 --> 05:00:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I realized how

2725
05:00:39.120 --> 05:00:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Often I say sorry

2726
05:00:41.070 --> 05:00:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: How naturally it came. I know why I don't want to let people down

2727
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, or cause conflict.

2728
05:00:51.840 --> 05:00:52.440
Yes.

2729
05:00:53.550 --> 05:00:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: See, you did. No.

2730
05:00:55.020 --> 05:00:56.880
Jackie: Absolutely. That is so true.

2731
05:00:58.230 --> 05:01:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it just didn't stick

2732
05:01:00.990 --> 05:01:01.290
Yeah.

2733
05:01:04.980 --> 05:01:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to let people down. Yep.

2734
05:01:08.520 --> 05:01:09.270
Jackie: That's a big one.

2735
05:01:15.900 --> 05:01:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you do realize, and this is this is just an opinion, but it isn't just letting them down.

2736
05:01:23.790 --> 05:01:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's how you're going to feel when you perceive you have disappointed someone

2737
05:01:30.480 --> 05:01:45.390
Jackie: Guaranteed it's I think it's both. Like, I don't, because then I think about how it feels to be let down and I'm like okay I caused this person to feel that way. But then, in turn, thinking of the way that I made them feel it makes me feel bad.

2738
05:01:48.600 --> 05:02:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's actually, it's, it's just to use a phrase, it's really none of your business to get on their side, it's just your business to pay attention to you.

2739
05:02:02.010 --> 05:02:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You hold yourself to the best ability that you can right i'll be responsible. All I'm managing a lot of competing obligations and pressures. I'm doing the best I can.

2740
05:02:15.660 --> 05:02:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But you cannot skip through life without disappointing people because you don't actually know what people's standards are and expectations. We don't make them disappointed you cannot control that.

2741
05:02:31.050 --> 05:02:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know where I'm going to be disappointed. Do you really

2742
05:02:36.660 --> 05:02:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know

2743
05:02:37.320 --> 05:02:38.160
Jackie: What you don't so

2744
05:02:38.820 --> 05:02:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You do this spray

2745
05:02:42.570 --> 05:02:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Of. I'm sorry. Just you nobody, you're going to get to find out what it is.

2746
05:02:50.190 --> 05:02:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't get to find out in reality.

2747
05:02:54.240 --> 05:02:57.720
Jackie: I have been told so many times in my life that I shouldn't worry about what other people
