91
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.160
Heather Regelbrugge: I mean, I live in a house. So, okay, yeah.

93
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.280

94
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.800

100
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.590
David Kan: Perfect. Thank you.

101
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.000
David Kan: Because I think that

102
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.550
David Kan: You know by getting on Suboxone what we're gonna do is we're going to suppress the withdrawal symptoms.

103
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.920
David Kan: And at the same time.

104
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.050
David Kan: You know, it may be that you still are around people who use drugs, particularly the opioids and it's safer to have in the lock zone kit with you.

105
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:57.480
David Kan: And, you know, most people never use it on themselves, but you know if you know other people who are using drugs at risk of overdose. It's good to have it around.

106
00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.160
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay.

107
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.270
And

108
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:08.640
David Kan: So you've been using it for about eight months and can ask you about other drugs because we talked about marijuana. What about alcohol or you

109
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:10.740

127
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.860
David Kan: No, that's, that's fine. Now I just have to ask because a lot of the reasons that I ask is that just, you know, there may be other health issues that come with it.

Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.550
David Kan: As far as

211
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.340
David Kan: Have you ever had surgery before

212
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.290
Heather Regelbrugge: No, I haven't. Okay.

213
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:55.650
David Kan: Remember earlier, we're talking a little bit about mood, like there's some times where you don't feel so good and other times where you feel good. Are there things that sort of influence your mood.

214
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.400
Heather Regelbrugge: Not really.

215
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.020
Okay.

216
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.890
David Kan: And how would you describe your mood in the last month.

217
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:11.850
Heather Regelbrugge: Pretty bad

218
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.890
Heather Regelbrugge: I bad let everyone

219
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.440
Heather Regelbrugge: Know it isn't.

220
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.280
David Kan: And have your friends and family noticed that you've been feeling down. Yeah.

221
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:26.760
David Kan: Okay. And let me ask you this, and you may not know the answer this. How much does drug use affect your parents.

222
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.430
Heather Regelbrugge: Wouldn't my wedding.

223
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:30.600
So,

224
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:40.800
David Kan: Yeah, because one thing I know about opioids, is that I've been working I ran a methadone program for 11 years and I've been using buprenorphine since 2006 so

225
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:50.670
David Kan: One of the things I know about opioids, is that when you have access to them that typically people get energy from the opioids, they feel great, they can get their day done

226
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.500
David Kan: When they can't access them. They feel down depressed, so

227
00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.980
David Kan: It can have an impact. And I'm not saying that it's only because of the opioids budget could be an important factor in things

228
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.220
Heather Regelbrugge: Not so interesting when you have the jug. You can just get the day right

229
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:17.280
David Kan: And with the dumper so you're taking anywhere from 10 to 20 pills, whatever you can get your hands on. I'm guessing.

230
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.110
David Kan: And does it take more to have same effect nowadays.

231
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.960
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah, it does. Okay, and

232
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:32.190
David Kan: The withdrawal symptoms, how it's been four days since the last took oxy cotton, when does the withdrawal symptoms start to kick in for you.

233
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.440
Heather Regelbrugge: Like literally, eight hours after stop. Gotcha.

234
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:43.740
David Kan: And I know you don't want to talk about health problems. But in general, has it cause health problems. So you're aware of

235
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.810
Major. Okay.

236
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.380
David Kan: But it may have had some impact upon your moods.

237
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.460
Heather Regelbrugge: As best as you can tell.

238
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.980
Gotcha. Okay, and

239
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.670
David Kan: You find yourself worrying excessively

240
00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.550
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah do

241
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.380
David Kan: What kind of things to worry about.

242
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.490
Family

243
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.400
Heather Regelbrugge: Family

244
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.930
Heather Regelbrugge: Family. Okay.

245
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.080
David Kan: And are you helping to take care of your family.

246
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.450
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah, okay.

247
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:13.680
And

248
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.310
David Kan: Have you ever had a panic attack before

249
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.550
David Kan: Okay, and to worry about your family, how long's happen.

250
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.530
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay.

251
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.120
And

252
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:43.320
David Kan: Have you and it sounds like this is something you want it, it sounds like there's a couple of reasons. You want to get help. You don't want to do this anymore. You've had a couple of friends overdose and it's something they want to want help with stopping

253
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.110
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah, okay.

254
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.960
David Kan: Well, I think I can help you with that and

255
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.920
David Kan: Because, has anybody explain to you what bright heart health is

256
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.460
Heather Regelbrugge: No, no. Okay, well,

257
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.000
David Kan: Maybe I could. Is it okay if I give you a couple of minutes about

258
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.080
Heather Regelbrugge: What what is what the

259
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.280
David Kan: Program is. Yeah.

260
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:03.660
David Kan: Yeah, so

261
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:11.100
David Kan: So bright heart house were a telemedicine company, you know, we connect like this and this is how you'll continue to connect with us.

262
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:23.220
David Kan: And think of us. It's like an addiction treatment program. But the nice thing about since we're telemedicine is. It's good. It's easy as they confidential. You know, you're not. It's not like you're coming in with people from the community.

263
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:23.940
Heather Regelbrugge: And then

264
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.100
David Kan: There may be some people in the community within

265
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.650
David Kan: The groups that you're in. But generally speaking, we, we really think that confidentiality is important and

266
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:43.710
David Kan: When it comes to program itself. There's, there's two pieces to it. One piece of the medical piece that we're doing right now. I'm a doctor. I'm going to work with your own medications.

267
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:53.220
David Kan: But there's also a second piece around counseling, so you'll be assigned it individual counselor. Have you ever been to see a therapist before. No.

268
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.390
Okay.

269
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:11.970
David Kan: Yeah, typically what the counseling is is that the counseling is targeted specifically towards you, meaning that we want to help you with the problems that you're experiencing inside your life. Obviously, one pieces stopping the drug use, but the other piece of it too is

270
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:24.630
David Kan: The other piece of it too is talking about other issues that for you that have you concerned. And so when it comes to counseling, we want to really target the things that really make a difference to you.

271
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:35.220
David Kan: And so you'll have an individual counselor and when it comes to medications, typically what we do in the beginning is that we start with a week of medications at a time.

272
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:44.130
David Kan: And then with that we could medications as he stabilized in the program, we can start to extend the length out of the prescriptions, if that makes sense.

273
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:45.990
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah.

274
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.310
And

275
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:58.230
David Kan: And then of course the care coordinators will talk to you about different ways that we do that but just want to say that it's more than just medications. We have a counseling component as well. And the counseling component

276
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:11.790
David Kan: What I asked for us, you know, participating counseling for a month. And if you find that it's helpful. Great. That's wonderful. But if it isn't helpful for you that we don't have to do as much of it if it's not working for you. That makes sense.

277
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.020
David Kan: And have you ever taken Suboxone before

278
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:17.490
David Kan: Now,

279
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.910
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay, Susan. Okay.

280
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.190
David Kan: And do you know anybody who's ever gotten on Suboxone

281
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.210
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah.

282
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.470
David Kan: Yeah. What did they tell you

283
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:31.770
Heather Regelbrugge: And so they don't feel as bad as the concentration, do the work. Right.

284
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.270
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah.

285
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.010
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah, cuz

286
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.530
David Kan: So Suboxone if I could explain them is okay if I explain the medication, what it does.

287
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:49.380
David Kan: Yeah, yeah. So Suboxone is actually a combination of two medications. It's a medication called buprenorphine and a medication calm the locks.

288
00:19:49.950 --> 00:20:01.050
David Kan: So it's a combination of two medications and when you take Suboxone the way you take Suboxone the end of the pills or the strips is you put it under your tongue and let it dissolve.

289
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:10.590
David Kan: And once the medication is fully dissolved, then it's inside your system and with the saliva. You can swallow it. If you want to be can also split this live out

290
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:21.510
David Kan: Because people who swallow the saliva get can have constipated, a bit more constipation than the people who spit it out. But once the medications dissolved. It's in your system.

291
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:39.060
David Kan: And the way the medication works is, what it does is it's an opioid just like the oxy cotton is. But the challenge with oxy cotton is that, you know, you take the first dose. You feel it starts coming down, you take another dose and so you're on this, you know, it's like a ship on the waves.

292
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.280
David Kan: Yeah, whereas if you're taking the Suboxone what happens, it turns on the opioid

293
00:20:45.330 --> 00:21:04.980
David Kan: Tone, but it holds it steady for really long time. And what we do into the end product of it, is it suppresses withdraw it reduces the temptation to use drugs and if you use oxy cotton on top of it. You don't get sick, what happens is you don't feel the oxy cotton.

294
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:15.000
David Kan: At the same time, you're feeling much, you know, when we talked about issues with your mood. I suspect that the oxycodone Suboxone will be much more steady

295
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.670
David Kan: The other interesting thing about Suboxone is that

296
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:27.600
David Kan: It has the anti depressant effects and we know the opioids have anti depressant effects, but the Suboxone has more anti depressant effects of the opioids.

297
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:43.410
David Kan: And when it comes to how to dose it. It's been four days since your last oxy cotton dose. So it's probably safe to start today and what I'll do is I'll send the prescription over to your pharmacy so that you can pick it up hopefully today.

298
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:45.810
David Kan: And

299
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:52.650
David Kan: As far as the first dose that I would recommend. So what I'm going to do some I ordered the eight to eight milligram strips.

300
00:21:53.370 --> 00:22:03.240
David Kan: And then recommend that you start with half a strip under your tongue and let it dissolve and then wait an hour. See how you feel. And here's it's this is this piece important

301
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:11.520
David Kan: If you take the medication you feel sicker. Stop. Whereas if you take the medication feel better after an hour, you can take another dose.

302
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:21.510
David Kan: And then after that you can take another dose after another hour, and yet another dose. So you can take up to a total of 16 milligrams in the first day.

303
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.110
David Kan: Because my goal is to get you comfortable

304
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.250
Heather Regelbrugge: As quickly as we can.

305
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:36.660
David Kan: And as far as the side effects of the medication. It does have some potential for side effects. The biggest one. I told you about, which is constipation.

306
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:46.920
David Kan: And if that happens, we can recommend some medications to help you with constipation. But there's some things you can do, such as, you know, make sure you drink lots of water.

307
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.150
Heather Regelbrugge: You know,

308
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.360
David Kan: Get try to get some fiber inside your food. That's the first and foremost thing.

309
00:22:53.010 --> 00:23:01.170
David Kan: It can also have some impacts upon it can medication can make you sleepy, although with the oxy cotton in the background. I don't think that's going to happen.

310
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:15.780
David Kan: And very rarely people are allergic to either the naloxone or the morphine, but that's I I've yet to see that. But it's been told it's it's happened before. So it's something that should let you know about

311
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.440
David Kan: And as far as how long we do the medication.

312
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:27.210
David Kan: You know, I tend to think of the medication is a longer term treatment and I don't want to say for the rest of your life because I don't know that.

313
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:41.040
David Kan: But I think the main thing is that we want to get you stabilized. So, till you feel like the pills are no longer an issue and the time to come off the medication was when it feels like everything, your life is kind of moving in the right direction, if that makes sense.

314
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:41.880
Yeah.

315
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:43.950
David Kan: And

316
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:55.980
David Kan: But I think getting the medication soundboard makes a lot of sense right now and I'm happy to order it for you. Do we, I'm sorry. I have another screen here. So I'm going to look up if that's okay with you.

317
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.040
David Kan: Do we know what your

318
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.700
David Kan: Which which pharmacy. Are you at

319
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:04.650
Heather Regelbrugge: A pharmacy.

320
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.130
David Kan: Let me just get that in there.

321
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:13.680
David Kan: I can hear you sniffling

322
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.120
Heather Regelbrugge: Hard to sit still. Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

323
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.250
David Kan: Let's see.

324
00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:36.990
milligram film.

325
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.200
David Kan: Sorry, bear with me as I put all the sun.

326
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.600
David Kan: And I'm sorry. You said it was arena pharmacy.

327
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.100
David Kan: Yeah, okay.

328
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.050
David Kan: And

329
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.440
David Kan: Let's see here.

330
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.660
David Kan: Yeah. And do you have Medicaid or medical

331
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.550
David Kan: Yeah, okay.

332
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.100
David Kan: Yeah, medical should cover the whole cost of the medication.

333
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:38.430
David Kan: So if they say that there's a copay ask them to send it through medical first and medical should cover the entire cost of things.

334
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:40.950
David Kan: And

335
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:58.200
David Kan: So, I mean, if I could summarize it sounds like you know oxy cotton kind of showed up and it's something they didn't expect to get dependent upon and what's happened is that over time. The OxyContin doses increased its constant problems in your life and you've tried to quit. But you couldn't

336
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:12.930
David Kan: You've been lucky they have an overdose. But it sounds like you, you know, you become tolerant to the drug. And you also have withdrawal. When you stop and it's something you've been thinking about trying to do for a while. And I'm really glad we got connected today.

337
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:22.110
David Kan: Yeah, and from a medical standpoint, it sounds like medically speaking, you're otherwise generally pretty healthy, you don't have any major medical problems you're aware of

338
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:34.080
David Kan: And from a psychiatric standpoint as far as your mood goes you know it's probably too early to determine. Look, I'm a psychiatrist, but I don't think you need antidepressants. I think we need to get this

339
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:40.110
David Kan: Issue with the pills as what under control first before you can make a determination as to what's going on.

340
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:50.790
David Kan: And I know they'll train you on the log, you'll get a no oxygen get trained on it at the clinic right now.

341
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.310
Heather Regelbrugge: Were there.

342
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.710
David Kan: And were there.

343
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.210
David Kan: Did I cover everything or were there other issues that you needed help with

344
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.450
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay.

345
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:16.470
David Kan: Well, I'm glad I think you're making a really good decision and get started on treatment and again when it comes to dosing the medication. Start with a half a strip and the one thing I would say about these trips is they're usually pretty easy to cut up

346
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:23.310
David Kan: And the main thing is you keep them dry because if you get them what the strips there. I don't know if if you're trying to Listerine strips.

347
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.190
David Kan: Yeah, yeah. They're kind of like that.

348
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.670
David Kan: And there's two places you can put you can put it underneath your tongue.

349
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.580
David Kan: There, or you can actually stick it in between your gum in your cheek both places work.

350
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.230
David Kan: And

351
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:45.450
David Kan: Once the medications dissolve. It's in you because what it does is it dissolves through like a it dissolves through or it gets absorbed in your mouth.

352
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:56.910
David Kan: And as far as using oxy cotton on top. I don't recommend it. But at the same time. If you do, it's something that I understand. Look, it's part of the process.

353
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:10.740
David Kan: And it would be great if this is what sticks permanently. But at the same time, if you do use oxy cotton we run what we call a harm reduction program. So we'll never get on your case about use it because in my view.

354
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:23.520
David Kan: If you're still using. To me, that's a sign that maybe the medications aren't at a high dose. We don't kick people out of the program for using because if you're still using its means that the illness has not been fully treated yet.

355
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.440
Heather Regelbrugge: That makes sense. Yeah.

356
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.820
David Kan: And so in the end we tried to get people on the treatment.

357
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:38.190
David Kan: Get people on the treatment and get them stabilized and then when it comes to coming off the medication. We can figure that out later.

358
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:48.750
David Kan: One thing I should say, though, is that one thing I forgot to mention is the medication you become physically dependent upon that medication as well, although you're already physically dependent

359
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:56.250
David Kan: Meaning that if you stop the medication. Suddenly, you could have some withdrawal symptoms, but they're not nearly as bad as oxy cotton.

360
00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:58.680
David Kan: And

361
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:08.160
David Kan: I heard some sniffling. It sounds like you're getting cramping and it looks like it's kind of look I get a sense you're a little bit restless kind of hard to sit still. Huh.

362
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:17.040
David Kan: Yeah okay well I'm going to order the medication for you to send to your pharmacy and then somebody from the team will be in touch with you.

363
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:30.030
David Kan: To figure out what the next step is because the next thing is that if there's any problems with medication call us you know either. You can't get it you taken it something strange happens you give us a call and they'll get back to me.

364
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.920
David Kan: And I can give you advice.

365
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:44.460
David Kan: But at the same time, if everything goes well, then everything goes well, and I would say take up to two strips a day. But if you find like it's not holding you just please let us know.

366
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.190
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay.

367
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.140
David Kan: Any questions that you had for me.

368
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.770
Heather Regelbrugge: Know you pretty much covered it all. Okay.

369
00:29:53.100 --> 00:30:06.630
David Kan: We'll say, sir, I can grab you know good I think you're making a healthy a great decision for your house and we're here to support you through that. I'll send the medication in for you right now and again if there's any questions or issues, feel free to give us a call.

370
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.220
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay, okay.

371
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.020
Heather Regelbrugge: Well, good. Thank you. Sounds good.

372
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.030
David Kan: Um, do I need to talk to Heather about anything.

373
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.670
Heather Regelbrugge: No, I just have a quick, just a quick

374
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:26.640
Heather Regelbrugge: Yesterday, they sent me the orders for his blood work. So I'm not a clinic. I'm at where I'm a community health worker, but I'm just trying to coordinate says I was care. So I'm going to

375
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:34.770
Heather Regelbrugge: Try it's difficult times to get him that blood work done, even though he he's pretty fearful of needles. So he's not

376
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:46.980
Heather Regelbrugge: Going to be hard on two aspects is to get him to go one and two, to actually get him into our little putting the, what kind of timeline, do I have in order to get that blood work done.

377
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:58.260
David Kan: Um, we prefer to get that sooner rather than later, because we make, we can make some decisions based upon that. But if there's concerns say sorry let me ask you, is that the pain or the idea of needles that troubles you

378
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.870
Heather Regelbrugge: Uh, I mean, it doesn't matter. I

379
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:03.900
Heather Regelbrugge: Just

380
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:06.450
Heather Regelbrugge: Know,

381
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:18.450
David Kan: Okay. All right. Well, because if it's paying I can give you a patch, so you can put over your arm that stops the pain from the needle, if that's something that you'd like. That's fine. Okay. All right.

382
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:25.920
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay that's good to know. So, so now I just have to overcome the clinic. So, that's okay. That's, that's, I'll do it.

383
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:26.880
David Kan: Yeah.

384
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:32.820
David Kan: I think, Susan, or what I'd recommend is look away dilemma. Let me ask you this question says, Are you pass out needles.

385
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.020
Heather Regelbrugge: Nada.

386
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:41.220
David Kan: You don't pass out. Okay. Yeah, because there's a thing called a blood on the needle phobia instilling phobia, where people actually pass out from

387
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:55.770
David Kan: I think the main thing is that asked if it's that they've had a lot of experience most labs have a lot of experience with people reluctant to give drop blood and asked him if you can put in your headphones turn away. Don't even look at it.

388
00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:01.470
David Kan: Just, you know, kind of breathing, you know, be someplace mentally be someplace else.

389
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.040
Heather Regelbrugge: Yeah.

390
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.260
David Kan: Find a good video on YouTube or something like that.

391
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:10.710
Heather Regelbrugge: Okay, okay. Alright, so I'm trying to set that up for him at the clinic.

392
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.270
Heather Regelbrugge: Yep, probably, it probably get done within the next week.

393
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:16.290
David Kan: Yeah, that's fine.

394
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.760
David Kan: Okay, okay.

395
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.140
David Kan: Sounds good.

396
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.270
David Kan: All right, I'll put some the medication for you right now.

397
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.630
David Kan: All right, take care, sir.

398
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.470
David Kan: It's a pleasure meeting you.

399
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.300
Aren't finer

400
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.720
Heather Regelbrugge: I cool. Yeah.

401
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.380
David Kan: Feel free to

402
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:40.260
David Kan: See, Dr. David con so Cesaro Mr Cervantes is an 18 year old male with an eight month history of opioid use disorder.

403
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:52.380
David Kan: Even though it does not meet the statutory criteria. He said, significant risk, as evidenced by escalating RATES OF OXYCONTIN. Moreover, the oxy cotton pills are likely contaminated with fentanyl

404
00:32:53.610 --> 00:33:06.720
David Kan: The patient is a good candidate for medication assisted treatment to reduce the risk of relapse detoxification would be risky at this time because he would lose his tolerance and should he returned to drugs is risk of overdose is elevated

405
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:15.150
David Kan: The patient has been will be provided overdose education and the locks and distribution shin at the clinic that he's located at

406
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:28.320
David Kan: The risks, benefits and alternatives to treatment were discussed with the patient and the agrees to begin treatment buprenorphine opportunities, the patient has offered opportunities to ask questions about the course of treatment as well as the structure of the program.

407
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:40.620
David Kan: The patient will start with four milligram sublingual q one hour to for total does not to exceed 16 milligrams. The patient was given the instructions on how to take the medication.

408
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:47.730
David Kan: The medication will be electronically prescribed to his pharmacy right heart health will further follow up with the patient in order to

409
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:56.250
David Kan: In order to engage in in psychosocial support as well as counseling and that's it. Thanks so much.
