22
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.430
Lauren Kelly: And

23
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:07.980
Lauren Kelly: Um, yeah, I didn't even want to answer it. At first, it took me like five minutes of, like, kind of going back and forth. And if I was even going to answer it. Um,

24
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:28.050
Lauren Kelly: And he just kept knocking it the dogs were barking, whatever, which he has a key. So the fact that he was knocking was the I, you know, normally the old him just lets himself in, you know, um, so

25
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.170
Lauren Kelly: I opened the door, and I said, Do you need something and

26
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.800
Lauren Kelly: He says, yeah, I need you to talk to you.

27
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:59.760
Lauren Kelly: So come yeah okay what and and he said, basically I just had two questions for you. The first was, if I could come in. So thanks for letting me come in and the second was if there's any way in the future you think that you would ever be able to forgive

28
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:14.370
Lauren Kelly: Um, basically, he exactly what you said he got there and realize that the problems were bigger than him and him being there changed. Absolutely nothing.

29
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.370
Lauren Kelly: That he

30
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.150
Lauren Kelly: Will in his words, he

31
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.100
Lauren Kelly: Miss or what was it, he

32
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.230
Lauren Kelly: I'm

33
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.940
Lauren Kelly: Not misunderstood. But I'm Miss. What's the word

34
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.640
Lauren Kelly: I'm not thinking of the word right but he didn't engage right his

35
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:56.940
Lauren Kelly: Love and draw for me vs. And also what him going back there. We do. So basically he you know thought that it was going to change something, or whatever. But that nothing changed in that

36
00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.160
Lauren Kelly: That

37
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:14.850
Lauren Kelly: He just realizing you know made the biggest mistake of his life, and he knows he heard you, but he's just wondering if there's any way that I could ever consider like obviously not today or tomorrow but sometime in the future.

38
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:28.050
Lauren Kelly: That if I could ever forgive him, and that he knows for a fact that now more than ever that I am going to eat his wife. One day he knows for a fact he's gonna be calling me five it

39
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.410
Lauren Kelly: Sooner than I realized, and that that you know even if I tell them to fuck off and leave today. He's just going to keep coming back and tell

40
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.580
Lauren Kelly: Until I, you know, find it in my heart to forgive him and that

41
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.300
Lauren Kelly: You know He loves me more than anything, and

42
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.220
Lauren Kelly: That he can't live without me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

43
00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:03.090
Lauren Kelly: Um I when he first started talking, I said, is this a fucking joke. This is a fucking joke right and

44
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:16.710
Lauren Kelly: And he said, No, and I literally I couldn't even look at him. I couldn't even I tried to look at him and my body like rejected. I like tried to look and I just, I couldn't even do it, I was like, I can't even fucking look at you like, I'm so angry at you.

45
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:26.520
Lauren Kelly: My whole body was. It was the weirdest thing like I was shaking, because that when he got here. I was doing my makeup. I was trying to like

46
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.050
Lauren Kelly: Yesterday was the first day I finally was like trying to engage with the world again and like

47
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:39.930
Lauren Kelly: Actually like took a shower or whatever. And there's just crazy that that would be the day he would show up. So when you got here. I was actually like up doing laundry and like doing

48
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:47.430
Lauren Kelly: Like you ready for the day and I was just shaking my whole body just because it was just the last thing in a million years. I expect that to happen.

49
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:57.150
Lauren Kelly: And, um, I guess by him, sending those things. He was trying to he's, you know, as I said, so what you just thought, you're going to send

50
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:09.810
Lauren Kelly: Things like you fucking left and then you send me things celebrating our anniversary, like, are you kidding me, said, you know, that was just me being an hour just trying to, you know, I knew I was going to come here today.

51
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.870
Lauren Kelly: I couldn't like our anniversary go by without seeing you in. I knew I was going to come here today. And I just thought that maybe

52
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:31.560
Lauren Kelly: I sent a few things. First, that, you know, maybe like you, you would. It would. I would just be showing up out of nowhere, whatever. And he said, you know, when I thought that maybe you would, you know, right me

53
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:41.190
Lauren Kelly: Or say something when you've got the flowers. But when I realize you've got the flowers last night and you didn't say anything. I realized, you know, just really how upset you were with me and

54
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.730
Lauren Kelly: And then I said the other things. And then he kind of looked around and he was like, did you throw the flowers away. They were now.

55
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:59.280
Lauren Kelly: And I said no. And these are, where are they, I was like, they're in the fridge. I just threw them in there. I didn't, I didn't want to look at them, you know, I wasn't going to display on, you know, um,

56
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.900
Lauren Kelly: And

57
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.170
Lauren Kelly: He basically said

58
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.600
Lauren Kelly: You know I

59
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:16.200
Lauren Kelly: Like I'd be willing to do whatever it takes whatever steps that you want me to take whatever you want me to do all you

60
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:27.810
Lauren Kelly: Just like but me, though it and I'll do it. And you know I did, I can your site, you would like. I can tell that I'm kind of overwhelming you right now, you probably have like a lot of process so

61
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:36.300
Lauren Kelly: I just wanted this to be the first of many conversations and I'd like to come back tomorrow to talk more about it.

62
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.520
Lauren Kelly: And

63
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.110
Lauren Kelly: Yeah. And I, and I said, you know, when

64
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:57.840
Lauren Kelly: So when when you were leaving and I told you, how did you, how do you know you're not going to be back here in a week, just like you always fucking are begging for my forgiveness, just like you always fucking do and you swore to me that you wouldn't do that.

65
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:15.960
Lauren Kelly: He said, You know, I just I misread my, like, my love, my draw for you and and i and i thought that being there would help like their mental health and I realized that it doesn't, you know, and maybe they're really accomplishes nothing and

66
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.420
Lauren Kelly: That

67
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:36.900

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do you feel

73
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.900
That inside

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.120
Lauren Kelly: Um, I don't feel like I'm the same person that I was before. Um,

75
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.860
Lauren Kelly: I've feel like I got to a point.

76
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:26.280
Lauren Kelly: Where I was just in so much pain that I just had to make myself that inside to just function.

77
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.170
Lauren Kelly: And

78
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.690
Lauren Kelly: I don't know. I don't know if I'm like tricking myself in this, but I almost feel like I don't love like I and

79
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.620
Lauren Kelly: Obviously, like I and I know everything.

80
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:59.100
Lauren Kelly: In my life. The first. I don't know week that I was just literally crying out to God. God, Please make it stop hurting this hurt so fucking bad just. Please make it stop like literally just crying out in the fucking air like begging behind to make this pain fucking stop like

81
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:13.950
Lauren Kelly: Those are all the things I would have wanted. I would have wanted him to realize he made a huge mistake and I didn't want any of this. You know what I mean, like, I didn't want to be alone. I didn't want to go through the worst heartbreak in my life. I don't want any of that.

82
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:27.330
Lauren Kelly: But that's what happened. And I just went through the worst like 10 days of my eye. And I don't know how to ever move forward or forgive him or no about that or

83
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.050
Lauren Kelly: I don't know. I don't know. I'm

84
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.910
Lauren Kelly: In a perfect world, you know,

85
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:44.040
Lauren Kelly: I he realized what he did wrong and I take him back and everything's free or whatever but

86
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.020
Lauren Kelly: I just

87
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:56.850
Lauren Kelly: I just don't kneel, I just have a really different perspective on like the world and relationships. Now, and I just, I really just feel like

88
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:04.050
Lauren Kelly: You can't trust anyone in that you're just alone in this world and like that everything is temporary and

89
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:20.940
Lauren Kelly: I just don't think I would ever be the same partner or girlfriend that I was before where I just love wholeheartedly and is willing to give my all like I i don't i don't really see myself ever giving that to another person and and I'm I just

90
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.050
Lauren Kelly: I just feel kind of dead inside. Um,

91
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:39.690
Lauren Kelly: I i don't know i i know like, you know, I was thinking about it last night and oddly, I actually talked to my mom about because I was thinking of before all this happened, I was thinking about finally going there today.

92
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:45.750
Lauren Kelly: Right. And I talked to my mom last night about it. And we actually talked for a while and I always wonder like

93
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:54.420
Lauren Kelly: It's kind of like that head heart battle, and I also call it like this stupid girl smart girl like his like the stupid girl flash heart.

94
00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:02.820
Lauren Kelly: Wants him back right now and wants to just like I slept like shit. Last night knowing this always coming today and

95
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:13.980
Lauren Kelly: In, you know, I want to after you and I get off this call have him come over and just like fucking crawl and Ben has been holding and just take a nap and go to bed and just like

96
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:27.990
Lauren Kelly: Work on stuff and move forward. Like that's stupid girl heart or of me, but the smart girl brain part of me wants to tell them to fuck off and never fucking come here ever again and

97
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.250
Lauren Kelly: I don't know what to do with those

98
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.170
Lauren Kelly: And I'm not like yay jumping for joy, like I'm

99
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:52.650
Lauren Kelly: I just feel like I built up this just huge massive wall, and I, I just don't see it being broken down. Um, I don't know, I just

100
00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:00.510
Lauren Kelly: I, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to take him back, and I didn't

101
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

102
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.630
Lauren Kelly: To believe all of those things.

103
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But there's a

104
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.090
Lauren Kelly: Need that just tells me to tell him to fuck off and

105
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:22.560
Lauren Kelly: That he heard me for the last time, and that regardless of if he made the biggest mistake of his life, or whatever, that this is what he does, he makes these spontaneous decisions that in one swoop.

106
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:32.130
Lauren Kelly: ruin my entire fucking life and he's done this multiple times and and you know he he said he understood the gravity of his actions, you know,

107
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:48.750
Lauren Kelly: Two weeks ago, or whatever, when he made this decision and you know you know what's to say he doesn't do this again in six months, when the therapist tells the ex something else that they don't like. And then he thinks he's going to go, you know what I mean, what

108
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.530
Yeah.

109
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many times have you done this with them.

110
00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:15.300

Lauren Kelly: But I'm not doing like jumping jacks about it. I don't know. I don't know. I should be happier than I am. I, I really don't know how I just feel

126
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do you think that that's a normal response after what you've been through with him.

127
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.490
Lauren Kelly: I don't know. Is it

128
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, it is.

129
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.200
Nice.

130
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because we can

131
00:17:46.560 --> 00:18:00.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As humans were pretty resilient. But when we're going through things like this like your work, you moved in. Okay. And you're moving your stuff in from storage.

132
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:17.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, you guys. It was the happiest time of your life. And then all of a sudden, bam. He's gone. Yeah. And he hasn't been gone once or he hasn't been gone twice and you know this is something that's happened throughout the time that you guys have been together and

133
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We can take that hurt so many times before we start shutting it off before we start building walls.

134
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's why it's fear based you have every right to be afraid that

135
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is a temporary thing that he's going to come back. Everything's going to get good and then he's gonna

136
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, feel the same guilt and remorse all over again and do the same thing all over

137
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what is going to guarantee that this cycle is stopped.

138
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.120
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

139
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know and you know

140
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Given everything that you have gone through Lauren

141
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You need guarantees.

142
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have the right to feel secure.

143
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:02.610
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

144
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just nerve.

145
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To feel secure. You know what I mean.

146
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.960
Lauren Kelly: I think so. I

147
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:21.270
Lauren Kelly: I was doing really good about my shit and owning my shit and not running and you know really sticking out the hard times and not

148
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.160
Lauren Kelly: Just running because nothing's easy or comfortable for me in

149
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:38.310
Lauren Kelly: The second that anything gets hard for him. He runs and ruins my whole life in one swoop and then a week later thinks it's all gonna be okay with you realize this. You fucked up, you know,

150
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:40.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, this was a biggie.

151
00:19:43.710 --> 00:20:06.060
Lauren Kelly: This was the worst thing I've ever gone through. I've never, ever. I mean, I couldn't function I literally would just like cry out to God like just to make this stop because I was in so much physical pain like I've never had a hard day caused me that kind of physical pain like overwhelming.

152
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.790
Lauren Kelly: Physical pain like

153
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.780
Lauren Kelly: I've never felt anything like it and

154
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.690
Lauren Kelly: I just

155
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.440
Lauren Kelly: I just

156
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.760
Lauren Kelly: I don't know how to come back from your Rebecca, I really don't know. I just

157
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.460
Lauren Kelly: I

158
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:43.440
Lauren Kelly: I don't think I can. I don't think I'll ever really be the same. First thing as like it just made me realize like how good she just can't trust anyone and maybe people are in this on this earth for you to like

159
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:53.640
Lauren Kelly: Spend a little bit of time with maybe have some fun with. But like definitely don't rely on the new one or trusting whenever because though we let you down and

160
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:05.730
Lauren Kelly: I just have a really different view on people in relationships now than I did before and it definitely on him.

161
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.290
Lauren Kelly: And

162
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:16.710
Lauren Kelly: I just, I don't know how to come back from it. And I mean, again, like there was part to me last night that just like

163
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:24.540
Lauren Kelly: One of my favorite things about you and i is like the way that we sleep at night like you would have never had someone just like

164
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:32.760
Lauren Kelly: Hold me like all night long. The way that he would. And that's been one of the things I've had like where that I've just like laid in bed and just like

165
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:40.290
Lauren Kelly: cried out to God like he's just make this stop hurting because just knowing. I'll never have that, again, I'll never like have that security of like

166
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:49.830
Lauren Kelly: Holding so what an all night and being in their arms all night and like last night, I was just thinking of like how yeah I would give anything to just

167
00:21:50.610 --> 00:22:01.650
Lauren Kelly: Call him and be like, Okay, come over, like you know and have that again and and to know that it's actually an option for me that I could have that back. If I wanted to, like, right now, you know,

168
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:12.750
Lauren Kelly: But then there's the smart girl brain in me that's like, how could you be so stupid, you know,

169
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:26.910
Lauren Kelly: You just wanted to fucking die every second of the day. IT TOOK EVERYTHING IN YOU NOT TO FUCKING GO GET SOME Coker hose and fucking us. Um, I mean,

170
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:37.710
Lauren Kelly: I was reaching out to people. I mean, I reached out to my brother who I haven't talked to in years. I was reaching out to friends, I haven't talked to him forever. I mean, I was trying everything system.

171
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:50.040
Lauren Kelly: Trying to force myself to get out of bed and I could even fucking function. And I said something about that from yesterday and said, You don't know what I just went through all like you have no idea what the fuck I just went through, you know, and

172
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.760
Lauren Kelly: I don't, I don't know how to come back from that and

173
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:04.800
Lauren Kelly: I want to, I want to have what I had. Again, I will. I want. And I know like

174
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:18.330
Lauren Kelly: In the past, when I've gone through stuff we've always come down this way of coming out of things like even stronger and better than we were before as somehow you got the most fucked up shit that happened, we've

175
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:30.900
Lauren Kelly: Somehow come to this better place, but like, you know, when he was leaving that day I asked them, they do you understand what you're doing right now and use it. I understand. I get it. And he was so detached and

176
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:37.500
Lauren Kelly: And and when I was asking him questions he like we don't even answer me that day and I brought that up when they said, you know, how cold.

177
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:43.500
Lauren Kelly: And attached, you were. And when you said you were coming back and you didn't even come back and I waited for fucking hours for you.

178
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:51.150
Lauren Kelly: And he said I had to do that because I had to detach because otherwise I would just fucking lose it. And I just, I had through that.

179
00:23:51.450 --> 00:24:02.100
Lauren Kelly: And I said, you know, fucking cool. That was to me like for everything we've been through for you to just be cold and detach and not even answer my questions and just continually just move your shit out in front of like

180
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:16.530
Lauren Kelly: And and then to just be here, just like you have so many times before, you know, and, and then he brings up. Well, you know, it wasn't that long ago. So remember the last time when I ran and then

181
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.830
Lauren Kelly: That is how I made this huge mistake and I like

182
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:29.640
Lauren Kelly: They actually like showed up at the Danville house and we came back to the apartment and talked and I was like in tears like begging him to come back and understand that I made this huge mistake and

183
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:37.710
Lauren Kelly: And he was telling me you know like how you know he thought that I had heard him for the last time. And then he just can't be keeping hurt by me and then he didn't talk to me for like four days and then

184
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:45.030
Lauren Kelly: It was right before our therapy session that when when he, when he texts me and said, you know, are sent me an email saying, you know, I thought about it and

185
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:52.950
Lauren Kelly: We lets you know stop wasting time ago start our lives together and whatever. And it was that day that we like move back and together and things were great. From that point on,

186
00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:00.720
Lauren Kelly: So you brought that up and said, you know, it wasn't that long ago you were, you were begging me for, you know, another chance. And like, that's all I'm doing it and you were telling me.

187
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.200
Lauren Kelly: That You would show me in your actions and that's all I'm asking for us for

188
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:10.710
Lauren Kelly: You to let me show you in my actions and whatever. And it's like, yeah, we've been we've done this before. You know what I mean. But like I haven't just

189
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.270
Lauren Kelly: Continually done the same thing over and over and over the way he had, you know, a mean and

190
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:24.660
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, it's always been his kids but but who's to say it's not your kids again a little, you know, in a couple months or a year or whatever, you know, and

191
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:39.840
Lauren Kelly: But, in his words, he knows more than ever, and has no doubt in his mind that I'm going to be his wife, and that he loves me more than anything, and he can't, you can't live without me. And he just Miss. Miss read

192
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:49.380
Lauren Kelly: How much you love being out that that he just thought that there was some way you could be away from you when he realizes he can't

193
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.360
Lauren Kelly: Um,

194
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:58.230
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know, somehow we're supposed to talk about this today.

195
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.630
Lauren Kelly: I'm just so ladies. It was just the last thing I was expecting to show up on my doorstep.

196
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know, yeah.

197
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:20.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I know you know right now that your heart is hurt. And I know that

198
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:35.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You want more than anything for this to work out to. I know those two things to be true, Lauren. I know that you are afraid and you have every right to be afraid. Every right i would be afraid if I were in your shoes right now as well.

199
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's nothing wrong with making him work for it.

200
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's nothing wrong with saying this is how I feel. Today, I'm not saying that I'm not, I'm not going to get over it, but I was devastated.

201
00:26:53.310 --> 00:27:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was devastated. I couldn't shower, I couldn't eat. I couldn't take care of the dogs. I could barely get out of bed and I thought I would never see you again.

202
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:15.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there is nothing wrong, you know, with owning your, you know, your feelings and saying, I'm going to work on forgiving you but I think we needed to take it a little bit slow.

203
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:28.500
Lauren Kelly: One day, my mom said when I was talking to her last night. She asked me, you know, where is he right now. And he said he's at the Danville house, you know, in the guest room or whatever. And my mom says will

204
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:37.740
Lauren Kelly: He cannot be in there, you know, while you guys work on things with this, you know, Ron is x and seven. I said, I agree with that. And I said, but what's it but you know and

205
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.930
Lauren Kelly: That was something like that all we talked about when he was here yesterday.

206
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:55.230
Lauren Kelly: You know, when he said, because when he left he had said going back there wasn't an option or whatever. And he said, Lauren. I don't have infinite money and and I did that because he is supporting like this. Full House. Like I don't pay any

207
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.230
Lauren Kelly: Bills here and

208
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.350
Lauren Kelly: So he you know he's got, you know, the $1.5 million house and Danville that

209
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:16.770
Lauren Kelly: He you know help support and then completely supports this household. So for me to also expect him to come up with the money to pay for a hotel every day. Like there's just not infinite money to do with, you know, so

210
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:31.620
Lauren Kelly: So then what do what do I do, you know, because it's either I leave him at the Danville house with his ex wife every day. And there, or I let him come back here. Like, and that puts me in a position

211
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:40.800
Lauren Kelly: Because like my mom, my even my mom was saying. Like, you can't have him over there. If you guys are going to be working on things, you know, but I'm like yeah but

212
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:48.600
Lauren Kelly: I I don't feel like I wouldn't be like okay, get all your stuff and move back in, you know, like

213
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.260
Lauren Kelly: That. So I don't know how I

214
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.000
Lauren Kelly: Do that. I don't know what I do with that.

215
00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I think.

216
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that you should pause

217
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that used to go on your trip.

218
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've been telling you to go this whole time.

219
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A ROAD TRIP definitely helps so much. I think that you should go see your job. Take a couple days just for you.

220
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:28.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Evaluate what you want, evaluate whether or not. Lauren can forgive him and is willing to give us another go.

221
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:37.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, you know, I get the money thing you know that that's got to be a hell of a lot of money to worry about over there and over there and I get that.

222
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:55.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you got to be able to be in a space where you process all of this and get back to the basics and if in your heart and in your head, you can do it, then do it. But you know, I still believe that your focal point needs to be on you.

223
00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:04.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Even if he does come back and even if you guys do get back together. There's got to be a Lauren and a Paul right

224
00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lauren's gotta have Lauren Lauren has got to be working on Lauren Lauren has got to be building, you know, a healthy network of people around her. So the next time. If there ever is a next time. And I'm not saying that there will be. And I'm not saying that there won't be

225
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You are supported.

226
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's all these things that you should be working on for Lauren, not for Lauren Ababa for Lauren right

227
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Putting yourself in your recovery ahead of everything else.

228
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

229
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:50.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now you don't want to hear it. But this is what I'm telling you, I'm not gonna lie idea, and I'm not going to sugarcoat things, you know, it's not going to be easy.

230
00:30:50.460 --> 00:31:01.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you don't take some time for you to figure out this whole piece because you have a gaping wound inside of your heart right now it's gaping. You know what I mean.

231
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And hence why it's behind a wall.

232
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you just went through was utter hell.

233
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And honestly, Lauren, if you think about it, could you really go through that piece again without some kind of a surety that it's not going to happen again.

234
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not fair to you.

235
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:23.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

236
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And bringing out the past, you know, we can bring up the past

237
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:44.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But let's leave the past where the past is the whole simple fact is you can dealing with this since he walked out the door. Last week without getting high. You were doing a clean and sober 100% feeling every not every piece of it.

238
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've done that.

239
00:31:50.640 --> 00:32:02.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not saying don't forgive him. I'm saying, you know what I mean, to really pay attention to where your heart is and identify that you're, you know, you've got this gaping wound that you need to get healed.

240
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: talk with him about about you know about peace.

241
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This was, you know, even the last time that I talked to you and the time before that.

242
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There was no if ands, or buts. He was ever coming back again.

243
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but

244
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:30.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: History will repeat itself, right, especially when he goes back into situation and he sees the problems were there way before he ever left

245
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's not like him being there is going to solve these problems. And again, not talking to the therapist.

246
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:57.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Herself versus getting the information from his ex wife not saying that his ex wife isn't reliable and trustworthy. But in the same sense, you know, be an advocate for his, his kids in therapy with his kids talking to the therapist communicating getting first hand information.

247
00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's all of those things. You know what I mean.

248
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:10.500
Lauren Kelly: I am. You said to something about like without having some kind of like

249
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.170
Lauren Kelly: A shirt like some kind of forget the word to use, but I'm

250
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:31.770
Lauren Kelly: At this one happened again like what, what can I, what, what can you ask for what what i don't i don't when I don't know what there is other than Him, saying, I realized this time, which I've heard before, you know, a mean like what

251
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:43.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, but behaviors tell all and he can say anything that he wants to. But as behaviors are really going to be in for the first couple weeks is going to be great and you know it, I know it.

252
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is like the honeymoon phase that happens, things are great. I

253
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mean, and then there's why he's really good at that. Like, that doesn't tell me anything. Like, I remember one time he said would like the first time all this stuff happened when time he was like

254
00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:04.440
Lauren Kelly: They'll be able to tell them the first 24 hours. And I laughed at them. This dude. You don't think I've had boyfriends be the perfect boyfriend. The whole world for two weeks, a whole month 24 Hour News.

255
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:13.590
Lauren Kelly: To me it means nothing to me two weeks means shit to me it means nothing to me because every guy I've ever been with in my entire life. Even the guys who beat the shit out of me.

256
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:18.990
Lauren Kelly: Could be the most perfect boyfriends in the entire world for the two weeks after they beat the shit out of me.

257
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have advanced

258
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:31.680
Lauren Kelly: ever asked for. They were amazing. They were the most attentive awful considerate men I've ever met in my life. And guess what. All it did was buy me another ship beating. You know what I mean. So

259
00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:40.680
Lauren Kelly: I mean I'm not saying he's going to hurt me like up but like I might just by myself another fucking

260
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:51.390
Lauren Kelly: A heartbreak. Every time I forgive that. Like so. And yeah, he says his actions but like I've seen your actions before and what it comes down to like the first time.

261
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.850
Lauren Kelly: That he did it. He was having conversations behind my back about like going back there and

262
00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:09.210
Lauren Kelly: You know that the kids in him and all that. And this time he again was having conversations behind my back about you know that he wasn't telling me about the therapist and all that. So what he's proved to me is that he manipulates me that he

263
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:17.640
Lauren Kelly: He does shady ship on my back, and he doesn't tell me any doesn't let me in the way a partner should be let in, and you should have been letting me know, hey,

264
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:23.370
Lauren Kelly: This is what I'm hearing every day in therapy. I don't know what to do. We put a bucking talked about this, instead of just the ones who pay

265
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:32.100
Lauren Kelly: I'm moving out today it, which is what he did to other times before like he's proven that he does sneaky shit and and I don't

266
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:49.770
Lauren Kelly: Think I can trust him like he's proven this and and what's to tell me he's not going to do this again like it can be perfect for a month, two months, whatever. But how do I know this all doesn't happen again the next time the therapist is something that he doesn't live, I

267
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Live, what's the

268
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Question, because honestly there's no guarantees and nothing

269
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:05.640
Lauren Kelly: So, what, what can he gives me. What am I looking for when I need

270
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:17.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well security for sure his behaviors it, you know, engage have them engage asked him to engage with the therapist without the ex wife.

271
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Asked him, I mean, he was seeing that there were basis, he still seeing a therapist.

272
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:34.320
Lauren Kelly: Know when things got, like, way better with us. He stopped seeing them because it was all about love our stuff and then we got better. It was he, you know, he's paying like 150 bucks out of pocket like twice a week and

273
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:43.260
Lauren Kelly: And now, both of these kids are in therapy and that's passion every, you know what I mean. So he's doing that.

274
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:53.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So he stopped going to to therapy because it was centered around everything that had to do with you.

275
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:55.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

276
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that

277
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And this again is suggestions. But, you know, engaging in therapy with his children.

278
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:14.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Talking to the therapist firsthand instead of getting information from Isaac secondhand

279
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know processing what he's going to do with the therapist and what's in the best interest of the kids would certainly be better than this back and forth, not just for you. But for them to. It's gotta be hard on them to

280
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:38.010
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, but how do I ever trust what he's actually doing because time and time again he's proven that he does sneaky stuff behind the scenes.

281
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.690
Lauren Kelly: You know,

282
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that's something that

283
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:58.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're gonna have to confront with him and tell him and see you know what the reaction is, and I know the reaction will probably be that he'll bring up your past. But the funny part about it is that you've owned all your house.

284
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're doing everything you can to make it different and better

285
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:09.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, this would have been a, sure, sure, sure, sure sign of

286
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A relapse. You know what I mean. And you as hard as what it is worn as many thoughts as you got in your mind. You did not allow this to when

287
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to know how huge, that is, there's that piece.

288
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I can tell you is that there is no no situation or no person that should ever interfere with your sobriety.

289
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:44.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's your. That's it for you. Right. Yeah.

290
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you think about you think about you, you think about what you want what you need.

291
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go back to the first list that you wrote to him and see how many of those that he's followed through.

292
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.900
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, I don't even know.

293
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where it is

294
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.530
Lauren Kelly: No idea.

295
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.220
Lauren Kelly: I'm

296
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.770
Lauren Kelly: A dress.

297
00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:19.470
Lauren Kelly: This

298
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:34.920
Lauren Kelly: ruin my world so many times. I just don't know. I just, I couldn't even look at him. I my whole body just I felt like nothing like I was in this dream or something. It was just the weirdest like

299
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:47.430
Lauren Kelly: Almost like an out of body thing like it was just like, is this really happening right now. Like, I literally was like, Is this a fucking joke. You're joking right this is a fucking joke because

300
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.170
Lauren Kelly: I couldn't understand how this could be a real conversation.

301
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:55.500
Lauren Kelly: You know you

302
00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.080
Lauren Kelly: You

303
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:09.150
Lauren Kelly: You understood the gravity of your X. You know what 1011 days ago and now things are different. Because what because you went back there and said,

304
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:14.250
Lauren Kelly: I broke up with my girlfriend, so I can focus on you and everybody didn't come. Yeah, everything's perfect now.

305
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:23.550
Lauren Kelly: Which I fucking told you was going to be the case, but in your mind. That's how it was all going to go and it didn't go that way. So now all of a sudden you want to come to add like it just

306
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.970
Lauren Kelly: I don't know, I just

307
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.720
Lauren Kelly: I don't know. I

308
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:39.360
Lauren Kelly: I want to love him. I want let him back in. I want to be happy like that again. But I just feel dead inside. I just

309
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:42.420
Lauren Kelly: I just feel dead.

310
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:51.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you can't change you know when that was been built it takes work to bring it back down. It takes work and time.

311
00:40:51.960 --> 00:41:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To heal that gaping wound that's inside here. It's not something that can just be easily fixed that. You know, because he's walked back you know there's all these other insecurities that that come up, you know,

312
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:10.830
Lauren Kelly: I don't think I'll ever be the same girlfriend or the same like I think if I ever did let him back in, he would be like

313
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.630
Lauren Kelly: A guy I dated it, you know, I don't even think I would look at him as a boyfriend or anything. He would be like

314
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:34.800
Lauren Kelly: Someone I guess I had dinner with and whatever, but like I just don't ever see myself like having a partner in life ever again like I are best friend ever again like that like I

315
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:43.950
Lauren Kelly: Are planning a future ever again, like I just don't think I'm capable of giving in that way again.

316
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.860
Lauren Kelly: To anyone, much less him.

317
00:41:49.110 --> 00:42:08.520
Lauren Kelly: I, I, I just think that part of me is is dead. Like I just, I just realized how much how alone, like I really am in this role in how much I really can't trust anyone, and especially him and I don't

318
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.580
Lauren Kelly: I don't know, like there's, again, there's this pulled, there's this part of me that wants

319
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:20.820
Lauren Kelly: To just crawl in his arms and haven't told me. It's going to be okay and

320
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:28.410
Lauren Kelly: You know I never wanted this in the first place. I didn't want any of this, you know, I didn't want

321
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.310
Lauren Kelly: To be in this apartment alone. I don't want to be

322
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:42.030
Lauren Kelly: Feeling dead inside after days of not eating or sleeping or showering, and I didn't want any of this and

323
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.750
Lauren Kelly: I just

324
00:42:49.020 --> 00:43:03.600
Lauren Kelly: I don't know, it's just this huge head and heart full of just fuck off. And I never want to talk to you again and I love you and come back. You know, like it's I

325
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:06.930
Lauren Kelly: And I don't know.

326
00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:17.580
Lauren Kelly: I'm just so fucking loss like my head's just been spinning, ever since it happened yesterday and like

327
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:26.160
Lauren Kelly: I was just waiting for this call like having that like 230 yesterday and I was just like, oh my god, like I just, I need to talk to her about like I just don't

328
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.750
Lauren Kelly: I just don't know what the fuck to do. I just

329
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think that you're in a place where you shouldn't make any decisions yet.

330
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:54.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've at least, you know what I mean, you've got at least a couple days to be able to breathe process it and get to the finalization of what it is that you you know that you want to do, or that you can do.

331
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.410
Lauren Kelly: Um,

332
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:11.430
Lauren Kelly: I just don't know like what I could possibly ask for from him that would make me feel sick or in any way that

333
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:16.320
Lauren Kelly: And I'm not just opening my life back up to

334
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:23.820
Lauren Kelly: The possibility of this and I get like none of us are promised anything and anything can happen at any time.

335
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:29.850
Lauren Kelly: But there's a difference between that things that are way more probable and like this is way more probable that you've heard

336
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:37.260
Lauren Kelly: This lady's done it before. He's may be spontaneous decision the wall sneaky wall that were that were

337
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:47.220
Lauren Kelly: Follow those bad decisions that were followed by two weeks of him speaking and not telling me what was really going on in conversation to was really having and feeling, he was really having

338
00:44:47.820 --> 00:45:00.780
Lauren Kelly: And instead of thinking them through and deciding you know actually thinking through the fact that he's never been able to fucking go without me with before and that you know he's always come crawling back before and that

339
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:08.640
Lauren Kelly: That, you know, maybe, maybe you should talk to the therapist first. Maybe you should try to go there with them first before he makes this huge decision and breaks my

340
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:17.430
Lauren Kelly: Heart like he's proven that these are things that he's capable of doing and that he's willing to do and that he thinks he can just come back and fix and

341
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:26.460
Lauren Kelly: I, I don't know how to open the door back up and say, Okay, let's see if that doesn't happen again.

342
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:33.180
Lauren Kelly: You know, we try to open my heart back up again like I don't know how to do that.

343
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:39.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right now you don't and that's why I said, you don't have to make any decisions today.

344
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get to take some time for you. You get to breathe a little bit, figure out whether or not you're willing to take the risk again.

345
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

346
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.530
Lauren Kelly: I don't know how to be willing to take that risk.

347
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you feel it, you'll know you'll know

348
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:05.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again, you know, I hate to keep bringing this up like a broken record, but I still think that you should be taking a road trip.

349
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:27.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you need to take a couple days for you for Lauren to get out of the Paul and Lauren, you know, obsession in the head. But really, and the heartache, but really being able to to spend time with your dad say hello to your mom to, you know, just be just be

350
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Read for a minute, even if it's a two to two day trip.

351
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:41.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just something that gets you on the road gets you to be able to breathe some air clear some clear the mind. You know what I mean.

352
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A couple days. You're not asking for a lifetime. You're asking for a couple days for Loren

353
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And Loren, Mr. It's worth it.

354
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 100% obviously because you've got, you know, you think about it.

355
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've just got to get to believing that inside your head inside your heart.

356
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.960
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

357
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:18.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes, giving it to God and just leaving it beaver, a day or do

358
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes that gives us the answers that we're searching for

359
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting out of it, just a little bit.

360
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.630
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

361
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.140
You know,

362
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.790
Lauren Kelly: I just feel paralyzed. I just

363
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.300
Lauren Kelly: You know, I wish just

364
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:54.840
Lauren Kelly: Just starting to engage with the world again yesterday, like actually finally went out and ran a bunch of there's a bunch of stuff like I just I needed dog food. I needed.

365
00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:07.290
Lauren Kelly: You know, I need to go to Target I needed stuff from like an auto part I put like power steering books. My car starts to stick. After all, I need to get our story, good to put in my car. Like there's just a bunch of shit I needed to do.

366
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:20.310
Lauren Kelly: Like a car wash. I went out and did a bunch of stuff yesterday and it's like right when I finally start engaging with the road like that's the day you shows up or she, you know, and

367
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.350
Lauren Kelly: I just

368
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.980
Lauren Kelly: I just feel like it like yesterday before all this happened, I was planning on leaving today after narrow my call.

369
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:40.620
Lauren Kelly: But that of course after all this happened. I didn't sleep like a fucking week, last night, and then I finally slept for like maybe a half hour.

370
00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:51.540
Lauren Kelly: Like nine to 10 or whatever and and then I woke up kind of with like a headache. So now it's like the last thing I want to do is like jump in the car for like four hours right now. I feel like after our call

371
00:48:52.470 --> 00:49:01.170
Lauren Kelly: I'm enough to deal with talking to him for a little bit and then I think I'm just like in need to like take a nap. Take it easy. Today, and really just sleep like 8am tomorrow or something.

372
00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:06.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just gotta get out of here. Look at me. Get out of here.

373
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:15.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you got to take some time to get out of here and to get out of here, just out of your heart, just so that you can breathe.

374
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just so that you can get some clarity on what it is that you really want. And that's how we get that piece is we step outside of it for a few minutes. Right.

375
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:36.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We see it in like, it's like through a mirror or window. We just step away from it for a few minutes.

376
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:46.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's where clarity comes in. That's where you know the answers come from when you dig within and take time for you.

377
00:49:48.960 --> 00:50:00.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't tell you, you know, and I would never tell you, Oh yeah, go take a bath or no, don't you ever take it back because our hearts, you know, might be broken. Again, I can't tell you one way or the other.

378
00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:06.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And because I might tell you the wrong direction for Lauren right i'm not you

379
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But what I can tell you is that you've really got to evaluate

380
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to evaluate this whole thing and do it. If you choose to do it again, do it in a whole different manner, things can be completely different and beast. You can learn how to be secure. You know,

381
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He can provide that

382
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:39.690
Lauren Kelly: Or I know like you can give me an answer of what to do. But I guess I was looking for, like, it is there any possible way that I can do this. And because my heart.

383
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:41.760
Lauren Kelly: Once

384
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:54.240
Lauren Kelly: Once that, you know, I mean, the hardest part of me trying to get over it was knowing like I'd lost like my best friend and like that. I would just have this void in my life of this like

385
00:50:54.810 --> 00:51:04.920
Lauren Kelly: Just happiness. I went to bed with and woke up with every morning and just this east. I always had with him, like I've been in. It was like within the first two weeks of knowing him.

386
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:14.760
Lauren Kelly: I was just driving one day and I was just like, I'm going to marry that man, and I've never felt that we had been in like five year long relationships and I've never felt like I was married when I

387
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:26.250
Lauren Kelly: I I pretty much since the beginning of knowing, Paul, I'd like known in my soul. I was going to marry this man and I can't explain it in words like how I felt that way. But I i've never

388
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:33.720
Lauren Kelly: Felt like I just knew, like the direction of my life like more than I did with him in that

389
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:43.440
Lauren Kelly: Like these 35 years of these like abusive horrible relationships and just shipped life I've been through, like, they get all was worth it because

390
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:52.680
Lauren Kelly: I wasn't going to be like abandoned and alone and like this really made me evaluate like what hurt the worst. And I think it was just being abandoned because I've always been abandoned by like the people

391
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:56.820
Lauren Kelly: That are there is the core

392
00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:02.070
Lauren Kelly: Love me, you know, and I don't think I can take being abandoned again and

393
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:09.840
Lauren Kelly: That's the core root ever feel secure again and I i guess that's what I was looking you for us like

394
00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:16.590
Lauren Kelly: Is there a way I can never do this again. I don't know that I can. I just feel so dead inside.

395
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:26.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that you would be amazed at the things that we can do and you should be pretty amazed with yourself.

396
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Given the fact that you your persevered through it and that you didn't use and that you didn't self harm and that you didn't commit suicide. All the things that you were feeling this past week you did not engage in any of those things.

397
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:49.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You stayed steady and you stayed strong through it all. So,

398
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you'd be amazed about how resilient, we are

399
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.310
Lauren Kelly: I just don't know.

400
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:02.400
Lauren Kelly: What he could do that would

401
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:11.820
Lauren Kelly: Ever make me feel secure or safe with him, you know, and not safe in like a physical sense but like emotionally like like

402
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:22.590
Lauren Kelly: I don't know how I would ever feel like my heart was safe with him. I think that I just feel like if he was ever here. I would just always be looking over my shoulder, the whole time. And I would just never

403
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:36.480
Lauren Kelly: Trust or ever fully let him back it like I just don't feel like I'm the same person I was before. And I don't think I can ever be that girlfriend. I was before or that partner. I was before because I just can't.

404
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:47.460
Lauren Kelly: Trust that anything isn't just temporary and that I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop at all times, you know, and

405
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.170
Lauren Kelly: I don't, I don't know if I'm capable

406
00:53:53.430 --> 00:54:07.290
Lauren Kelly: I know that my heart never wanted this in the first place. So, I will. I would love to fix this. And yeah, you stay in everything that I would have wanted you know like like yesterday I had this dream.

407
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:20.010
Lauren Kelly: Right when I woke up because I knew it was our anniversary. And I also knew I'd gotten the flowers. The night before, so I knew he was trying to make some form of contact, and I had this dream that I woke up to like him waking me up like being here.

408
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:22.200
Lauren Kelly: And in the dream.

409
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:32.280
Lauren Kelly: Because he woke me up my instant response was this huge smile on my face and I was so mad at myself when I woke up from the dream because I knew

410
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:37.260
Lauren Kelly: That that would have been my response. I knew that if he had gotten here as angry.

411
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:44.940
Lauren Kelly: As like I wanted to be. I knew that I would be so happy. You know what I mean. And I whenever I see the time

412
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:59.070
Lauren Kelly: At 1111 I always make a wish and like little kids to the clock. I always I'm super superstitious like that. And yesterday at 1111 I literally said a wish that he stopped by that day and within like two hours. He was there like it and

413
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:09.030
Lauren Kelly: So it's like here, I'm having this dream about him coming by know happy. I would be, and I'm wishing that he would stop by. And then, here he is and and then he does it, and

414
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:16.170
Lauren Kelly: I couldn't even look at him and I just like when this out of I'm shaking. And I'm just like, I just couldn't human

415
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:30.840
Lauren Kelly: Or a million my thoughts and all I could just think of is this has to be a fucking joke like this, this, this has to be a joke. This has to be like funny to somebody like this can't be a real conversation. I'm happy right now because

416
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.050
Lauren Kelly: Like we've been here before, like I

417
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.930
Lauren Kelly: And I just don't

418
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:52.680
Lauren Kelly: I just don't know like what I could ask him, that would be different, other than Him being like, I'll show you my options and I'll be this really good boyfriend. Well guess what, I've had the most abusive people in my life. Be the best boyfriends in the world for weeks, months, whatever.

419
00:55:54.690 --> 00:56:01.440
Lauren Kelly: So what he's a superintendent boyfriend for a while because he's trying really hard, again, to me, I'm still in the back of my head, knowing

420
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:13.890
Lauren Kelly: That this is only because we've all got he fucked up. And that, you know, I just came from the best, you know, a couple months of my life with him to have this happen. So I'm really never state, you know, and

421
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:22.290
Lauren Kelly: And the only way I make sure this doesn't happen to me again, is to not let him ever in again and

422
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:29.610
Lauren Kelly: That's the only way I keep myself safe and I can't like get passed out in my head right now.

423
00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:33.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And right now, you don't have to get past it in your head.

424
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a piece of it. You don't have to get through anything right now.

425
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:42.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

426
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:50.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's this other piece that I kind of want to bring up that if you continue the work that you're doing for Lauren

427
00:56:52.020 --> 00:57:06.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lauren as an individual, not Lauren as part of a couple but Lauren as an individual, when you have new experience life's, you know, ups and downs and catastrophes and chaos and all that crap.

428
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It makes you find security within yourself.

429
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:22.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So security should really be coming from you. First and foremost, so if you're not secure with yourself. It's hard to be secure in any relationship.

430
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so doing some internal security work.

431
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:38.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will help you find the security that you need, because this is what, this is what I know to be true, personally, is that

432
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can love wholeheartedly.

433
00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:45.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can have anybody in my life.

434
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:53.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if they hurt me. I get to choose whether or not they stay a part of my life if I choose to forgive them.

435
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll forgive them wholeheartedly.

436
00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:02.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but I have to feel secure within me. I have to

437
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If I don't feel secure security within myself, then it's hard to find security within anybody else.

438
00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's that piece to think about

439
00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

440
00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:30.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, you're right. You're not the same person that you were a week ago through every heartbreak every trial and tribulation that we face in life we change. Remember, the one thing consistent in life has changed.

441
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:36.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's the God's honest truth, you know, and it's even within us within ourselves.

442
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:44.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With every heartbreak with every situation with every loss with every game we change.

443
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:48.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just up to us to figure out how we want to change.

444
00:58:55.710 --> 00:59:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have a lot to think about or not, think about and put it away for a little bit and breathe.

445
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:04.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just let

446
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:16.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: These emotions, just kind of run its course and see exactly what it is that you feel comfortable doing, you know, but this is what I know, Lauren, working with you.

447
00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:18.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For the time that we have

448
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You are you deserve to give yourself any and all chances that you possibly can.

449
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You deserve to give you

450
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whatever that looks like whatever you're happy looks like.

451
00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You deserve that that

452
00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:39.990
Lauren Kelly: I've never

453
00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:49.650
Lauren Kelly: Been happier, more at peace, wanting to be like the best version of myself. Like, I've never been more of any of those things and

454
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:52.170
Lauren Kelly: When

455
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:53.880
Lauren Kelly: I

456
00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:55.920
Lauren Kelly: I

457
00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:06.480
Lauren Kelly: I felt like worthy and accepted and life loved in understood and in this relationship and

458
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:18.720
Lauren Kelly: I, I don't know. I am I just lost all of that, you know, I just felt so just worthless and just again, like I i didn't

459
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:31.440
Lauren Kelly: Know, as a kid. And this just food for me, you know, it wasn't this wasn't just like a call being like that all of a sudden they felt worthless, for the first time I've always felt a few mirthless like the only thing

460
01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:36.780
Lauren Kelly: That Paul really should did was like it almost convinced me for a while that I was like worthy of

461
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:43.920
Lauren Kelly: Love and and of being you know it for somebody else. The same way he was it for me and

462
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:53.070
Lauren Kelly: And being like valued and somebody actually thinking I mattered it was important that way of the message has been since I was a kid that I wasn't and I don't and

463
01:00:53.550 --> 01:01:10.950
Lauren Kelly: And that like I wasn't ever going to be like a band and like that and and and to all of a sudden, just feel just completely worthless and just completely all alone in this world. Like I just, it just fucking killed me and

464
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:16.050
Lauren Kelly: I don't know that I'm struggling to ever go through that again. I mean,

465
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:28.230
Lauren Kelly: I was literally just like crying out, just like, Please make it stop like I would just lay in bed and just cry and cry and just beg for it to stop and

466
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.300
Lauren Kelly: I

467
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:34.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Today, you don't know

468
01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't mean that you're not going to have clarity with tomorrow or the next day. It just means that that's the place that you're at today.

469
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:53.610
Lauren Kelly: But I, I just, I, I just want to know what I could ask for what what that would be different because the only thing that I can see him saying is

470
01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.920
Lauren Kelly: You know, it'll be my actions and not my words and you just said, let me show you. And whenever and

471
01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:06.210
Lauren Kelly: So cool. Again, you're so then you show up and you're the super nice boyfriend for a while. Like, what does that mean to me because again I

472
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:16.620
Lauren Kelly: Think we just came from the best two months of my fucking life. When this happens, so it's still the message in my head is always going to be, I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop and I don't know how to

473
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.880
Lauren Kelly: Move forward and not feel that way and

474
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:31.680
Lauren Kelly: To actually like let this other person. And again, I don't want that with anyone else but him like, I don't want it. This isn't like, oh, I want to go date other people or anything. I

475
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:43.290
Lauren Kelly: Just almost want to just be alone forever like I just don't. I just don't ever want to let anyone. And I just, I don't know what I'm looking for. What I would need from him to

476
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:50.940
Lauren Kelly: To let him back in, or to lead to on it to be different. I don't know.

477
01:02:53.790 --> 01:03:12.510
Lauren Kelly: What I I could ask for our like what security or what what thing I could say, like, I need you to do this for me or I need that or like I need to see this or I need this to happen, or what, like, I don't know. I don't know what any of those things are. I just

478
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anyone

479
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you won't, because honestly, is there anything that he could do that. Could all of a sudden, if he does it bring back security. No.

480
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:28.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's not

481
01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:42.750
Lauren Kelly: And even it doesn't it doesn't have to be all of a sudden, but like I don't even know what the working things would be okay well as for a month, you go to counseling with your kids. And you and I go to counseling together or something like I don't even know.

482
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would be, because it seems to me the issue of him keep going back is the kid.

483
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:52.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

484
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:57.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know definitely alleviating that piece, you know, is definitely going to help

485
01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In building up the P, you know, the security for you if he's doing the work with the kids and the therapist, you know, he's going in there with them. And you know what I mean, he's trying to work on his relationships with his kids in therapy.

486
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then, and it consistent, you know, trying to do it not listening again to secondhand information, but getting it from the therapist and doing the work that the therapist is asking you know him to do. I can tell you that the therapist would have not told him move back home.

487
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there's no way

488
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:33.330
Yeah.

489
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, um, I can tell you that they, you know, like I can make suggestions to you, but it's up to you to take them and go, and it's up to him to take them and go

490
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

491
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:47.280
What

492
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:57.420
Lauren Kelly: I need some any help any guidance anything like I was talking to my mom and she kept saying, well, you should talk to a therapist about this tomorrow, she will. She'll probably have tools and

493
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:05.790
Lauren Kelly: You know she'll probably know what sort of things you can do. And the only thing my mom suggest is, maybe you and him should do therapy together or something.

494
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.500
Lauren Kelly: But I

495
01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I

496
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:15.450
Lauren Kelly: I need some i'm just i'm still just head spinning. I don't know how to process any of this, like, like you said, like

497
01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:24.840
Lauren Kelly: Up until this point, I thought I was never going to see him again. You know, I was trying to figure out where I was going to move where I was going to live what I was going to do here like

498
01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:33.450
Lauren Kelly: I and then all of a sudden, now it's oh you can have all this fact if you want it you know and and I don't know what to do with that and

499
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and I think that, and these are my suggestions morn. Okay, number one, first off you. One of the things that I would definitely put on the table for him is to engage in therapy sessions with his children to alleviate that that piece of running back and forth.

500
01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:07.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I if I were you. My suggestion would be that I take a road trip and get out of my head and put it aside and ask your higher power for some help and guidance.

501
01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I would continue to do the work on Lauren

502
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:26.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And build up Lauren work on Lauren, you know, be the best version of Lauren that she can possibly be. Despite everybody else in this world and their chaos and they're crazy

503
01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those are the things that I would do.

504
01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: First and foremost,

505
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: First and foremost,

506
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:43.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And give him your truth.

507
01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's another piece, I would definitely you know suggest that you do is give him your truth. Give him the information of how this has affected you

508
01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:02.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you don't believe in for a minute. At this point, that you could ever go through this again. No. If ands, or buts.

509
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And letting him know that and letting him know that you are worth more than

510
01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For him to think that there's a revolving door there.

511
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:15.390
Yeah.

512
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's the God's honest truth.

513
01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:26.370
Lauren Kelly: And I mean, he'll say all the right things. No. See, I know that.

514
01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:37.050
Lauren Kelly: I know that more than ever that I know now, I have no doubt in my mind that we're, you know, I've been very you and your because he knows that those are things that I wanted in and

515
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:44.430
Lauren Kelly: That I wanted with him and he's going to say all of those things. And, you know, I'll never make this mistake again and and

516
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:57.810
Lauren Kelly: You know as much as it sucks that I had to fuck up to really see this, I see it. So clearly, now you know he's been to say all that stuff, but to me it just, I just feel good inside it just it. I hear it.

517
01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:03.600
Lauren Kelly: All splat like I don't have that warm in my heart. We're like the first time that happened.

518
01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:10.140
Lauren Kelly: When he would see these things. It was like, oh my god. Okay. I think he realizes it and like I could really open my heart up and like

519
01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:25.770
Lauren Kelly: Have these emotional conversations like this time it's just like, I hear it, and then it just, it's like an arrow hits me and just falls off. You know, it just, it doesn't like it just falls flat edges. It just doesn't mean and I don't

520
01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know what about what about if you told him that it would be on a trial basis.

521
01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know that you're you've got some work to do within yourself to get to a point of trust.

522
01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that's one of the number one things that we need in a relationship, right, is to is to trust somebody

523
01:08:51.900 --> 01:09:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so he has a lot of work to do around that with all the manipulation that he's done. You've been doing this work. You've been you've been owning your truth and working on that piece consistently through this whole thing.

524
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:19.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The minute that I told you how to do it. It's like bam, you're done. And you've walked that path. So you can't he can't throw that up in your face. Yeah, because you've actually done the work that needs to be done to stay out of that realm of thinking, yeah.

525
01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:21.330
Lauren Kelly: I said that yesterday did

526
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:26.640
Lauren Kelly: You know, did once I did bring up like the past. And I said, Yeah, but when I

527
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:36.330
Lauren Kelly: When I realized what I was doing. Like I did the hard work and and I moved forward and I got a shit together and I have had my shit together. And every time that I wanted to run

528
01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:42.720
Lauren Kelly: And do the things that were comfortable to me or wanted to use. I haven't. And I've stayed and I've done

529
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:56.220
Lauren Kelly: I haven't ran. I haven't used. I've been completely honest about everything, no matter how shitty it is I, you know, I've done the hard work and I've done it over and over again, day in, day out, and

530
01:09:56.550 --> 01:10:14.490
Lauren Kelly: You're the one who led me down, you know, Hope I was here doing the hard work. I was, you know, a couple weeks ago when I wanted to run when all this first came up. I stayed and and not that I made the right decision. And I was so happy that I made that decision that I didn't run and

531
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:21.390
Lauren Kelly: All I did was for long, like what was really going to happen, but at least I made the right decision. You know, and

532
01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now it's time for him to do some hard work.

533
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:28.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's really not the truth of it all.

534
01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:30.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

535
01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:32.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's time for him to do some work to

536
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:38.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: mourn the it's time for you to disprove

537
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get out of the the ruminating get out of it all. Take it out of your brain. Put it aside. Take a nap and just breathe, just be for a few minutes.

538
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:56.010
Yeah.

539
01:10:57.090 --> 01:11:00.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have to know that I am so

540
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 100%

541
01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: happy for you and proud of you, that you didn't that you did not do anything to hurt yourself.

542
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:27.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you stayed steady, even through this whole thing. You could have gotten a new car and ran and and not not looked back and you know what I mean. And you didn't do it. You stayed steady and you stayed strong in your in your position, even through this past week.

543
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:39.720
Lauren Kelly: I was, I was thinking about like when I went to Baker so lines and my mom about why she needed to keep the dogs, you know, so I can go kill myself. I mean, I was making plans like that. You know what I mean, like, just

544
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.140
Lauren Kelly: Oh, Mom. You just need to keep the dogs. I have something going on, you know,

545
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:52.080
Lauren Kelly: With you know I've got this job interview or and I need, I need you to keep the dogs for a while. Just so I knew the doctor stakes and were you know what I mean. So that way I didn't do it.

546
01:11:52.380 --> 01:12:01.410
Lauren Kelly: In the apartment and have the dogs have to be in the apartment with my dead body for a few days before somebody smelled something and figured it out. You know, like I was

547
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:10.080
Lauren Kelly: Those are the kind of thoughts. I was having, you know, and they kind of plans. I was making you know like I just couldn't fucking take the pain anymore and

548
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.140
Lauren Kelly: I just I

549
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:13.890
Just didn't

550
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you didn't

551
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every single time that you and I had a conversation. You are hesitant about a road trip, which tells me that. Yeah, you might have had those thoughts.

552
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You did not act on them did not follow through on them. You knew you had more information than I did because you knew at that time it wasn't a good thing for you to do.

553
01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And therefore, you didn't do it.

554
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you can't beat yourself up with that because there's good that came out of that.

555
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you didn't do it.

556
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:59.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You hear what I'm telling you.

557
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

558
01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:08.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give yourself just just breathe for a little bit.

559
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just breathe for a little bit.

560
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:21.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, take a nap. If you feel like going to your mom's to visit your dad and visit some family and not for any ulterior motives.

561
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:22.140
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

562
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then get in the car and go for a day for a day.

563
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

564
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, agreed, guys.

565
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:38.280
Lauren Kelly: I should do that. I was pretty sure that that when I talked to my, on my site. And I said, I think she said my therapist mentality.

566
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:47.850
Lauren Kelly: To get in the car and go, but I said I you know I wanted to but it's like I couldn't even function have to walk the dogs like packing up the car and getting out the door and do not like I couldn't even do it and

567
01:13:48.210 --> 01:14:03.300
Lauren Kelly: Without shooting. I was sleeping and everything like it wouldn't have been a good idea for me to do that long drive by myself. Anyways, but I said, I'm pretty sure that my therapist is going to suggest that I still, you know, but I wasn't sure if like

568
01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:19.110
Lauren Kelly: Then am I running from my problems and maybe it's better that I stay here and have these hard conversations with them and work these things out and whatever, or what I don't know, I just, I didn't really know

569
01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:23.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What. So you think about this. What I want you to think about

570
01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What we say

571
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In times of anger in times of hurt can never be taken back from the universe. Right.

572
01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:49.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about it in those contexts that TAKING SOME TIME TO BREATHE taking a little bit of time for Lauren to get her head in the right place to figure out some of the things that she wants. Get her head in her heart aligned. Right. There's nothing wrong with that.

573
01:14:51.270 --> 01:15:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's actually giving yourself and giving him consideration before you sit down and have hard conversations that you may say things, you know, or hear things that you'll regret or he'll regret. It's about giving yourself just a little bit of time.

574
01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just a little bit taking that pause, you know, we always want to want to stop and think about our actions, think about what we need to say before we say it.

575
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, because the idea isn't to cause more pain. The idea is to find the resolutions, right.

576
01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:33.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so when you're in a state of emotional state you're in, emotional mind.

577
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:38.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's no rationale that that's going on. It's all over the place.

578
01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:45.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah. When we take when we take scenarios and we put them aside for 24 hours even

579
01:15:47.160 --> 01:16:01.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we don't give ourselves an opportunity to feel about them or to think about them, but to just read, think about other things. Think about your dad. Think about your mom. Think about your cousin, think about other things, just for that moment.

580
01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:06.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you look at it again. You can look at it through a different pair of glasses.

581
01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:12.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you'll know you'll know what you want to do, you'll know what you need to do.

582
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: pretty smart cookie be asked me.

583
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's my suggestions.

584
01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's purely what they are.

585
01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you get to choose whether or not you're going to, you know, do it or not do it either way it's perfectly okay whatever you feel is right for you and you'll know Lauren because you're your best advocate, you just don't even know it.

586
01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:44.580
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

587
01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:46.800
Yeah.

588
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:56.700
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, I think that's just, I don't think today because I just slept so badly last, I think, I think today. I just take a day to

589
01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:06.300
Lauren Kelly: Just try to catch up on some sleep and relax. Just trying to eat and

590
01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. Focus on self care.

591
01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:14.130
Lauren Kelly: And then tomorrow, just for seeing the morning just pack up on. Oh.

592
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the crazy like a few weeks ago, we are having a whole different conversation where you're like, I want to pack my car up and go right now and I'm like, No city.

593
01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now we're. This is

594
01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:27.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Funny because we're those whole different realm. Now,

595
01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:29.730
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

596
01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.480
Lauren Kelly: I wish I could go back to the couple weeks ago, Lauren.

597
01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Listen, Lauren.

598
01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:46.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to know something that you are perfect in this born

599
01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:54.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In every way. You just have eventually I'm hoping we can get you to believe what I see.

600
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have a good heart. You have a great mind you're smart as hell.

601
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:06.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You care about people and you're trying in every way to make your life different

602
01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.170
Lauren Kelly: Try and leave.

603
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.710
Lauren Kelly: Our

604
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:18.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is our good lord. It's the hardest thing to do. It's easy to go right back, it would have been the easiest thing for you to do is to go back and get high.

605
01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That would would have been, you know, the easiest thing to do, but you chose to do the hardest thing.

606
01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you walked through this, we

607
01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Gotta give yourself some credit for that because that's huge.

608
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

609
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:39.870

615
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:17.490

01:39:52.080 --> 01:40:04.830
Quentono W.E. Neal: Cuz, cuz I was on that before. But then again, like, like maybe they had the thyroid gland probably wrong before because I would, I would still feel the same emotions and everything to me.

865
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.070
Quentono W.E. Neal: I would say, yeah, maybe, you know, maybe a different doctor

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That can send you into that depressive state without you even knowing you know what i mean that that's what's going on.

872
01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so, you know, don't take it if you feel that something's a little haywire, pay attention to what your body says

873
01:40:45.120 --> 01:41:00.510

You should be able to feel, you should be able to express you know your feelings, you should be able to cry when you need to cry. You should be able to do those things. And if your, your thyroid is off kilter.

874
01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:11.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then it's hard. You know, it just turns out to be this whole bottle. This whole like ball of of anger and resentment that kind of builds in your chest. You know what I mean.

Quentono W.E. Neal: Do my way though, I want to do it my way. But

901
01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:53.790
Quentono W.E. Neal: At the same time,

902
01:43:55.050 --> 01:44:01.860
Quentono W.E. Neal: I told her that if you have any positive feedback or anything. I'm are to accept it, but anything negative

903
01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:13.590
Quentono W.E. Neal: I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna set that because right now I'm good. I'm on medication. Now I got my life balance down and then I'm gonna go and I know I'm headed and you know i know what God intended it to be, you know,

904
01:44:14.130 --> 01:44:21.630
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, and he wants me to have wanting to help out, you know, maybe it's, you know, wants me to put it on the map for them. So that's how

905
01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:36.090
Quentono W.E. Neal: I see it, but you know what, like you're you, my lady. And my mom like the only ones that know about it. And that's just the start of it a lot. Never know five years down the line.

906
01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:39.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You do the work.

907
01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:44.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. You put everything into it and what you love to do your artwork.

908
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can be out there for others to enjoy to, you know, you have this great potential

909
01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

910
01:44:52.200 --> 01:45:07.740
Quentono W.E. Neal: Mm hmm. And I also got the I also got the sponsor to build on that, you know, got two sponsors right now to build on that. And right now I'm, I'm here. I am actually right now. I'm here at the workshop right now.

911
01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:09.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

912
01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.520
Quentono W.E. Neal: We're, we're making a mask mask.

913
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:21.930
Quentono W.E. Neal: Me going and I gotta get the sewing machine fixed today because I don't know. Do you know about. So when

914
01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:26.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm very naive when it comes to showing

915
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:30.330
Quentono W.E. Neal: Okay. Well, when I run it through.

916
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:35.790
Quentono W.E. Neal: The string on the top and the needle. It goes to nothing.

917
01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:47.250
Quentono W.E. Neal: But it won't catch it won't catch. So I'm thinking the bottom in case something with the case is probably chipped or has holes in it or something because that's why it keeps flipping out, you know, to me,

918
01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:55.830
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, and I looked at it. Those holes in there and it was chips on that Bobby case. So I'm thinking we need a new bottom case in order for it to rotate

919
01:45:55.890 --> 01:45:57.630
Quentono W.E. Neal: Perfectly, you know, without all that

920
01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:10.560
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah. Stuff that damaged it. So that's what I'm thinking, though, but because before it's fine. I got the timing down, everything's all good. But I think that's the only problem is the bobby case.

921
01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that needs to be good to go.

922
01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:21.780
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, the thing won't be here for a couple of weeks, though, but I think I'm gonna work on this today and try to get it to work.

923
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't

924
01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:25.770
