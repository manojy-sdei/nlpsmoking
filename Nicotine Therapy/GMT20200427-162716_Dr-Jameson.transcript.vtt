Dr Jameson: Hi there. Hi.

2
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.900
Dr Jameson: My name is Dr. Jamison, can you hear me OK.

3
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.610
Modoc County: I can hear you just fine. So I'm not on the nurses can be in the room, and this is

4
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.430
Dr Jameson: I know it's weird because I think it looks like your, your screen and your camera to different places.

5
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.370
Dr Jameson: That's okay.

6
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
Dr Jameson: I see that I get that, that's fine. So, um,

7
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:55.500
Dr Jameson: This is the first time I've done a visit like this with, you know, in a facility like this. But anyway, I think it's really neat. So I'm glad glad this is gonna. This is working now. I'm so Edward, if you could just confirm your name and birthdate

8
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.290
Modoc County: Blasco

9
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.590
Modoc County: 87

10
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.590
Dr Jameson: Okay, and you're in California right

11
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.440
Dr Jameson: Okay, and they have already explained to you. I mean, I know you've probably signed consent forms and all that, but you're aware that we're

12
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.320
Dr Jameson: Creating transcripts of these visits. So that means it's recorded at least until the point that they can write everything down you're comfortable with that.

13
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.160
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, okay. So the point of this visit is primarily sort of a medical

14
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.630
Dr Jameson: Overview and sort of sort out what's the

15
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.690
Dr Jameson: I was going to try to sit outside on my back patio. But if it's too noisy. Let me know if I can go back inside. I hear trucks driving by and stuff.

16
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.800
Modoc County: Okay.

17
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.630
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me okay. Yeah. Is it bothering the background noise.

18
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.460
Dr Jameson: No. OK. OK.

19
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:15.180
Dr Jameson: OK, let me know if that changes. And so the point of today's is this visit is to sort of just determine if and what sort of substance use problem. There may be and then just a general medical overview and then decide about treatment options if applicable.

20
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.680
Dr Jameson: And is it primarily mess that you've been struggling with. Is that right, yes.

21
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.990
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'm going to just kind of back up a little bit and ask some basic questions like are you allergic to any medications.

22
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.070
Dr Jameson: And are you prescribing medications.

23
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.500
Dr Jameson: Okay.

24
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.990
Dr Jameson: That's easy.

25
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.310

Dr Jameson: Did you start using that after you stop opiates or

164
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.170
Modoc County: Before

165
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.940
Dr Jameson: Like, how old were you when you started anything

166
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.730
Dr Jameson: And when at one point did you realize it was a problem.

167
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.250
Dr Jameson: Right away, or to take a while or

168
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.460
Modoc County: Just recently is

Dr Jameson: Okay.

172
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.550
Dr Jameson: What other people have said it was a problem before six months ago, do you think, yes.

173
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.880
Dr Jameson: How long ago would you say other people would have decided it would have had that opinion.

174
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:59.130
Dr Jameson: Okay. Has it been interfering with well you graduated high school

175
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.590
Dr Jameson: And then you are working

176
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.260
Dr Jameson: Was an intern, like how what kind of challenges does that present

177
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.790
Modoc County: It was probably my life.

178
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.470
Dr Jameson: Okay, but you've been using it daily. Yeah, pretty much. Since you were 17

Dr Jameson: Okay.

181
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.350
Dr Jameson: All right, so now it's a problem, mainly because of the Custody Situation is that your biggest

182
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.020
Modoc County: Factor.

183
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.410

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.550

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.920
Modoc County: So,

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.730
Dr Jameson: What sort of specialist sorry he

230
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.760
Dr Jameson: Behavior. Okay. Okay. So you do counseling.

231
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.590
Dr Jameson: Good. How long have you been doing that.

232
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.540
Modoc County: For about six months now.

233
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.090
Dr Jameson: And

234
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.410
Dr Jameson: Has been how I mean, I guess.

235
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.080
Dr Jameson: Yeah, good question.

236
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.720
Dr Jameson: But are you finding that

237
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.270
Dr Jameson: helpful or interesting or

238
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.160
Modoc County: Useful. Yes.

239
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.300
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Do you have PTSD.

240
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.540
Dr Jameson: From the accident or from before that.

241
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:35.640
Dr Jameson: You don't, I'm not asking for details. But like little young kid kind of age or teams or

242
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.450
Modoc County: 2006 put those

243
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.020
Modoc County: As pretty hard for you.

244
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.650
Dr Jameson: Oh, gosh.

245
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.300
Dr Jameson: It's terrible. It's horrifying.

246
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:09.000
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I said, you know, not supposed to know how to handle that. That's not supposed to happen.

247
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.190
Dr Jameson: I'm glad that you're

248
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:19.920
Dr Jameson: Glad that you're in counseling. I asked because, well, first of all, I know you had this big accident yourself. But second of all, we have a very high

249
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:37.890
Dr Jameson: Percentage of our patients. I would say that have PTSD from from one thing or another. So it's, it's very, very common. There's a lot of trying to forget or trying not to feel those feelings that people are

250
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.810
You know,

251
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:49.830
Dr Jameson: Right, so, so, so will come, will come back to that, I'm sure. But you know, I think one. I think the counseling is really

252
00:19:51.450 --> 00:20:06.330
Dr Jameson: Probably more important at the end of the day than any medications that we give people to try to help with some symptoms. Because if we're not working on the underlying cause of the problem from all directions. We are going to have a hard time

253
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.480
Dr Jameson: You know,

254
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:18.450
Dr Jameson: Thriving I guess going forward. So I'm glad you're I'm glad you're JC is that weekly. You see the counselor.

255
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:19.110
Yeah.

256
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.310

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.310
Dr Jameson: Other things you think it's important for me to know that I haven't asked you about

307
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.290
Modoc County: No.

308
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.070
Dr Jameson: The zillion questions later. So I guess I okay so I have a couple

309
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:37.110
Dr Jameson: Okay. Well, first of all, did they explain to you how are how our program is is like structured

310
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.400
Modoc County: Yeah.

311
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:50.760
Dr Jameson: So we have weekly meet. We actually have group we with a group based program as well. We do meet weekly groups, I guess you don't have a phone or an iPad or something. That's why you're at the clinic.

312
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.050
Yeah.

313
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.300
Dr Jameson: Okay, and that will be something you'll have access to, once a week.

314
00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.490
Modoc County: Yeah, yeah, what's the

315
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:12.330
Dr Jameson: Secret. Okay. Um, so it doesn't absolutely have to be with me. If the schedule doesn't work, we can find a different group, but my California groups are on Wednesdays typically

316
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.800
Dr Jameson: guess you'd need something that's during office hours.

317
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.060
When they happen.

318
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:32.340
Dr Jameson: Which is fine. My, my two groups. My two groups on Wednesday are at. Hold on, because I have to calculate the time difference. I just wanna make sure I say Reich's I mess it up all the time 10:30am and noon.

319
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:43.200
Dr Jameson: I do have groups on Tuesdays as well. And then we have plenty of other doctors, if you're there. What day did you just say you're there Monday.

320
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.700
Modoc County: Oh, yes.

321
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:45.480
Okay.

322
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:55.680
Dr Jameson: So we can also, if, if, if that's what you were hoping for. We can probably find a Monday group for you to

323
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:06.630
Dr Jameson: It's basically what's most most convenient, but will be easiest for you to be able to attend really, you know, can consistently.

324
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.380
Dr Jameson: I'm so

325
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.970
Dr Jameson: Is there a certain time of day that's best and

326
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:27.750
Modoc County: No one will yeah for you guys for us to yeah for Monday's it'll be fine from like nine to like 11 to 12. It just depends. Um,

327
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:41.940
Modoc County: What we only do it on Mondays and we do it here only like to wear the veil, we really get the patient to come in or the doctors, the patient to come and then we'll move things around and try to see if we can get them face to face.

328
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:51.480
Modoc County: But so far with the program was only having so many people. We just started on Monday, so far.

329
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.360
Dr Jameson: Okay. And do you have other patients that are already

330
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.930
Dr Jameson: Attending a group with us on Mondays.

331
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:04.080
Modoc County: They are seeing a doctor on Mondays groups and things like that they have

332
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.680
Modoc County: Okay, yeah, kind of like individually.

333
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:10.920
Modoc County: Groups.

334
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, I guess the coronavirus does present a little bit of a

335
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:23.400
Dr Jameson: Question mark. But in general, like this would be interesting. You know where I worked before we did you know we all sat in a room. When did a group

336
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:37.800
Dr Jameson: And normally it is and then we then we moved to the zoom thing. But if if there was a way to have a group in your facility that was, you know, all of you guys there and just the doctor and the counselor on the on the video. I guess that's probably

337
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.800
Modoc County: Good ideas were yeah

338
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.840
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'll have to find out. Sometimes I feel like I'm the last

339
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:52.650
Dr Jameson: I'll find out what the, what the plan is. But for now, so it sounds like will be it'll be a Monday of some sort.

340
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:59.940
Dr Jameson: And you come every week and. That's a twofer. So there's the counselor that runs the meeting and you talk about recovery skills and relapse prevention and

341
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:11.130
Dr Jameson: Whatever else is going on that you need to talk about. Sometimes it's how we're all handling the coronavirus quarantine or, you know, just whatever the holiday that's coming up or something and then

342
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:28.950
Dr Jameson: The doctors there too. So if you're on a prescription. Many of our patients are opiate patients, but not all. But anyway, so if there's a medication involved. We will will do the refill at the same time. So it's like two, two and one. Basically, and then we do

343
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:37.380
Dr Jameson: Include counseling in the program, although that can be done locally. It doesn't have to be with one of our counselors necessarily

344
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:50.250
Dr Jameson: We do need you to meet with one of our counselors at least once, and then every so often for touch bases. If you're seeing a local counselor, we call it a bio psychosocial evaluation.

345
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:51.720
Modoc County: Because, for sure.

346
00:28:53.010 --> 00:29:03.630
Dr Jameson: So that would happen regardless. But then if you're in involved in your establish with a counselor, I think, unless there's a compelling reason to change. I wouldn't necessarily

347
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.520
Dr Jameson: Suggest that we disrupt you know what you've already got

348
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.210
Set up

349
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:10.890
Modoc County: Here.

350
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.460
Yeah.

351
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:13.650
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

352
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.280
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

353
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.920
Dr Jameson: Usually, once you've established that relationship. It's

354
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.330
Dr Jameson: Best to leave it, let it, let it do it, let it continue it's it's it's self.

355
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.930
Dr Jameson: And then there's initial lab work that they talk to you about that. Yeah.

356
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.410
Dr Jameson: Well, we generally do some blood work and urine.

357
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.820
Dr Jameson: As an initial screen and and then we check for which, if you've had labs recently that

358
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:58.830
Dr Jameson: Are all the things that we would need, then we can just get copies of the labs. It doesn't have to be a whole new lab draw. If you have me test.

359
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:10.530
Dr Jameson: HIV, hepatitis, you know, some of the things we worry about with people that inject and then some other basic you know chemistries, and blood counts and stuff like that. And then I get her in drug screen.

360
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.880
Dr Jameson: So do you think you've had labs recently.

361
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.170
Yeah.

362
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.800
Modoc County: Yeah, just over

363
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.460
Dr Jameson: Perfect.

364
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:30.510
Dr Jameson: That works great. Yeah, good. So we can just get copies of that and make sure I'm sure it probably is pretty complete but if there's anything missing, then we can always just add the

365
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.240
Dr Jameson: Get the missing piece that I think that's probably fine.

366
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.740
Dr Jameson: And then

367
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:49.680
Dr Jameson: After that, um, this is different. Again, because you have this facility there that I guess can do some testing for us. Normally we mail people a urine cup every month that they do at home, but maybe we're doing something different.

368
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.650
Modoc County: Maybe we're not really

369
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.570
Modoc County: Here and then we pass over the results to you. Great.

370
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.120
Dr Jameson: That's perfect handy.

371
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:08.010
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's kind of the general structure. We usually start out, we have to talk about whether medication is going to be

372
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:19.950
Dr Jameson: Part of your, your program or not. But if you are on medication. We start out with pretty short once at one a week one week for medicine and then as time goes on, we sort of gradually

373
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.940
Dr Jameson: You earn your longer prescription

374
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.830
Dr Jameson: Do they do you have a firm in in house pharmacy there or

375
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.330
Modoc County: Do you have to pharmacies in our small town either writing or less.

376
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.580
Dr Jameson: Okay.

377
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.500
Modoc County: Ready. Okay.

378
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.040
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um,

379
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:48.900
Dr Jameson: There's, there is a medication, which is so it's sort of a surprising.

380
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.490
Dr Jameson: Surprising but there's a drug called REM Iran or mortality.

381
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.020
Dr Jameson: Which

382
00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:10.230
Dr Jameson: It's actually, it's weird. It's an antidepressant. I don't think it's a very good anti depressant, but it is technically in any depressant. Most of the time it's used these days to help people sleep that it's dating. So we haven't had people taking it at bedtime.

383
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:25.080
Dr Jameson: I don't know who figured it out. But somehow I think accidentally it was discovered that it seems to help decrease method methamphetamine use and people that struggle so

384
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:27.900
Dr Jameson: That is an option.

385
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:39.870
Dr Jameson: Some people actually find the Suboxone helps with methamphetamine cravings as well, which is the drug that we typically use for opiate dependence.

386
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.400
Modoc County: Right. Why

387
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.920
Modoc County: Not to not to interrupt, but

388
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.490
Dr Jameson: No, no.

389
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.150
Yeah.

390
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:47.430
Modoc County: He was

391
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.810
Modoc County: If he needs to pray for somebody

392
00:32:52.950 --> 00:33:00.600
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I mean it sounds like you do. You did also have a physical dependence on opiates at one time and that's

393
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:11.370
Dr Jameson: Not something that goes away. Really, as you probably know, I mean, if you were to start taking opiates. Now you would likely get right back to where you had been

394
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:21.270
Dr Jameson: So, you, you, you probably meet criteria. Just, just by the fact that you had had to go through withdrawal from opiates before

395
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:29.190
Dr Jameson: I mean, ended up that unless you're are you if unless you tell me you're having cravings for opiates. I wouldn't necessarily suggest

396
00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:45.360
Dr Jameson: It's sort of, it's an optional thing but it wouldn't necessarily be necessary for the opioid piece. But as far as meth methamphetamine goes meet that we do sometimes see that it helps, at least in some degree.

397
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:52.680
Dr Jameson: So is that something you were, well, how much do you know about Suboxone. Are you familiar with it. What do you

398
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.090
Modoc County: Really, really.

399
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.350
Modoc County: Really research and stuff like that so

400
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:00.660
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

401
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.570
Modoc County: I take it before on the street.

402
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.080
Mm hmm.

403
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.560
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you didn't have any side effects.

404
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:20.490
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, okay. So in this case, if since you're not currently using opiates and then you go to, I don't know what this red spot on my face is by the way. Sorry, I'm

405
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:24.240
Dr Jameson: Looking at myself in the camera like over

406
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.280
Dr Jameson: You would be someone that I would worry a little bit about developing like constipation and some of the side effects that

407
00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:41.790
Dr Jameson: Normally people that are already on opiates, they kind of are already have all that stuff. And when we just move you from whatever you're taking to the Suboxone it's like not really a different difference

408
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:53.490
Dr Jameson: But if you haven't been taking any and now you add that we would, you know, we do need to watch for, like, constipation, dry mouth sedation, not so much the nation, but

409
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.990
Dr Jameson: The patient anyone

410
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:55.680
Modoc County: At all.

411
00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:06.990
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so, and I would probably also start a lower dose than we would, you know, ordinarily, when we're pulling somebody from heroin. You know, we start relatively higher

412
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:16.350
Dr Jameson: What so I don't repeat things you already know. What do you know about how it works. I don't want to bore

413
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:25.320
Modoc County: This watching this puts in place where the pain receptors are

414
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.980
Modoc County: I mean, I'm pretty educated on it, really.

415
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:29.430
Yeah.

416
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.320
Dr Jameson: Research is okay. Well, no. That's why I asked, because I don't want it.

417
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.200
Modoc County: You started reading it for

418
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.170
Modoc County: For the message, you know,

419
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:53.940
Modoc County: You know, stop my current user or, you know, make and the way we were talking about it is you know if I have a craving and just take a little bit of that. And, you know, see where we're at, you know,

420
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.370
Modoc County: Small, like you said,

421
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:04.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah. The other way that I could see it helping you is that it actually has an anti it as an analgesic meaning of pain.

422
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.130
Yeah.

423
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.430
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

424
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:17.700
Dr Jameson: I'm not necessarily sure I'd recommend you do it. Just here and there. Like, I think if we did it. We want to get it into as like a steady state in your body, more or less.

425
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.970
Dr Jameson: So that we kind of stabilize things as much as we can.

426
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:35.040
Dr Jameson: Obviously pain is not necessarily a steady state issue, right. So I realized, but but I think that's probably a better way to use it. Then, then we don't usually have people just taking in here and just taking it.

427
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:45.330
Dr Jameson: It is an interesting. There is an interesting phenomenon with with this drug which I, I, I still haven't

428
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.470
Dr Jameson: Thought of any other drug that I know of that really works this way but

429
00:36:50.100 --> 00:37:04.920
Dr Jameson: Normally it's we know it's a very long acting drug which is good because it kind of gets in the system and then it it takes a gradually much long, you know, sort of a slower point to which you would start developing withdrawal symptoms.

430
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:16.410
Dr Jameson: Most of our patients don't feel comfortable just taking it once a day because I think they're used to, you know, repeatedly dosing themselves once a day just seems like

431
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.970
Dr Jameson: Not enough so most of our patients, which is, it doesn't really matter. Most of our patients split the dose at least twice a day.

432
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.040
Dr Jameson: There's a funny.

433
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:41.790
Dr Jameson: Little thing about the medication for when you're using it for pain. It actually works better if you do break it into more frequent doses flip throughout the day. So

434
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:53.280
Dr Jameson: Even if you're taking a total of four milligrams a day, which would be a low dose. So normally would have. You didn't even say take two and two. To start, I don't know. I'm just making, making up numbers, but something relatively low

435
00:37:53.970 --> 00:38:12.390
Dr Jameson: For pain. It might, you might give better pain relief. If you took one milligram four times a day instead of two and two or four all at once. So for that reason, we might have you space it into smaller more frequent doses to see if you can get your pain, a little bit better.

436
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:24.720
Dr Jameson: I think it's important to mention that you would be calm physically dependent on this. If you were to add it right so right now.

437
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:37.650
Dr Jameson: You you had an opiate dependency at one time. You haven't taken any recently, but once we start you on it, then you'd have to taper off of it again and have withdrawal symptoms. So I that is an important

438
00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:51.870
Dr Jameson: Factor. I think there are there are other like gabapentin Lyrica and other ways we could you know potentially start as far as pain goes if we were if that is a concern of yours.

439
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.890
Dr Jameson: So I do, I do just want to kind of throw that out there.

440
00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.190
Dr Jameson: What do you think about that.

441
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.120
Yeah.

442
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.340
Modoc County: Yeah.

443
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:14.580
Modoc County: So, I mean, yeah, I'm good with it. You know, I'm just going to try and see where we're at, you know,

444
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:15.870
Modoc County: With

445
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.080
Dr Jameson: With with the Gabba pensioner with Suboxone

446
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.960
Modoc County: You're

447
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:34.560
Dr Jameson: Okay. I mean, I'm okay. I'm okay with it too. But I do want to just, you know, sometimes people are upset when they realize now they're addicted to or dependent on the Suboxone so i don't i didn't want to not

448
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.480
Dr Jameson: mention it.

449
00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.990
Dr Jameson: But as long as you're okay with that concept then I'm okay. I'm okay with it, too. I just want to

450
00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:44.820
Dr Jameson: Okay.

451
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:54.360
Dr Jameson: Um, and just because you're on Suboxone doesn't mean you couldn't also take gabapentin Lyrica or Cymbalta or something else. So it's not like it has to be one or the other.

452
00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:04.230
Dr Jameson: And we could also we get started with the box. We'll see how it's going. But if you know depending on how it is. We could also add the restaurant because they're totally different types of drugs, they

453
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:09.300
Dr Jameson: Work different ways and different chemical, you know, different receptors and everything so

454
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.790
Dr Jameson: I don't really in general like starting multiple things at once if we don't have to because it

455
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.330
Modoc County: Just gets

456
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:23.160
Dr Jameson: Confusing and messy. What's causing what but just to keep that in the back of your mind, that's also something we could come back to

457
00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:26.670
Dr Jameson: When you

458
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:33.390
Dr Jameson: Took it before. Was it the film or the tablet and you know if it was Suboxone or sub you text.

459
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:36.600
Mm hmm.

460
00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.310
Dr Jameson: You know if it was Suboxone or some new text.

461
00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.560
Dr Jameson: Box. Okay. All right.

462
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.450
Dr Jameson: Um,

463
00:40:46.530 --> 00:41:01.290
Dr Jameson: And then again, just to be clear, which you probably know if you've done your, your research, which it sounds like you have the spot the difference between those two, which you probably know is that the Suboxone has some some some new text plus naloxone to make Suboxone

464
00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.870
Dr Jameson: The naloxone is Narcan

465
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:13.620
Dr Jameson: Which is there really is a passenger like if it's taken the way it's designed and it dissolves under your tongue and gets absorbed through your

466
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:21.840
Dr Jameson: mucosal membrane there no oxygen is not really absorbed that way very well at all. So most of it just passes right through you.

467
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:36.810
Dr Jameson: The reason it's there is because some people get creative with what the way they want to ingest this stuff. And if it is melted and shot or crushed, and snorted. If it's a tablet, then you get your no locks on our can and then

468
00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:41.220
Dr Jameson: You know you don't feel so good. So it's more of a deterrent for

469
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:57.240
Dr Jameson: Misuse then necessarily part of the treatment and sometimes people think they're getting our can or that the Narcan is the blocker and it's not. It's the buprenorphine which is the the opiate the main ingredient in there. That's what's doing the blocking

470
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.000
Dr Jameson: Just, just so you know.

471
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.620
Dr Jameson: And in your case, it is not really relevant, but you

472
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:10.710
Dr Jameson: I just think it's important. Everybody knows that if you were to take this

473
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:23.850
Dr Jameson: If someone who had been using opiates recently like today or last night were to take a dose of Suboxone without waiting until they were already feeling sick, you know about this part if it will make you sick. If you take it too soon.

474
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.150
Dr Jameson: Have you heard about that. No.

475
00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:29.460
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right.

476
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:41.340
Dr Jameson: I am not in any way endorsing you ever sharing your medicine with anybody at all. But I just think it's important that everybody knows all of this stuff just

477
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.830
Dr Jameson: Just so you know.

478
00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:53.160
Dr Jameson: Um, okay. So what I would have you gotten any other appointment scheduled yet or not yet.

479
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.800
Dr Jameson: No. Okay, so

480
00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:04.350
Dr Jameson: We like to get the bio psychosocial scheduled as early as soon as possible. It sounds like a Monday is going to be the best day for you.

481
00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.650
Dr Jameson: So maybe they can set that up for next Monday.

482
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:16.830
Dr Jameson: And then I need to get back to you with specifics on when unless you already know what time the group there is meeting and can tell me I don't

483
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.380
Know we don't we use. OK.

484
00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:21.030
Modoc County: OK.

485
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.480
Dr Jameson: OK. OK.

486
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.950
Dr Jameson: So we'll figure out what the plan is on that and then

487
00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.170
Dr Jameson: What I can do is send the initial prescription

488
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:38.760
Dr Jameson: We generally do

489
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:50.310
Dr Jameson: No more than a week. But sometimes we do shorter supplies to ensure that like appointments get scheduled and what, in your case, you don't need to get your labs done per se.

490
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.730
Dr Jameson: Other than when's the last time you did a drug screen.

491
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.200
Modoc County: Here. No, it doesn't need to be that'd be done today. Yeah.

492
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:12.600
Dr Jameson: Okay. Yeah. Maybe we'll do that. Do your crops test for well today, it won't matter because you haven't started it yet, but do your, your tests include buprenorphine, I assume. Yeah, I'm sure somebody already question.

493
00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.210
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

494
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:24.810
Dr Jameson: I'm just a bit i guess i guess i'll send the script. First of all, I gotta run you through the cure system. Hold on.

495
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:33.900
Dr Jameson: I don't know if you know what that is, but it's a database to make sure you're not getting medicine from two different doctors or

496
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:35.730
Modoc County: Something

497
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.970
Dr Jameson: But they require that we check, everybody. And then we run it every month.

498
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.390
Dr Jameson: A lot harder than it used to be people to

499
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:51.990
Dr Jameson: Do funny business.

500
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.290
Dr Jameson: I still live in New Hampshire and

501
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:07.290
Dr Jameson: Right on the, you know, there's a section of New Hampshire where main is right here in Massachusetts is right. You like within 15 miles and nice direction.

502
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.680
Dr Jameson: And oh, this would be a big problem.

503
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.610
Dr Jameson: But now nowadays.

504
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:20.340
Dr Jameson: Okay.

505
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.470
Dr Jameson: 838 87 right

506
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.440
Dr Jameson: The other thing I would

507
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:52.080
Dr Jameson: Add when the last go to 87. Yeah. You don't even come up. So I guess that means you haven't had any controlled substances in a while.

508
00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.780
Modoc County: Yeah yeah

509
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.710
Dr Jameson: Save search for June my list.

510
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:04.080
Dr Jameson: Well, maybe it will be a different doctor. But anyway, I'll put you in for now.

511
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:06.390
Dr Jameson: Um,

512
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:17.550
Dr Jameson: Gosh, I lost my train of thought, oh, oh, PTSD, we have. Do you know if you have anyone there that does em, Dr.

513
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:25.950
Modoc County: It was suggested to one of our clients but they haven't really followed through with it and get more information or anything.

514
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:28.530
Dr Jameson: From us or

515
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.630
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah, okay, because we have a we have accounts are now that

516
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:40.080
Dr Jameson: performs the, the, you know, provides the therapy. The procedure or whatever you want to call it.

517
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:48.240
Dr Jameson: But it's, it's something that sometimes there are local people that can do too. So I just wanted to throw that out there too. I, I think.

518
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:58.890
Dr Jameson: Not instantly, but it might be something to consider. At some point in this in this process for you. Do you know what I'm talking about at all or no idea. Okay.

519
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.950
Dr Jameson: Fair enough. It's, it's

520
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.170
Dr Jameson: It sounds totally wonky. Like, I don't

521
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.030
Dr Jameson: I get it there. You'd be like, okay, but

522
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.510
Dr Jameson: It's a, it's a technique which

523
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:20.670
Dr Jameson: Mimics your REM sleep, you know, the rapid eye movement.

524
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:42.660
Dr Jameson: And you're awake, though, but they use certain sequence and moving your eyes back and forth. And the purpose of it what what it's meant and what it's meant to do is help get them the memories that are associated with the trauma that you've had in your life and kind of trigger usually

525
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.250
Dr Jameson: Kind of the definition of PTSD triggers strong emotional sensations or etc.

526
00:47:51.390 --> 00:48:00.660
Dr Jameson: The theory is that the memory kind of got stuck because it was so traumatic your being was never able to process it and like file it into the memory been

527
00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:16.890
Dr Jameson: With all the other memories from when you know, years ago and it's like, stuck in the central area of your brain and it continues to kind of fester and create discomfort. Anyway, it's a way of like put moving it into the helping your brain actually like

528
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:27.300
Dr Jameson: Properly file it away. So it's not erasing the memory, but it's take it's taking away the emotional. Yeah.

529
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.320
Dr Jameson: I'm torn up sort of torment that that it's currently associated with

530
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:40.890
Dr Jameson: I first heard about it from a nurse that I worked with in an urgent care and the and the x ray tech. We were sitting around one day, years ago.

531
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:49.080
Dr Jameson: And they, I don't know how it came up, but somehow it came up and they turned out they both undergone it because they both witnessed traumatic things

532
00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:58.890
Dr Jameson: In their lives and worked beautifully for both and they were the ones that first explain how kind of how it works. Anyway, and I've been sort of curious, but I was still thought

533
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:17.070
Dr Jameson: Okay. And then I've, you know, the more I've been working in this area, and I've met the Serena is her name of the therapist that works for us who does this and she explained it again. She actually also was a patient before she was a therapist about it. So she experienced it from the

534
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:25.260
Dr Jameson: You know the other side first, and was so passionate because it works so well for her that she looked you later got trained to do it herself so

535
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:36.900
Dr Jameson: It's definitely sounds like it's worth a try. I don't think there's a lot of risk to her town side, you do need to be in a mental place where you're, you know, able to even

536
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:49.620
Dr Jameson: Raise the memories to talk about them. But, and so that's something that, you know, might be to discuss with your counselor before we embarked on it but just to throw it out there as an option because I think it's

537
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:55.470
Dr Jameson: It's pretty it's pretty incredible. When it works really well, which it seems to do so.

538
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.340
Dr Jameson: Just to throw that into the mix, too.

539
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.580
Dr Jameson: Okay, so let me send a prescription

540
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:13.770
Dr Jameson: I would recommend we start pretty low on the dose. I mean, our goal is maybe

541
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:28.590
Dr Jameson: You know, to sort of try to deal with pain control a little bit and then at the same time, observe whether you do or don't notice any change in the amount of cravings that you have for mass

542
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.470
Dr Jameson: I kind of in a way I sort of hate this question, but

543
00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:41.640
Dr Jameson: Do you have, I'm sure it's been asked you before, like how do you rate your pain late usually lately.

544
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.830
Modoc County: An everyday scale, I would say probably six

545
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:48.240
Dr Jameson: Okay.

546
00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:56.760
Modoc County: My name is not always yet. So, I mean, that's the biggest problem and flip

547
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.960
Modoc County: Every day when I wake up.

548
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.720
Modoc County: Soon as I hit my feet hurt.

549
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.620
Okay.

550
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:07.650
Modoc County: So,

551
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.750
Dr Jameson: Uh huh. So

552
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:15.810
Dr Jameson: Obviously comes in. I mean, it's never going to be completely flat, but so six is kind of the baseline and then you have

553
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:19.620
Modoc County: You know, no, no matter what.

554
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.800
Dr Jameson: So we have something to compare with us. I went to

555
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:34.320
Dr Jameson: Where, where we're starting. Okay, so, um, the film was okay. You didn't have a problem. Some people don't like the taste.

556
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.050
Dr Jameson: It comes in a tablet to

557
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:39.570
Modoc County: Yes. Okay.

558
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.890
Dr Jameson: And then you

559
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.020
Dr Jameson: Some of the

560
00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:47.520
Dr Jameson: Maybe I'm sorry, I should have asked you what what is your name.

561
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.100
Modoc County: My name is Maya.

562
00:51:50.760 --> 00:52:04.620
Dr Jameson: Hi. Sorry. No, sir. Do you happen to know if some of the California I think it's maybe this medical they they they prefer the Suboxone brand. Do you know if that's

563
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:06.900
Modoc County: Oh,

564
00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:08.670
Dr Jameson: If you don't know, it's okay.

565
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.430
Modoc County: If they want the training or just the generic name.

566
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:16.380
Dr Jameson: I've never

567
00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.180
Dr Jameson: It's the weirdest thing. There's

568
00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.630
Dr Jameson: Medical I believe they

569
00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:28.440
Dr Jameson: Won't let us right substitution of okay like we have to say brand name only. Weird.

570
00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:39.510
Dr Jameson: Backwards. To me, but anyway. Alright, well I'll write it kind of normal first because I'm not sure which which plan if beacon is the same as the other. I don't know.

571
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:47.580
Dr Jameson: And if they need us to change it. I will change it, but I think I'm going to start with the two milligrams flashpoint five films.

572
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.740
Dr Jameson: And

573
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:53.490
Dr Jameson: I

574
00:52:54.810 --> 00:53:01.110
Dr Jameson: Well, we could. You could start by taking it one in the morning and one at night and then

575
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:13.440
Dr Jameson: Or we can have you take a half, four times a day. I don't, I don't feel strongly one way or the other. I guess I think it'll work better for pain if you like I was saying earlier, if you put it into small into half's

576
00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:14.340
Modoc County: Okay.

577
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.200
Dr Jameson: If that's okay with you.

578
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.890
Dr Jameson: And then we have to assess and see

579
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:27.450
Dr Jameson: A first of all that it doesn't bother you, now that you aren't taking opiates every day. Otherwise, and

580
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.650
Dr Jameson: Be how it does with pain.

581
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:33.660
Dr Jameson: At least to start

582
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:46.050
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'm gonna send a week supply because presumably your group is going to happen. Monday.

583
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:59.220
Dr Jameson: We have well I normally offer a recheck kind of so many days in to see how it's going. I don't know if you would even be able to

584
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:06.330
Dr Jameson: Have half get in to do a visit say Friday or Thursday.

585
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.480
Modoc County: Friday we're close.

586
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.040
Dr Jameson: Okay, so not Friday.

587
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:11.910
Dr Jameson: Fair enough.

588
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.060
Modoc County: Elements and not only nurse so far.

589
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:17.520
Dr Jameson: Okay.

590
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:25.440
Dr Jameson: All right, and you don't you don't. I'm just confirming, you don't have a phone or a smartphone yourself right

591
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:31.080
Modoc County: Well, my girlfriend, she hurt her. Okay.

592
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.410
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, it's

593
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:44.250
Dr Jameson: I'm not trying to rock the boat. But yeah, I mean if we do have other patients you borrow somebody else's phone and you know you wear headphones and you go in a private place but

594
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.430
Dr Jameson: Technically, it doesn't have to necessarily be your personal phone

595
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.340
Modoc County: Rarely here.

596
00:54:53.400 --> 00:55:05.190
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so it's it's just an option, just because it's a whole weekend we're, we're also, you know, it's, we're tinkering, you were starting out, we're testing the dose and and sort of tight trading because I

597
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:13.350
Dr Jameson: If it doesn't, if you don't know as a single thing you might want to have a follow up between now and then to talk about changing the dose.

598
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:21.840
Modoc County: Would be good, we'll just try Monday and we will discuss

599
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:26.610
Modoc County: A good minute to figure it out.

600
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:32.700
Dr Jameson: Sure, yeah, I'm okay with that too. I just, I guess. Yeah, if you're having an issue. You can always

601
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.090
Dr Jameson: call in and and we can try to

602
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:41.220
Dr Jameson: Walk you through downloading zoom on your girlfriend's my fiance's phone and

603
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:44.640
Modoc County: Your shoes. Well,

604
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:46.170
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

605
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:50.850
Dr Jameson: Because it's not just the phone. It's having internet

606
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:52.680
Dr Jameson: That

607
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:55.440
Dr Jameson: That works reliably. So that can be heard.

608
00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:03.870
Modoc County: As well as we all know, our people like living things that are in town of our town, our town, they don't

609
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:07.530
Dr Jameson: You know, we have

610
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.980
Dr Jameson: A lot of patients that have, you know, well,

611
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:13.650
Dr Jameson: Claimed to have inconsistent.

612
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:19.800
Dr Jameson: Internet. I don't, you know, you never know, but it is nice to have this kind of hardwired

613
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:27.480
Dr Jameson: option here. So what, uh, let's see. It's a Rite Aid. Is that what you had said.

614
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:34.860
Dr Jameson: All right, let me see if it comes up. Is it north Main Street, and I'll tourists.

615
00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:35.670
Yes.

616
00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:37.410
Dr Jameson: Okay.

617
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:55.320
Dr Jameson: So I'm going to send it's gonna be, let me just make sure I'm doing it. It'll be a total of two a day but you're going to break them in half and split them throughout the day, but it'll still be 14 for the seven day supply just double checking myself.

618
00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:00.090
Dr Jameson: To get my special code.

619
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:14.850
Dr Jameson: So there can be some delays. It's a pharmacy. So sometimes they don't have especially this to milligram doses, less commonly used in the eight or more often use sometimes they have to order it.

620
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:26.580
Dr Jameson: Sometimes there's a prior off often there's a prior off. Let's be honest. So, which is a form that we fill out and get back to them. So I would just

621
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:35.610
Dr Jameson: Call the pharmacy in the next hour to a confirm they received the electronic prescription, which I just sent and then

622
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:45.000
Dr Jameson: Any idea when it might be ready and then that's when they. Oh, we have to order it or you need a private like you get a little bit of feedback about what what the situation is.

623
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:47.550
Major

624
00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.070
Dr Jameson: Say, Dan.

625
00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:52.590
Modoc County: I said I can be the one to major at

626
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:53.880
All and you go, okay.

627
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:03.390
Modoc County: When we're done with it. So I just wanted to make sure

628
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:13.890
Dr Jameson: She. Yeah. And then, if I may, for the prior off automatically if it needs one and we have a staff member that fills them out and send it back. So it's not

629
00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:22.080
Dr Jameson: Necessarily that part doesn't take a long time unless she happens to have a whole bunch of them all at once, or something, sometimes takes a little bit of time.

630
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:38.460
Dr Jameson: But with they have to order it. That's can put a kink in it. So we sometimes will do, you know, okay, give him the aid and he'll cut it into quarters or that would still be a double dose, I guess. But sometimes we do something to try to

631
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:39.600
Dr Jameson: Fill

632
00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:51.120
Dr Jameson: fill the gap but so be in touch with our virtual clinic, if anything, sounds like it needs adjusting and then I'll ask have you been working with Jamie or RG and I guess.

633
00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:53.820
Modoc County: Our Jane and I go, primary

634
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:58.950
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'll, I'll follow up with them about what what we're planning for the

635
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:03.060
Dr Jameson: Group time

636
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:09.690
Dr Jameson: And and you said sometime between nine and noon would be I ending by noon or could start at noon.

637
00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:18.720
Modoc County: My lunchtime, so

638
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:22.950
Modoc County: But I mean, that's fine, whatever needs to be

639
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.030
Dr Jameson: I mean, I guess.

640
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:36.690
Dr Jameson: Um, you tell. Well obviously we, I mean, we want to make it as convenient as possible. So you're saying you'd rather be done by noon. Is that what you're saying. Okay.

641
00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:39.930
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no.

642
00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:51.690
Dr Jameson: But I mean, the other thing is that once it gets going. I mean, I don't, I don't know. But what's the expectation, you were going to sit in in the group or you're just gonna have set it up and let them do their thing.

643
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:53.550
Modoc County: Right.

644
00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:59.580
Modoc County: Okay, I'm gonna have to be the one to write notes and make sure the prescriptions are all there and

645
01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:04.140
Modoc County: Problems. Then they call me call you guys

646
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.620
Dr Jameson: Oh, OK.

647
01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:09.990
Dr Jameson: OK.

648
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:10.740
OK.

649
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:12.930
Dr Jameson: OK.

650
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:18.120
Dr Jameson: OK, that's fine. I

651
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:32.940
Dr Jameson: We, right now, it's what we do, anyway. Okay, that's fine. So I will say something either 910 or 11 on Mondays is ideal. So we basically need to find one of our counselors and one of our doctors to do that, I guess.

652
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.430
Dr Jameson: That's 12 one or two for me.

653
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:40.440
Dr Jameson: I wonder if

654
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:45.480
Dr Jameson: That might be doable for my schedule. I don't real currently I don't do any groups on Mondays, but

655
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:51.780
Dr Jameson: Anyway, what we'll figure that part out. Um, let's see if they have somebody already slated i don't i'm not i'm not

656
01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, do you have any question. What questions can I answer for you if any

657
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:00.720
Modoc County: Good.

658
01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:03.090
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

659
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:07.020
Dr Jameson: How about sorry. Say it one more time.

660
01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:10.950
Dr Jameson: My not Nyah, like with an M and N

661
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:12.360
Within

662
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.140
Dr Jameson: Not now. Yeah. Okay. My sister's dog is named Nyah, sorry, but it's I think it's a pretty name.

663
01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:23.430
Modoc County: Same thing. Yes, my dog you

664
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:37.800
Dr Jameson: Know, but it'll be should be easier for me to remember that way. But no, I think it's I think it's really pretty. I'm I'm bad with names. So that's why. Sorry, I had to ask you, boy.

665
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:39.300
Um,

666
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.820
Dr Jameson: Any questions that you have.

667
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:43.560
Modoc County: You know your

668
01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:45.870
Modoc County: Be honest.

669
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:50.850
Dr Jameson: Yes, I have to look it up because I don't know what off the top of my head.

670
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.050
Modoc County: Okay.

671
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.250
Dr Jameson: But I do. Okay.

672
01:01:53.670 --> 01:02:04.950
Modoc County: It's 1-457-327-4133 okay

673
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:09.630
Dr Jameson: And all the other numbers, maybe that one too, but should be on the prescription. I don't

674
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.660
Dr Jameson: Know if they put them on there. To be fair, but I know the DEA is on there and the waiver and all that.

675
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.700
Dr Jameson: Okay, okay.

676
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.120
Dr Jameson: All right, any other questions. That was easy. Any other

677
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:25.170
Modoc County: Any other questions.

678
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:25.860
Okay.

679
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:38.790
Dr Jameson: All right, well. It was nice meeting, both of you and I, I'm very interested to see are excited to see how this system in your how many patients do you have there. Do you think

680
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.490
Modoc County: So far, three use the third one.

681
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:42.720
Dr Jameson: All right.

682
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.590
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I'm cool. I bet you, I'm sure there will be more

683
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:51.960
Modoc County: You're probably will be more and it will make it work even better. We just starting out.

684
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.180
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, and it might be

685
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.510
Dr Jameson: I can see pluses or minuses and minuses to having

686
01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.690
Dr Jameson: A group with some of the folks there and then other folks somewhere else, just for kind of

687
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:10.530
Dr Jameson: I think it's helpful to see people in all different

688
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.890
Dr Jameson: Situations, and it can be, I think our patients find that

689
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.460
Dr Jameson: Reassuring I think

690
01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:23.280
Dr Jameson: And, and, you know,

691
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.950
Dr Jameson: You see somebody in a totally. You know, I don't know, there's a lot of

692
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:50.700
Dr Jameson: It helps to hear different perspectives and different experiences. And what this person has found to be helpful. And that person did and then the more ideas and here and stories you hear, I think the more your apt to find something that kind of, you know, rings rings for you.

693
01:03:52.980 --> 01:04:08.280
Dr Jameson: So, okay, well, we'll be in touch with a specific on the group. And if for some reason the group's not starting before next next Monday already we'll, we'll make sure that the medication gets covered

694
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:10.020
Dr Jameson: Okay, okay.

695
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.510
Dr Jameson: You know what, I have one more question. How tall are you,

696
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.490
Modoc County: I mean, yeah.

697
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:21.330
Dr Jameson: Wow. And do you know how much you weigh these days.

698
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.500
Dr Jameson: Okay, just my physical exam.

699
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:35.880
Dr Jameson: I guess I could get vitals on YouTube, but I don't think it's usually not all that relevant to honestly to this particular stuff. So I think that's okay.

700
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.230
Modoc County: Okay.

701
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:41.310
Dr Jameson: All right, well, nice to meet both of you. Thank you so much for your assistance. Nyah,

702
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.690
Modoc County: No problem.

703
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.980
Dr Jameson: All right, take care.

704
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:44.790
Modoc County: Thank you.

705
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:47.220

709
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.200

714
01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.340

01:05:54.510 --> 01:06:13.020
Dr Jameson: I'm sure they already told you all this. We're just to confirm while you sign your consent forms, but you're comfortable with the video visits and it's being recorded so that they can make transcripts of all of our visits and just make sure you're comfortable with that. Okay. Um,

720
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:15.180
Dr Jameson: So are you

Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: No, I'm not currently

723
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.550
Dr Jameson: But you happen in the past.

724
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.620
Dr Jameson: Yeah, with medication or just in like detox kind of stuff.

725
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:40.410
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Um, with Suboxone like I've never been in rehab like like inpatient rehab. I did Suboxone and then I went to groups and like in a so kind of outpatient

726
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:42.660
Dr Jameson: Okay, was it with Dr. Gross.

727
01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:49.170
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. I have several other patients that you know she works for us now. Right.

728
01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:56.280
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I didn't know that. Yeah, I think I knew that. That's why they they don't do really, they're not taking your patients for

729
01:06:57.810 --> 01:06:59.130
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: The end like that.

730
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:06.510
Dr Jameson: I used to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She moved. But then she was able to start working for us. So

731
01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:08.160
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: That's awesome.

732
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:17.910
Dr Jameson: It's up to you. I know most of her former patients have been transitioned over to her groups in our with us to

733
01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:22.650
Dr Jameson: You obviously don't have to, but if you would like to, then we can make that happen.

734
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:27.000
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, that'd be cool. I mean, it doesn't really matter to me.

735
01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.770
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I don't care really

736
01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.430
I'm

737
01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.520
Dr Jameson: Okay. I mean, I'll just leave it.

738
01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:41.760
Dr Jameson: There's no pressure, one way or the other, you know, like some, some people get really attached and some people don't care so

739
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:50.790
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, I wasn't in there for that long. I'm actually from Santa Cruz. I haven't lived here very long. I've lived here for like a little over a year.

740
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.420
Okay.

741
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.140
Dr Jameson: Are you living with with parents or

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.460
Dr Jameson: Coming out on my list. I live in Florida. I was sitting out on my call them one is here. It's just a patio, but

748
01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:22.200
Dr Jameson: There's too much background noise. I'll go inside. It's just happened to be fine. Actually, a nice a nice day outside for one, not too hot.

750
01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:39.690
Dr Jameson: It definitely can get very hot. But today, it's like not even humid and it's just nice. So I wanted to see if I can, I can make it work. Okay. Um, okay. So you have taken Suboxone in the past.

751
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.680
Dr Jameson: You know,

752
01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:42.840
Dr Jameson: You probably do know what your dose was

753
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:46.650
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Um, I think that I had

754
01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:51.870
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I think they started me out on for strips today of eight milligram

755
01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:57.090
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Mm hmm. And then they took me down to three strips eventually

756
01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:05.460
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay, so I think I got 30 a week or 28 week

757
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.300

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:12.270
Dr Jameson: How long ago was all that approximately

760
01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:18.330
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Um, probably about a year ago or close to

761
01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:22.140
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you were in the team. And then when did you stop.

762
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:30.480
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And I went back to Santa Cruz for a little bit. And that's when I stopped because I get it.

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:32.070
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, really do it.

764
01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:32.940
Dr Jameson: So that was

765
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:38.520
Dr Jameson: Okay. So how long did you take the Suboxone for

766
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:41.220
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Um,

767
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:43.680
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Probably like

768
01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:46.650
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Maybe like three months.

769
01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.820
Of hormones.

770
01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:49.440
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And then

771
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.600
Dr Jameson: And then you went back to Santa Cruz.

772
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:53.760
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah.

773
01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.740
Dr Jameson: And then you stop the Suboxone

774
01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:09.450
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, I tried to get put on methadone there, but it was like too long of a waitlist and like I just never got on because their doctor quit and like they can't prescribe any new patients so

775
01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.370
Dr Jameson: And then

776
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.300
Did you

777
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.850
Dr Jameson: Have you taken methadone.

778
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:19.110
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Somewhere. I'll never take never taken methadone.

779
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:23.850
Dr Jameson: Was it just because you couldn't find us about some doctor or you didn't really like the Suboxone

780
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.260
Dr Jameson: That you were looking at mom it

781
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:31.530
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Was because I couldn't really find this the box and Dr. There. And it was easier to get into the Methadone clinic.

782
01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:33.900
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: So,

783
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.990
Dr Jameson: I just there was, there wasn't something you didn't like about the Suboxone

784
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:45.120
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Know I helped me a lot. It's like going I've ever gotten clean was using Suboxone okay so

785
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.050
Dr Jameson: So what

790
01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:07.110
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Uh, yeah, didn't work out so

793
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:16.470

794
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:19.230
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I'm probably like

795
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.110
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Seven or eight months ago.

796
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:23.520

797
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:30.930

798
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.160
Dr Jameson: But you didn't look into Suboxone

799
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:42.330
Dr Jameson: Once you've got back again, or you did. But Dr girls will spawn or what happened.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.900
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I don't know. I was just kind of like going through hard times. So I just didn't really do it.

802
01:11:51.990 --> 01:12:01.710
Dr Jameson: Okay, you know, you don't. You don't have to justify yourself or anything. I just, just to sort of get an idea of where your mindset has been, that's all.

803
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.800
Dr Jameson: I'm okay so

804
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:06.510

813
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:58.620
Dr Jameson: So a lot of times, and I think I saw this written and some of your paperwork somewhere. It's now it's more about just not not feeling sick.

Dr Jameson: with nowhere to stay and then you started using did you start injecting ran away, or did you do some

Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: She never has. Yeah.

1005
01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:35.970
Ever

1006
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:41.220
Dr Jameson: Well, that's good, though. You don't want to be living in a place where

1007
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:42.720
Dr Jameson: Things are

1008
01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:46.200
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, no, it's definitely a good like environment, but are so good.

1009
01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:50.280
Dr Jameson: Um, do you know how well of course how tall are you,

1010
01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:54.780
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I think, like, five, one,

1011
01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:57.000
Dr Jameson: You how much you weigh DC

1012
01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:02.820
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I'm probably like maybe like like 110

1013
01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:11.760
Dr Jameson: Okay. So, um, what, when you have withdrawal. What, what does that

1014
01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:14.430
Dr Jameson: How does that manifest for you.

1015
01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:22.470
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Um, I get really sick of it lasts a long time for me. I don't know why.

1016
01:27:23.970 --> 01:27:29.160
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I know some people that can withdraw and they'll be done in like 234 days talks, you know,

1017
01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:47.610
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I like first time I ever withdrawal actually why got boxes because I tried to do it cold turkey and I will draw for so long, I really just couldn't take it anymore. I will try out for like a little over a month.

1018
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:54.840
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Now, and it just like wasn't getting any better, like I felt like worse and worse and so

1019
01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:56.700
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I

1020
01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:00.180
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I started Roxanne

1021
01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.800
Dr Jameson: Do you get not like few vomit. What, what kind of symptoms you have

1022
01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:20.880
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, I get really sick. Like I puke. I have used bathroom I sweat, and I called plants, I get hot and cold restless leg syndrome like fatigue, but I can't sleep.

1023
01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:24.810
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And like I get really bad anxiety.

1024
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:27.840
Dr Jameson: Yeah, pain.

1025
01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:32.310
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Oh yeah, my body is like a game.

1026
01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:35.460
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Like sore like yeah

1027
01:28:36.330 --> 01:28:39.990
Dr Jameson: It sounds very, very familiar. Yes.

1028
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:45.390
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and some. So I would say that is a little bit

1029
01:28:46.650 --> 01:29:03.570
Dr Jameson: More letters fairly for a long. I mean, most people it's at least a week, two weeks. But then there's kind of depression and other stuff that can kind of wax and wane for even 656 months. Sometimes it can take a very long time so

1030
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:05.400
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I don't know if it's

1031
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:10.320
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: The only time I ever have withdrawal and that's why it took so long.

1032
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.730
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: The first time is the worst time so i i don't know

1033
01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.020
Dr Jameson: I don't know.

1034
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.110
Dr Jameson: Either so I don't know if that's true or not. Honestly, I don't know.

1035
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:30.150
Dr Jameson: If I think to me. I would say would have probably has more to do with how stubborn your receptors in there. Are they don't want to change.

1036
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.790
Dr Jameson: Their thermostat. It sounds like so they

1037
01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.840
Dr Jameson: Keep on screaming longer and longer, which is

1038
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.500
Dr Jameson: Money, but

1039
01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:46.530
Dr Jameson: That's usually what the withdrawal process is is the receptors. They have been, you know, that's the opposite of getting the tolerance and

1040
01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:51.660
Dr Jameson: Is when you you have to reverse that basically

1041
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:57.510
Dr Jameson: Sort of and and generally in a sort of a sense but

1042
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.930
Dr Jameson: That should gradually

1043
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:07.830
Dr Jameson: Physical stuff usually doesn't last quite so like I said, this is a long time.

1044
01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:10.440
Dr Jameson: Are you there.

1045
01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.060
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah.

1046
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:12.810
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1047
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.400
Dr Jameson: I thought you're frozen for a second. Okay.

1048
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:26.820
Dr Jameson: So, um, so you probably know quite a bit about how the Suboxone works, but I want to make sure you don't have any questions or if there's any questions I can try to answer for you.

1049
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:28.440
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay.

1050
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.310
You

1051
01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:30.540
Dr Jameson: Know,

1052
01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:38.340
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I am pretty sure she just told me that would maybe be put under my tongue for 15 minutes

1053
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:44.430
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And let it, you know, try to let it absorb like as much as possible, and then

1054
01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:58.980
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, I'll just take it in the morning and then we'll try me for her. So I'll just take off in the morning and then one like in like the mid afternoon.

1055
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.560
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And then one in the evening.

1056
01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:04.140
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And then like where I went to bed and

1057
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:07.380
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay, but then it tapers down to three. So I would just

1058
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:09.540
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Do one in the morning and afternoon doesn't one

1059
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.600
Dr Jameson: Were you feeling okay I'm a three.

1060
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:29.550
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah. At first I needed the for because I was just like, withdrawing so hard. I got it. I it didn't help me I needed for for my cravings. I had really craving the first

1061
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:33.030
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: But not take it off and I didn't really have anything

1062
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:36.480
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Like so kind of the three was okay for me.

1063
01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:50.370
Dr Jameson: And then compared to how much heroin. You've been taking well I guess you hadn't taken any in a month when he started the Suboxone last time. But how much have you been you. How much have you been using before you started to stop.

1064
01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.770
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Probably less than I'm doing now.

1065
01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:57.810
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Because, yeah.

1066
01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.520
Dr Jameson: Well, cuz tolerance, that's why.

1067
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:03.270
Yeah.

1068
01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:10.890
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then did she explained to you, like how it works in your body, like what it does.

1069
01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:13.380
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Um, yeah, like you're

1070
01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:22.770
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: It pretty much blocks your receptors are from, like, like wanting to get like fed more like opiates. Right.

1071
01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:31.020
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so the same receptors that the heroin or the Percocet, or whatever oxy whatever people are using

1072
01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:52.800
Dr Jameson: There's like receptors in your brain where those drugs connect and then create various sensations. The buprenorphine goes into those same receptors and then it sticks. They're like it you can't really your body can't get it out. So, um, I guess with Mark, can you can but

1073
01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:57.990
Dr Jameson: It's much stronger than even heroin is so

1074
01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:12.360
Dr Jameson: That's good. I mean, you know, so even if you, God forbid, decided to use heroin. If you've been taking your Suboxone that would be nowhere for the heroin to go because the receptors are occupied

1075
01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:21.480
Dr Jameson: The problem theoretically can be that since it's so strong, it can actually push the heroin out

1076
01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:43.410
Dr Jameson: So you can if you don't wait until you're already feeling sick when you first take your first dose it will pre it will create a sudden very severe withdrawal Republic precipitated withdrawal sorta like if you give someone in our can when they're high except worse because it last longer.

1077
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:47.880
Dr Jameson: can win her can wears off. After an hour or so.

1078
01:33:49.530 --> 01:33:56.850
Dr Jameson: So it's important that you be careful about the timing of your initial dose.

1079
01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:03.900
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: You wait like it's like 72 hours or 48 hours 4872

1080
01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:07.050
Dr Jameson: Basically, as long as you can.

1081
01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:18.960
Dr Jameson: If it's really just heroin, which I don't know that we have any way of knowing for sure if it's really just heroin, because there's so much mental out there in the world now.

1082
01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:34.020
Dr Jameson: Then I think 24 hours is enough. As long as you're feeling pretty ill, like, you know, like withdrawals really going strong. If you're not feeling that sick, then I would wait longer

1083
01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:43.920
Dr Jameson: And if there's any suspicion that which I think we have to have because there is so much fentanyl than waiting longer is better because that stuff is

1084
01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:51.960
Dr Jameson: That stuff is so strong that it's actually a little bit harder for the Suboxone to to work for that so

1085
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.990
Dr Jameson: The

1086
01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:07.710
Dr Jameson: Especially in California. The support, but in anywhere these days, the supply of what what sold as heroin often has as much or more. Sometimes it's all fentanyl so

1087
01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:23.130
Dr Jameson: I don't know, we, it's hard to know. I even had a patient who said he lives in San Francisco. And he, I guess there was some clinic or somewhere, you could go. Probably the same place, you will go to exchange your needles. I mean, they had some sort of test, you could test your

1088
01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:24.510
Dr Jameson: Dope.

1089
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:25.200
Man.

1090
01:35:26.250 --> 01:35:29.520
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, the needle exchange. They have a fit and all test it.

1091
01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:40.110
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and he had done that and when he, when he tested it came back as just heroin. But when we went to induce him. It turned out it was

1092
01:35:41.190 --> 01:35:44.970
Dr Jameson: Apparently there was one on there because it was more. It was much more

1093
01:35:47.670 --> 01:35:51.360
Dr Jameson: Uncomfortable for him for the first few days until things. Finally, certainly set

1094
01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:53.100
Dr Jameson: So,

1095
01:35:55.050 --> 01:35:57.450
Dr Jameson: What do you know when, when's the last time that you used

1096
01:35:59.430 --> 01:36:01.020
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Last night, okay.

1097
01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:08.190
Dr Jameson: How long does it normally I don't know how long you've tried to go lately, but how long until you start to feel like you're vomiting in that so

1098
01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.850
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I'm only about like

1099
01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:21.960
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Maybe like 12 like puking like probably like 1618 hours.

1100
01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:27.540
Dr Jameson: So you're getting getting there. Now, I guess, starting to or

1101
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:35.580
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Well, I mean, it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of different when you go to sleep in. And because I didn't go to bed until late night.

1102
01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.260
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay to like three or four

1103
01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.000
Dr Jameson: Years right before them.

1104
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:43.200
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah.

1105
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:46.950
Dr Jameson: I think so. Okay, so, um,

1106
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:54.780
Dr Jameson: Yeah i mean i think i think waiting as long as you can stand to wait is probably the safest bet.

1107
01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:08.790
Dr Jameson: I can send some natural medicine, if that would help and we we have you used any of the quantities or the visceral hydroxyl scenes in the past.

1108
01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:15.120
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Um, I think that when I first came here. He gave me a kickback Dr girls did

1109
01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:15.720
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

1110
01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.540
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I think it. That's what I had. And yeah.

1111
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:20.430
Dr Jameson: Maybe, yeah.

1112
01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:28.980
Dr Jameson: Probably so I can send all of that stuff too. So you have some other stuff to take for some of the symptoms, while you're trying to like

1113
01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.990
Dr Jameson: Wait out your time as much as you can.

1114
01:37:33.690 --> 01:37:45.420
Dr Jameson: But I would say very bare minimum is 24 hours but I probably I would say if you can try to get through tonight and start tomorrow at the earliest assuming you're really

1115
01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.770
Dr Jameson: Terrible, which I

1116
01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.360
Dr Jameson: Suppose you will be but

1117
01:37:49.710 --> 01:37:52.080
Dr Jameson: And then as far as dose goes

1118
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:56.910
Dr Jameson: I think we should give an attempt at three day

1119
01:37:58.170 --> 01:38:09.810
Dr Jameson: Or really, the very, very, very most maximum dose and where we I've had to do that, initially, and people to but it's usually you know the average was sexually to a day so

1120
01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:21.360
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I think, I think it's worth trying 3D and I say that partly because some of the cravings are physical, but some of them are more psychological and

1121
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:30.120
Dr Jameson: You know you've been on Suboxone before you know that it works for you. You have a probably a little different mindset about it this time than you did the first time where it was.

1122
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:38.700
Dr Jameson: Unknown to you. And is this even going to work and I, you know, not knowing what was going to happen. So I think it's worth a try it three a day.

1123
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:53.100
Dr Jameson: If you're really not either, you know, you're feeling still sick or you're still having terrible cravings and okay but I think we can we can adjust up, but I think it's worth a try, because you might actually be okay at three

1124
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.640
Dr Jameson: There's no way to know until we try

1125
01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.580
Dr Jameson: I have to run you through the

1126
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:10.350
Dr Jameson: Curious system, one second. Then in your family. I guess the way that we do our program is probably similar to the way that Dr groves.

1127
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:14.520
Dr Jameson: Works there you we do the weekly group.

1128
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:16.650
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And

1129
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:17.790
Dr Jameson: That what she did to

1130
01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:19.140
Yeah.

1131
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:28.980
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I think that we started to do it on webcam. Actually, when she cuz she moved in. So we actually

1132
01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:33.480
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Like on webcam and stuff. Okay.

1133
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:34.980
Dr Jameson: All right. Um,

1134
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.340
Dr Jameson: So, um,

1135
01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.040
Dr Jameson: So I can see when her

1136
01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.830
Dr Jameson: You didn't like get kicked out or have any

1137
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:51.690
Dr Jameson: Issues with that.

1138
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.380
Dr Jameson: Program. I

1139
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:53.610
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Know,

1140
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:58.770
Dr Jameson: Feel free march 29 27th. Sorry.

1141
01:39:59.130 --> 01:39:59.730
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: 29

1142
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:01.560
And 1997

1143
01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:07.440
Dr Jameson: That's Wittenberg with them. No, I saw there was enough for you.

1144
01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:10.080
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, everybody does.

1145
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.720
Dr Jameson: Okay, is not coming up. Would you be under miss

1146
01:40:19.530 --> 01:40:20.760
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Lisa Michelle.

1147
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:25.470
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: There should be an early. So Michelle Wittenberg

1148
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.570
Dr Jameson: Try again. There'll be you.

1149
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.330
Dr Jameson: H. I.

1150
01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.320
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: N B RG

1151
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:45.330
Dr Jameson: To know what's your take on. Sorry. Oh.

1152
01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:48.780
329 97

1153
01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:59.070
Dr Jameson: Me, try this during this show. Maybe that was always done under

1154
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.920
Dr Jameson: I don't see anything with the least

1155
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:36.060
Dr Jameson: nothing's coming up.

1156
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:39.120
Dr Jameson: There's two T's right

1157
01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:46.350
Dr Jameson: I just purchased your last name, and it's not even coming up.

1158
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:50.310
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Oh, what is that, what are you eating for for me or

1159
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:51.450
Dr Jameson: So in the

1160
01:41:52.710 --> 01:42:02.490
Dr Jameson: There's a state database that is supposed to show any controlled substances. Maybe I should do a long. I wonder if I can do a longer time period.

1161
01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:20.550
Dr Jameson: Maybe it doesn't go back far enough.

1162
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.630
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I don't

1163
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:36.180
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Think it's been longer than I mean it has been over a year and barely

1164
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.890
A year.

1165
01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:14.070
Dr Jameson: I mean, if I can't find you. I can't find you. I'm just surprised because when user that just means you haven't had anything in a year, but I find that surprising given

1166
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:19.980
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: That's definitely in 2009 it wasn't

1167
01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:32.790
Dr Jameson: California

1168
01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:51.540
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1169
01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:56.430
Dr Jameson: So let me see what the what Dr.

1170
01:43:59.730 --> 01:44:00.690
Dr Jameson: Close.

1171
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:08.610
Dr Jameson: Group schedules. Like, I can tell you my when my groups for California are Wednesday's either 1030

1172
01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.880
Dr Jameson: All of that one's getting kind of full

1173
01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:18.510
Dr Jameson: Well, either 110 30 or noon.

1174
01:44:20.610 --> 01:44:27.090
Dr Jameson: And then I can tell you can look through Dr grow. So you have a certain day of the week or time that you need.

1175
01:44:28.890 --> 01:44:31.980
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Probably the afternoons better than their early morning

1176
01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:35.610
Dr Jameson: You see,

1177
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:39.360
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Like noon would be good.

1178
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:50.310
Dr Jameson: Have you done any individual counseling.

1179
01:44:54.090 --> 01:45:03.780
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: No, not really. I think I went to one one session was and it was kind of weird. And so I designed it and do it.

1180
01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.060
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Again,

1181
01:45:06.330 --> 01:45:11.340
Dr Jameson: Okay, so Dr. Gross. Have a 10am on Thursday, but that might be too early.

1182
01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.340
Dr Jameson: And

1183
01:45:16.530 --> 01:45:20.970
Dr Jameson: Know her schedule off the top of my head. Some, hold on. There's a lot of different groups now.

1184
01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:44.400
Dr Jameson: Another one because I

1185
01:45:46.650 --> 01:45:51.900
Dr Jameson: Asked her some patients like I had, I had someone for patients. And then when she started making a list, they

1186
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:55.770
Dr Jameson: Move back with her, which is totally fair

1187
01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.160
Dr Jameson: Oh here 545 on Monday.

1188
01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:02.040
Dr Jameson: And that'll work.

1189
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:03.090
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I work

1190
01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:06.750
Dr Jameson: With I know that's kind of a big boy. That's a really big group.

1191
01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:17.370
Dr Jameson: So I should probably get the okay from her before some of these folks maybe just going once a month, though I don't know because they. Some of them I happen to know at least one or two of them.

1192
01:46:17.850 --> 01:46:24.480
Dr Jameson: Were very long duration, so that that may be, but I don't want to put you in there till I get an okay because it's like 20 people so

1193
01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.720
Dr Jameson: Let me see if there's any other. Let me see if there's any others.

1194
01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:40.140
Dr Jameson: A different place to look. That will be easier to see here

1195
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:57.780
Dr Jameson: So I don't know if that will work or not. I have. We can tend to we can pencil you in for the noon on Wednesday, one

1196
01:46:58.950 --> 01:47:03.990
Dr Jameson: Me and then I'll reach out to Dr. Bros and just let her know the situation.

1197
01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:09.150
Dr Jameson: And we can decide what works best for everyone involved.

1198
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:14.010
Dr Jameson: So we do

1199
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:19.080
Dr Jameson: We do require

1200
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:32.910
Dr Jameson: At least a period of individual counseling. So, for sure. There's an initial visit with with one of the counselors and that's for kind of an assessment of just the general

1201
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:44.460
Dr Jameson: What your various factors bio, they call it a bio psychosocial so like, what's your support system like what's your, you know, kind of just what's the setting in which we're dealing with

1202
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:55.770
Dr Jameson: This and then they at that visit will make a recommendation about okay once a week or every other week or twice a week, you know, depending on how much

1203
01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:09.780
Dr Jameson: Is going on. And then once they've met with you enough times, I feel like you've got a pretty good mindset and your coping skills are really strong and you're

1204
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:24.150
Dr Jameson: You know, kind of cruise control a little bit, then they'll start, you know, slowing down. And eventually, maybe just leave it as and as as needed. I think most of our patients benefit from

1205
01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:39.120
Dr Jameson: A reasonable duration of counseling. And I say that because my opinion is, I don't know that it's a scientific study, but my opinion is, there's usually

1206
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:45.360
Dr Jameson: There are usually more than one reason why someone ended up in this

1207
01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:46.950
Dr Jameson: Pickup

1208
01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:51.930
Dr Jameson: You know, there's a reason you make a decision to inject

1209
01:48:53.070 --> 01:49:01.290
Dr Jameson: Heroin in your arm, you're trying to escape from some other reality or some kind of discomfort, whether it's emotional or physical

1210
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:22.230
Dr Jameson: And we can't just magically erase all of those other you know things in your, from your life. Right. So what we need to help you, is to replace this coping mechanism, which is so self destructive with some with other a variety, probably not just one, but other

1211
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.990
Dr Jameson: Coping mechanisms.

1212
01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.960
Dr Jameson: But in order to do that, we also have to sort of help you if you don't already know what those

1213
01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.770
Dr Jameson: Issues are where they're coming from. Maybe there are some maybe there is some

1214
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:46.680
Dr Jameson: Trauma related to, you know, some things that have happened to you in your life that we can help you kind of process through better grief through work through heal from

1215
01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:55.560
Dr Jameson: So that they're not kind of a festering thing that you're always carrying around with you, trying to numb, which is common.

1216
01:49:56.850 --> 01:50:07.770
Dr Jameson: Some people have, you know, anxieties and social anxieties and phobias and things that they're trying to keep quiet and overcome and Amy.

1217
01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:16.890
Dr Jameson: If we find that most people have have at least, even if it's like the way that they think about with whether they're very

1218
01:50:17.370 --> 01:50:24.510
Dr Jameson: Pessimistic instead of optimistic or they're always jumping to the worst possible conclusion, we call that catastrophizing

1219
01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:36.240
Dr Jameson: Sort of the way that we think about things that happen in our environment can make have a huge impact on how how we get through them or don't.

1220
01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:43.890
Dr Jameson: And so some of you know, working with working with kind of analyzing that a little bit healthier. What is your sort of

1221
01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:57.930
Dr Jameson: knee jerk thought process, which, you know, we all have that it's just some of us are very negative and some of us are not and some of us blame ourselves for every single thing that happens and other people you know it's. Everyone's a little different but

1222
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:07.320
Dr Jameson: That I think makes a huge difference in how long term big picture how people end up you know doing

1223
01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:08.910
Dr Jameson: In the long run, so

1224
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:11.910
Dr Jameson: That's the reason anyway.

1225
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:23.760
Dr Jameson: And I get it. I mean, I hear what you're saying. It can be uncomfortable or weird or you don't always connect. Sometimes the person you first meet with is like you feel like they're crazier than you are sometimes

1226
01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.610
Dr Jameson: That's okay. No, no, just

1227
01:51:26.610 --> 01:51:32.400
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Kind of weird because I didn't know it was a guy. He was an older guy and then just, like, kind of, I don't know.

1228
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:33.510
Dr Jameson: Just didn't feel comfortable so

1229
01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.890
Dr Jameson: So that doesn't mean that counseling isn't appropriate just means that wasn't the right

1230
01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:40.770
Dr Jameson: match for you. And that happens. I mean, some

1231
01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:47.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, maybe even if it was a young female, you might still not have felt comfortable for us. And sometimes there's just a weird

1232
01:51:47.970 --> 01:51:49.020
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay, hold on.

1233
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:51.990
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Sorry. Sorry, I'm talking to my mom.

1234
01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:53.790
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um,

1235
01:51:55.740 --> 01:52:11.670
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so we'll have you meet with counselor and then they'll determine together with you what the, what the recommendation is but we doing Kurt, we do consider the individual work kind of part and parcel just as important really honestly really

1236
01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:15.420
Dr Jameson: Very important, not just the medicine, which is usually the patients kind

1237
01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:18.630
Dr Jameson: Of primary focus. So do you need to

1238
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:22.980
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Know her and I was in the bathroom.

1239
01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.810
Dr Jameson: Okay, okay.

1240
01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:25.560
Sure.

1241
01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:32.190
Dr Jameson: So what we usually do is kind of tie your prescriptions to

1242
01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:40.860
Dr Jameson: The expectation is that you we write the prescription you your you fulfill your side of the

1243
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:51.930
Dr Jameson: Equation which is showing up for groups showing up for appointments doing your labs. The initially, there's a set of lab work that they did they tell you about that.

1244
01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:53.340
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah.

1245
01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:56.580
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay, they told me that I needed to go to center coast.

1246
01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:03.270
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: With them this week and then after that we'll be sending it to my mailbox every 30 days.

1247
01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:03.810
Dr Jameson: You got

1248
01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.100
Dr Jameson: Two minutes. Yeah.

1249
01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:14.610
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so basically like we, you know, you kind of we dole out the prescriptions like as each of these things are being

1250
01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:19.020
Dr Jameson: Cut. Check, check. Okay. You know, you get your prescription so

1251
01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:26.400
Dr Jameson: We start out with a very short leash. I'm not gonna lie. I mean, we keep it pretty

1252
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:36.090
Dr Jameson: But I think, you know, I sometimes I think we leave able to Lucy, Lucy and it's all I'll do that tomorrow, I'll do that tomorrow. And then it just never happens. So

1253
01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:47.130
Dr Jameson: We kind of keep things pretty tight at first and then as time goes on and you're showing up and doing all the right you know all the things we're asking you to do, then we start doing

1254
01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:56.640
Dr Jameson: A longer prescription and eventually ultimately down as long as a month at a time, which is that takes a good time long time to get to, but it does happen, and

1255
01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.340
Dr Jameson: So we started out with weekly groups and then

1256
01:54:03.630 --> 01:54:10.020
Dr Jameson: You know, six months down the line, if things are really good. Then we sometimes people will start coming in a group, every other week but

1257
01:54:11.490 --> 01:54:18.150
Dr Jameson: Usually more is better. As far as feeling connected and and sort of encouraged and supported and

1258
01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.910
Dr Jameson: Part of the program.

1259
01:54:23.010 --> 01:54:23.520
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay.

1260
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:26.580
Dr Jameson: We are pretty strict about no

1261
01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:27.330
Shows

1262
01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:34.380
Dr Jameson: We have had big problem with them. So especially for the counselor, is it. Go figure.

1263
01:54:35.850 --> 01:54:43.980
Dr Jameson: So we've, we've got a pretty strict policy in place. Like if you don't show up, you're going to get a three or four day prescription for the next month.

1264
01:54:44.670 --> 01:55:05.520
Dr Jameson: Until you don't have any naturals for the next month. So my advice to you is we understand stuff happens like your phone dies or I don't know you're sick or whatever you, you just need to let us know ahead of time. I'm not gonna be able to make it and reschedule like an adult, you know,

1265
01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.480
Dr Jameson: And then

1266
01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:22.530
Dr Jameson: And then that's okay if we reschedule. And you call us and let us know. It's the idea. Don't even bother to call, don't you know and then two days later, I'm on a medicine or something like that and you need to be upfront and proactive that's that's really all we're asking

1267
01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.060
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay.

1268
01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:38.430
Dr Jameson: I mean, if you keep on rescheduling every single appointment. After a while we're gonna have a problem with that too. But we are reasonable. I mean, I think we're, we're pretty flexible. We just need we need to have that communication.

1269
01:55:40.710 --> 01:55:42.030
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

1270
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:44.490
Dr Jameson: I will send

1271
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.010
Dr Jameson: What did I say Dr. Gross.

1272
01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:57.450
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay.

1273
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:02.160
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah.

1274
01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:10.290
Dr Jameson: No worries. And you did the film was before, right.

1275
01:56:11.490 --> 01:56:12.060
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: The what

1276
01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:13.500
Stress trip.

1277
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.280
Dr Jameson: And I'm pretty sure medical strangely wants us to say brand only Weirdest thing, but okay.

1278
01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:27.900
Dr Jameson: So I will read it that way. And I'm going to say three day but you're not going to probably start it.

1279
01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:29.820
Dr Jameson: Until

1280
01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:33.300
Dr Jameson: A little bit at least tomorrow.

1281
01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:37.620
Dr Jameson: T ID. And I'm going to do a four days.

1282

Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah. And then I did the I went to drug test and

1315
01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:25.650
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I took Suboxone

1316
01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:27.570
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

1317
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:29.640
Dr Jameson: All right.

1318
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:35.100
Dr Jameson: And have you had any legal issues.

1319
01:59:36.690 --> 01:59:37.080
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: No.

1320

Dr Jameson: probation or parole or anything. You have a license.

1321
01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:41.160
Yeah.

1322
01:59:52.350 --> 02:00:01.800
Dr Jameson: And the only thing about quantity. It's used for anxiety and the hots and colds and stuff. It can make. It's a blood pressure medicine so it can lower your blood pressure a little bit

1323
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:14.760
Dr Jameson: So you just want to make sure you don't. If you notice you're feeling light headed, or disease, especially when you stand up, you might not have the highest blood pressure to start with because you're kind of petite just good. Yeah.

1324
02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:17.070
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Pretty low blood pressure actually

1325
02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:27.540
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that's the only thing you gotta kind of watch out for, with nothing. Nada medicine one, but the one that has to do with anxiety and restlessness and stuff.

1326
02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:32.880
Dr Jameson: So just be careful. Yes.

1327
02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:46.410
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Pretty much like my worst symptom is saying I got already have really bad anxiety, like I have super bad anxiety and like when I when I detox like I have a line goes through the roof anxiety.

1328
02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:47.310
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

1329
02:00:47.370 --> 02:00:49.770
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I got just so anxious for no reason.

1330
02:00:50.490 --> 02:01:03.810
Dr Jameson: So that's a common withdrawal symptom, actually. And then if you have anxiety to start with any way that it's just unmasked because you're not sedated by your opiate then

1331
02:01:04.710 --> 02:01:06.810
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so it may be a little both

1332
02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:23.190
Dr Jameson: So one is for the hot and cold and the restlessness with anxiety and then the hydroxyl mean I'm going to put for anxiety, insomnia, and that one is just that one doesn't affect your blood pressure. So,

1333
02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:30.270
Dr Jameson: That one is ok not in my make you sleepy, which would be good, I think.

1334
02:01:31.590 --> 02:01:38.880
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, cuz I can't sleep, but I'm like exhausted. I can't sleep because they like restlessness anxiety. So

1335
02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:43.530
Dr Jameson: Basically all the simple opposite symptoms of what opiates.

1336
02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:49.920
Dr Jameson: Do to people. Right. So they make people sleepy. They make people I'm constipated.

1337
02:01:51.330 --> 02:01:57.570
Dr Jameson: They kind of slow things down, they, you know, it's like when you take the breaks away everything goes

1338
02:01:58.230 --> 02:02:00.270
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Opposite or the roof. Yeah.

1339
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:11.250
Dr Jameson: So that's and not being able to sleep. I would say is probably the most common side effects for withdrawal from for people

1340
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:20.370
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Yeah, I know some people that can sleep through it, but it's like, I cannot. I got is Blair like slipping and tossing and turning,

1341
02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:25.050
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: And every little thing is so uncomfortable. Like, I can't remember. Oh.

1342
02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:32.280
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's really pretty miserable. Um. Any chance you could be pregnant. Yeah.

1343
02:02:33.090 --> 02:02:34.230
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I have an IUD.

1344
02:02:35.010 --> 02:02:35.940
Dr Jameson: Ah, well,

1345
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:38.130
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: I haven't been sexually active though.

1346
02:02:38.370 --> 02:02:44.250
Dr Jameson: Okay. Well, let me put that in here that technically would be a medic medication. So is it a marina or

1347
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:46.950
The plastic one

1348
02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:48.690
Dr Jameson: There's another

1349
02:02:50.010 --> 02:02:51.210
Dr Jameson: Guy law or something.

1350
02:02:53.370 --> 02:02:53.670
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1351
02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.400
Dr Jameson: Good. Okay.

1352
02:02:58.650 --> 02:02:58.890
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1353
02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:06.870
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you're going to get your labs and I'm going to pencil you in for the Thursday 10am group.

1354
02:03:08.490 --> 02:03:13.140
Dr Jameson: A couple guidelines which probably all make sense to you, but

1355
02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:24.810
Dr Jameson: We asked you to have headphones on which you have now, but we want you to have the head just say, whoever hopefully that you're in a private room anyway. But if there. It does happen me

1356
02:03:24.810 --> 02:03:25.830
Dr Jameson: Somebody else in your household

1357
02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:31.920
Dr Jameson: What somebody else in group is saying it's not getting broadcast around who knows, you know, it's for privacy basically

1358
02:03:32.490 --> 02:03:33.360
Dr Jameson: And then

1359
02:03:33.450 --> 02:03:36.030
Dr Jameson: You're not a smoker, so we don't have to ask you not to smoke.

1360
02:03:38.250 --> 02:03:42.510
Dr Jameson: It's really recommended that you check start checking in.

1361
02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:53.670
Dr Jameson: And I know it's getting earlier in earlier. I don't know. We asked people to start checking in half an hour before group actually starts. So just like

1362
02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:57.240
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Hold on. One moment please. Hold on. Sorry, sir.

1363
02:04:02.850 --> 02:04:04.770
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Can you give me one second, please.

1364
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:17.850
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Okay, sorry, my mom. My mom called me back. I think I got my stimulus check. I'm not sure my, I have to call my credit card.

1365
02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:22.020
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: Debit card company and I was on hold for an hour. So she

1366
02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:23.670
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: didn't hang up.

1367
02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:27.480
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay. So we better hurry up. So, um,

1368
02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:30.840
Dr Jameson: I lost my train of thought, anyway.

1369
02:04:33.090 --> 02:04:41.760
Dr Jameson: No smoking in the same room. Oh, checking in at least half an hour before group starts just because it if everyone's checking in at once. Sometimes it gets

1370
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:49.050
Dr Jameson: It gets to be a backlog there. So do your best to try to set an alarm or something to enter, you're going to be getting up just for group so

1371
02:04:51.330 --> 02:05:00.480
Dr Jameson: Then you go to the virtual clinic, just like you do today and you tell me I'm checking for group and then they'll do their thing and then give you the meeting ID, just like they did today.

1372
02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.040
Lisa Michelle Whittenberg: OK.

02:08:19.650 --> 02:08:33.900
Dr Jameson: Patient has had success with me to the past and I think she's a good candidate for this as she's at high risk for overdose and or death, given that she uses IV here when I be period.

Dr Jameson: Medication

1461
02:15:22.230 --> 02:15:29.760

1462
02:15:34.050 --> 02:15:42.420
Dr Jameson: Use Disorder period, our task pane certainly is an option might also help with some of his insomnia period.

1463
02:15:44.490 --> 02:15:47.700

1464
02:15:48.810 --> 02:15:55.200
Dr Jameson: buprenorphine naloxone to see if we can help with some of this chronic pain and at the same time.

Dr Jameson: To experience, I should say.

1467
02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:19.590
Dr Jameson: We discussed potential side effects, which may be somewhat more obvious now that he's not currently using opiates also discussed the fact that he would technically be physically dependent on the Suboxone as well.

02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:22.740
Dr Jameson: Period.

1469
02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:29.880

1471
02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:44.010
Dr Jameson: really relevant to the patient at this current time but is important information to be familiar with.

1472
02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:54.270
Dr Jameson: And have initial lab results reason to have recent lab results from the clinic forwarded to us and

1473
02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:00.930
Dr Jameson: Then the group is going to be formed in within his clinic population.

1474
02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:04.080
