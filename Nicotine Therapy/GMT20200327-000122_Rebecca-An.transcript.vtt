Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That

184
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.890
Amanda's: Just completely shuts off.

185
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.930
Amanda's: I don't know when I took my phone taste off.

186
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:54.240
Amanda's: Because it was a little hot, but I've never had my phone just me sometimes, it shuts off. I'm like, always been on my phone. That's like once a month.

187
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.550
Amanda's: Or you know what I mean, but

188
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.880
Amanda's: Lacking that older lady is shut off twice.

189
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:09.750
Amanda's: So just how many did I knew what was going on. So I just had to wait for it to load everything up and I don't know why it does that. I've never video chatted this long either

195
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe you should take it in and and ask, maybe it's something simple, maybe it's in the settings or something that you don't

196
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.960
Amanda's: Realize how I'm going to use that zoom or whatever.

204
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.580
Amanda's: See on Sundays like Saturdays and Sundays, because there's only

205
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.250

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.190
Lenovo TAB4 8: Why, my face is not there.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you don't have your video on

222
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:02.580
Lenovo TAB4 8: I didn't want to like go through and do I got it would all be coming up. It just keeps shutting off on us.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and we can just finish up just like this that's totally okay. Okay.

224
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:19.320
Lenovo TAB4 8: All right guys do it better. I just wanted to get on the tablet right away because it shut off right away as soon as I got on there, at least, at least I got halfway through before it shut off again.

225
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I know.

226
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay. Um, alright, so we talked about your family.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:33.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you had mentioned, I need to know a little bit about your legal history, you told me that you had in the past 60 wise.

228
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.650
Yeah.

229
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any other Past, present legal stuff.

230
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.080
Lenovo TAB4 8: conspiracy to shoplifting. I went to prison.

231
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.250
Lenovo TAB4 8: Prison three times.

232
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, that one I

233
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:54.120
Lenovo TAB4 8: Went there and then a valid my Pro. I went back about three years later, I ended up going back

234
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.020
Lenovo TAB4 8: For a DWI.

235
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:06.450
Lenovo TAB4 8: I finished my Pro. I don't have. I'm not in trouble now. I haven't been in trouble, since I got out of prison in 2013

236
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Perfect.

237
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:09.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

238
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.980
Lenovo TAB4 8: Put your mind to something

239
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:21.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right, 100%. That's right. Um, any financial stressors for you right now.

240
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:23.400
Lenovo TAB4 8: No.

241
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:33.300
Lenovo TAB4 8: Like my wife. She works. And I'm really thankful that she's a store manager, because the coronavirus isn't affecting us

242
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.850
Lenovo TAB4 8: Will always have a job.

243
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.590
Lenovo TAB4 8: Because like right now the stores only open from 10 to seven.

244
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.440
But she doesn't have any employees because the hours are guaranteed to her.

245
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:55.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's awesome. That's definitely a financial security relief and all this madness.

246
00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:11.190
Lenovo TAB4 8: Yeah, and name instead of a closure store gap because you have to drive 3030 miles away to go to work, but it thanks to her store down, they'll, they'll find her another store so she won't be out of work. Every guaranteed or that

247
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really good.

248
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.180
Lenovo TAB4 8: Yeah.

249
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She must be a good worker. Okay, I

250
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.320
Lenovo TAB4 8: Mean, like I said, we were homeless and

251
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.800
Lenovo TAB4 8: We just needed a place to put our feet down the ground. My cousin said she was helping us, but she didn't and

252
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.280
Lenovo TAB4 8: We've got it together. But we're okay now.

253
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, okay. Is there anything that I missed out that you think is important for us to know about you.

254
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.310
Lenovo TAB4 8: Know, I mean,

255
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:55.860
Lenovo TAB4 8: Like I said about the appeals. I could have said no, but I didn't. And that's my own fault, like I'm a very strong person, like I said, if I don't want to do this anymore. I'm not going to

256
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:58.020
Lenovo TAB4 8: I'm

257
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.330
Lenovo TAB4 8: Just, I don't want to be dependent on drugs. The whole point of all this.

258
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.090
Lenovo TAB4 8: Yeah, got on the Methadone so I could

259
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.350
Lenovo TAB4 8: Get off the field, but then I'm still stuck on that one.

260
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:21.450
Lenovo TAB4 8: And I'd like i said i thought i could get off, but it was more. It was body. I do it was physical period, but I just thought I could keep myself down, but I couldn't

261
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:23.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I

262
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:24.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Want to get

263
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:30.330
Lenovo TAB4 8: The box. And now I want to, I obviously know I need them because they need to get this

264
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.610
Lenovo TAB4 8: Depends on the

265
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.140
Lenovo TAB4 8: The I forget what they're called, The opiates out of me.

266
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:38.670
Lenovo TAB4 8: And

267
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.000
Lenovo TAB4 8: I need to take something to taper down but

268
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:43.980
Lenovo TAB4 8: All I am is

269
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.740
Lenovo TAB4 8: Feels. You know what I mean, still needing something new. Okay.

270
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:57.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just know that, you know, work with a doctor. Don't stop it and try to stop it on your own, you know,

271
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:12.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you have a game plan with the doctor to, you know, get yourself leveled out so that you're not sick and then slowly taper you down in a safe medical way, you know, and then you'll be able to be successful at it.

272
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:15.510
Lenovo TAB4 8: Because

273
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:25.590
Lenovo TAB4 8: Try to find out why it was wrong. You know what I mean. Because, already take me down and I have to go in every day, or what happens is the two years that I was clean like

274
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.200
Lenovo TAB4 8: The they just didn't help me.

275
00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.320
Lenovo TAB4 8: So like we got. I got punished all over again for but I didn't do anything wrong, you know,

276
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, that's like it. Yeah. That way, but

277
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:42.510
Lenovo TAB4 8: I know not to taper down and I'm going in this program, knowing that I want to get off rather quickly.

278
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, well, why are you working with bright heart, tell me anything that you would like to work on with individual therapy with me.

279
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.190
Lenovo TAB4 8: I've noticed a lot of people have noticed they told me like

280
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.130
Lenovo TAB4 8: I don't know how to do it. Like I'm bossy, or I'm rude.

281
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:06.960
I

282
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.260
Lenovo TAB4 8: Some people will say in a nice way. And I'll say it.

283
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.690
Lenovo TAB4 8: I'll just say it bluntly, I probably could sit there and think about it, but I don't

284
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.860
Lenovo TAB4 8: And I'm not trying to be rude or nothing, it's just

285
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:22.530
I know

286
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.250
Lenovo TAB4 8: I don't really know what, what, why, what's the difference why I have to sit there and try to sit nicely when it means the same thing.

287
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:44.370
Lenovo TAB4 8: It would actually take me longer to think of what I'm trying to say, if I had a student tries it nice when I could just see what I need to say right away, but I know that's rude.

288
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.930
Lenovo TAB4 8: Rude like that. I just

289
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So communication style is rude and polite.

290
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.580
Lenovo TAB4 8: Leaf in a hurry.

291
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But, but it doesn't offend me

292
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.370
Lenovo TAB4 8: Not everybody's like me, you know,

293
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:08.310

333
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about

334
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.980

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.200
Lenovo TAB4 8: So I can get out of the house a little bit too.

340
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If I find a job, can I

341
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.370
Lenovo TAB4 8: Change this

342
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With you. Yes. Okay. Very much so.

343
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How about Thursday at 10am

344
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:44.820
Lenovo TAB4 8: Okay, so does that mean 11 k. So, today, they told me that I had to call in at five. So I call that by but then they told me it was actually six o'clock.

345
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so, um,

346
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.300
Lenovo TAB4 8: You're in

347
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My time

348
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.140
Lenovo TAB4 8: Okay, so that means it would be

349
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 11 your time.

350
00:31:54.210 --> 00:32:04.290
Lenovo TAB4 8: I love it. It's 11 for me. So it's seven o'clock. What time is it for me. I probably wouldn't have missed yesterday, I probably should have call it six o'clock.

351
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:12.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If yeah if it was it seven o'clock. Your time because your doctor. He's in New Mexico to

352
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.920
Lenovo TAB4 8: Okay, so then it's the right time. Okay. Yeah.

353
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.470
Lenovo TAB4 8: Well for you. It's 11 o'clock.

354
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.660
Lenovo TAB4 8: And he said,

355
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes.

356
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:39.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's on the right time zone with you. Huh. He's on the right time zone for you. They told me that with you. They didn't say PM Pacific time

357
00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:54.690
Lenovo TAB4 8: They just said five o'clock so city. Okay, yeah. Then I call it and that guy is. He told me he does. Well, I'll give you her number. And then you could call later as well. Isn't it now. He said, No, it's an hour in got it wasn't a different time though, because then I would have missed it.

358
00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, I struggle with.

359
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I struggle with the time it's something so simple. It's an hour, an hour difference but I

360
00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just struggled with that. I don't know why I

361
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:14.580
Lenovo TAB4 8: Didn't say it was. They didn't say it. We had a kind of different data said five o'clock, so I assumed it was five o'clock. If he told me I would have known, but

362
00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.520
Lenovo TAB4 8: I didn't, I didn't know that, like how they how they said about seven I just

363
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.640
Lenovo TAB4 8: They didn't tell me my doctor was in New Mexico, either.

364
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See, when you learn something new every time.

365
00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.810
Lenovo TAB4 8: They, they need a safe Pacific or mountain or you know what I mean, because

366
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.200
Yeah.

367
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:40.020
Lenovo TAB4 8: I didn't know that until I called him because I was trying to mind. I called it an hour early

368
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.090
Lenovo TAB4 8: That's how I found out

369
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh well thank God you're being proactive.

370
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:46.800
Yeah.

371
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:56.910
Lenovo TAB4 8: So I'm saying if it would have been the other way time, I would have missed it all together because they didn't tell me all the time difference, and I should snap in California, but

372
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.320
Lenovo TAB4 8: Like I'm saying my doctors obviously on my, on my time, but it'll tell me any of this.

373
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm sorry about that. I am glad we're I'm glad we're talking about it then.

374
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:18.570
Lenovo TAB4 8: Maybe like you got to always say Pacific time or mountain time it will never affect anything because if I mountain, then I know what I'm doing.

375
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:25.140
Lenovo TAB4 8: Right at least they'll know some people are different because how you're different. You're on a different time.

376
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. Yes.

377
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:33.540
Lenovo TAB4 8: They don't realize they just say the time they don't snap it everybody's not all the same place.

378
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

379
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so I have you set up and scheduled for individual sessions with me.

380
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wednesdays or Thursdays at 10am my time which is 11 o'clock, your time. Okay.

381
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.690
Lenovo TAB4 8: So Wednesday and Thursday my appointments. Okay.

382
00:34:51.750 --> 00:35:10.560

383
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.870
Lenovo TAB4 8: Okay, and hopefully I'll get this

384
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.050
Lenovo TAB4 8: Camera to work better.

385
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At least I can hear you really well.

386
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.200
Lenovo TAB4 8: It hasn't shut off on us.

387
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, not, not once, and sometimes you know it happens.

388
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. I mean, my Internet's been unstable my

389
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I've gone through the same thing. So

390
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely get your phone checked out. And there might be a setting that needs to be changed because of the video.

391
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, we do that.

392
00:35:44.760 --> 00:36:03.540

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your medication.

394
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.110
Lenovo TAB4 8: If you like check his messages all the time. Where does it go to his phone or like how

395
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He does. He

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He'll check and he has somebody else that helps him.

397
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

398
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:28.350
Lenovo TAB4 8: Wait until I get a message from the, from the pharmacy that my medications day or what

399
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.320
