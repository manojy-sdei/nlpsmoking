27
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:43.470
Galaxy J7 Crown: So I've been going through the court process since about October to resolve this whole situation and they're wanting me to seek therapy and counseling and stuff so that they can dismiss my case.

28
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.420
Galaxy J7 Crown: So this was requested from my lawyer and my probation officer.

31
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.430
Dawn Abriel: Well that's significant enough about how much do you drink.

32
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:15.000
Galaxy J7 Crown: Oh now nothing because I can't, it's, it's either drink and go to jail or don't drink and stay out. So that's what I do.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.930
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and you're you're associated with life link right

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.490

84
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.610

85
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:28.950
Dawn Abriel: Alright, um,

86
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:37.230
Dawn Abriel: Are you on a program where you're blowing into a breathalyzer every couple of hours.

87
00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:39.540
Galaxy J7 Crown: No.

88
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.100
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

89
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.520
Galaxy J7 Crown: They haven't given me anything. I just, I'm

90
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:57.510
Galaxy J7 Crown: Okay, so I'm not on probation. It was conditions of my release that I that I see her until my trial is finished. So it's not really like full blown probation conditions of my release.

91
00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:58.680
Dawn Abriel: Great. Okay.

92
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:09.660
Dawn Abriel: There are medicines that I can give you that make it so if you drink, you won't enjoy it. You won't like it.

93
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.640
Dawn Abriel: And I recommend that if

94
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:25.830
Dawn Abriel: If you have a slip that we have an agreement that you get a prescription and start taking that medicine.

95
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.650
Galaxy J7 Crown: Sounds great. I don't want

96
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.980
Galaxy J7 Crown: To drink. I don't like I'm I'm trying to get better.

97
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.680
Galaxy J7 Crown: I'm not trying to go backwards. I

98
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.670
Galaxy J7 Crown: Have been in the hospital for a month it like I was in the hospital for a month, last year.

99
00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:40.110
And

100
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:46.320
Galaxy J7 Crown: It was probably the best. I don't know. I really enjoyed the time there.

101
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:47.970
Galaxy J7 Crown: So,

102
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:52.620
Dawn Abriel: Just because it was a good break from your life. Yeah, yeah.

103
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.990
Galaxy J7 Crown: And there was other people there that

104
00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.940
Galaxy J7 Crown: Were going through the same things that I was going through as well. Right.

105
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:13.560
Dawn Abriel: Yep, that's always very helpful. So this program is set up mostly for opioid use. So I need to change the wordings a little bit. When was the last time you had a drink.

106
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.900
Galaxy J7 Crown: Probably about a month ago.

107
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:31.830
Galaxy J7 Crown: Because I mean, not a month. Um, it's been since I started all this stuff. I haven't been able to, because, well, if a drug test me and I come up positive. I'm going to go to jail. I don't want to go to jail. I have a good job and my kids, so I don't

108
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:39.030
Dawn Abriel: And how long is it, how long is the alcohol that been your way of escaping

109
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.390
Galaxy J7 Crown: I'm a lot

110
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.180
Galaxy J7 Crown: How long, long

111
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.770
Galaxy J7 Crown: Time I lost. I lost my old son.

112
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:58.560
Galaxy J7 Crown: When he was six. That was about 13 years ago. So drinking has been a problem like continuous so

113
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:05.010
Galaxy J7 Crown: I mean, I'm sure that after all this is done. If I don't get the help. I need. I'm just probably going to drink again, you know,

114
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.220
Dawn Abriel: So at least 13 years

115
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.140
Galaxy J7 Crown: Yeah, at least.

116
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:16.200
Dawn Abriel: And did you start to develop a tolerance to add more and more

117
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:17.790
Galaxy J7 Crown: Up. Yeah.

118
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.440
Dawn Abriel: Did you ever have a blackout.

119
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.930
Galaxy J7 Crown: Um, yeah.

120
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.170
Galaxy J7 Crown: Many times

121
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:37.410
Dawn Abriel: And then any medical complications. You don't have any liver disease because of it.

122
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:37.920
No.

123
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:49.680
Galaxy J7 Crown: I probably, I don't know, like, I think there's something wrong with my stomach because my stomach cramps, a lot like I don't know maybe all sorts or something. I do have like stomach pain.

124
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.340
Dawn Abriel: And I assume you're in a safe place right now.

125
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:14.010
Galaxy J7 Crown: Yeah, I have my own place. Um, but the person that all this stuff, you know, like with that happen. The reason why I'm dealing with all this stuff. He still lives at my house.

126
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:21.720
Galaxy J7 Crown: And it doesn't seem to matter what I tried to do. I can't get them out my landlord won't like do it.

127
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:35.340
Galaxy J7 Crown: The officers that come to the house. They know as well because they've seen it, you know, like everything that's happened, they won't help me do anything like nobody will help me do anything. I can't even a victim because he will. He was the

128
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:50.100
Galaxy J7 Crown: They say that he was the victim, but they let him stay here because, well, he was the victim. So they just made an exception, so that I could be here so that I didn't have to look for anywhere to live, which it's my place my kids reside here too. So they let me stay here.

129
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.760
Dawn Abriel: What is just miserable.

130
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:07.050
Galaxy J7 Crown: It is, and I'm tired of it. And he continues to do the same crap that he's been doing like all this time and I made changes. Whenever I went to rehab.

131
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:15.180
Galaxy J7 Crown: To that hospital and he does the same things. He was doing before. So if I continue to do better. These those stays in the same place. It's not going to help me.

132
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:21.720
Dawn Abriel: Well, it's not. But it doesn't have to hurt you. You don't have to let it hurt you.

133
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:40.440
Dawn Abriel: And that's what the therapy is for look Heather, you can get therapy to three times a week. You can you can saturate yourself and get and really take care of this in an intense way and

134
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:48.690
Dawn Abriel: And you're going to need it and you're not going to get therapy, you're not going to give you any better therapy than the therapist. I'm giving you

135
00:38:49.500 --> 00:39:05.490
Dawn Abriel: And you're never going to get it. Any cheaper. Believe me, you have an opportunity here that if you don't just grab hold with both hands, you're going to be really sorry. You didn't because this is an amazing chance that you have

136
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.750
Galaxy J7 Crown: And I plan on taking advantage of it.

137
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:10.980
Good.

138
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:16.380
Dawn Abriel: How old were you when you started using any illicit drug

139
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:23.400
Galaxy J7 Crown: I guess the first time I use marijuana was like about 1516

140
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:37.830
Galaxy J7 Crown: I experienced with stuff like cocaine or whatever. But that's, like, I don't know, maybe like in my 20s or whatever but not like anything like that. Now, drinking is the only thing that I really do for did

141
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:52.320
Dawn Abriel: And it has obviously resulted in relationship and work problems or just relationship.

142
00:39:52.320 --> 00:40:03.690
Galaxy J7 Crown: Problems. Well, the relationship. Okay so me drinking is not the cause of our relationship problem. My boyfriend is from another country and

143
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:13.170
Galaxy J7 Crown: He has a family over there, which he lied to me about. So he's been sending her money and sending her nude pictures and they've been exchanging this and he lives at my house, doing all this stuff to me.

144
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:20.190
Galaxy J7 Crown: And I'm just if he's going to be here. That's fine if he wants to do things right but if he doesn't he wants to do that stuff. He needs to leave.

145
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.330
Galaxy J7 Crown: I didn't ask for his double life and neither did our daughter that we share together.

146
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:32.430
Galaxy J7 Crown: So if he can't be honest and he can't be truthful and he can't be the person that he said he was going to be, then I don't want nothing to do with them. I shouldn't have to live like that.

147
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:41.460
Galaxy J7 Crown: Wondering if while he's at work. He's talking to her on the phone, he sends her money and he barely even helps me at all. He doesn't help me with my child, but he's still helps them.

148
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:53.310
Galaxy J7 Crown: Like all his money goes there and I'm just stuck here to fend for myself, I have a good job. So I'm not crying about the money because I worked for myself, but the attention and the section that I need from him. I'm not getting

149
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.170
Galaxy J7 Crown: What's wrong.

150
00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.160

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:22.410
Dawn Abriel: How many days. Have you been in detox programs before you said there was one that you went to

157
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:30.960
Galaxy J7 Crown: Um, yeah, it was hospitalized for about a month and I had to detox while I was there because, well, I couldn't use anything. You know, so

158
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:42.150
Galaxy J7 Crown: They had they offered my senior doctor. Every day they we had therapy sessions like it was a group thing where we had topics that we talked about every day and we share, you know, if we wanted to.

159
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:49.290
Galaxy J7 Crown: Just stuff like that. It was really helpful. Okay, I'll actually go back there. If we could

160
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:54.240
Dawn Abriel: And

161
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.170
Galaxy J7 Crown: I learned there.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.350

164
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:28.980
Galaxy J7 Crown: Because if I don't take them. I can't fall asleep and I don't stay asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night. I can't. I wake up, tired in the morning, an anxiety wakes me up in the morning. My son is like cramping. I feel nervous. My heart is racing. I get headaches my life I want to vomit.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:38.910
Galaxy J7 Crown: Like something I feel like something really bad's gonna happen. And I just can't stay asleep. I get up because I can't feel. I can't live like that.

167
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:49.530
Dawn Abriel: And that the hospitalization that you had recently that was for a physical problem but you detox while you were in there.

168
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:50.940

171
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:10.590
Galaxy J7 Crown: I guess I was just talking crazy and they call the ambulance to come pick me up and they took me out there.

172
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:19.530
Galaxy J7 Crown: So at first it was not by choice, but afterwards. I wasn't so you know opposed to it.

Dawn Abriel: Bone problems thyroid problems, diabetes, I mean,

186
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:21.510
Galaxy J7 Crown: I have an underactive thyroid. When I was in that hospital. They did a lot of blood work and they were giving me medicine for it.

187
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:40.800
Galaxy J7 Crown: But after that stuff was gone. And I was working with another organization. And this man just never he was supposed to meet with me once a week, but he just stopped calling me like he never came back and never talked to me again. So I wasn't able to like to get those medications again.

188
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.800
Dawn Abriel: And you don't have a primary care doctor unless

189
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:54.600
Galaxy J7 Crown: Los Alamos, really. I mean, I go to the doctor if something's wrong, but I don't really have like a somebody that I've really see like all the time.

190
00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:04.740

192
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:31.380
Dawn Abriel: You're not every single cell in your body needs to have the hormone that the thyroid makes to pull sugar into the cell to use for energy every cell in your body needs that thyroid medicine.

193
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:41.640
Galaxy J7 Crown: That's probably why I don't have any energy then I'm tired all the time. I don't want to do anything at work. I'm not tired. I mean, I get paid to do my job. But when I come home. I just want to sit on the couch.

194
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:42.660
I don't want to do anything.

195
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:51.720
Dawn Abriel: Well, it's you know, it's a complex issue. It's I'm just trying to encourage you that you've got to get a primary care doctor
