Debbie Barker: Come over here.

452
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.750
Chris Alliman MD: I need to know if that hurts while you do it.

453
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.950
Debbie Barker: No, not really good

454
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:49.230
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so that's about it. I can't listen to your heart or lungs. I can't do any of that other stuff.

455
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.070
Debbie Barker: Right.

456
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:59.430
Chris Alliman MD: I can, I am watching your nervous system from your facial expressions and of course we're talking so I know your coherence. So there are things that I can do that way too.

457
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:02.910
Chris Alliman MD: So that's good.

458
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:04.950
Chris Alliman MD: All right.

459
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.680
Chris Alliman MD: When was the last time to take the oxy codeine pills.

460
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.360
Debbie Barker: Last night.

461
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.880
Chris Alliman MD: All right. How are you doing, because I would have I would imagine you would have taken some today.

462
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:25.620
Debbie Barker: On fixing do mine, my knees or bother money's in my back in my hand. Okay.

463
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.240
Chris Alliman MD: When was the last time to to use the heroin to smoke in the

464
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.130
Debbie Barker: Morning. Okay.

465
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.000
Chris Alliman MD: All right.

466
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.550
Chris Alliman MD: How much do you know

467
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.580
Chris Alliman MD: How much do you know about Suboxone

468
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.330
Debbie Barker: I don't know very much about it. Okay.

469
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.910
Chris Alliman MD: So the way Suboxone works is that it's a long acting opiate

470
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:59.100
Chris Alliman MD: All right, just like the heroin and the hydrocodone and the oxycodone are opiates.

471
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:06.690
Chris Alliman MD: Right Suboxone is an opiate but but the others are short acting while Suboxone is long acting

472
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.810
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so you don't take Suboxone nearly as much as those short acting one

473
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.960
Debbie Barker: That would be wonderful. I get started to taking pills.

474
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:16.920
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

475
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:27.930
Debbie Barker: They have a whole bunch of stuff. And I just throw them all away and I take this little bit now and do just fine. I get my son, they call the time and it just wasn't worth it.

476
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:38.400
Chris Alliman MD: Now here's the other thing on Suboxone pushes off the oxy codeine and the hydrocodone and the heroin from the receptors in the body.

477
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.660
Debbie Barker: What that

478
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:47.010
Chris Alliman MD: Means is that if you take the the the Suboxone too soon it will kick you into really bad withdrawals.

479
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.110
OK. OK.

480
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.180
Debbie Barker: Good.

481
00:31:51.540 --> 00:32:01.080
Chris Alliman MD: So generally what we need to have you do is we need to have you wait until you're a bit uncomfortable till you're in moderate withdrawals.

482
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.830
Chris Alliman MD: Before I

483
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.200
Debbie Barker: Take the Suboxone okay

484
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.010
Chris Alliman MD: Have you ever been in moderate withdrawals.

485
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:10.560
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

486
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.830
Chris Alliman MD: What does that feel like for you.

487
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.140
Debbie Barker: Everything arts

488
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:16.980
Everything.

489
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:19.260
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

490
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.190
Chris Alliman MD: You get cramping with it.

491
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.410
Chris Alliman MD: Yes, yeah.

492
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.090
Debbie Barker: Yeah, especially with my life.

493
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:35.790
Chris Alliman MD: Often people get like goosebumps, maybe a little bit of sweat, they'll feel nauseated stomachs kind of crappy

494
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.910
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, all these things. Yeah, that's when you then take the Suboxone

495
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:50.310
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, if you take it before that it's going to kick those withdrawals into the really, really bad end of things.

496
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.720
Debbie Barker: We don't want that.

497
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:58.110
Chris Alliman MD: We don't want that. Now, generally what we understand is that it takes about

498
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.840
Chris Alliman MD: Two days to get into moderate withdrawals two to three days.

499
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:04.680
Debbie Barker: Okay.

500
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:11.220
Chris Alliman MD: So that means going without the short acting opiates no oxy codeine hydrocodone or heroin.

501
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.880
Chris Alliman MD: For about two to three days before taking the Suboxone

502
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.090
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, what do you think about that.

503
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:20.190
Debbie Barker: I think I could do that.

504
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:21.780
Chris Alliman MD: I think you could do that.

505
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:29.100
Chris Alliman MD: Oh, good, good. There are some specific instructions about how to take the Suboxone

506
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:40.200
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, when you're starting off like this. So, initially you take you take one film when you're in moderate withdrawals.

507
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:41.160
Debbie Barker: Okay.

508
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:47.160
Chris Alliman MD: And then two to four hours later, you take another half of the film, if you need to.

509
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:48.390
Debbie Barker: Okay.

510
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.730
Chris Alliman MD: If you don't need to. You don't take it.

511
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:51.960
Debbie Barker: You need to

512
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:59.070
Chris Alliman MD: And then two to four hours after that you take another half of film, if you need to.

513
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.100
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so that's the first day.

514
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:12.150
Chris Alliman MD: On the second day, you take, you start with the total from the first day. So if you only took one film. The first day that's what you start with on the second day

515
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:13.080
Debbie Barker: Okay.

516
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.170
Chris Alliman MD: But if you took two films. The first day that's what you start with the second day

517
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:28.650
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And then again, two to four hours later, you can take half and two to four hours after that you can take another half

518
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.300
Debbie Barker: Okay.

519
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.520
Debbie Barker: This is all

520
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:37.470
Chris Alliman MD: I'm going to email these instructions to you. Okay, so you'll have them.

521
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:39.870
Debbie Barker: All

522
00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:49.890
Chris Alliman MD: On day three, you take the total from day two. And you can split those up during the day. But there's no extra films during the day.

523
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.630
Debbie Barker: Okay.

524
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:58.830
Chris Alliman MD: And then day for you just take two films during the day, probably one in the morning, one in the evening.

525
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:01.170
Debbie Barker: Okay.

526
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.700
Chris Alliman MD: And then we'll check in to see where things are at and how you're doing.

527
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.560
Debbie Barker: Where they help me sleep.

528
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:16.860
Chris Alliman MD: Um, so they don't work specifically for sleep. What they help out with is of course the withdrawal symptoms.

529
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:17.910
Chris Alliman MD: Like cravings.

530
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.920
Chris Alliman MD: And they also help out with pain.

531
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:20.880
Debbie Barker: So if

532
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.600
Chris Alliman MD: Those are the things that are keeping you awake, then yes, it'll help out.

533
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:29.340
Debbie Barker: Okay. Oh, nice man. Good, good. No.

534
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:35.940
Chris Alliman MD: I have an email address for you as Debbie Barker 753 at GMAIL. COM

535
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.890

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:43.200
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm going to send that information to the list of how to take the medication.

537
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:49.860
Chris Alliman MD: OK, the next thing we need to do is figure out a good group for you to be part of

538
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.120
Debbie Barker: To participate in

539
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.340

540
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.360
Chris Alliman MD: I'd like to offer the Friday 12 noon group.

541
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.840
Chris Alliman MD: All right. Would that work out for you.

542
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.660
Debbie Barker: Now that would work out good.

543
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.120
Chris Alliman MD: I think that would be a really good one for you.

544
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:19.080
Chris Alliman MD: So today, when you called into bright heart health. And that's going to be the same process that you'll do for Friday for the

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.260
Chris Alliman MD: Yep. Yeah.

549
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:41.250
Chris Alliman MD: Okay so calling bright heart health through that phone number is just like calling the doctor's office or just like going in the front door of the doctor's office.

550
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:48.000
Chris Alliman MD: Right one, there's always align and two, there's usually paperwork that has to happen.

551

Chris Alliman MD: Right. So if you can call five minutes before group, you're not going to get through the check in before before group start

552
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.200
Chris Alliman MD: Right. That's like, that's why we have you call in half an hour ahead of time.

Debbie Barker: Great.

571
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.930

Debbie Barker: But then I would help out a lot. I used to be able to manage it paint head. Why, you know, when I was younger, but that takes takes a lot of concentration and a lot of practice.

573
00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.650
Chris Alliman MD: Absolutely it does. And I think this would be a wonderful person.
