00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.419
Dominique Pozo: Hi there, what happened.

2
00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.840
Martin Price: My bad. I like God and about 610. I'm sorry. I was like in zoom meetings all day and times of day for me.

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.769
Oh,

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.870
Martin Price: And had to go through the

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.570
Martin Price: Virtual clinic twice because the number was working. So here we are. I apologize.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.660
Dominique Pozo: Well, you're here, it's okay.

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
Dominique Pozo: Good. Well, let's just dive right in. Since we only have about 25 minutes left.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.270
Dominique Pozo: So how's it going, how has it been since we met last I know

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.930
Dominique Pozo: We've we were talking about, you know, I know that one of the themes was, you know, reaching out to women and as opposed to just figuring out how to

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.030
Martin Price: How to find myself.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.720
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.520
Dominique Pozo: How to find joy with yourself as well as connection with others. But really,

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.920
Martin Price: Yeah, I'm doing some of both

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:07.230
Martin Price: I'm just like, really fighting my ego, which keeps attacking me for being so stupid. In the previous relationship, you know,

15
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.790
Dominique Pozo: And

16
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.610
Martin Price: I should have known better. You know, I should have listened to my brands. I should have seen this sign or I should have seen that sign and

17
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.070
Martin Price: And I know

18
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.580
Martin Price: It's really weird. It's like

19
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.400
Martin Price: I, you know,

20
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.670
Martin Price: What my counselor told me to do is just all you can do is intervene on yourself and pray, you know, and recognize that

21
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.560
Martin Price: It doesn't help you to sit there and condemn yourself to

22
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.510
Martin Price: And

23
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.940
Martin Price: You know, call yourself a dunce and think of yourself as being unlovable, and

24
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.400
Martin Price: And

25
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.950
Martin Price: I don't know. And then I just like

26
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.770
Martin Price: Think that it's karma because of, you know, things that I've done in the past, you know, it's all coming back to me it's just

27
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.860
Martin Price: And it's not

28
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.950
Martin Price: I don't know. It just seems to happen like between three and six in the afternoon. I call it the witching hour

29
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.790
Oh,

30
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.060
Martin Price: Yeah, I miss it. Right.

31
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.830
Martin Price: I don't know what else to do, except for to just keep intervening, you know, until it kind of wears off and goes away. I hope

32
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:37.740
Dominique Pozo: Well here's the thing. I actually, I have a different take on on this and i i think it's all valid. It's just trying to another angle to that.

33
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:48.720
Dominique Pozo: Sometimes these voices that come in, they actually have a meaningful message. And if we don't, if I don't, I know from my own therapy and working with others. If we don't

34
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:59.340
Dominique Pozo: push them away and try to shut them up and actually listen, maybe they will start to quiet down but when they're, they're kind of pushed away they scream louder sometimes so

35
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.420
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm

36
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.580
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm wondering, have you ever done any empty chair work.

37
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.700
Martin Price: No, never heard of that one.

38
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.190
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. Well, it's a gestalt technique is very effective, I think, and

39
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:23.190
Dominique Pozo: What a person does this. So what we could do is we'd have the empty chair and that would be the part of you that voice that's calling you a dunce and

40
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.090
Dominique Pozo: Connie, this and that. And then you take a moment to

41
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.850
Dominique Pozo: Set the chair up and imagine that that part of you is there and have a start to have a dialogue with it and then

42
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:45.660
Dominique Pozo: You're going to switch. If you're open to doing this and and exploring it and then you will become that voice and then talk to the chair that you were previously sitting in and actually just start talking and whatever you want to say.

43
00:03:46.830 --> 00:04:02.730
Dominique Pozo: To kind of give this part of you because we all have these various parts and this sounds like a critic part but to get quiet space to just speak and hear, you know, what is it that what is, what is that part of you actually really want to say what's the message.

44
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.070
Dominique Pozo: You want to give it a go. Yeah.

45
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.700
Martin Price: I'll try.

46
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.770
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. So if you can find another chair somewhere in your space.

47
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.790
You Michigan.

48
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.180
Martin Price: Okay.

49
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.220
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

50
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.270
Dominique Pozo: Would you like to speak to this part first or do you just want to become that part right away. What would you like to do you

51
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.410
Martin Price: Mean the self critical part of me.

52
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.050
Martin Price: That's pretty easy to do.

53
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.390
Dominique Pozo: To become that part.

54
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.220
Martin Price: Yeah, the critical part

55
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.040
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so God. Would you be open to me interviewing the critical part

56
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.040
Dominique Pozo: And talking to him a little bit. Okay. So go ahead and switch chairs, because we really want to make this distinction. It helps the safe.

57
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:26.730
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay. So go ahead and just imagine into this part, you know, tell me, tell me a little bit. What do you look like and and does he have another name or should we just call him the critic, what do we want to call them.

58
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.900
Martin Price: And the critic, the voice. It doesn't let me or maybe it's like the voice that

59
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.000
Martin Price: Says that you never learn. I'll never learn.

60
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.700
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm gonna

61
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.890
Martin Price: Voice of my dad or something.

62
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.620
Dominique Pozo: Oh okay i'm gonna i'm going to interview this part a little bit. Okay, so

63
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.010
Dominique Pozo: So I hear that you are the critic in in Martin's head. Is that correct,

64
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.080
Yeah.

65
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.830
Dominique Pozo: We are you willing to tell me a little bit about yourself.

66
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.360
Martin Price: Marty scripts are many times, and he's doing it again and

67
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.960
Martin Price: He's done it again and you know

68
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.360
Martin Price: Leave

69
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.980
Martin Price: Know this woman's fabrications and

70
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.480
Martin Price: You know, what do we call it a

71
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.780
Martin Price: That was like a dumb stunt or something.

72
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.690
Dominique Pozo: Gosh, I, you know, when I hear you. It sounds like you really care about him.

73
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.270
Martin Price: Yeah.

74
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:54.480
Dominique Pozo: I hear that. Maybe. Maybe. Sometimes. You're harsh and you call them names and I hear that you actually don't want him to repeat a pattern. Is that true

75
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.930
Martin Price: Right.

76
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.900
Martin Price: So you care. Yeah.

77
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.650
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think what I'm understanding is that your delivery gets kind of annoying to Marty.

78
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.280
Dominique Pozo: Do you think that this is the only way he'll listen because he's not getting it.

79
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.920
Martin Price: Just ever gets it.

80
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.660
Dominique Pozo: Number.

81
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.400
Martin Price: 60 he would have gotten it.

82
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.760
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm going to invite you critic to think about something he has got some because never is a huge word. How has he ever had.

83
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.800
Dominique Pozo: A relationship with a woman that you actually

84
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.760
Dominique Pozo: That you think when relatively well

85
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.890
Martin Price: Yeah.

86
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.660
Dominique Pozo: Well, who within

87
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.160
Martin Price: The second life.

88
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.200
Dominique Pozo: What was good about it.

89
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.130
Martin Price: Just really well.

90
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.370
Martin Price: They both love each other and

91
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.510
Martin Price: That was kind of came to an end.

92
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.500
Martin Price: Because of just some unfortunate circumstances.

93
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:27.750
Dominique Pozo: So if you were to tell Marty, the whole of mighty what what you recognize that he did well in that relationship, what would it be specifically

94
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.920
Martin Price: I mean, he was

95
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.140
Martin Price: Almost over generous to a fault but

96
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.360
Martin Price: He took care of her as best as he could, and her daughter.

97
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:54.360
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds to me like you recognize that Marty, he knows how to nurture.

98
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.190
Yeah.

99
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.650
Martin Price: Never

100
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.440
Martin Price: stood up for himself. And then in the end when he started to stand up for himself. That was like a sea change in the relationship. It was like setting boundaries. After

101
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.950
Martin Price: You know 17 years of not setting boundaries and always apologizing, and then

102
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.090
Martin Price: She didn't like that.

103
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:42.660
Dominique Pozo: You know, it's interesting critic, as I hear you and watch you. I keep getting this vision of an eagle, you're almost like you've got these eagle eyes that are watching everything and you're so perceptive, and you're really looking out for Martin, it seems to me.

104
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.000
Martin Price: Yeah, but I could see, I would get annoying.

105
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.570
Martin Price: Right.

106
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.480
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't want him to do this again repeat the same thing.

107
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.110
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. He mentioned something

108
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:19.380
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah, I'm in the beginning of the session Martin mentioned something that it's that your voice is similar to his dad's voice. Do you think that you're, you're kind of like his dad.

109
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.740
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

110
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.400
Martin Price: Which and there's a good side to that, but there's just like a very

111
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.110
Martin Price: I only really engaged and then

112
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:40.650
Martin Price: When it was when I'd messed up, and he criticized me, you know, it wasn't a lot of healthy engagement.

113
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:49.620
Dominique Pozo: So are you talking about Martin's dad now or, uh huh, uh huh. So it sounds like you really took on a lot of that.

114
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.180
Dominique Pozo: Just being the default often

115
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:12.300
Dominique Pozo: Well, if you had one message for Martin just clear really clear, concise and you know he's with us right now. So he's going to hear it. What would you say just very clearly and concisely.

116
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.560
Martin Price: Yourself and follow your heart.

117
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:18.780
Martin Price: What

118
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.480
Dominique Pozo: What if that gets him into another pickle with a woman.

119
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.470
Martin Price: Would hope he learned his lesson by now.

120
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.750
Martin Price: That you know

121
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.120
Martin Price: You can't

122
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.630
Martin Price: Either you can't find love or that you can't have expectations.

123
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.370
Martin Price: From helping somebody that they're going to reciprocate in a way that you want them to

124
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:04.140
Dominique Pozo: So what kind of agreement, could you make with Martin if he follows your advice to just forgive themselves and follow his heart.

125
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:18.720
Dominique Pozo: Yet your hope is, he doesn't repeat patterns that he's done in the past. What agreement, can you make with him because you're really driving them crazy he's, he hears you he hears you loud and clear. I'm wondering if you can make an agreement with them.

126
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.100
Martin Price: All I would like to know.

127
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.140
Martin Price: If I could just see him be more patient

128
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.670
And

129
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.200
Martin Price: Not try and jump in and be a savior again.

130
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.120
Dominique Pozo: Oh, so you're you're inviting him to be more patient

131
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.310
Martin Price: Or

132
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.700
Martin Price: advising him or telling him.

133
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.140
Dominique Pozo: What would that look like if he'd been impatient now.

134
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:09.060
Martin Price: Too bad you know I do see him following some same patterns in the current like online Pen, pen pal relationship.

135
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.690
Dominique Pozo: Like what's, what's an example of one pattern.

136
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.450
Martin Price: No kind of complaining about

137
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.120
Martin Price: Not necessarily how miserable. She is but she can't

138
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.410
Martin Price: Sleep like

139
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:38.910
Martin Price: You know she's up for three or four hours a night can't sleep worried

140
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.150
Martin Price: As problems that their son.

141
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.980
Martin Price: And I can't fix that.

142
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.990
Martin Price: And I shouldn't try you know

143
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.060
Martin Price: Nice things but

144
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.520
Martin Price: Yeah, I just have like this Savior kind of side of me.

145
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.310
Martin Price: Or he has he has this

146
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.960
Martin Price: You know he's always trying to

147
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.970
Martin Price: Keep people from having to feel their pain.

148
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.750
Dominique Pozo: What do you think

149
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:33.660
Dominique Pozo: He Martin was telling me that between three and five is like the witching hour. It's when it's, it seems to me that your voice is loud as you're like,

150
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:44.730
Dominique Pozo: Screaming somehow the, the air is clear enough that you can just kind of bombard him. What could you do different maybe for the next week around that time.

151
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.310
Dominique Pozo: Between three and five.

152
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:02.670
Martin Price: Every

153
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.620
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I wonder

154
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:17.250
Dominique Pozo: I wonder what Martin has to say. Shall we switch roles. Now, are you, are you willing to hear, maybe some of what's good, what's come up for him as he

155
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.540
Martin Price: Wasn't sure

156
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.260
OK.

157
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:20.670
Dominique Pozo: OK.

158
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.720
Dominique Pozo: So just take a few deep breaths. You're out of the full on critical

159
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.260
Dominique Pozo: You're back to my team.

160
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:50.220
Dominique Pozo: And without processing with me yet. Just go ahead and see if you can turn to the chair and anything you want to say to the critic from what you heard this is your time to speak, you're not going to be interrupted. HE'S NOT GOING TO TALK BACK TO YOU. HE JUST GOING TO LISTEN.

161
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.250
Dominique Pozo: What do you want, is there anything you don't

162
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.570
Martin Price: Like, I know you're right but like

163
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:04.230
Martin Price: Continually bringing this up right now is just rubbing salt in it.

164
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.410
Martin Price: IT'S NOT HELPING ME FEEL BETTER any better about myself.

165
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.260
Martin Price: It's like the past and I know I have to

166
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:25.980
Martin Price: do everything I can to save money and, you know, think about me and my retirement.

167
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.820
Martin Price: But I do get lonely and i a

168
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:39.900
Martin Price: It'd be really nice to have you know someone to be with back can Wisconsin.

169
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.180
Martin Price: And I guess I've

170
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.870
Martin Price: Really been taught a hard lesson and I

171
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.570
Martin Price: Lots of times I want retribution, but there's really nothing I can do.

172
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:54.930
Martin Price: But

173
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:57.870
Martin Price: Just constantly

174
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.620
Martin Price: Bashing myself or dashing me

175
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.700
Martin Price: For this predicament is like

176
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.190
Martin Price: Taking away my

177
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.820
Martin Price: Will that move on.

178
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.320
Dominique Pozo: Are you willing to go sit in in the critic chair and respond to that.

179
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.220
Dominique Pozo: Going to respond to mighty from everything you just

180
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.440
Martin Price: You're just going to do it again if you don't

181
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:52.920
Martin Price: If you think you have to like if you can't let other people just experienced pain and not try and jump in and save them all the time either financially or emotionally or

182
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.770
Martin Price: Whatever.

183
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.840
Martin Price: Just because

184
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.140
Martin Price: You want to be in a relationship so bad.

185
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:15.090
Dominique Pozo: Critic. I have a question for you. What do you do when you're lonely. It sounds like you really got a grip on how to take care of yourself and do you know you set those boundaries. How do you

186
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.490
Dominique Pozo: Master was Esther.

187
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.960
Martin Price: Purposes wife.

188
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.160
My dad's

189
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.340
Martin Price: Like through thick or thin. She was always, you know, therefore him.

190
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.300
Uh huh.

191
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.890
Dominique Pozo: Do you think that um

192
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.510
Dominique Pozo: How does that work for you, how did you have such a supportive dynamic with us to

193
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.360
Martin Price: The very devoted woman she like step by her she

194
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.630
Martin Price: She loved me and she stood by me.

195
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.930
Martin Price: When things were bad.

196
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:05.220
Dominique Pozo: I don't know where this came from. And please, I pray that you, this isn't sound insulting to Esther. But I'm wondering what she really obedient to

197
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.010
Dominique Pozo: Kind of compliant or whatever you

198
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:20.910
Martin Price: Are moments of defiance, but she was really there to hold the family together and then kind of be there for him in the end.

199
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.850
Martin Price: You know, took care of him.

200
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.310
Dominique Pozo: Saying you really didn't have much experience of being alone because you had Esther.

201
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:40.890
Dominique Pozo: Can you imagine, can you imagine what it's like for Marty when he does have those lonely moments because he doesn't have an ester. He doesn't

202
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.020
Dominique Pozo: Right now.

203
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.670
Dominique Pozo: What do you think that's like, can you imagine what that would be.

204
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.770
Martin Price: Like being in the world without

205
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.770
Martin Price: Having a like intimate companion that you knew was on your side.

206
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:17.400
Dominique Pozo: So, does it make sense to you why he keeps reaching out and trying and he's doing is making efforts and and he's learning

207
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.820
Martin Price: That's true. I've never had to go through that.

208
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.520
Martin Price: You guys keep trying.

209
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.050
Dominique Pozo: Well, if

210
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.210
Dominique Pozo: If you could say something encouraging to him, what would you want to say.

211
00:20:47.520 --> 00:21:01.560
Dominique Pozo: Because he's been really feeling beat down by you honestly. He seems like he's just, it's kind of on the edge of it's like it's starting to to hit his self esteem. So I think he needs. He needs a some encouragement action.

212
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:16.020
Martin Price: I've never had to go through what you're going through. And so I realize it's probably pretty hard for you and I wish you the best and hope you find your Esther.

213
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.040
Dominique Pozo: I think this is a good time to switch seats.

214
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.710
Dominique Pozo: What was that like to hear about

215
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:50.580
Martin Price: It's kind of making sense of it. That was when my second wife was like so upset with

216
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.730
Martin Price: My schizophrenia daughter that

217
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.130
Martin Price: She just created her and was kind of like

218
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:10.980
Martin Price: I kind of felt like I got left with the choice of like daughter or her right and what she would say was like, I'm not asked her, I'm not asked her, you know, like she was basically saying she wasn't going to hang in there and

219
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.140
Martin Price: So that makes sense to me.

220
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.030
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

221
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.220
Dominique Pozo: That makes sense to me to you had a father who

222
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.220
Dominique Pozo: Didn't experience what you're experiencing and you really internalized his voice.

223
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:53.220
Martin Price: Yeah, he like my mom was, I don't know if you caught Victorian or old fashioned, but she just stuck hung in there through thick and thin. I mean, she drew a couple of ultimatums with them, like he had to stop drinking or he had to stop smoking. But he

224
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.340
Martin Price: I don't know. I'm part of it, like, people would say, well,

225
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.000
Martin Price: She didn't love herself, but another part of me says, well, she loved it herself enough to

226
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:07.980
Martin Price: You know,

227
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.010
Martin Price: Endure, that kind of thing, you know, she had a pretty strong.

228
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.860
Martin Price: Sense of faith, that's for sure.

229
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.150
Martin Price: So it's hard to say, you know, but like

230
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.450
Martin Price: Pam my second wife, she like

231
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:32.040
Martin Price: She had like a like a real tough upbringing, with an alcoholic father who

232
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:33.870
Martin Price: Basically

233
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.400
Martin Price: Like lost their house and a lie to go live in Section eight housing and so

234
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.800
Martin Price: She was she'd been through.

235
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:51.720
Martin Price: I don't know. She just wasn't she certainly wasn't a nester you know she wasn't going to hang around

236
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:54.510
Martin Price: I guess I should like

237
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.860
Martin Price: And so she she told me she was going to move out and then let me

238
00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.110
Martin Price: Until I like developed a more healthy relationship with my daughter, you know,

239
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.520
Martin Price: And

240
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:24.090
Martin Price: But that was the same thing. Like she like it. The same thing with their first husband. She waited till he was like on vacation or something and just packed up and left. So that's actually given me too. So I guess I shouldn't have assumed I was going to be any different.

241
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.840
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's bring it back to the critic for a moment. So

242
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:46.380
Dominique Pozo: What can you do differently between three and five just tried an experiment in the next week since that's the tough time. What can you do to have a different experience.

243
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:58.290
Martin Price: Like I go to the dog park with my friend at 430. I don't know what it is about my daughter says the same thing. She says between, like, three and five and three and six that just like

244
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:05.670
Martin Price: The tough time of the day. It's like your maybe your mind gets all stressed out or something and

245
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.400
Martin Price: But yeah, I call it the witching hours witching hour

246
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.290
Martin Price: And I go up and down. But yeah, like

247
00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:25.770
Martin Price: I did find this lady in Milwaukee, and we both seem to like each other and we like text each other pictures and I

248
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.140
Martin Price: I just like

249
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.230
Martin Price: Have this reflex in me. Like if

250
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.430
Martin Price: It's not just

251
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:49.950
Martin Price: Some of them in their relationship with it's like I just had this relationship that if someone's hurting or whatever. I always try and swoop in and help

252
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.910
Martin Price: And I guess it's most often my significant other, but it was also my daughter, you know,

253
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:08.550
Martin Price: That was what my second wife gets upset about was that I was paying more attention so much attention to my daughter that, you know, I wasn't available in your relationship.

254
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.570
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think being of service is clearly

255
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.930
Dominique Pozo: Not, you know, a natural thing for you.

256
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:36.750
Dominique Pozo: And maybe starting to redefine what does being of service really mean or look like and you know and as I've heard you also say, oh, here I am swooping in as the rescuer again and it doesn't sound to me that rescue someone is really, you know, has the highest

257
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:44.850
Dominique Pozo: Is the highest definition of service. So maybe that's something to think about in the next week. What are different ways you can be of service.

258
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.560
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like one guy explained it service versus sacrifice. You know, it's like

259
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.090
Dominique Pozo: Right, not being a martyr.

260
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:51.810
Martin Price: Right.

261
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.380
Martin Price: You're not God, and people need to experience their pain.

262
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.330
Martin Price: To grow.

263
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:05.610
Dominique Pozo: Well, I have an idea. You know, when you say witching hour. It's such a great metaphor. You know, when I think of witches. I think of rituals.

264
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:21.600
Dominique Pozo: And so because it's the. Those are the witching hours, maybe you could create a ritual for yourself like sitting down and making a list of, you know, what are the other ways to be a service or being of service to someone. During that time, somehow, really.

265
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.000
Dominique Pozo: Making a ritual out of

266
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.670
Dominique Pozo: Through that those hours.

267
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.090
Martin Price: Like a gratitude list or calling somebody or

268
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.410
Dominique Pozo: Something. Yeah.

269
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.940
Martin Price: I have been doing

270
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.580
Martin Price: So I'm working at home.

271
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.140
Martin Price: And I've been trying to do the new nickname meetings and those help

272
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.180
Martin Price: You know, I think part of it is just like this whole lockdown thing, you know, we're also isolated.

273
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.770
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, as it

274
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.060
Martin Price: Was a cope with.

275
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.520
Martin Price: You know, social

276
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:51.270
Worker.

277
00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:03.660
Martin Price: It's like anyway. Well, I apologize for being late. This is, this is pretty helpful to me so. Oh.

278
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.280
Dominique Pozo: Good. Good. I'm glad.

279
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.400
Martin Price: I came. Yeah, it does. It does.

280
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.670
Martin Price: Yeah, my I just get so tired of it. You know, going into that. Do you know

281
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:27.930
Dominique Pozo: I'm curious what happens in the next few days. Because often, if there's a voice that's just nagging and nagging, it's like it just needs to be heard and I know the more that I push those voices away the louder, they get so

282
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:38.430
Martin Price: Yeah, lots of times, I'll just rely on my God just have added man. I'm tired of like intervening and praying. It's like nothing I do seems to want to change it.

283
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:44.610
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, no, I think, giving it space. And let's see, we'll see what happens in the next couple days.

284
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:54.300
Dominique Pozo: And I'm just pulling up my calendar here. So do you want to do you want to meet on the 27th, which would be two weeks away.

285
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.730
Martin Price: Yeah, I need like a

286
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.110
Martin Price: Reminder system or something like that.

287
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.390
Dominique Pozo: I

288
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.760
Martin Price: Set up like a calendar reminder

289
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.920
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, something

290
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.920
Dominique Pozo: I don't know, maybe you can ask the virtual clinic, if they would be

291
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.300
Martin Price: Good to

292
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.170
Dominique Pozo: 30 minutes before the session or something like that.

293
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.320
Martin Price: I've never gotten good enough with my cell phone to have it.

294
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.300
Martin Price: I think it'll, you know, like on your email.

295
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.350
Martin Price: It'll work, it'll remind you if a meetings coming up in 15 minutes

296
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.840
