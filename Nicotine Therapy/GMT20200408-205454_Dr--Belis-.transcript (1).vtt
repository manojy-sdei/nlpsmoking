Dr. Belis Aladag: She's here for methamphetamine use disorder. So there's no cures activity.

3
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hello.

4
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hello amber. I'm Dr. Doug, how are you

5
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.120
Amber Prior: I'm good, how are you

6
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good, good, good. So welcome to bright heart. Is this your first time with us.

7
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.960
Amber Prior: Yes, it is.

8
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:10.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Well, welcome. I'm, I'm actually newer on this as well. I joined them from Kaiser last month so

9
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:24.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's been interesting. It's been good, you know, telemedicine. So, so tell me a bit about yourself. Tell me, like, what brings you in. I understand methamphetamine is, is your problem right now that you want to deal with.

10
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:34.920
Amber Prior: It was my problem. In the past I have an open CPS case that's requiring me to have a substance abuse treatment assessment and education.

11
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gotcha. Okay.

12
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:48.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so that we can totally provide that for you here. The way Brian heart health has we have our

13
00:02:50.100 --> 00:03:01.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Appointments set up once we do this one on one with you individually as doctor and patient we get to see each other once a week in a group setting with a therapist.

14
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so

15
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:16.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, most likely, you won't be needing medication you know people that have, you know, I have other patients that have like opioid use disorder and they need some medication or whatever.

16
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, go. So our medical check in would

17
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:32.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Could be very brief, and then the rest of the time you're doing the counseling, you know, you're hearing other people's stuff and then you're you're participating in the in the group thing and that would count towards your CPS, I'm sure.

18
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.240
Okay.

19
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I don't know how many hours they need or whatever. But I think you should be good for you to do that and you'll rack it up quickly.

20
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:54.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, and then in terms of communicating with them if you have like a case manager coordinator or something you can sign a release. If you haven't already done that.

21
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.680
Amber Prior: Yeah, already have

22
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: We already did that. Okay, good.

23
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: That

24
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:16.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: We can communicate with them. And then finally, I would say, you know, we have one on one individual therapy sessions as well so you can meet with your assigned therapist as well. So like in a group setting will meet, but then you and that person can also meet individually.

25
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:30.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: That might be good to do once in a while if not every week because she can also support you in terms of the case right like coordinating with the case, the other person on the other side and like

26
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah reports and stuff like that.

27
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:44.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Yeah. Okay, so tell me how everything started for you, like in terms of, I guess, a history of substance use, tell me, like where you're a teenager when you started using

28
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.350

Amber Prior: The I started going

50
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.460

51
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so that's how you got introduced the math.

Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god.

77
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.580
Amber Prior: So, so my baby was born, three months early

78
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.020
Amber Prior: I was only 28 weeks along. Wow.

79
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my gosh, and your liver ruptured, geez.

80
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.690

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, God. God bless you. You're okay now though how

82
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.660
Amber Prior: You look okay yeah

83
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:30.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow, okay. So you did that, and your baby wasn't Nick you and then the dad was the dad supportive. Were you married. Are you were you in a religion.

84
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.720
Amber Prior: I'm I'm married, and it was there. He was there for us.

85
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:43.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Awesome. Okay, so at least you had that support. Okay. And the baby was in a queue and then okay then you recovered. And then what happened.

86
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:51.150
Amber Prior: I was in the hospital for a month for myself for the medical issues. The baby was in

87
00:08:51.930 --> 00:09:08.700
Amber Prior: Nick you for total of three months. But right after I came out of surgery. I was in a coma for the first two weeks and CPS came and became involved because when I when I checked into when I checked into the hospital. I got there by an area ambulance. So when I checked in.

88
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.500
Amber Prior: Because I like I've always known to, you know, tell your doctor. The truth about drug use, just in case something happens.

89
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.570
Amber Prior: Sure. And so of course I told them that had prior drug use in the past, but when I found out I was pregnant.

90
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:32.130
Amber Prior: You stopped using I stopped using and all of my prenatal care I had like you know i authorized the drug testing. And I don't know if they did it but I authorize it. So they were able to

91
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:41.850
Amber Prior: To drug testing, as far as I know nothing should have dirty my baby was born, clean, I was born, or I was delivered clean

92
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:54.390
Amber Prior: But CPS became involved because I told my doctors. I had prior drug use. And so since so since I had since I had such an early delivery. They assumed that it was drug related

93
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh. Oh.

94
00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:07.620
Amber Prior: And so then, since I was only six months pregnant, they required me to do a hair follicle test. Well, I've been using for years and years.

95
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:22.560
Amber Prior: Heavy amounts. And so my hair didn't grow very well. And so I agreed to submit a hair follicle test because I assumed that it was grown out they told me, went back three months, apparently does not goes back further than that. So,

96
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:30.060
Amber Prior: They said that I was exposed my baby to substances.

97
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:31.680
Amber Prior: And

98
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.740
Amber Prior: So while I'm feeling from all this and learning how to walk again and everything.

99
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.490
Amber Prior: I was having to deal with all the CPS thing like my babies never come home.

100
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.090
Amber Prior: He's been with foster care, since he got out of the hospital at three months old.

101
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: He's been with foster care. Wow, are you, are you able to see your child.

102
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:04.920
Amber Prior: Just recently I had to read. I had to move back home. I was living in Arizona at the time and I had to move back home to Northern California.

103
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:14.460
Amber Prior: And so he's still in foster care, but they're almost completed with the IC PC to get him transferred up here to my mother's house since

104
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:28.380
Amber Prior: I'm trying to do everything I can. But it's been really hard with transitioning to a new state with new insurance and everything. So my mom stepped in and said you know if it'll be faster all taking my care and then you can work from here, you know, we'll get it done so.

105
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh. Oh, so good. Oh my god, what a story. So, the baby is an Arizona now.
