00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.220
Ryan Morrow: Hey, Jess. How are you

2
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good, how are you

3
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.830
Ryan Morrow: I'm good, thank you.

4
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think we missed a session.

5
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We didn't meet last week.

6
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or the week prior

7
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.440
Ryan Morrow: Oh, I think my internet was down

8
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.470
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I think I was having problems with my internet or something.

9
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.390
Ryan Morrow: So,

10
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We have a very bad thunderstorm going on. So if my internet connection gets a little loss.

11
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.900
Okay.

12
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.230
Ryan Morrow: Where I'm where you got right I'm look

13
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.820
Ryan Morrow: I'm in Florida. Okay, yeah, we have rain here too.

14
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.990
Yeah.

15
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.430
Ryan Morrow: So,

16
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Last time we met, we were talking about how you stay in mothers days.

17
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We also discussed the tele health rules, but maybe a licensed in Florida and the Mexico.

18
00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:03.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But with everything that's going on with Kobe, there has been some flexibility as far as Tele health goals with crossing state lines. But because whenever we do a session.

19
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:13.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're in Texas, there's a high possibility that would have to transfer you to a therapist. That's actually a license in Texas.

20
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.080
Ryan Morrow: Well can I mean how do you know if I'm in Clovis or or loving

21
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whenever I ask somebody to do because the last time we spoke

22
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You were in, and I don't even know the differentiation between those cities because like I said before, but I know the last time we spoke, and when you mentioned that you weren't in Texas.

23
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I had to go and contact Texas regulation board just to see how that would be able to work.

24
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.260
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, well, I'm not, I'm not a resident here. So, I mean, I'm in Clovis

25
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The way the licensing work is not about residency. It's about where you reside.

26
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.390
At the time, right.

27
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

28
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just wanted to comment.

29
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.420
Ryan Morrow: I'll make I'll make sure I'm in Clovis whenever I have my name.

30
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.410
I

31
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't want to make a difference for this one to give you the heads up in the case that has to happen. But if you're going to go, then that's fine.

32
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.380
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I'll make sure I'm in Clovis

33
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.640
Ryan Morrow: Whenever I have me

34
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good one. I'm with you.

35
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.970
Ryan Morrow: I'm well I'm moving into an apartment with

36
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.030
Ryan Morrow: A couple of guys today and

37
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.970
Ryan Morrow: That's really not. I mean, nothing's really changed. I'm still laid off for

38
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.200
Ryan Morrow: The gems opened back up. So I started going back to the gym.

39
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.580
But

40
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really. So how was that experience because honestly, I haven't done anything aside from my essentials grocery shopping

41
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: curious what that looks like.

42
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going back to gym like that.

43
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's

44
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.970
I mean,

45
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.900
Ryan Morrow: To me it's it's it's nothing.

46
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.880
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, um,

47
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.250
Ryan Morrow: I mean, it's weird. Seeing people with mask and stuff on, I guess.

48
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're exercising with the mask on.

49
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.610
Ryan Morrow: Some people do, but most people that go to the gym. They're, they're kind of have the mindset that I have

50
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.210
Ryan Morrow: And to me, it's just it

51
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.150
Ryan Morrow: I mean, it sucks. It's a shitty situation.

52
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.160
Ryan Morrow: I mean, I, I understand the people are dying, but

53
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.270
Ryan Morrow: However, it got out and however you got here. It's here.

54
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.370
Ryan Morrow: And it's not going anywhere.

55
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.200
Ryan Morrow: It's just gonna, it's like it's the flu. Now it's another form of the flu.

56
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.640
Ryan Morrow: It's another disease that is here and it's going to kill people, unfortunately.

57
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.010
Ryan Morrow: And, you know, if I get it, I get it. If I don't, I don't, am I doing anything different. No.

58
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.170
Ryan Morrow: I'm not a German fo by i think that

59
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:18.690
Ryan Morrow: The more. I'm not saying coming in contact with germs on purpose is like this is a smart thing to do, but I think that

60
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:28.740
Ryan Morrow: You have to expose your body to, um, you know, bacteria and stuff. In order for your immune system to fight off.

61
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:38.610
Ryan Morrow: sicknesses. If you're a German phobe and you never expose yourself. And when you do get sick, you're going to get really sick because your immune system doesn't know how to act. Yeah.

62
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.380
Ryan Morrow: And so

63
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:49.080
Ryan Morrow: So, I mean, I'm really conservative. I'm not liberal at all. I don't. I mean, I don't know. I think it

64
00:05:49.680 --> 00:06:07.020
Ryan Morrow: It's just another form of the flu and however it got here got here and it ain't going nowhere. I mean, it's here to stay. The only thing that's going to make it better, is when they get medicine, a vaccine to keep the symptoms and stuff. And stuff, you know, the low

65
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.970
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, so

66
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.400
Ryan Morrow: But I yeah I'm not aware masking gloves and all that crap. Now,

67
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If they have like different things.

68
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I saw that was my jam. That's locally, where I am and they have like

69
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I kickboxing and so there's like only certain stations, just take everywhere. How's it

70
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In New Mexico where

71
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.090
Yeah.

72
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.570
Ryan Morrow: They are are trying to keep it were like

73
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.250
Ryan Morrow: Six be so if someone's on a machine, you have to use one that is a machine over

74
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.920
Ryan Morrow: Stuff like that. Just to keep you know the the distancing

75
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.420
Ryan Morrow: And then cleaning the equipment, obviously, before and after you use it.

76
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What I was already doing so I can. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

77
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.960
Ryan Morrow: So, but other than that. I'm nothing

78
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.640
Ryan Morrow: I'm

79
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.430
Ryan Morrow: Nothing really.

80
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have like thoughts about it because eventually we all have to come out of this.

81
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. And then my life. You can't. Yeah.

82
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.330
Ryan Morrow: Place for me. Yeah, more people are gonna die in

83
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.130
Ryan Morrow: And suffer.

84
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.050
Ryan Morrow: being stuck in their house, then they are from going out and living their lives.

85
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What suffering. Are you talking about if they stay in house.

86
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.200
Depression.

87
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.600
Ryan Morrow: You know, stuff like that.

88
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Very true.

89
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:45.570
Ryan Morrow: So, I mean, I think people need to get out live a normal life. The older people that people that are more susceptible to

90
00:07:46.470 --> 00:08:00.510
Ryan Morrow: Getting sick and when they do get sick, they get really sick. Those are the people that need to be, you know, really careful cautious and, you know, probably really, you know, follow the social distancing stuff.

91
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, but

92
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:07.680
Ryan Morrow: Other than that, like, I think that like everybody else to just live normal life like go back to

93
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.570
Ryan Morrow: Normality

94
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.520
Yeah, so

95
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Yeah, I hear I hear that perspective.

96
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:28.980
Ryan Morrow: I mean I've talked to nurses and and and stuff and they say that you know this. This is a lot of hype, the media, um, it's a lot of propaganda.

97
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.380
Ryan Morrow: So,

98
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.340
Ryan Morrow: They say, I mean, they say it's just the flu, you know, and

99
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.750
Ryan Morrow: The I guess the issue, is it

100
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.910
Ryan Morrow: Really a

101
00:08:46.110 --> 00:09:01.890
Ryan Morrow: I don't know, like, more. It's more like how, how, how did this thing get out like all of a sudden, you know, I mean, I don't know if it came from a lab. I don't know if it's biological warfare. I don't know if it came from a food.

102
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.890
Ryan Morrow: But I don't think it just accidentally just appeared the way that it did.

103
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:08.820
So,

104
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.000
Ryan Morrow: I think that there's a lot of diseases that are man made that rather than

105
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.730
Ryan Morrow: Actual diseases. You know, I think.

106
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.830
Ryan Morrow: Population control is is a is a huge thing. So the

107
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.660
Ryan Morrow: The global elite, the people that really control the world.

108
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.740
Ryan Morrow: And so I have. I'm not kidding.

109
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.250
Ryan Morrow: I love conspiracy theory I watch a lot of documentaries and I have my my own

110
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:52.170
Ryan Morrow: Opinions and stuff like that. I don't think that our government really has our best interest at

111
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.250
Ryan Morrow: At hand at the end of the day, so

112
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.290
Ryan Morrow: So, yeah.

113
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have that perspective, it definitely below and says how your behaviors and how you response.

114
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:13.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To it because someone they may not believe in a conspiracy theories and they really just think this with a virus and until they get a vaccine. So then

115
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:19.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That type of interpretation warrants anxiety and lots of preparation and

116
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm hypothetical words like what it, what it

117
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.470
Ryan Morrow: And I don't believe in vaccines. I don't get vaccines.

118
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.200
Ryan Morrow: I'm not. I've never been really sick so

119
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.700
Ryan Morrow: I don't know.

120
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.410
Ryan Morrow: I think

121
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:39.870
Ryan Morrow: They put stuff in vaccines that are bad for you for people on that do more harm than good.

122
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That disposition will definitely influence

123
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:48.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

124
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I mean, the seed is fire virus.

125
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.360
Yeah.

126
00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, is there anything aside from the pandemic that you feel is significant.

127
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.860
Ryan Morrow: I mean,

128
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.130
Ryan Morrow: I mean, I guess, you know, at the end of the day, like

129
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.950
Ryan Morrow: I'm not really worried, but like I don't know what I'm gonna do with

130
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.610
Ryan Morrow: I don't know where life's

131
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.650
Ryan Morrow: Going right now because of my job and stuff and

132
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.170
Ryan Morrow: They the oil economy is so

133
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:49.050
Ryan Morrow: So bad. I mean, it's coming back a little bit better. But anyways, yeah. I mean, just, you know, not normal worries, like, you know, what am I going to do if but as far as like, I'm not really like worried, to the point where it's given me anxiety or stress me out or

134
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.630
Ryan Morrow: Anything like that.

135
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.370
Ryan Morrow: It's, I mean it's

136
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.410
Ryan Morrow: Not making me want to go you know relapse or or anything like that.

137
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:11.430
Ryan Morrow: So, um, but, yeah, I mean, that's the only thing that I would say that I'm dealing with emotionally right now is just, you know what, like what am I going to do with my life, my career.

138
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.130
Ryan Morrow: You know, stuff like that.

139
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:27.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's more concerned because you said these worries, they will have that Transition. Transition into stressors right now or for anxiety, which presented so

140
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:27.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

141
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.650
Ryan Morrow: He fight if I weren't getting unemployment right now.

142
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.340
Ryan Morrow: Then, well yeah, things would definitely be

143
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.960
Ryan Morrow: A lot different.

144
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.540
Ryan Morrow: But

145
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:52.410
Ryan Morrow: Um, I don't want to get too comfortable with that because I know that it's only gonna last for so long and and I do need to if I don't get called back to work, you know, start looking for a job.

146
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Timeframe or of when they would touch base with you or was just kind of this indefinite

147
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.640
Ryan Morrow: Not, I mean it all. It all depends on

148
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:16.200
Ryan Morrow: On the oil market, the oil economy. You know, when oils like like right now it's in the 30s. That's better than a than it was because it was like pretty much negative

149
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:28.260
Ryan Morrow: And in the 20s and teens, but um yeah I mean that they're just like will call you back to work. Whenever the oil companies start you know drilling again in fracking again.

150
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:40.410
Ryan Morrow: So, but, yeah, that in and I mean I can't really tell you when or how or because it all depends on a lot of different circumstances.

151
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.500
Ryan Morrow: So, yeah.

152
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's the oil field. Yeah. Only specialty or or trade that you

153
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:50.700
Ryan Morrow: Know,

154
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:58.410
Ryan Morrow: No, I mean like I did sales and marketing for like 10 years I sold insurance for all state.

155
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.650
Ryan Morrow: And I had my insurance license. And so, I mean, I know, I know.

156
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.700
Ryan Morrow: A lot about insurance. I know a lot about like financial stuff like real estate.

157
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.880
Ryan Morrow: So I was thinking like maybe

158
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:27.870
Ryan Morrow: Something that's not going to be, I mean like I'm getting to the point or the age where manual labor is not really like something that I want to go and

159
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.590
Ryan Morrow: You know, unless I really have to

160
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.900
Ryan Morrow: So, um, so, yeah, I mean,

161
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:47.370
Ryan Morrow: I, I worked in the car business for three years and then insurance for 10 so I guess I could fall back on.

162
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.940
Ryan Morrow: Something to do with cells or whatever.

163
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A lot of transportation is

164
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.840
Ryan Morrow: Like a yeah performance based type of job, I guess.

165
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.810
Ryan Morrow: Without a college degree.

166
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.400
Ryan Morrow: If you want to make money.

167
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.610
Ryan Morrow: Um, you know, you either start your own company.

168
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.480
Ryan Morrow: Or you get into a

169
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:18.810
Ryan Morrow: Like a sales job that you can make a lot of money is let me know based on your performance. So

170
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.050
Ryan Morrow: Like Commission based jobs, you know,

171
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.480
Ryan Morrow: It's

172
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That one sales, I

173
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:37.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Level of patience. It's different. Right. Because therapy wines, a level of patience but the sales is like, totally different. And it's like,

174
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. So how did you like being in the sales field.

175
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.770
Ryan Morrow: It was an adrenaline rush

176
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.910
Ryan Morrow: You have your bad days, but whenever you get somebody like that's interested in a car.

177
00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:10.200
Ryan Morrow: Or whatever, and you get them in your office and and it's in your like going over the numbers. And the more you know like I always like my sales manager always told me you have to sell yourself before you sell the product.

178
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.940
Ryan Morrow: And so you have to get that person to trust you and like you

179
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:27.150
Ryan Morrow: You know, sometimes it's like like within 30 minutes you know you somebody drives up and they buy a car. Sometimes it's a week or a month, or two months.

180
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.350
Ryan Morrow: And so in that time, like you got to do whatever

181
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.410
Ryan Morrow: I'm not saying, Be deceitful or manipulative

182
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But you got to get that person to like and trust you.

183
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.520
Ryan Morrow: Or they're not going to want to buy anything from me so

184
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:49.230
Ryan Morrow: So yeah, I mean it can definitely be stressful and and and anxiety is

185
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.600
Ryan Morrow: Whenever you're having a bad month and you got bills do and you know

186
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.800
Ryan Morrow: You know having a car sold. It's like, what am I gonna do, but

187
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.230
Ryan Morrow: I guess that comes with the territory.

188
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.460
Ryan Morrow: Mean I would rather I would rather take the chance of

189
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:18.210
Ryan Morrow: Going into a, a position where they're not paying me any salary.

190
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:33.270
Ryan Morrow: Um, it's strictly commission, you know, based on what I do, then go to a job where I'm making 2000 or less a month digging ditches or roofing or, you know, doing something like that.

191
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, what seems more appealing about about the other type of work, the Commission base.

192
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.810
Ryan Morrow: Well, I mean, like,

193
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:51.570
Ryan Morrow: You, it's kind of, I mean you you have a lot of control over how well how much money you may

194
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.450
Ryan Morrow: Wear like you're on the

195
00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:03.690
Ryan Morrow: hourly or a salary job, you know, you just go to work you do your job and and your pay is what it is.

196
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:12.120
Ryan Morrow: So sometimes that kind of sucks. If you're not making like after being in the oil field and making like between 10 and

197
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:20.250
Ryan Morrow: 15,000 a month. I don't know if I could ever really go back to a job that didn't pay more than 1000 a week.

198
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:28.050
Ryan Morrow: I mean, it would be really hard for me to i would i would humble myself and do it. If I had to

199
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.300
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, but it would be really hard.

200
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I didn't know that while it was such a lucrative business I

201
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:45.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: can still see you all. Yeah, yeah, you can walk into depending on what

202
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.400
Ryan Morrow: Type of

203
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.170
Ryan Morrow: Oil Field job it is, but you can walk into

204
00:18:53.250 --> 00:19:02.190
Ryan Morrow: You know position, like with no experience, making 18 and our I'm with benefits right off the bat.

205
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.760
Ryan Morrow: And that's not like great but

206
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.580
Ryan Morrow: You're going to get like 42 sometimes 80 hours a week of overtime.

207
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wow.

208
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.690
Ryan Morrow: There was, there were weeks where I would talk

209
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.190
Ryan Morrow: Over 100 hours.

210
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.380
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

211
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.090
Ryan Morrow: So I would get like

212
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:30.750
Ryan Morrow: You know 18 an hour for 40 and then what's it 32 and our for 60 7080

213
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.700
Ryan Morrow: Wow. Yeah.

214
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.170
Ryan Morrow: And so when you get those paychecks. It's like, wow, no.

215
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a lot fasted, but this is it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you don't have alive.

216
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.670
Ryan Morrow: Most companies do like a three week on one off for 10 on

217
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.560
Ryan Morrow: For something like that.

218
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:59.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's just the norm. That's the nature of that feel to work those long extremely hours so there's

219
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No set time that you lose.

220
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:02.850
Yeah.

221
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:14.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Imagine that would be rewarding being in the position where it seems like there's kind of lack of control and other areas of your life.

222
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And being able to

223
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really control your streams of income and knowing that

224
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:29.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can work with this heart and I can make lots of money and maybe that's how it's been, you know, I know a lot of people that say they have to start all over.

225
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:39.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I mean, starting all over. When you have that much money coming in a week. I guess that you would be able to start over a lot quicker than other people that are salary positions.

226
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:39.930
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

227
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:54.810
Ryan Morrow: You know for sure. Um, for me, like, I didn't know what I was getting myself into how I ended up in the oil field was like, I guess, three, four years ago.

228
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.280
Ryan Morrow: I

229
00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:06.120
Ryan Morrow: Was, you know, doing drugs and I was in, I was broken didn't, didn't have anything at all. I didn't even have a driver's license.

230
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:20.370
Ryan Morrow: And so my friends and family got me into a place called teen challenge. It's an international Christian Faith Based program. And, um, it's like 12 to 13 months.

231
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:31.320
Ryan Morrow: And so it's not really a rehab. I would say it's more of a, like a Christian boot camp slash Bible school

232
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.350
Ryan Morrow: With a lot of discipline and

233
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.650
Ryan Morrow: Stuff like that makes them with it.

234
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.490
Ryan Morrow: And so anyways I went there.

235
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:47.190
Ryan Morrow: My dad got dropped off with a bag bag and a little bit of clothes.

236
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:58.230
Ryan Morrow: And I stayed. I hated it. I didn't want to be there, but after I was there for a couple of months. I started kind of seeing the light

237
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.570
Ryan Morrow: And

238
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:08.670
Ryan Morrow: So I stuck it out and after 15 months I finally graduated, I got in trouble. A couple of times.

239
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.290
Ryan Morrow: And

240
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:22.110
Ryan Morrow: So anyways, I had to stay a little bit longer but I graduated and then when I was done. There was a guy that helps kids or or guys getting out of

241
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.770
Ryan Morrow: The program as long as they graduate, he'll help them out with a job on his ranch and he owns an oil company.

242
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:43.260
Ryan Morrow: And so I went to work for him for like six months and got like some money saved up, got a truck and got it kind of got things set up and then he told me, you know, just start looking for another job.

243
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.390
Ryan Morrow: So I

244
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.250
Ryan Morrow: I started, I met some guys the gym that

245
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.130
Ryan Morrow: told me about this company they worked for

246
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.950
Ryan Morrow: And I walked in and got hired

247
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.900
Ryan Morrow: After like 15 minutes

248
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:12.420
Ryan Morrow: And so I didn't. I mean, when I went to teen challenge. I didn't have anything when I graduated I had, you know, a bunch of clothes I had acquired shoes. You know, like, Cool stuff along the way.

249
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:26.580
Ryan Morrow: In that year's time, but I still didn't have anything really. And then whenever I left the ranch that I worked on after six months, I had a truck drivers license, um, you know, some other stuff that I bought

250
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:38.640
Ryan Morrow: And then whenever I left there and went to work in the oil field after six months I bought another truck and like had my own place like all this nice stuff.

251
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.740
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, and

252
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.130
Ryan Morrow: I mean, I went from like within a year and a half.

253
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.700
Ryan Morrow: You know making 100 and some thousand dollars a year being a heroin addict to that.

254
00:23:52.710 --> 00:24:04.470
Ryan Morrow: So the, the insanity. The stupid. I'm part of the story is in the midst of all that something inside me.

255
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.590
Ryan Morrow: I was still empty.

256
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:17.340
Ryan Morrow: I I had, I felt like I had did all that accomplished, all that stuff, just so I could tell my family or show my family and friends.

257
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:27.450
Ryan Morrow: Like liquid. I did, you know, look at you know what i have acquired accomplished. I'm I'm successful now.

258
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.810
Ryan Morrow: But I did nothing after I left for my sobriety.

259
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.670
Ryan Morrow: And so it only took like eight months for me to relapse.

260
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.280
Ryan Morrow: So,

261
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:53.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that that's not the insane part. I mean, I can see where you know from external looking out the saddle again making all that money. You should be happy.

262
00:24:53.910 --> 00:25:03.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But here in several stories and we really don't identify with what exactly brings me about you. What exactly makes me happy.

263
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:15.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's your on the satisfaction of others. That's where that emptiness comes in because some fulfillment is one of the key principles for long term sobriety.

264
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:28.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because now it's you're able to motivate yourself so through your journey. What have you found that you equate to self fulfillment and what brings you value, aside from your external networks.

265
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.140
Ryan Morrow: I don't know. That's a, that's a, that's a hard question to answer.

266
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.150
Ryan Morrow: Word that a little bit differently.

267
00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so

268
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:53.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: self fulfillment gives you that sense of purpose and so the story that you shared with me.

269
00:25:54.210 --> 00:26:11.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said something very significant WHERE YOU SAID YOU WANT TO SHOW TO YOUR FAMILY AND HERE LOOK AT ALL THE I'VE attained, but it still wasn't enough gratification for you. So when you look within yourself. What are the things that you necessarily about you. What are things that you appreciate

270
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.130
Ryan Morrow: Um,

271
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.180
Ryan Morrow: I mean,

272
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:21.000
Ryan Morrow: I don't

273
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.270
Ryan Morrow: What are the things I appreciate about myself.

274
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.650
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, when I'm doing my meeting.

275
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.990
Ryan Morrow: Um, hang on.

276
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.990
Ryan Morrow: Sorry about that. Um,

277
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.660
Ryan Morrow: I don't know, just so that's that's a tough question answer.

278
00:26:43.830 --> 00:27:00.630
Ryan Morrow: I think I have my life, my priorities and all the wrong places. When it comes to fulfillment. I, I, like if I'm not in good shape. Like, you know, muscular and I don't feel like I look at

279
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.240
Ryan Morrow: Then that brings me down. If I don't have nice clothes to wear

280
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.510
Ryan Morrow: If I don't have a nice vehicle, a good job.

281
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.870
Ryan Morrow: I mean, like, those are the things that

282
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.610
Ryan Morrow: I give me self credit gratification.

283
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.050
Ryan Morrow: In a certain sense,

284
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:29.730
Ryan Morrow: But then like at the end of the day, I'm still like I guess miserable in a certain sense,

285
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.330
Ryan Morrow: And I still feel like I have this huge hole that I don't know how to fill

286
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.620
Ryan Morrow: And so I'm still trying to figure out, like, like what that means.

287
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:55.830
Ryan Morrow: I think maybe like I need to come to a point where I'm not so selfish and self centered and maybe like if I start helping other people

288
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.100
Ryan Morrow: And not be so concerned.

289
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:07.800
Ryan Morrow: With the things that are relevant like being in shape and have a nice stuff and a good job.

290
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:13.590
Ryan Morrow: You know, stuff like that. And I think that that was probably

291
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.560
Ryan Morrow: Like mentally like really hell.

292
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:27.450
Ryan Morrow: I just don't know how to get to that place. I feel like I guess I care. Way too much about what other people think.

293
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.330
Ryan Morrow: And so I want to impress people

294
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:36.870
Ryan Morrow: So,

295
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.210
Ryan Morrow: I don't know.

296
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:42.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If that makes sense.

297
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The physical

298
00:28:46.050 --> 00:29:01.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The physical stature and what is there from the outside in that status is significant and you have the advantage because you know good looks, you're able to exercise, you see, you see the effects of your work so

299
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:08.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Being able to be able to see, okay, this is a product of what my word. Looks like I can see it.

300
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:08.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

301
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. It's tangible

302
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.450
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, it's something that I have control over.

303
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.280
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, like

304
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:22.230
Ryan Morrow: I can control, you know, as long as I go to the gym and I eat good

305
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.390
Ryan Morrow: And that's a controllable situation now as far as like

306
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:41.970
Ryan Morrow: Finding a pretty wife and getting her fall in love with me. That's not really i mean i have i guess you have a certain control over that. As far as like, you know, doing your part, but you really don't have control.

307
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:51.330
Ryan Morrow: You know what I mean, like China, when it comes to find me like true love real love of a wife soulmate.

308
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:07.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Possible when you're able to look within, and really get comfortable with who you are. And so really outline

309
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Outlining bad this is who I present as

310
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:25.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the world, and this is how I present when the doors are closed. There may be different variances that you get based on the level of our relationship, but at a core. This is like

311
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:33.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm hearing you. You're hoping to get that self discovery through more purpose towards given towards others.

312
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:43.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because your past addictions. There was some taking from others and any investment was more so for others to view.

313
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:49.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And not another time for you to reflect internally. What's going on with Ryan.

314
00:30:51.060 --> 00:31:00.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, maybe that's something you can reflect on and what makes it challenging is, you know, some people, they'll go to other people say, Hey, what are some of the things you like about me.

315
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:10.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But a lot of those social connections have been lost because of your addiction and and your natural support on your mom and your sister.

316
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:15.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To me, that same as genuine as hearing it from other people.

317
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.530
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

318
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.670
Ryan Morrow: For sure.

319
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:26.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have to agree that being able to contribute in other ways, whether it's through peer mentorship.

320
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:28.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Church.

321
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:44.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any communities that you were hobbies that you specialize in and be able to do more than internal work than what's on the outside. I mean, if you like exercise or you could even commit to helping someone learn how to train

322
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:45.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can

323
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: benefits others. I used to be a fitness trainer.

324
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.200
Ryan Morrow: The only problem with that is it doesn't pay. Very good. So it's something that

325
00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.420
Ryan Morrow: I guess you could do at night, you know, like, just to help people or something but

326
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're interested in finding out what you can contribute to society, aside from

327
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your appearance in your status.

328
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:15.420
Ryan Morrow: Right.

329
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.100
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I just, I just don't, I don't know.

330
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.580
Ryan Morrow: What I'm supposed to do it myself right now.

331
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:28.470
Ryan Morrow: I don't know where I'm supposed to go what I'm supposed to do, or

332
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:34.440
Ryan Morrow: Like, I don't know. I guess I need right and ask God for guidance. Yeah.

333
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And Journaling is always helpful.

334
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:54.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And being comfortable with what are the thoughts that is, in itself, a lot of times people try to educate or way the internal dialogue that's constantly going by keeping busy doing all those other things but

335
00:32:54.570 --> 00:33:00.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that internal dialogue is where we get more insight about what's really important to you.

336
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:23.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe there's something that you can do this week is in your journal in time daily commit to just writing down whatever comes up in that internal dialogue matter how comfortable or uncomfortable.

337
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then see if there's any common themes that come up in that internal dialogue.

338
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:31.230
Ryan Morrow: Okay.

339
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:32.430
Sure.

340
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have any questions.

341
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.560
Ryan Morrow: Um, no. I think

342
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.180
