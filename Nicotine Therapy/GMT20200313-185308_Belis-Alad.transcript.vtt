00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:28.620
Belis Aladag: I agree that it's important for you to wait and be cautious before doing any more invasive procedures connections spinal cord stimulation all this stuff.

139
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:40.980
Belis Aladag: Those things are it modalities that pain specialists use. So Dr. Ella. He is a pain specialist and he can use those treatments to help people that have chronic pain.

140
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.080
Lisa’s iPhone: From whatever different reasons.

141
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:57.360
Belis Aladag: Which is ok but for you. Yes, you have chronic pain like the the arthritis and fibromyalgia pain, but those aren't the things that are needing help right now from those types of invasive modalities. Right. You don't need

142
00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.100
Lisa’s iPhone: For that

143
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:17.130
Belis Aladag: It's the endometriosis. This new diagnosis that came about four months ago. And since that procedure of the biopsy it just feels like something just got irritated or something that if the pain level went up based on that.

144
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.180
Lisa’s iPhone: thousand percent

145
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.680
Belis Aladag: thousand percent

146
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:36.750
Belis Aladag: So let's first figure out, okay, what is this endometriosis. How do we. Is it, is there a way to fix what's going on. Maybe there's a surgery they could go in and take out most of the tumor or the problematic part. Get rid of it. So it doesn't roll back you know

147
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:44.700
Lisa’s iPhone: Back. But yeah, the what what what they told her. Was that what he seen, but he thinks that there's more on the bottom.

148
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:57.750
Lisa’s iPhone: And he said that there's a later time. There's a third. There's two different treatments. One is one of the laser one's a surgery and ones like real life skills, but we won't know until like I said to Lucien, especially

149
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.630
Lisa’s iPhone: At the specialist, which, let me see which one was the specialist for that UCSF.

150
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.430
Belis Aladag: UCSF right you have the using

151
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.150
Lisa’s iPhone: The 18th

152
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:13.530
Belis Aladag: ON THE 18th AND YOU'LL discuss those treatments. You'll discuss. Okay, what do I have, what is this endometriosis. What does it mean

153
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:28.320
Belis Aladag: How do I treat this those three treatment options which ones is best for me in terms of risk of getting worse. So I would want to know, okay, what's my risk of this pain getting worse because if there's a risk. They're getting worse. Maybe you don't want to do it.

154
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.310
Lisa’s iPhone: And

155
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:40.440
Belis Aladag: You know, just ask those questions for each each thing the laser. The surgery and the whatever, you know, the pills ask, Okay, what's the pro and what's the con what could happen.

156
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:40.890
Lisa’s iPhone: And then

157
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:53.790
Belis Aladag: Based on that decide on those things. After you treat that and work on that. Then maybe you can make an appointment, if necessary, later later with Dr elahi

158
00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:08.610
Belis Aladag: Think, for now, my suggestion would be the 20th with Dr. Ally. He just post one it. You don't have to explain to me to just call their office and say hey you know we got we're dealing with some other medical stuff. Can we postpone this to next month or something and

159
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.030
Lisa’s iPhone: Then

160
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.270
Belis Aladag: Most phone it. You don't have to go. You just kind of for now put it off that way you're not confused.

161
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.110
Lisa’s iPhone: Because you have

162
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.890
Belis Aladag: So many people telling you, you got to do this for the endometriosis and then you got

163
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.450
Lisa’s iPhone: This for the pain and we don't have to

164
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.950
Belis Aladag: Separate it all. It's all your

165
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.250
Body.

166
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.480
Lisa’s iPhone: Every day, every two days. I have an appointment to the doctor to take the day

167
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:37.050
Lisa’s iPhone: She, she has a doctor. It's called Golden Valley clinic Holden.

168
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:49.560
Lisa’s iPhone: And usually 90% of The Times PA Cesar are not the doctor because and every month they changed her doctors, so we don't even have like a

169
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:56.160
Lisa’s iPhone: Like we just gets we just call and they send us. Okay. You gotta go to this one. Now you got to do this for now and literally

170
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:07.380
Lisa’s iPhone: Monday through Friday we're all over the doctors and it's literally the took a toll on her life. It took a toll on the family because I have to be with her and and business and we go

171
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:21.690
Lisa’s iPhone: For know there's like no no no changes like nothing change is like she's not getting anything helpful. So, but the thing is like I told them whatever you guys telling me to do. I'm doing it wherever you're telling me to go on going. But you guys, she's not getting no percent better

172
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.490
Lisa’s iPhone: I see.

173
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.500
Belis Aladag: So, and the Golden Valley clinic is supposed to be your home base.

174
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.850
Belis Aladag: Is that your primary care.

175
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.050
Physician

176
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.770
Lisa’s iPhone: But unfortunately you're saying they're switching around a lot.

177
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.550
Belis Aladag: You don't, you don't feel like you have like a captain of the ship.

178
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.050
Belis Aladag: Correct. Dr.

179
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:47.070
Lisa’s iPhone: We don't. We didn't call an extra somebody doctor. What did the doctor say or what did this. We don't even know who he is.

180
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:58.590
Belis Aladag: So this is very thank you for sharing all this because it's so important for peace of mind and and and you need that right now with all this stuff happening to that.

181
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:12.300
Belis Aladag: You know, all of a sudden came on four months ago you need clarity and you need to have like a home base where you can go and say, Okay, here's what's going on. Now, what, what is my next step. And where do only

182
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.250
Lisa’s iPhone: Reports come to so that I can

183
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.350
Belis Aladag: Have somebody review it and guide me. Okay, what do I do next, kind of like what we're doing right now.

184
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:19.890
Lisa’s iPhone: Saying

185
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:37.320
Belis Aladag: Let's postpone the pain guy, let's do this. Let's do that. Right. So, so for now. I mean, I'm happy to help. Since I'm starting to get to know what's going on. I'm happy to be kind of like ground zero for you to just try to get all the pieces together and help guide you

186
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.640
Lisa’s iPhone: Thinking

187
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:47.010
Belis Aladag: You're welcome. Um, and I think the good news is the 18th is right around the corner right it's next week.

188
00:18:47.250 --> 00:19:01.230
Belis Aladag: Yes. Right, next week. So, so hopefully I'm really hopeful UCSF has a great reputation. I hope that when you go into the room with this provider on the 18th. You can really feel comfortable to just say,

189
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:09.360
Belis Aladag: Doc, you know, this four months ago, brand new thing came into my life and it's kind of confused me and caused me a lot of pain and

190
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:21.630
Belis Aladag: Discomfort. So I'm hoping you can help both through slowly what's happening and what you recommend based on what you see. And so hopefully it'll be somebody that you can trust and kind of work with

191
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:22.680
Yeah.

192
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:39.990
Belis Aladag: I'm in terms of continuing your medications like the Gabba Penton the trezza don't and the Deluxe, a team are these three medications prescribed by Golden Valley clinic providers or someone else.

193
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:51.720
Lisa’s iPhone: First, the golden golden Golden Valley prescribe them and then now the two of them is describing by the bones, the

194
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.960
Lisa’s iPhone: Doctor

195
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.390
Lisa’s iPhone: A lot. No, no.

196
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.330
Lisa’s iPhone: I'm sorry. Haha.

197
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.830
Lisa’s iPhone: prescribes for the last, the last thing. No.

198
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:06.930
Lisa’s iPhone: No.

199
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:23.010
Lisa’s iPhone: No, no, no. I'm sorry. Hold on. The gabapentin that the last thing I know the last session murders. A Oh, that's called a rally i right now. Yeah, give it to her. She used to give her the locks it then. And the other paintings, but now Golden Valley is given

200
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.770
Belis Aladag: And the transit homeless from Golden Valley.

201
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.680
Lisa’s iPhone: Yes, I see the child is owning the vitamin D.

202
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.100
Belis Aladag: So, um, okay.

203
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.770
Belis Aladag: So Golden Valley.

204
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:43.620
Belis Aladag: I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to my team with us with bright heart health, to see if they can

205
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:57.480
Belis Aladag: Kind of communicate with golden valley clinic or somehow figure out a way where you feel safer at Golden Valley clinic with one provider that you can trust and hopefully it's a doctor. It sounds like the PA is good, but you don't really feel

206
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:06.750
Lisa’s iPhone: I don't, is it thing is that I don't know if there's this golden valley have about 60 doctors. Wow, they have they have their

207
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:17.040
Lisa’s iPhone: Own little by me and they have. It's a big thing. It's like a county thing is like the biggest thing here. Believe me, Dr. Wood what you told me I said it 100 times

208
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:27.750
Lisa’s iPhone: I'm like, I even last last appointment. I went to him. Like I the normal Africa. I'm like, I never seen before. Now how could I tell you all the situations about her because you don't

209
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:38.550
Lisa’s iPhone: Know you're reading about it, but you don't know about it. Yeah, and that's the situation. That's why I want to get away from golden belt. I don't want, I don't even want. Yeah, I don't want to do a golden valley.

210
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:51.960
Belis Aladag: Beautiful. Okay, I just wanted to make sure. So if that's the case, then I say, how do you feel comfortable importing your care to to bright heart health, where you can have one provider for your primary care needs and stuff like that. Maybe that's

211
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.650
Lisa’s iPhone: This

212
00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:05.460
Belis Aladag: And the cool thing about it is you can have one provider and its online like this so you can, you know, you can communicate wherever you are, even if you move or whatever. Right.

213
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:17.430
Belis Aladag: So we'll see I'm new to bright heart health. So in terms of services we provide. I'm pretty sure we do primary care, but I would have to check and double, double check on that. Right.

214
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:28.500
Belis Aladag: But I can help at least convey your, your concerns to the team with us and then make sure you get good like hand holding to the next step. Yeah.

215
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:39.150
Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, and, and that way. I'm thinking it might be best for you to receive all your medications from one place

216
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.470
Yes.

217
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:50.580
Belis Aladag: So like right now. Where are you at with your refills. How are you with the Gabba Penton the trouser don't the Deluxe, a team do you have enough

218
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:56.610
Lisa’s iPhone: Yes, I have a refill for one year. One more try this one. Okay.

219
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.040
Lisa’s iPhone: And the vitamin D, I think, okay, for one year.

220
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.430
Lisa’s iPhone: Now, I don't know that.

221
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:06.930
Lisa’s iPhone: Day.

222
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:18.330
Lisa’s iPhone: What goes on, you'll have one refill that you're feeling it today. And the doctor. The doctor from Golden Valley approved it today and everything yeah refill. Yeah.

223
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.240
Lisa’s iPhone: It's not one year, we feel

224
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.700
Belis Aladag: On one time, one month maybe

225
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.670
Lisa’s iPhone: She told me one year. Okay.

226
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.560
Belis Aladag: So I see

227
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.760
Lisa’s iPhone: All Shahar Dr. Laurie from Informatica the arthritis.

228
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.710
Lisa’s iPhone: And the other one, guys. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

229
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.900
Belis Aladag: A lot. He is the pain doctor right

230
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.800
Yeah.

231
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:46.230
Belis Aladag: Right Faulconer is the so you said he's a urologist or is he a gynecologist

232
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:53.580
Lisa’s iPhone: Also urology. No, that's for concert was in Rolla does. He does. He is. He was my doctor I had testicular cancer before

233
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.540
Belis Aladag: I got you.

234
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.510
Lisa’s iPhone: So, and then, that's why. Yeah.

235
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:03.600
Belis Aladag: I got you. I see. And because it was in her bladder. That's why they went with Dr Faulconer

236
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.040
Belis Aladag: Correct. But when he looked at it. He's like, this is not cancer. This is endometriosis.

237
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:13.080
Lisa’s iPhone: What that would not know when when when he looked at it. He told me that it was a tumors cancer.

238
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:13.800
Belis Aladag: I see.

239
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:23.190
Lisa’s iPhone: But he didn't, didn't know how far the cancer was so when when he send it to get the that it came back as enabling which

240
00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.570
Belis Aladag: Is good and bad what it

241
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.110
Lisa’s iPhone: Means

242
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:31.620
Belis Aladag: The tissue of your uterus inside the uterus. We have tissue that bleeds every month right as a woman.

243
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:38.280
Belis Aladag: You believe every month that that's the tissue inside your uterus. It just kind of shuts off and bleats right

244
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:47.220
Belis Aladag: So endometriosis is when the cells, the same type of skin inside the uterus accidentally gets into a different organ.

245
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.940
Belis Aladag: So instead of being inside of here and going through and just bleeding normally like every woman does

246
00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:09.150
Belis Aladag: Yours, you have tissue like that that bleeds every month in the bladder. So it's in an area where it shouldn't be, and it's causing pain, probably because it gets inflamed because it gets filled up with blood and it has nowhere to go.

247
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:18.000
Belis Aladag: I'm guessing that's what's going on with this endometriosis thing so it's it's tissue that got confused and ended up in Oregon. It shouldn't be.

248
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:23.130
Belis Aladag: But they will explain this to you more at UCSF.

249
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:36.240
Lisa’s iPhone: And for the longest time doctors always had heavy, heavy periods and and she had it like every she would go seven 810 days or a period and then 10 days later, get it again. Yes, yes.

250
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:48.780
Belis Aladag: So it's very typical so this is i, it makes sense that you have endometriosis and endometriosis, because of the condition, it can be very painful. It can make you feel bloated or full or whatever.

251
00:25:49.230 --> 00:26:05.730
Belis Aladag: And so, and it can look like it's a tumor, because there's so much blood. It's just expanding and stuff. So that's why you have these these issues. The good news is, now we know what it is we have a diagnosis. We know why you were having this thing in your bladder.

252
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:18.060
Belis Aladag: And and it has treatments. So hopefully you'll get the best treatment to clear it so that the tissues that are in the bladder and in the areas, they're not supposed to be will be cleared out

253
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:32.250
Belis Aladag: And then hopefully they don't grow back. Sometimes they grow back over several years. Sometimes they don't. So hopefully you can clear it out nicely in in the least invasive least you know bothersome way possible. We

254
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:32.520
Lisa’s iPhone: Know,

255
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:44.250
Belis Aladag: You want to avoid things that are too dramatic if you can do it subtly, so maybe start with the most subtle. See if that works. If it doesn't work, then they can go in and do like a surgery, whatever they need to do.

256
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:56.850
Belis Aladag: So we can talk more about it after you have your appointment. Maybe after you have your UCSF appointment you we can talk again about what did they say and what do you think you want to do.

257
00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.440
Yeah.

258
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.230
Belis Aladag: Okay.

259
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:13.380

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.490
Lisa’s iPhone: There's a lot going on and

310
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:21.750
Belis Aladag: Like consolidation of care. So the good news is I think you're in the right place. I think we know I know where we're going next. So

311
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:23.460
Lisa’s iPhone: Here's the deal. Thank you.

312
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:29.340
Belis Aladag: You're welcome. So. So the good news is this the pill that they gave

313
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:41.550
Belis Aladag: eight milligrams under the tongue, you let it melt. That's how it gets into your bloodstream, you let it melt. You don't chew it and swallow it. If you do that, it'll skip your system. So make sure it really melts under the tongue.

314
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.890
Belis Aladag: And you take that twice a day. So maybe in the morning and later afternoon, it should help you with the pain.

315
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.250
Belis Aladag: Any pain. It helps

316
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:57.390

318
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:06.960

319
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:20.970
Belis Aladag: Yes. So it really is helpful and and so I think and and the good news is it's not something like Norco or bike it in or all these things that are causing big problems for people. People are dying because they

320
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:21.990
Lisa’s iPhone: Start taking

321
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.170
Belis Aladag: On an event and they have to take it all the time. Then they need more than one more.

322
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.310
Lisa’s iPhone: Yeah.

323
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:37.650
Belis Aladag: You stay on the same level. Usually if it works for you. It's going to continue working, usually at that same dose for a long time. So that's the good thing. That's why you don't need more and more. You don't get taller.

324
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.600
Lisa’s iPhone: Yeah, and and it's a religious listening medication.

325
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:48.480
Belis Aladag: So that's, that's called buprenorphine and that's like my specialty. I help people.

326
00:33:48.750 --> 00:34:01.380
Belis Aladag: So my specialty. I actually do. Addiction Medicine. So I actually help people that have become addicted to the pain pills and Oracle's and all those things that are you know faster acting and then they go in and out of your system and you need more and more

327
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:08.580
Belis Aladag: To what you know and then we place them on this to keep them home and and their, their

328
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:15.240
Belis Aladag: Their brain heals from all those changes. So for you, you don't have the addiction problem.

329
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.880
Belis Aladag: Correct. But, but

330
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:31.950

Lisa’s iPhone: To sell jams. Hopefully, you know, I hope in

333
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:48.390
Belis Aladag: And, and I think that once this endometriosis issue is really handled hopefully really well by a good

334
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:59.190
Belis Aladag: Special specialist, you know, gynecologist specialist endometriosis specialist at UCSF. That's what you need a really good one to really hold your hand and help you
