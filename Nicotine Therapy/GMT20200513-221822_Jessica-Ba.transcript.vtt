Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Number this medium number is when you're meeting Jessica to me.

5
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Group.

6
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, okay.

7
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.980

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.290

9
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.740
James Gonzales: Yeah, okay.

10
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

11
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.740
James Gonzales: Yeah.

12
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.160
James Gonzales: Yeah, that's one problem. Yeah, but in case or in case I

13
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.370
Need

14
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:23.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So sorry for the confusion. The thing is, where we're providing this group. And so if we don't have three participants, so we can't be group, but I figured since you came in, let's make the best use of your time or give me your bio psychosocial done so.

15
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let me just introduce myself. I'm Jessica. One of the therapist with bright hearth health I'm licensed in New Mexico in the state of New Mexico.

16
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So with that being said in the event that you're traveling because Tele health. It's very important that we know your location and where you are.

17
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One for safety reasons, and two, because with people that are license the license doesn't travel with you wherever you go.

18
00:03:49.290 --> 00:04:03.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm licensed by the state of New Mexico. So that means we are residing in Mexico. I can do that here. If you go to another state, then it becomes a little tricky because now I no longer have an active license to provide your European that say

19
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:15.060
James Gonzales: Oh. Oh, I get it, though. Sometimes when we meet you may think it's odd, and I may ask, Hey, where are you, and that's me just doing what what's ethically sound and responsible

20
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For verifying your location for safety and for my life. Okay.

21
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:28.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, right. So far, a bio psychosocial it's a requirement with the program, so I'll be asking you about past and present. History

22
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What brought you to the program.

23
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then we'll work together to develop some treatment plan goals. Those goals will be outlined it

24
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In your patient portal, you can look at your treatment plan goals at any time and just to see the progress that you're making

25
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:55.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then I'll check in with you, periodically to update the treatment plan so that you can be aware of the progress that you're making me. You can also develop miracles asked me.

26
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:05.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm going to do this a lot faster than I typically do only because you have a different situation where you were there. And are you here.

27
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.840
And I don't want to cut

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:37.590
James Gonzales: And I just wanted to switch because yeah I mean I like to go for the time that I would on it and everything, but it's time to me out. Like, there's a couple things I don't like about it and I also need to

258
00:22:54.270 --> 00:23:10.080
James Gonzales: With no yeah so and then as after. And because of that, actually, that's when I, at the time I went to live with my grandmother, you know, and because of the situation with my step dad at the time when I was about

259
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: 13 or

260
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:16.260
James Gonzales: 14 um, you know, I finally got big enough to, you know, fly back or whatever but I

261
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.000
James Gonzales: Didn't work out over there. I try

262
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:27.420
James Gonzales: Left and and then that's when I was, you know, I started getting exposed to a lot of lot of drugs. After that, like,

263
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.240
James Gonzales: Like crack, especially

264
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.530
James Gonzales: It was cracked everywhere. When I was at that age, you know,

265
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:56.310
James Gonzales: It was everywhere. And I could end i was i could get it. I had access to it for like free. So I started, I started using it and getting it for other people and and using it to, you know, to, to gain myself some to use and to

266
00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.290
James Gonzales: You know,

267
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.690
James Gonzales: Make money and stuff like

268
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:06.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That yeah yeah I mean for yeah I learned how to do that at

269
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:23.460
James Gonzales: That at that early age, you know, I learned how to hustle really really early enough so that was back in the days when it was different because it was the crack and heroin and now it's like big analysis meth and heroin other craft is still there, but

270
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.070
James Gonzales: You know, it's not as big and more

271
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.220
James Gonzales: And more

272
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.840
James Gonzales: That can be brought on

273
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.640
James Gonzales: Yeah, it was, it was kind of strange when I came back into the game.

274
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.790
James Gonzales: Three years ago and everything was really different. The drugs were really weak.

275
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.790
James Gonzales: And there was everybody was into the math and not craft.

276
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.540
James Gonzales: And or the code, you know, different

277
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.080
James Gonzales: But I still I still knew what I was doing and I still to it and and

278
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:06.300
James Gonzales: It's like to get to, to, to, you know, the extremes much that

279
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.380
There.

280
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was a lot of trauma that I'm not sure it

281
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:26.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really had an opportunity to stop and process adoption in itself brings up lots of different emotions and some physical abuse.

282
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then, then I can imagine, loss of identity, you know, growing up as a child.

283
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, there was some physical exactly

284
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was there any verbal with sexual abuse, growing up.

285
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:39.840
James Gonzales: I'm

286
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.130
James Gonzales: Not sexual book just like verbal I guess a little bit

287
00:25:45.600 --> 00:26:00.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, I mentioned addiction within your family. So all of those parameters almost kind of sets up you know either you're going to be very strong and self determined and beat the obstacles, you know, the stories that you hear and

288
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, but then there's a high

289
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.200
James Gonzales: Percentage off.

290
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:16.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, like you that really all the odds are against them. And so they kind of just go into a system that's already been created for them on.

291
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:23.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Their own so I'm proud that you know you got released and connected to a program right away.

292
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:37.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we hope for you, long term as a variety. So that's what this is about. That's why I get this history because it helps to understand how we can support you therapeutically as well as medically

293
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:43.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To get into Suboxone is the small step for the sobriety. The hard work is really

294
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:59.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The therapy and the willpower and developing the skill set that when you have cravings, that you don't automatically default to the drugs so allow yourself to feel those feelings really identify what it is, so that you can actively work through them.

295
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:06.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The drugs for so long has has crowded, your ability to really identify that are

296
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Out.

297
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There feel them so that you can work through them.

298
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.300
James Gonzales: Yeah.

299
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:19.230
James Gonzales: That's what I was using that. That's what I was really using them for this last time, especially because

300
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:24.780

James Gonzales: And so I you know I kind of oversaw the the shop and and I'm trying to drivers networking, where to go to do all day. So, and, and then at night when I would go home, you know, the office would still call me your office manager would still call me with

444
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Customers that needed so I could get the schedule ready

445
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.560

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know cuz I would go in the morning.

447
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:08.010
James Gonzales: And you know, I would be best if I have kind of sort of like a plan of what the drivers gonna, you know, at least start off with, like, you know, whatever. So I was always

448
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:25.530
James Gonzales: You know, I couldn't even go home and eat dinner like basically with my phone like I had no phones beeping off. Also, I could mean taking you know and and then I would be working on the schedule and, you know, trying to help my daughter with their homework and then or generally mean and

James Gonzales: Yeah, I could see how maybe I was. Yeah, I mean, I probably wasn't as well, I'm sure. But, you know, not too much.

451
00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:39.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

452
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:48.780
James Gonzales: I mean, and then, especially when you know we became law, like I said at that point it was just like

453
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.730
James Gonzales: It's, it's up to go to work and it's up to go home, you know,

454
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.700

455
00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:16.950

475
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

476
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:56.430
James Gonzales: Because I don't need to do it for the money in tomorrow or whatever, you know, I just that's I do that and

477
00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:06.660
James Gonzales: I mean, I don't know. I like to go for release notes like if I have, you know, a truck and start like to go or four wheeling and

478
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.720
James Gonzales: Yeah, just stuff like that, a role.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Play with my kids. Yeah.

480
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:12.330
Yeah.

481
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:24.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's talk about your treatment plan to have another client that's gonna present. I'm not sure you know what the program expectations are, and different things of that nature so I'm

482
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:38.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have certain rules in place to make sure that you are compliant and that is making sure that you have in your groups every week attend any individual sessions that we have scheduled

483
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:48.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then we'll work on developing relapse prevention skills. Those relapse prevention skills will be discussing group and individual segments.

484
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:55.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they look like a lot of it kind of what I did before we came here, I talked to the other patient about, you know,

485
00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:06.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Identify emotions and figuring out patterns, you know, in the topics of the things that we cover. They'll be education on how addiction works and how the brain works.

486
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:15.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And developing different skills to help you manage that helping you identify your trigger always the person people, places and things

487
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's also emotion that's not so identifying and

488
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:28.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those domains. What might be some stresses for you. And then also find out what works well for you. Who are those people that help you when you're stressed out that you can speak to

489
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:40.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are those systems in place. Is it school is it work, is it church are your hobbies those systems has put in place to keep James busy active and plugged in.

490
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:56.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And helping you to identify what those supports on so we'll work on that. And like I said, individual and group settings and the purpose of that is to help you identify your triggers to use the coping skills and to allow you that sense of community groups and

491
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:12.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Individuals where we can process. Some of that trauma and help you to really go an individualized scope of what's going on with James What legends to this point and how can we get James on the trajectory of long term sobriety.

492
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:22.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in that there's different interventions on you this, I'll use cognitive behavioral therapy which is helping you to identify how you think.

493
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:33.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then helping you to stop the negative thought process Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is another way that focuses on emotions, how to manage the emotions and management.

494
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:47.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: group therapy mindfulness and relaxation as well. James in the event that you're relaxed. That's not a reason to disconnect from the program. It is a relapse.

495
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:48.480
James Gonzales: Does the dog.

496
00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:53.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: let myself know get plugged in. We have been put in place.

497
00:46:53.640 --> 00:47:01.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To help support you addiction breeds isolation. So a lot of patients think that if they relapse to stop.

498
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:10.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Stop doing this, but all that does is contribute to you to continue to us again and again, you make a mistake, come back in.

499
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:19.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our requirements is not for you. We want you to be sober, but we also understand the course of addiction so wanted to plug back in

500
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:31.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: India bit those guys addicted brain and speaking louder than a sober brain. I want you to stabilize well and connect with another program. If you feel like that program is best for you.

501
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:43.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Also, James, we have we had the right that if we see that. Listen, your addiction is too intense and telemedicine is not the proper form for you to get the treatment that you need.

502
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:57.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We also have the right to tell you that you don't meet the eligibility criteria and will refer you to another problem. Okay, but for the most part we always try to support you and keep you within our resources.

503
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I do really short term and long term goals that you want to add to your treatment plan.

504
00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.140
