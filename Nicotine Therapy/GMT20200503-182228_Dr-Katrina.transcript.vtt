TCL A503DL: It's like if I'm going to go to jail, all the time anyway. And I have to start over every single time. Then I'm just going to run because then I just have to go to jail for a month and be done and just run again, you know, it's like six months for freedom versus, you know, drug court.

Right.

72
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:25.140

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:33.390
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, perfect. And please come early to the groups. And what else can I tell ya, I guess that's about it. I appreciate you being so patient and getting all this done.

430
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.250
TCL A503DL: I appreciate it. Not, you know,

431
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.720

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:51.600
Dr Katrina Groves: Taking

435
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.960
TCL A503DL: From the clinic, then how did they, you know, kick you guys out.

436
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.240
TCL A503DL: And they did not government

437
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:07.290
Dr Katrina Groves: They did not kick us out. I actually asked to join bright heart because they allow me to keep you guys going because they couldn't find another doctor at the clinic so

438
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.640
TCL A503DL: I'm. Oh, that was all.

439
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.520
Dr Katrina Groves: I joined bright heart because there are private

440
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.310
Dr Katrina Groves: They do this all over the world and

441
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:19.620
TCL A503DL: I'm going to get my arms. So it just happened to start at the time when you are going. And so that was

442
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.430
Dr Katrina Groves: Going over. Yeah, they've been going for about three years. And I

443
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.520
TCL A503DL: Was like, well you been leaving for about three years. I know.

444
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.200
TCL A503DL: I just can't.

445
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.000
TCL A503DL: Yeah yeah

446
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.790
Dr Katrina Groves: I know bright heart is great. They just do have a lot of intake questionnaires. They do a lot of AI.

447
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.430
Dr Katrina Groves: Artificial Intelligence. They do a lot of

448
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.480
Dr Katrina Groves: Documentation so they have tons of forums and you just

449
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:43.770
TCL A503DL: Have a lot of us.

450
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Well,

451
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.770
TCL A503DL: The positive

452
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.500
TCL A503DL: Well, I just, I was talking to do about that. Why do you put people who can't speak the language.

453
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.200
TCL A503DL: In a job where they speak the language.

454
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.420
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. That makes it frustrating.

455
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:04.080
TCL A503DL: Yeah, but so far they haven't had somebody who was, you know, like there was one guy that he's

456
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.590
TCL A503DL: I don't know. It was almost like telemarketing crap they I couldn't get through. I tried to call the bright heart number

457
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:22.200
TCL A503DL: And all I got was an offer for $100 rebate at Walmart or Safeway or something and. And then the guy. Yeah, everything I said it took him about 30 seconds before he could figure out what I said.

458
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.860
Yeah.

459
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.750
