Brandy Duplechin: I was. I wasn't sure if it I'm at a friend's house right now, letting our

7
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.640
Brandy Duplechin: Kids together and I wasn't sure if it was her internet connection. So I kept hanging up and trying to log back in

Kathleen Marshall: All right, well, tell me what you looking into Bernard Hall.

12
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.690
Brandy Duplechin: Goodness, I'm

13
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:19.890
Brandy Duplechin: Have the same doctor for the past seven years or so. And it seems like every single time that I go in, I'm having to go over everything, like he doesn't remember me. And to me, that's shocking, but I'm

14
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:31.410
Brandy Duplechin: Over a seven year span. I had missed six appointments and so I received a certified letter saying that he could no longer be my primary care provider because of that.

15
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:42.720
Brandy Duplechin: Which I guess I understand, but at the same time, when you're a busy mom and things happen. You know, you gotta call and I've always called and rescheduled or, you know,

16
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.080
Brandy Duplechin: My

17
00:01:43.290 --> 00:02:02.850
Brandy Duplechin: Friend made arrangements, so I don't understand why he would have done that but anyways. Just a little background on me. Um, I've been a barrel racer basically my whole life riding horses. So I've been kicked off bucked off thrown off any get off of a horse. I've done it.

18
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:16.560
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, had you know severe trauma as far as accidents. Go. Um, I was also diagnosed with spinal stenosis and lumbar so I have a lot of pain in my back.

19
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:30.780
Brandy Duplechin: Carpal tunnel severe carpal tunnel that I need to get surgery on but I post on that because my youngest was so little. Yeah, there's just no way I could have recovered at that time. I mean, I can but

20
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.280
Brandy Duplechin: At that time, it was just

21
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.260
Brandy Duplechin: Not going to be able to happen.

22
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:49.860
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, but, um, so for the past 15 years my daughter was too. She will be 15 at the end of this month. So since I have been well first, they put me on hydrocodone

23
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.100
Brandy Duplechin: And they made me really really sick.

24
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.190
Brandy Duplechin: I was throwing up constantly so then they put me on Tramadol and I have been on that for the last 15

25
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.450
Kathleen Marshall: Years. Okay.

26
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.010
Brandy Duplechin: Which is a really long time.

27
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:11.940
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, but when my doctor quit being my doctor, I have been going without my medications which has made me have withdrawals anxiety.

28
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.510
Brandy Duplechin: Cry I'm shaky right now because you know

29
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.820
Brandy Duplechin: I want to cry because I don't want to be going through this

30
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.110
Kathleen Marshall: Right, right.

31
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.650
Brandy Duplechin: I want to wake up and just be able to go about my day.

32
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.760
Kathleen Marshall: Mm hmm.

33
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.260
Brandy Duplechin: I'm sorry.

34
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.220
Kathleen Marshall: No, it's okay, it's okay. I think I didn't even tell you my name, just to make sure you know I'm Dr. Marshall think we just jumped right in, but

35
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.560
Kathleen Marshall: So how long have you not seen or doctor or been without. How long have you been without medicine.

36
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.420
Brandy Duplechin: Well, I want to be 100% open and honest with you.

37
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.720
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah.

38
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.450
Brandy Duplechin: I mean, this is the only way this will work is if

39
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.550
Brandy Duplechin: I'm my mom has been sending me um

40
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.530
Brandy Duplechin: You know, some medicine here and there just to get me through, but I haven't seen my doctor in about two, maybe three months.

41
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.990
Brandy Duplechin: Okay. And I haven't been able to, I mean every other office that's here that accepts Medicaid is either not accepting patient

42
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.880
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, or they don't provide that kind of medicine that I need.

43
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.960
Brandy Duplechin: I had a really hard time finding a doctor. Yeah, when all this coven stuff started more doctors were doing virtual appointments

44
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.170
Brandy Duplechin: And so I had Google searched and you guys came up

45
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.220
Kathleen Marshall: Okay.

46
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.250
Brandy Duplechin: So you are my first attempt to

47
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.380
Brandy Duplechin: Try to recover, I guess.

48
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.160
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, yeah. And what have your mom then sending you

49
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.880
Brandy Duplechin: My training.

50
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.710
Kathleen Marshall: And my time at all.

51
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.020
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, my Tramadol and I've also been on ADHD medication, since I was five.

52
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.350
Brandy Duplechin: And I started me off on Ritalin, when I was

53
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.730
Brandy Duplechin: In kindergarten.

54
00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:06.840
Brandy Duplechin: Okay. You have me on the highest milligram, but it still wasn't doing. I mean, the teacher was sending me home every day and hype, because I would have anxiety from sitting still, and wanting to get up.

55
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:17.610
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, so the Ritalin, the highest milligram, it still wasn't working. So my mom to give me a cup of coffee with my Ritalin.

56
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.610
Brandy Duplechin: So ever since I was five. That's where it began. And then they had put me on Adderall.

57
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:34.110
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, I didn't like the way Adderall made me function, it was, it would make me have mood swings, irritability, I would snap at people.

58
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.130
Brandy Duplechin: And

59
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.630
Brandy Duplechin: played around with a few other ones, but finally we came to buy Vance.

60
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:51.420
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, that is the only one that you know me and my doctor had played around with that didn't change my moods and I was able to finish, you know. Dude, my schoolwork, and all that stuff.

61
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.530
Kathleen Marshall: Right, right.

62
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.510
Brandy Duplechin: My mom has been sending me some of my by Vance that I have left at her house.

63
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.280
Brandy Duplechin: Because she was back in Texas.

64
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.230
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, Carolina

65
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.430
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, so before we had moved here. We were living with my mom waiting for our house to be built.

66
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.930
Brandy Duplechin: And

67
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.260
Brandy Duplechin: At that time I was on Adderall.

68
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.420
Brandy Duplechin: So I had left

69
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:26.670
Brandy Duplechin: Some old Adderall there because I was no longer taking that I was on five ants. At this point, so she's been sending me my old Adderall and Tramadol because she takes

70
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.850
Her

71
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.540
Brandy Duplechin: So I know I shouldn't. And I know it's illegal, but it's

72
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.990
Brandy Duplechin: I don't

73
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.520
Brandy Duplechin: Deal with the withdrawals.

74
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.020
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah yeah

75
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.500
Kathleen Marshall: And what those Tramadol where you're taking when you were prescribed that

76
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.460
six a day.

77
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.270
Kathleen Marshall: To day of the fifth 50 milligrams

78
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.280
Brandy Duplechin: Yes, ma'am. Yeah.

79
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.040
Kathleen Marshall: And would you space them out.

80
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.750
Brandy Duplechin: Yes, I was taking sometimes I wouldn't even take six a day. Sometimes I

81
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.070
Brandy Duplechin: Was only like three

82
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.140
Brandy Duplechin: I'm gonna be real with you.

83
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.190
Brandy Duplechin: Take it unless I was hurting

84
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:11.370
Brandy Duplechin: I didn't really take what was prescribed. So in the mornings when I would wake up. That's when I'm usually hurting the worst. I would say

85
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.740
Brandy Duplechin: In the morning, and then at least four hours would go by before I would take anymore. And usually I would just take one.

86
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.760
Brandy Duplechin: And

87
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:33.090
Brandy Duplechin: Right now with my mom sending me some of hers. I've been having them and trying to take three halves a day just because she can't go without her medicine. So I'm trying to get by and not

88
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.140
Brandy Duplechin: Going to get through the withdrawal symptoms. So

89
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.470
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, the last month or so I've been taking three halves a day.

90
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.840
Kathleen Marshall: So for the last month. Do you feel like you've been going up and down in withdrawal.

91
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.400
Kathleen Marshall: Or okay

92
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.330
Brandy Duplechin: And having good days and then other days I have horrible days.

93
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.200
Kathleen Marshall: Okay.

94
00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:02.520
Brandy Duplechin: Some nights I just lay in a hot bath and add hot water and sleep in the tub. Yeah, I know the pain is there. It's not a mental thing I do have

95
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.490
Brandy Duplechin: Problems with pain, um,

96
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:23.430
Brandy Duplechin: But at this point, I want blood work done. I want to be tested for arthritis, my joints hurt so bad. I'm constantly popping up. Ever since I was little, I remember I mean my elbow just now popped me

97
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:40.260
Brandy Duplechin: Every pops and the only time I feel any release is if I'm popping up the doctor that I prior had right before you guys, the one that discharged me told me it was fine to pop. There was, there was no big issue. I've had other doctors tell me the opposite.

98
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:52.380
Brandy Duplechin: Um, but I want. I want to know for sure everything that's wrong with me and then go from there. Because there's no worse feeling than feeling crazy

99
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.960
Brandy Duplechin: all in your head.

100
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.950
Right.

101
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.920
Kathleen Marshall: Right. No, no, it does.

102
00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.370
I

103
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.280
Kathleen Marshall: Don't know barrel racing.

104
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:18.960
Brandy Duplechin: No, um, I wanted to talk to you about that too. And I've never told anybody this ever. Um, there was a time I was about 21 years old and I was training a new horse and she was the worst horse. I think I ever had.

105
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:29.310
Brandy Duplechin: To tame her, we had been given the horse and I was thrown off pretty bad and I, my best friend Amanda was there.

106
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.570
Brandy Duplechin: She made I hit the ground, and I was seizing and there was

107
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:42.030
Brandy Duplechin: So much blood. She said she threw me in the horse trough, just to get come out of not being unresponsive.

108
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.650
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah um I begged her and pleaded her not to take me to the hospital because I was afraid they wouldn't let me ride anymore.

109
00:09:50.670 --> 00:10:04.470
Brandy Duplechin: So I never told anybody about this one particular instance, but I had busted the veins in my eyes. So all the way is red. I slept for three days straight. I probably got a concussion.

110
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.780
Brandy Duplechin: You know, um, it was what

111
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.040
Kathleen Marshall: Are you bleeding from

112
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.920
Brandy Duplechin: I have no idea she

113
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.250
Brandy Duplechin: She said I was bleeding from my ears and my nose.

114
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.270
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, but I personally don't know

115
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.340
Brandy Duplechin: I just know what she told me

116
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:21.330
Kathleen Marshall: Right, right.

117
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.980
Brandy Duplechin: Um, but I never got checked for that accident.

118
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:35.370
Brandy Duplechin: Mm hmm. So I feel like we should definitely because I'm going through so much pain. My mom keeps pounding me about

119
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:42.540
Brandy Duplechin: Finally fessing up to a doctor about this and figuring out if that did any damage.

120
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.110
Kathleen Marshall: Right. Right. Okay. Um,

121
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.360
Kathleen Marshall: Well, what will go into your past medical a little more and go through things but

122
00:10:52.050 --> 00:11:03.360
Kathleen Marshall: So bright heart health. So I'm I am a primary care doctor I do internal medicine, but the bright heart health platform. Have they explained to you, kind of, we're not asking as your primary care doctor

123
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:18.780
Kathleen Marshall: Did you understand that part. Okay. Because you will, you know, there's things that we can do and you know we we help with the opioid issue and kind of the aspects of it and the addiction aspect of it.

124
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:30.600
Kathleen Marshall: And we can work on all of that. But some of these things at some point you'll need to get, you know, a primary care doctor that you can see and have these things further evaluated because you should

125
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.080
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah. Does that make sense so I don't want you to think for treating

126
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.430
Kathleen Marshall: Everything.

127
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.060
Brandy Duplechin: Through that I just wanted to lay everything out and

128
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.420
Good.

129
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.950
Kathleen Marshall: So tell me what other medical problems. Have you ever had.

130
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:53.550
Brandy Duplechin: Um, I did have my gallbladder removed and I had a hernia repair behind my belly button.

131
00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:05.550
Brandy Duplechin: At the time I was going about a year where I was having severe pain right here and I was sleeping in the bathtub throwing up

132
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:19.950
Brandy Duplechin: And I thought it was an ulcer because my dad was actually passing at the time, so I thought it was just stress and to find out I was rushed to the emergency room because I had gone days without sleep because I was in so much

133
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.890
Brandy Duplechin: And it was my gallbladder.

134
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.350
Brandy Duplechin: So I had emergency surgery, got my gallbladder removed. I had the hernia repair the same time.

135
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.600
Brandy Duplechin: I've suffered

136
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:42.750
Brandy Duplechin: Six miscarriages. And that's basically because I had a precancerous cyst. They were non benign, but they were on my ovaries and

137
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.340
Brandy Duplechin: I had a lot of scrapes done

138
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.860
Brandy Duplechin: And it made my cervix week

139
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:56.340
Brandy Duplechin: So I had me and my husband had several miscarriages, but we are very fortunate we have two beautiful children together.

140
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.710
Brandy Duplechin: But, um, that's

141
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.860
Kathleen Marshall: An older children. He said, one's about to turn 15

142
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.050
Brandy Duplechin: One's about to turn 15 and my son, he will be eight in September. Okay.

143
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.850
Kathleen Marshall: And did you have a C section.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.760
Brandy Duplechin: natural birth.

145
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:23.520
Brandy Duplechin: And a complication. I'm with my daughter her foot had grown in between my ribs.

146
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.800
Brandy Duplechin: Know when she was born.

147
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.270
Brandy Duplechin: They had to basically break my rib to get her out.

148
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.400
Brandy Duplechin: Of her foot was like

149
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.230
Brandy Duplechin: All the other

150
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.840
Brandy Duplechin: Place. We had to work with it and do therapy, a lot

151
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.500
Brandy Duplechin: But when it was all said and done, I looked at my mom and told her it was the most fun I ever had in my life.

152
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.780
Brandy Duplechin: Oceans, you know,

153
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:59.190
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, my son, it was more back labor and that was miserable. I'll never forget my grandmother she's a Christian woman and we grew up in the church, and I was hanging onto the bed rail and I was saying.

154
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.610
Brandy Duplechin: At my pregnancies all together.

155
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:15.810
Brandy Duplechin: They were great. And she was breach, so they thought she was twins until the end of it, which was

156
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.520
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah.

157
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.270
Brandy Duplechin: But other than that, it all went well i think

158
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.970
Kathleen Marshall: And no chance you're pregnant now.

159
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.050
Brandy Duplechin: Oh, goodness. Now,

160
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.530
Brandy Duplechin: I'm now I'm almost 40 I do not want to start over.

161
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.500
Kathleen Marshall: And do you something for protection.

162
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.210
Brandy Duplechin: No, but my husband can't have kids anymore. He's a type one diabetic.

163
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.620
Brandy Duplechin: Okay. And over the years. He's become you know sterile.

164
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.610
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, okay.

165
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.080
Kathleen Marshall: And I only probe into it because of the medication.

166
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.860
Brandy Duplechin: You know that we're

167
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:50.760
Talking about

168
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.940
Brandy Duplechin: No more kids in our future.

169
00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.990
Kathleen Marshall: And so the medications. You've been taking right now. We talked about the Tramadol right now you're taking I would

170
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.950
Kathleen Marshall: 75 milligrams a day maybe what you're saying.

171
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:21.120
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, probably somewhere around there and out you know I told my husband from the get that I wanted to be 100% and tell you the truth about everything. And I'm going to tell you I have been downing ibuprofen.

172
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:27.360
Brandy Duplechin: And Tylenol with my Tramadol so bad to the point where it's upsetting my stomach.

173
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.530
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, I'm

174
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.450
Brandy Duplechin: Just because I, I feel like I can't get the edge off, if that makes any sense.

175
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.930
Kathleen Marshall: And when you were taking the prescribed Tramadol months ago for those years, was it controlling your pain.

176
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:53.190
Brandy Duplechin: Sometimes I'm okay. I feel like my joints. Even my toes and my ankles like anywhere there's a joint I'm constantly hurting

177
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.040
Brandy Duplechin: When I'm laying in bed at night.

178
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:04.740
Brandy Duplechin: I mean, it got so bad. I mean, we went through mattresses, trying to find a good mattress. We have a memory foam mattress. Now, which has been best for my back.

179
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.580
Brandy Duplechin: I am a licensed cosmetologist and I had to. I used to own my own shop.

180
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.590
Brandy Duplechin: And I had to give all that up.

181
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:26.580
Brandy Duplechin: Because standing on my feet with my arms raised for hours on end is at this point, I'll take clients from home from time to time. And even after just one. I'm in so much pain and it's

182
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.410
Brandy Duplechin: In my neck.

183
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:29.520
Brandy Duplechin: And my

184
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.860
Brandy Duplechin: Joints, my friends, I hurt my wrist so bad. The other day from painting my daughter's room.

185
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.350
Brandy Duplechin: I've been wearing a cast on it at night.

186
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.800
Brandy Duplechin: And they tested me for carpal tunnel. They say it's carpal tunnel. But, I mean, it hurts, all the way into the elbow.

187
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:50.640
Kathleen Marshall: No, I'm not. I don't know. He said, it's kind of, I guess I'll trust that it's carpal tunnel, but it's getting worse.

188
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.780
Brandy Duplechin: Um, but, no, I don't feel like the trim at all ever really

189
00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:01.680
Brandy Duplechin: I mean, it did relieve some of the pain, but I still always feel pain.

190
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.320
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. And have you seen an orthopedic referrals an orthopedic surgeon

191
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.350
Brandy Duplechin: Know, and my doctor never referred me to one either.

192
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:21.210
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, he did send me because I told him I wanted to get some MRIs done and he did send me to get an MRI done and but it was just of my neck and my upper back.

193
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.450
Brandy Duplechin: We didn't do any scans of the head or any scans of

194
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.440
Brandy Duplechin: The lower back.

195
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.150
Brandy Duplechin: But that's when he did diagnosed me with spinal stenosis and lumbar

196
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.200
Brandy Duplechin: But other than that, that's

197
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.220
Brandy Duplechin: And then I had to quit. He sent me off for the carpal tunnel testing.

198
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.680
Brandy Duplechin: But anytime I would ask him.

199
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.360
Brandy Duplechin: You know for certain testings, he would kind of just shove it off like

200
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.460
Brandy Duplechin: I was over exaggerating. I cannot be honest, I didn't really like this doctor

201
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:59.250
Brandy Duplechin: I dealt with him because I had to, because I have Medicaid, but I don't feel like he listened or

202
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.050
Brandy Duplechin: Like really listened

203
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.780
Brandy Duplechin: I mean, he kind of just kind of looked at me like,

204
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:16.380
Brandy Duplechin: I was a young he was older, probably, I would say 60s. He was a much older gentleman, so he was old school and he would look at me like I'm this young woman that shouldn't be having this pain.

205
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.520
Brandy Duplechin: And like

206
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.220
Brandy Duplechin: Like he I felt like you didn't take me serious

207
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.300
Brandy Duplechin: But this is all really serious to

208
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.300
Kathleen Marshall: It is to me, and you've never Brandi have never used drugs off the street.

209
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.220
Kathleen Marshall: To quote on perfect I

210
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.560
Brandy Duplechin: Know my father was a drug addict.

211
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.350
Brandy Duplechin: I was raised by a drug addict and I went this way.

212
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:52.410
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, completely opposite way. I will tell you that I have smoked marijuana and have this last month, probably five times because of the anxiety.

213
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.840
Brandy Duplechin: Of not having my medications.

214
00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:01.260
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. And besides that add that are you add diagnosed ADHD.

215
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:10.770
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. And have you been diagnosed with any other mental like anxiety mood, depression, bipolar.

216
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.050
Brandy Duplechin: Anxiety. Add, and then the pain. That's it.

217
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:21.480
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. And have you ever been on an onion medicine for specifically for anxiety.

218
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.880
Brandy Duplechin: They have put me um

219
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:26.070
Brandy Duplechin: No.

220
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.690
Brandy Duplechin: No, no, I haven't.

221

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.150
Brandy Duplechin: That for anxiety, the law.

223
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.680
Kathleen Marshall: It can, it can be. It's an anti depressant, but it works on the brain receptors.

224
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.540
Brandy Duplechin: They did put me on Zoloft, but I'll be honest, I never took it.

225
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.240
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, okay, why not

226
00:19:46.800 --> 00:20:00.870
Brandy Duplechin: I don't know, I'm a be for real with you, like, I do have an issue, taking medicine even birth control any prescriptions. I usually get the only ones that I would, because my doctor had also put me on gabapentin

227
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:06.930
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, and he had put me on another medication tram a zone or

228
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.090
Brandy Duplechin: I can't remember the number but

229
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.700
Brandy Duplechin: No, it was for migraines.

230
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.530
Kathleen Marshall: Oh colossal

231
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:14.550

Brandy Duplechin: I can't remember her name of it.

233
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.720
Okay.

234
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:37.260
Brandy Duplechin: I can't remember the name of it, but I never took it and I had taken the Gabba pit and at one time for like a month or so and then I had read an article that had actually popped up on Facebook about how it was addictive and how apparently they're selling it on the streets and stuff.

235
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.660
Brandy Duplechin: So I took myself off of it.

236
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.560
Brandy Duplechin: Because I don't need another thing in my life.

237
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.180
Brandy Duplechin: That I have to depend on

238
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.360
Brandy Duplechin: So I didn't want to get to that place so

239
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.520
Brandy Duplechin: I've just taken my add in the dream at all and that's it and vitamins.

Brandy Duplechin: He was diagnosed with heart failure, and I believe it was self induced probably. I mean, I know he was born with a heart murmur. He was a heavy, heavy drug user. And I'm sure that did not help the situation.

243
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:20.910
Kathleen Marshall: Okay.

244
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.070

Brandy Duplechin: Right after that last accident.

314
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.720
Kathleen Marshall: Okay.

315
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.030
Brandy Duplechin: Even though I was terrified to tell anyone because I was afraid they would stop me from writing

316
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.490
Brandy Duplechin: I couldn't get back on. I was in so much pain from writing

317
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.320
Brandy Duplechin: In general, do

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.850
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, just count how many feel so tell me when you're feeling it regularly.

Kathleen Marshall: Okay, how many

Kathleen Marshall: Do you feel like your heart's going fast.

338
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.600
Brandy Duplechin: A little bit. Just because anxiety.

339
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.410
Okay.

340
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.070
Kathleen Marshall: Lean forward and just kind of pull your eyelids down like that.

341
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.560
Kathleen Marshall: Good, and you can mean by look to one side with just your eyes.

342
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.730
Kathleen Marshall: Your eyes look

343
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.260
Kathleen Marshall: Listen, with your eyes.

344
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:57.810
Kathleen Marshall: And the other way and up and then down. Good. And I'll stick your tongue out.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.360
Kathleen Marshall: Good pop your cheeks like this.

346
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.420
Kathleen Marshall: Good shrug your shoulders out good and turn your head side to side.

347
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.790
Kathleen Marshall: And then just read your emotion of your arms. Can they go over your head and down.

348
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.280
Brandy Duplechin: And see when I do this, I feel

349
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.370
Brandy Duplechin: Like around the shoulder blades.

350
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.270
Kathleen Marshall: Okay.

351
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.770
Brandy Duplechin: I get pinched nerves.

352
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.510
Brandy Duplechin: Quite a bit. Yeah.

353
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.920
Brandy Duplechin: Pinched nerves and

354
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.040
Brandy Duplechin: Years ago when I had one of my mild accidents, I had a doctor put me on

355
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:30.960
Brandy Duplechin: Flexor L.

356
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.200
Brandy Duplechin: Okay, and I couldn't take that either it

357
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.930
Brandy Duplechin: Made me like a zombie and

358
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.910
Brandy Duplechin: I, I'd be honest, I never took it.

359
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.960
Brandy Duplechin: I may have taken it.

360
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.630
Brandy Duplechin: Twice and the bottle. Who knows where it is.

361
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:50.610
Kathleen Marshall: OK, OK. And then if you can move the camera or bring your leg up just for me to see your ankles and the swelling.

362
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:53.940
Kathleen Marshall: Okay.

363
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.930
Brandy Duplechin: Don't mind my toes.

364
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:01.860
Okay.

365
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.060
Kathleen Marshall: Good. Okay. And then you can sit back, normal, that's fine.

366
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.290
Brandy Duplechin: My ankles pop

367
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.970
Kathleen Marshall: Really

368
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:23.730
Brandy Duplechin: Everything pops in the morning. I can't move. Unless I pop everything from my shoulders up in it literally it'll go

369
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.660
Brandy Duplechin: My husband's like wow

370
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:28.980
Yeah.

371
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.850
Kathleen Marshall: And do you do any exercise now.

372
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.660
Brandy Duplechin: Um, I try to stretch. I had

373
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.370
Kathleen Marshall: Like yoga or anything.

374
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.740
Brandy Duplechin: No, not yoga, but I had actually just gotten into spinning

375
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.720
Kathleen Marshall: So by Friday. Yeah.

376
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:57.390
Brandy Duplechin: I really want to get to the point, because I probably spend about 95% of my nights laying in bed wishing that I could feel good enough to start working out.

377
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:16.740
Brandy Duplechin: I feel like if I build muscle and just kind of not work out to lose weight or tone or anything, visually, it's more about want to feel better. So I just I had even gone to the extent of cutting out all carbs in all sugars. I was fat and protein.

378
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.730
Brandy Duplechin: I did notice that it didn't make my joints feel better.

379
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.240
Brandy Duplechin: But it's very hard to stick with that.

380
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.260
Kathleen Marshall: I

381
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.340
Brandy Duplechin: Know I did go about four months where I wasn't eating carbs and sugars.

382
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.090
Brandy Duplechin: And I had went from almost 160

383
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.400
Brandy Duplechin: To 124 pounds.

384
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.400
Brandy Duplechin: Wow, not eating carbs and sugars.

385
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.130
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, but then you get to your goal weight.

386
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.330
Brandy Duplechin: And you're like, we're good now. So now I'm eating what I want

387
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.350
Kathleen Marshall: And do

388
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.690
Brandy Duplechin: You need to get back on track. I really want to

389
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.770
Kathleen Marshall: And you've never had a workout for autoimmune disorders.

390
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.970
Brandy Duplechin: Oh, I've never had any blood work or anything like that. Done.

391
00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.600
Brandy Duplechin: And I would. I mean, how was tested for rheumatoid arthritis.

392
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.710
Brandy Duplechin: And that did come back negative because we have a history of that in my family.

393
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:12.960
Brandy Duplechin: But I don't know if maybe it's like a little sneaky creature and then it shows up later on in life or how that works, but

394
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:26.400
Brandy Duplechin: retested for arthritis and maybe even chronic fatigue syndrome. I don't know what it is. I just know that I'm tired all the time and I'm in pain all the time.

395
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:34.680
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah so so bright heart health, you know, our model is we're treating opioid use disorder.

396
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:43.200
Kathleen Marshall: When your body has become dependent on any type of opioid so Tramadol has a partial opioid in it.

397
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.990
Brandy Duplechin: In what's crazy is when the

398
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:52.290
Brandy Duplechin: Doctor first put me on those, like I said, my daughter was too. So this was a very long time ago.

399
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.790
Brandy Duplechin: They were not

400
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.440
Brandy Duplechin: a controlled substance.

401
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.730
Brandy Duplechin: At the time,

402
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.750
Brandy Duplechin: And she told me she promised me they would not be addictive.

403
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:18.930
Brandy Duplechin: And that it wasn't a controlled substance and I trusted her because I have known it was a controlled substance and if I would have known it was addictive. I probably would have rethought taking the medication, to be quite honest with you, just because my dad's history.

404
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:26.070
Brandy Duplechin: I just always know that that is in my family as far as addiction goes

405
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:33.420
Brandy Duplechin: So anytime anything is presented to me that could possibly be addictive. I go the other way.

406
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:44.310
Brandy Duplechin: Okay. And so I'm constantly preaching to my kids, my daughter. It was definitely now that she's at that age, you know, you have a history of addiction and both sides of your family.

407
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.150
Kathleen Marshall: Right.

408
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:52.080
Brandy Duplechin: You can try something once and be addicted. So I tell her all the time. Just please, please use your brain.

409
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.280
Kathleen Marshall: Right, right.

410
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.270
Brandy Duplechin: You know, but

411
00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.150
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, you can only preach so much

412
00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:57.660
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah.

413
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.750
Kathleen Marshall: So Tramadol is an interesting medicine, it actually

414
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.240
Kathleen Marshall: When your body metabolizes it

415
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:10.410
Kathleen Marshall: People metabolize it differently depending on it, something called our side of Chrome, which is how we metabolize certain medicines.

416
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:23.160
Kathleen Marshall: And it breaks into basically part opioid and part as NRI which is like like an anti depressant has a little bit of pain. It helps a little bit with pain.

417
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:30.840
Kathleen Marshall: So that you might have heard SSRI which is the Zoloft and Prozac and less pro SNR eyes are things like

418
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:42.330
Kathleen Marshall: Deluxe, a team Cymbalta kind of those lines so Tramadol splits into an opioid and an SSRI but different people make.

419
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:51.120
Kathleen Marshall: Different amounts. Some people metabolize it into more opioid and some people metabolize it into more SNR I and you don't really know

420
00:33:52.050 --> 00:34:04.890
Kathleen Marshall: Which one, people will will metabolize it into so I can't know just from looking at you. So it Tramadol you were taking how much of it, you were getting as opioid and how much you were getting as Sri but

421
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:19.290
Kathleen Marshall: The only point I'm saying with that is when we try to figure out, putting you on Suboxone the buprenorphine. We look at the kind of the equivalent. So you may have to tight right, you may have to figure out kind of what's working

422
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.100
Brandy Duplechin: For you.

423
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:37.320
Kathleen Marshall: So what we offer is you know treatment for the opioid use when you know this feeling when you're going through these withdrawals, your brain is seeking out and you're having a craving for what your what your body has just become dependent on. Yeah.

424
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.970
Brandy Duplechin: So teen years is a really long time to be on something.

425
00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:45.030
Brandy Duplechin: Right. It really, really is.

426
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.070
Kathleen Marshall: Right, so

427
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.360
Brandy Duplechin: My goal.

428
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.960
Brandy Duplechin: My goal with you guys is to eventually be on nothing.

429
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.710
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah.

430
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.170
Brandy Duplechin: You know, I don't like I said

431
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.390
Kathleen Marshall: I just want. I think that's a

432
00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:10.080
Kathleen Marshall: reasonable goal, I think, you know, if we consider bridging you you know you get treated with Suboxone and you're on that while you find a new physician for primary care.

433
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:17.550
Kathleen Marshall: Who can kind of work up some of these issues, see if there's anything else that can be done. Maybe injections.

434
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:33.240
Kathleen Marshall: Maybe even a surgery and I'll have an orthopedic referral. And in the meantime, you'll, you'll be on the Suboxone which will control the cravings and the withdrawals in your brain. Let me tell you a little more because you've never taken you've never taken Suboxone at all right.

435
00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.560
Brandy Duplechin: I have but

436
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.070
Brandy Duplechin: It was, it was one. My mom sent me

437
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.060
Yeah.

438
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.420
Kathleen Marshall: Was it a sublingual like the film.

439
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.410
Brandy Duplechin: It was a pill.

440
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.950
Kathleen Marshall: Who the pill. Okay, and did it help with the withdrawal.

441
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.600
Brandy Duplechin: It did. It did.

442
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.940
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so

443
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:59.310
Kathleen Marshall: We can do films or tab. Sometimes people say their Medicaid covers one versus the other. And I can change that. If not, but

444
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:07.410
Kathleen Marshall: They usually cover the films which most people find is a little more easy to tolerate it easier to dissolve under their tongue.

445
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:12.600
Kathleen Marshall: So that's usually what I prescribe on unless people request the tabs for some reason.

446
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:22.950
Kathleen Marshall: But the film. So it has to medications in it has up an orphan and then it has locked zone and the buprenorphine is the opioid part

447
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:38.220
Kathleen Marshall: But it's not the same as an opioid you'd get up the street like Percocet, or oxycodone, or the Tramadol part it, it goes in your brain and attaches to the receptors, but doesn't cause that same high and low that you would get the peaks and valleys.

448
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:49.500
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, so it's a great medication to use however you do when you take it for the first time you want to feel like you're in withdrawal before you take it.

449
00:36:49.860 --> 00:37:06.990
Kathleen Marshall: Because it will latch on to the receptors in your brain more strongly than the Tramadol or oxy cotton and it will knock them off. And so you'll feel like you're going into worst withdrawal really fast. If you're not already feeling some symptoms of withdrawal.

450
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:15.180
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so when you first take your first film, you want to be feeling like like you are. You want to have some nausea, you want to have some yawning some

451
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.160
Kathleen Marshall: Running on

452
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.680
Brandy Duplechin: The one mom sent me it made me throw up.

453
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.000
Okay.

454
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.930
Brandy Duplechin: But I didn't know. Like, she said, a whole one

455
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.270
Brandy Duplechin: And I had taken a whole half

456
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:34.470
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, which I had no knowledge of, you know what I should take or how much or

457
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.510
Brandy Duplechin: I wish I feel better.

458
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:37.620
Kathleen Marshall: Right.

459
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.350
Brandy Duplechin: Right. And it did make me nauseous. I did throw up. Um,

460
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.690
Brandy Duplechin: But it did help a lot.

461
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.980
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, but I didn't. I didn't feel any of what you're saying. As far as

462
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.680
Brandy Duplechin: My withdrawals didn't feel worse.

463
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:57.780
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. Okay, good. You want to feel a little that withdrawal before you take it and that will help not have the reaction.

464
00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:58.890
Brandy Duplechin: I got

465
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:05.820
Kathleen Marshall: So the other medicine and Suboxone is called the lock zone and that when you put it under your tongue.

466
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:13.620
Kathleen Marshall: It doesn't get absorbed in a meaningful way in your body. So you it doesn't have any reaction in there to prevent

467
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:28.050
Kathleen Marshall: People from using it the wrong way. So if you were to inject, you know, or somebody were to try to steal all all your Suboxone and try to, you know, melted down and injected in the rain. It wouldn't give them any high because of the naloxone

468
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.120
Kathleen Marshall: If you get it right in your veins that way. It just won't

469
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:41.160
Kathleen Marshall: Work, but when you do it under the tongue. It just doesn't have any effects that you still get all the effects of the buprenorphine, which is what you want and you don't have any problem within the locks zone. But that's why it's written that way.

470
00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.460
Kathleen Marshall: So for you, I was looking at, you know, the morphine equivalent

471
00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.020
Kathleen Marshall: Basically of the Tramadol

472
00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:56.160
Kathleen Marshall: And if you've been on about in the past 50 milligrams three times a day, then

473
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.360
Brandy Duplechin: It was

474
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.420
Brandy Duplechin: It was six. I was prescribed to every four to six hours.

475
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.060
Kathleen Marshall: Right. And you said, sometimes you take six something

476
00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.040
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah 33 I

477
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:16.740
Brandy Duplechin: Know, sometimes I would take six and then sometimes I would take it everyday varied. I would just take them as I was hurting

478
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.700
Brandy Duplechin: Well, I never really stopped. I know I never took more than six, but there were days where I did take less

479
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.530
Brandy Duplechin: So it just kind of varied. Some days I hurt worse than other days.

480
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:29.370
Brandy Duplechin: I have

481
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.830
Brandy Duplechin: Things in hobbies that I do that trigger

482
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:42.630
Brandy Duplechin: Right, my pain, especially with the carpal tunnel like painting or crocheting or working in the yard. And sometimes I'll overdo myself.

483
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:54.450
Brandy Duplechin: And I'll have worst days than other days. Yeah, but I would. I mean, if you're going to put something in the system. I would probably say that I took anywhere from four to six of them a day.

484
00:39:54.810 --> 00:40:01.560
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, okay, what I would consider them. But now, for the past month or so. You haven't been taking as many

485
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.140
Kathleen Marshall: Because you don't have as many right yeah yeah I've been

486
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.720
Brandy Duplechin: Severe, severe withdraw.

487
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.620
Brandy Duplechin: The half of one. I mean, it doesn't

488
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:18.180
Brandy Duplechin: Already after I take that first half, not even an hour later, I'm filling that withdraw again.

489
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.440
Kathleen Marshall: Right, right.

490
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:26.370
Brandy Duplechin: And I'm trying to make myself do with it because I don't know because I know I'm not, I don't have enough

491
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.510
Brandy Duplechin: You know, so I have to kind of space them out.

492
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:36.900
Brandy Duplechin: You know, so I'm always feeling that withdraw just not as severe. If I take a little

493
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.450
Kathleen Marshall: Here and there, right.

494
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.540
Kathleen Marshall: Well, so, and then the other thing with with Suboxone with the buprenorphine.

495
00:40:48.990 --> 00:41:07.230
Kathleen Marshall: It doesn't. It has to work for pain. The best way to take it is kind of how you were taking the Tramadol so I would have you taken this at least three times a day. So start and then you can see if you need it for time, it generally lasts about six to eight hours. So when people for pain.

496
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.700
Kathleen Marshall: It lasts for

497
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:18.270
Kathleen Marshall: For the withdrawal symptoms. More like 12 hours so people that don't have pain will and are just using, you know, heroin or oxy codeine

498
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:28.950
Kathleen Marshall: More for the high when they start Suboxone they'll often just takes about from twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening and that controls all of the cravings and all of the withdrawal.

499
00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:40.170
Kathleen Marshall: However, when people have chronic pain. On top of that, it's better to split those doses throughout the day because that will also help you with the pain that you're having yes so

500
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:49.650
Kathleen Marshall: I would recommend so we when we take the film's if you when you get it in the container. You can cut it down the middle.

501
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:59.010
Kathleen Marshall: The film. So, and then you can take part of the film. And that's how I would recommend doing it as cutting it in half, it'll be an eight milligrams film.

502
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:03.660
Kathleen Marshall: And the first time you take it. Remember, you want to be feeling that withdraw.

503
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:13.860
Kathleen Marshall: And then you put it under your tongue and let it fully dissolve it can take, you know, 510 minutes sometimes 15 but let it fully dissolve all the way to make sure you get all the benefit of it.

504
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:24.930
Kathleen Marshall: And the film. Another tip is to cut it in the wrapper that it comes in so that you're not cutting taking it out and dissolving it on your fingers when you buy it.

505
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.580
Brandy Duplechin: How big is the rapper.

506
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.350
Kathleen Marshall: Not that big. I mean, you can easily caught right through it.

507
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.200
Kathleen Marshall: It's just a way to. You don't have to take it out and, you know, play

508
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.190
Kathleen Marshall: Around with the film.

509
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.440
Kathleen Marshall: I'm holding this up, it's not

510
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.350
Kathleen Marshall: Trying to show you. You're putting it

511
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:53.430
Kathleen Marshall: But so then you would take for so it's half of a film that's the four milligrams and put it under your tongue, and then

512
00:42:53.820 --> 00:43:11.700
Kathleen Marshall: Wait, several hours I would wait till mid afternoon, and then I would take for you with this dose. It's a little tricky and we may have some tie trade and check back in, you know, the next week because you've been on a different medication than you've been on before

513
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:20.340
Kathleen Marshall: And so, but I would recommend another half film later. And then one more in the evening.

514
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.810
Kathleen Marshall: If you wake up the next

515
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:30.990
Kathleen Marshall: Day and you feel like that controlled all of your cravings and your withdrawals and you didn't feel overly sleepy or anything like that. Then, then there's your adult

516
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.280
Kathleen Marshall: Is you have

517
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.000
Brandy Duplechin: One and a half a day. Is that what you're

518
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.960
Kathleen Marshall: Saying, Okay.

519
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:45.960
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, if you found you had cravings more towards the evening we could add another you know half dose or even quarter, people will do quarter.

520
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.390
Brandy Duplechin: Like to start off small

521
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:54.840
Brandy Duplechin: Yeah, I'm smaller because like I said, eventually, I don't want to have to take anything

522
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:55.800
Right.

523
00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:07.860
Kathleen Marshall: I mean, that's the other way. We could do it is I would start with with the four, but you could do. You said the morning. It's kind of your hardest time starting with the for there you could do.

524
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:14.040
Kathleen Marshall: I could prescribe me that comes in for milligram films as well. And I would be easier for you to put into smaller doses.

525
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:24.930
Kathleen Marshall: So you could do a full film of the four milligram in the morning and then half in the afternoon and half in the evening, and then you're on a relatively low dose that's eight milligrams

526
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.620
Brandy Duplechin: I mean, we

527
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:40.890
Brandy Duplechin: Keep it with the eight and then I'll just kind of play around with it. Instead of taking like a half of one from the beginning. I'll take like a quarter, maybe. And then if I feel like it's not helping. Maybe I can take the other quarter I just

528
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.570
Kathleen Marshall: Looking to see is

529
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:48.600
Kathleen Marshall: The first day, the first day. The most important thing is that you don't want to knock yourself into worst withdrawal.

530
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.910
Kathleen Marshall: So you want to be in a little withdrawal when you take the

531
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:55.410
Kathleen Marshall: Medicine and then you want to see that it stops your withdrawal that you're having

532
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.190
Kathleen Marshall: And then it

533
00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:06.000
Kathleen Marshall: Stops your cravings and that then that you're not feeling really sweet. Be like you took more opioid type medicine that you were used.

534
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.890
Brandy Duplechin: To be as ever I don't ever do.

535
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:08.550
Kathleen Marshall: That in

536
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:15.060
Brandy Duplechin: Anything other than Tramadol and hydrocodone i like i said the hundred code on was making me vomit really

537
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.140
Brandy Duplechin: Not just

538
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.960
Brandy Duplechin: I couldn't take it. And I will drive that actually I was prescribed that for a

539
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:35.370
Brandy Duplechin: It was either. This was so long ago it was either a kidney infection or a bladder infection and I had gotten so ill, and I was crying to my mom and I was like, why would the doctor put me on this.

540
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:36.780
Brandy Duplechin: Awful.

541
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.330
Brandy Duplechin: So when I did have my horse accidents and when I went to the doctor for pain.

542
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.640
Brandy Duplechin: I had just initially right off the bat told them, please do not put me on anything with coding

543
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:56.610
Brandy Duplechin: Right. Please don't put me on at the time. I think they were still prescribing stuff like darvocet and stuff like that. I mean, this was so long ago.

544
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:08.130
Brandy Duplechin: It makes me feel, but I told him, don't you know I don't want anything like that. I even told them, if you can put me on something that's for pain, but that is not addictive and I was specific about that.

545
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.000
Kathleen Marshall: And

546
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.450
Brandy Duplechin: I think at the time Tramadol was kind of just coming into its own.

547
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:19.680
Brandy Duplechin: And the doctor was like, well, like there's this new medication. It's non addictive and it's not a controlled substance.

548
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.900
Brandy Duplechin: And of course, you know, things change.

549
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:28.710
Brandy Duplechin: But 15 years is a really long time. So I just, I'm at the point now in my life.

550
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:35.160
Brandy Duplechin: Where, like I said, I just want to be able to wake up in the morning and not have to depend on anything. I just

551
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:35.490
Kathleen Marshall: Want

552
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.140
Brandy Duplechin: To be released from that.

553
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.700
Kathleen Marshall: Right, right.

554
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:49.230
Brandy Duplechin: I've been praying a lot about it and begging God I attend church regularly. I don't know if you do, but I'm a very religious person and

555
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:54.360
Brandy Duplechin: I've been praying and praying and praying on it. And I just, I want to get to that place.

556
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.990
Brandy Duplechin: So that's my. That is my number one goal right now.

557
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:03.450
Brandy Duplechin: No treatment for what I'm going through the withdrawals. I obviously need the treatment.

558
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:08.520
Brandy Duplechin: But like I said my end goal is to be on absolutely nothing.

559
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.350
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah yeah

560
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.320
Kathleen Marshall: I do feel as we're talking

561
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:20.190
Kathleen Marshall: You know, I feel the best kind of course for you. I think would be to do the lower because we can always increase it.

562
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:33.390
Kathleen Marshall: And, you know, if you're still feeling withdrawal that first day you can take another film, but if we do the four milligram pills, it'll be easier for you to cut if you're cut in half. If you're needing much less

563
00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:42.990
Kathleen Marshall: Because you are dependent on this Tramadol but it is a lot less opioid than someone taking heroin or oxy code on off the street.

564
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:46.470
Kathleen Marshall: So you're already ahead of the game, you know, to start

565
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.050
Kathleen Marshall: It's just that your body has needed that for a

566
00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:49.920
Kathleen Marshall: Long time

567
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.860
Kathleen Marshall: Let me look here and make sure I have your correct pharmacy.

568
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.590
Brandy Duplechin: It should be the Walmart in Waynesville

569
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:21.150
Kathleen Marshall: It sounds like you have good support to your husband, your children, and friends.

570
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.770
Kathleen Marshall: We've been together.

571
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.840
Brandy Duplechin: We've been together 20 years and August.

572
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.950
Brandy Duplechin: On years

573
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.970
Brandy Duplechin: We've been together since we were kids, since I was 17 almost eight

574
00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.210
Brandy Duplechin: You are my daughter.

575
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:43.170
Kathleen Marshall: So, Brandi. The other power of right on. How have they told you how it works with the group meetings and check in.

576
00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:48.930
Brandy Duplechin: I mean, they did tell me that I will need group meetings and all that, but they did not explain how it works.

577
00:49:49.110 --> 00:50:09.810
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so we have a group meeting going as in the North Carolina area on Tuesdays at 7pm if that is a good time for you. It's all women so far there's, I think four or five other women in that group all in different stages of kind of recovery and treatment.

578
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:17.730
Kathleen Marshall: You know, you would present a different perspective because you weren't using you know medicines off the street and

579
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:27.600
Kathleen Marshall: So you may not need it for very long, although it may be very helpful to you. It's a place to vent and you could talk about pain and, you know,

580
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:32.550
Kathleen Marshall: Other things that are going on a lot of the women are mothers in it too. So

581
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:39.060
Kathleen Marshall: And then there's a therapist and I go to the meeting to and then I just quickly check in and see how your medicine doing

582
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:45.480
Kathleen Marshall: And if anything's complicated. We make another appointment, but that kind of constitutes your appointment for the week.

583
00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:59.310
Kathleen Marshall: And then bright heart health also offer the individual therapy and they can reach out to you about that. I'm not sure with Medicaid, how it all works with the financial part but that could be really helpful to you as well.

584
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:09.060
Brandy Duplechin: I just, I'm like dude to join those meetings do I go about it the same way with bright heart health. Zoom meeting and all that.

585
00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:15.270
Kathleen Marshall: Yes, you check into the virtual clinic and they'll give you the meeting address for that time.

586
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:23.370
Kathleen Marshall: So if you're available for the 7pm. I will send the care navigator an email and say that, you know, that can be a good meeting for you and you can

587
00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:24.030

Kathleen Marshall: Taking one film in the morning than a half in the afternoon and a half later, but I'm going to give you enough films to take more than that. If you're feeling in those days that that you're still having cravings, you would just take

602
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:47.880
Kathleen Marshall: Another half of the film.

603
00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:59.760

893
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.310
Kathleen Marshall: Okay.

894
01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.950

895
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:39.150
Yeah.

896
01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:43.350
Kathleen Marshall: Have you ever had a question or tried to kill yourself.

Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, and

901
01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.030
Jeffrey Cannon: I probably need to sit down and talk with somebody and figure out what I need.

902
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.090
Jeffrey Cannon: So that I can quit having these problems.

Kathleen Marshall: Besides, cocaine, what, what's the last time you bought in opioids off the street heroin fentanyl whatever

1007
01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.010
Jeffrey Cannon: It was before my Suboxone scripts, about three weeks.

1008
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.930
Kathleen Marshall: About three weeks ago. So for the past three weeks. You've been on the fence about Windows

1009
01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:00.000
Kathleen Marshall: Right, okay.

1010
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:11.640
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so, you know, bright heart health, a model, you already know your senior individual therapist.

1011
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:20.730
Kathleen Marshall: We do the group session we check in. If a group session is with me. I can do the check in there. Otherwise, you and I schedule a different time.

1012
01:25:21.330 --> 01:25:34.830
Kathleen Marshall: But it's relatively brief if you're not having problems. There's lab work they send for you to get done and we like to see that within the first week or so so that we just make sure your liver enzymes look good.

1013
01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:46.800
Kathleen Marshall: The urine test. If you tell me you know i use cocaine and we know what's going on. We know what to expect. We can deal with that. And we can work with that.

1014
01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:59.400
Kathleen Marshall: Obviously, the goal here is to not be on any drugs. We want to be functional in your life to be accomplishing the goals you want to accomplish, you know, having

1015
01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:11.490
Kathleen Marshall: Few relapses, if any, so that is the goal. We know starting off right now you're telling us, you're using cocaine. So I expect your urine to be positive. And that's not going to cause us to kick you out of the program or anything.

1016
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:15.660
Kathleen Marshall: But that's what we want to be working on with your therapist.

1017
01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:31.410
Kathleen Marshall: And in group and everything, because it's dangerous for your health. And it's, you know, dangerous for you to be having a heart rate that high all the time and I blood pressure and all of those. And, you know, we want you to be healthy, as you do. Okay.

1018
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.990

Kathleen Marshall: Okay, okay.

1038
01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:46.110
Kathleen Marshall: That's what I was seeing here. So I wanted to make sure it was about the same.

1039
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.820
Kathleen Marshall: Yes. Male I don't need to prescribe you it for, you know, the next two weeks. That's what you were expecting. Right.

1040
01:28:54.270 --> 01:29:11.040
Kathleen Marshall: Right. Okay. So this is our first meeting, but as long as that dose has been working with you when we do our check in, then that's the same dose that I'll prescribe and the film's I'll go over just so I know that, you know, you take the film under the tongue.

1041
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:13.500
Kathleen Marshall: Swallow it. It doesn't work.

1042
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:19.530
Kathleen Marshall: If you try to inject it or anything, then the locks on block the effect so

1043
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:25.860
Kathleen Marshall: The only way it works is putting it under the tongue.

1044
01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:33.570
Kathleen Marshall: Do you have a relapse and you're on an opioid and you take Suboxone it will knock you into withdrawal.

1045
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:50.460
Kathleen Marshall: Wrong, because it will attach onto the brain receptors for opioid more strongly and not the other opiate off. So if you ever do have a relapse and you're going back on your Suboxone make sure you're already feeling like you're in withdrawal before you take the Suboxone because it

1046
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.560
Kathleen Marshall: will knock you will make you feel awful.

1047
01:29:54.510 --> 01:30:01.740
Kathleen Marshall: But the way you're doing it right now if you keep this way. Don't have to worry about that. You just take the next dose at your scheduled time

1048
01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:13.470
Jeffrey Cannon: Have mental illness thought of move up the arm three strokes, because two strokes. Just don't have used for so long and you such high doses, especially my main drug without pen on fentanyl

1049
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:15.480
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, and it just

1050
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:18.360
Jeffrey Cannon: Feeling like oh, claiming yeah

1051
01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:20.850
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, um,

1052
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:30.120
Kathleen Marshall: I think that's fine to try. So if you had 16 or so you have about 20, what would that be about 32 films last

1053
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.490
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, I haven't counted them, but I know I've got about 15 or 16 days.

1054
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:42.480
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so let's say you have about 30 films, on average, if you start taking it three times a day.

1055
01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:49.290
Kathleen Marshall: You could even just try doing eight eight. And for some people do that.

1056
01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:57.570
Kathleen Marshall: Because if you're just feeling Jerry feeling some miles. What time of day. Are you feeling that

1057
01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:03.180
Jeffrey Cannon: Um, it depends on how hard I worked really

1058
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:09.180
Jeffrey Cannon: Okay. And a lot of times I worked real hard like must time I get up at four o'clock in the morning.

1059
01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:18.420
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, so take one. Then I'll take one, you know, somewhere around 11 or 12 what what I really love to do is take one around 11 or 12

1060
01:31:18.930 --> 01:31:19.260
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah.

1061
01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:26.640
Jeffrey Cannon: And then tight one around five or six in the afternoon. That way when I get up. I'm not withdrawing from working so hard during the

1062
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.940
Kathleen Marshall: Day. Yeah. What have you got a bad

1063
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.050
Jeffrey Cannon: I'm normally I try to go to bed in between 10 and 11

1064
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.150
Jeffrey Cannon: Us stay up till around 11 or 12 but you know getting up at 4am

1065
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.830
Jeffrey Cannon: For is it's hard for me to stay up that late

1066
01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:48.690
Kathleen Marshall: And you're getting up so early to do side work and work on cars.

1067
01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:49.710
Jeffrey Cannon: Yes, ma'am.

1068
01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:50.640
Okay.

1069
01:31:51.810 --> 01:32:01.950
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, well, I would take try going off to the three films doing it just the way you said that's a reasonable dose. It's 24 milligrams for the day.

1070
01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:11.670
Kathleen Marshall: Your brain should really be all that receptor should be pretty saturated at that point. So you let us know if you're having cravings, but hopefully that will be working

1071
01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:27.030
Kathleen Marshall: So that I'll mark that down so that I know that you're taking the three films which puts you about 10 days you know about 10 or so days of films last and then we'll check in at the next room. And if that's working. That's the prescription will go with for a while.

1072
01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:39.990
Kathleen Marshall: You know, you may have heard people talk at some point of tapering off buprenorphine we generally, like people to be on a steady dose for at least six months before we even think about that.

1073
01:32:41.610 --> 01:32:50.370
Kathleen Marshall: Because your brain needs a job and you've got other things to work on with the cocaine. So I wouldn't really even think about that too much right now.

1074
01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.310
Jeffrey Cannon: The only thing we didn't talk about

1075
01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:55.140
Jeffrey Cannon: Been so long.

1076
01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:56.520
Kathleen Marshall: You know what

1077
01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.040
Kathleen Marshall: I was gonna ask you about

1078
01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:05.010
Jeffrey Cannon: I've been on us so alone. Yeah. Oh yeah, I do smoke, no I SMOKE ABOUT very

1079
01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:05.730
Nice.

1080
01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:09.600
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. For how many years.

1081
01:33:10.770 --> 01:33:13.830
Jeffrey Cannon: I've been smoking since I was eight thing.

1082
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:17.250
Kathleen Marshall: ever quit.

1083
01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:22.140
Jeffrey Cannon: Um, yeah, I've tried twice a try on vacation.

1084
01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:24.210
Jeffrey Cannon: Okay, but

1085
01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:31.980
Jeffrey Cannon: Sometimes it costs more to buy sometimes at one time, you know, you have so much to buy with it.

1086
01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.580
Jeffrey Cannon: That it turned me back to smoking not working.

1087
01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:38.220
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, so

1088
01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:40.470
Jeffrey Cannon: Um,

1089
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:48.120
Jeffrey Cannon: Okay, I have tried to patches enough. I need a prescription for two patches and some a Medicaid can pay for it. I like to do that.

1090
01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.920
Kathleen Marshall: OK. OK.

1091
01:33:51.090 --> 01:33:59.220
Kathleen Marshall: I think that's a good idea. You want to start that now, or you want to try to work on. I would put the box on and the cocaine first

1092
01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:01.680
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, well,

1093
01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:02.130
Yeah.

1094
01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:09.690
Jeffrey Cannon: It's locking down and start with the patches set and unprepared and trying to go and and quit.

1095
01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.790
Jeffrey Cannon: Yeah, you know, because as long as you're still doing one thing is

1096
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:19.890
Jeffrey Cannon: Laid you to another. Mm hmm.

1097
01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.690
Jeffrey Cannon: Okay, people will you know seismic does inside us to make cigarettes.

1098
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.790
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah.

1099
01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:33.900
Kathleen Marshall: So let's, let's have you think about that.

1100
01:34:34.230 --> 01:34:35.220
Kathleen Marshall: Because I want to have

1101
01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:43.440
Kathleen Marshall: A quick quick date set and then we can, you know, possibly at our next meeting. We could prescribe some of the nicotine patches.

1102
01:34:45.420 --> 01:35:00.450
Kathleen Marshall: And see how you're doing make this change first on the three times a day Suboxone films or stress and then we'll check in on how that's doing and you'll see your therapist again and then we'll check in and see how all that's going

1103
01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:01.890
Okay.

1104
01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:04.260
Kathleen Marshall: Does that sound like a plan.

1105
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.370
Jeffrey Cannon: Yes, ma'am.

1106
01:35:06.150 --> 01:35:07.980
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, do you have any questions.

1107
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:10.770
Jeffrey Cannon: I'm not really

1108
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.810
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, and you should expect an email.

1109
01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.730
Kathleen Marshall: And I'll send about setting you

1110
01:35:17.730 --> 01:35:19.380
Kathleen Marshall: Up with a with a group

1111
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:21.090
Kathleen Marshall: Which group. It'll be okay.

1112
01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:22.320
Okay.

1113
01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:25.560
Kathleen Marshall: All right, Jerry. It was nice to meet you.

1114
01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.750

Jeffrey Cannon: By our

1117
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:43.530
Kathleen Marshall: I forgot to record for the last person. So the session for Brittany ciphers. I will fill out the note on my own.

1118
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:59.430
Kathleen Marshall: For these two I've started a note, just put in kind of initial some thoughts on the API. And I put in a few no no drug allergies, but hopefully you're able to get everything else from these recordings. All right. Thank you very much. Bye.
