Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I wonder what they've just been real busy, I guess.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.410
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, I tried like three times, cuz I didn't know it was taking so long. So I just

Gwenevere Abriel: Anybody your time, your time, your time, your time.

10
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, so

11
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey Dan,

12
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.800
Nicole Bacon: Hey,

13
00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

14
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:13.020
Nicole Bacon: I'm going to head back to it later today, after I am helping out my friend by taking them to a colonoscopy appointment and then I'm gonna head back.

15
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.900
Nicole Bacon: Had some hair appointment work here, so good.

16
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you've been touching people these people that you already know.

17
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.010
Nicole Bacon: Yes. Okay. People they already know, but I'm realizing that that was a story. I was making up in my head to be lazy.

18
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.360
Oh,

19
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I you sugar.

20
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.540
Nicole Bacon: Yes, and if it coincided with my story of

21
00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.390
Nicole Bacon: You know, lacking self confidence because of this skin issue I'm dealing with. So it all tied into that.

22
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And being self conscious

23
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you're when you're working with people in proximity I. Are you experiencing this almost in vivo desensitisation and you're realizing it's not that bad.

24
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.960
Nicole Bacon: I think, um, well, I haven't

25
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:42.660
Nicole Bacon: Experienced it lately, but I just realized I was making it making it up to be way more intense because I was telling myself that in my head. And yes, I'm hypersensitive and yes, sometimes it feels

26
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.890
Nicole Bacon: I feel really drained after a day at work, but

27
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.300
Nicole Bacon: That's how I make my name. That's my career. So

28
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, but let's talk about just that that self confidence for just a second.

29
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember when you were working with these clients spending a lot of time thinking a wonder what they're thinking about my skin. I mean, was there a lot of time thinking about it.

30
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.900
Nicole Bacon: I'm

31
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.990
Nicole Bacon: Not like

32
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.450
Nicole Bacon: A lot of time thinking about it before, before I left the house. Yeah. Before I was meeting with clients.

33
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So is apprehension, you are imagining this is how it's going to go.

34
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right, and

35
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you thought they'd be thinking of you.

36
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.570
Nicole Bacon: Like, what's up with this girl skin.

37
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.790
Nicole Bacon: And was she a crackhead you know

38
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So they might they might attribute it to drug use.

39
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.800
Nicole Bacon: Uh huh.

40
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.390
Okay.

41
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other worst thoughts.

42
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.830
Nicole Bacon: Um,

43
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.020
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, like, how is this

44
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.740
Nicole Bacon: Lady doing my hair when she looks like crap.

45
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.060
Nicole Bacon: And

46
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Only to the skin.

47
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.240
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

48
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.350
Alright, um,

49
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think that comes from that that notion that somehow capability is based on how someone looks. Well that's stretch for me. I'm having to really work hard at trying to understand that connection.

50
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:58.530
Nicole Bacon: In the hair business and the beauty. Beauty business it's, I mean it's a major thing, you have, you know, present yourself and and look good. You know, I always dress a little bit nicer more professional. When I go in for clients.

51
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.180
Nicole Bacon: As

52
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.260
Nicole Bacon: You know, if you're not

53
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.460
Nicole Bacon: Prepared and you don't take care of yourself and

54
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.880
Nicole Bacon: You're working to help somebody look a different way or

55
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:32.190
Nicole Bacon: On their image, it doesn't really work coincide, then there's like doubt that I feel like the client might have and a little bit of fear if they come in and

56
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:43.800
Nicole Bacon: You're not put together. They're not going to have confidence that you're gonna help them look good, or make them feel good and also within myself.

57
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:57.720
Nicole Bacon: I'm if I'm not feeling good, or looking good. I don't have the confidence to to to be like, yes, we're gonna make you look beautiful. You know, if I'm not feeling beautiful

58
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe maybe let's spend a little more time on that one.

59
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

60
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.340
Yeah.

61
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just say I am not feeling it be beautiful.

62
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I have the confidence to help someone else.

63
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.040
Nicole Bacon: Achieve that

64
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.350
Something else.

65
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That state.

66
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

67
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So, on this point, we will not agree.

68
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a really interesting conversation. I think

69
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think what's striking me the most is this candid style that you're presenting with today just this. I wasn't

70
00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Really getting in touch with the real core truth about why I was doing something, why wasn't you're making sure I'm getting this income.

71
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Work besides just now showing up here with that candid way of speaking. Has that been elsewhere. You've been talking with people like that more the last few days.

72
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.200
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yeah.

73
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.780
Nicole Bacon: Especially with my parents.

74
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:30.540
Nicole Bacon: sitting down and having conversations with them and they even said that they appreciate the way I'm communicating with them.

75
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.010
Nicole Bacon: Keeping them in the know and telling them where I'm at and what I'm doing.

76
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.140
Nicole Bacon: And explaining to them that

77
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.480
I

78
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:59.130
Nicole Bacon: I'm trying to wait until I actually make your decisions before coming to them and telling them those decisions because they're so like action oriented.

79
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:17.190
Nicole Bacon: That I would get ahead of myself with with with things with them because they're like oh you decided on this. Let's do that right now. And a lot of things shift or change sometimes. And that's where a lot of stress would come from. And so, um,

80
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.480
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I don't know, I just

81
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:43.380
Nicole Bacon: I've just been keeping in my head a lot. The last couple days of just trying to let go of my story and and kind of being this like new fresh person that I can be how I wanted to be. And a lot of the addiction and stuff.

82
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.590
Nicole Bacon: Like clouded my judgment of

83
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.970
Nicole Bacon: How, how I was letting

84
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.640
Nicole Bacon: Certain things

85
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.090
Nicole Bacon: How, how is letting

86
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.630
Nicole Bacon: Certain excuses fit into my story and

87
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.630
Nicole Bacon: Not going forward in Oh, gosh, how am I making it way too confusing.

88
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.790
Nicole Bacon: Like for example, yeah, like the

89
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.460
Nicole Bacon: Okay, I'm feeling lazy and so

90
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.510
Nicole Bacon: I'm just gonna say that I'm

91
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:37.890
Nicole Bacon: Too hypersensitive to touch people's heads because I'm not feeling motivated to build clientele.

92
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.400
Nicole Bacon: Or yeah yeah so

93
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really mature Nicole, my gosh, you sure you want to grow up.

94
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:57.300
Nicole Bacon: I mean it. Yeah, it's less stressful. Like when I stop lying to myself, you know,

95
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I was looking for something moments ago, and that

96
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You said

97
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Fresh

98
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know quite well hopefully I wrote it down. But let's see if I can find it exactly what you just did.

99
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.820
Really cool.

100
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Speaking of there was a new fresh person.

101
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: In fresh person so earlier when you were talking about.

102
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm exaggerating it. You weren't. This is not verbatim. This is how it went in. Well, I mean, I'm not feeling pretty

103
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So, how dare I

104
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Show an app like I can help someone else. I can't even help myself.

105
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that kind of get in there a little tiny bit.

106
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: On the road to

107
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason why later on. And when you were talking and you said, Well, I'm I get to be a new fresh person. The reason why I thought it was really cool that you said that was

108
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I think about how much leeway. We have to give ourselves as humans to show up each day for work. My work is a really unique one right

109
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'm supposed to be a a modicum of temperance and moderation patience and wisdom.

110
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: char, a few facts thrown in.

111
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And if we didn't know

112
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If I had a nice little meditation that I could come up with immediately and certainly I would never be defensive, I would certainly never take anything personally get hurt or I would never tire or be wary some

113
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do

114
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.230
Human Sundays.

115
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you imagine I show up for clients.

116
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I do that, how can I both know the vulnerability of being human.

117
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Because because you guys are going to pick up on a phony. You're going to know whether I can relate to you. You guys are going to pick it up like nothing like like an attic, right, or someone that's right to go this lady, she's full of it.

118
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.140
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, right. So,

119
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I do that. How do I be human. Without you taking care of me.

120
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I do it. How do I get up every day come in here. Sometimes eight in the morning, all the way to who knows when right and be a fresh person. How do I do me, how can I, how can I be this professional when I catch myself flawed.

121
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What do you think goes on over here. We're making it up just to get back to you, obviously. But, so how do you think a therapist any therapist, pull that off with any gross at all.

122
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:17.580
Nicole Bacon: Setting that saying your life kind of and yourself aside and opening

123
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.040
Nicole Bacon: Creating space,

124
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:26.310
Nicole Bacon: Or you're climbing it all kind of setting it aside. Yeah, okay.

125
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, take that fresh. See if you can find a way to take that beautiful phrase you just had a fresh person is each day is you

126
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, creating this space for you as a fresh person.

127
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you do that, how do you create that for yourself what permissions do you give that weren't there before.

128
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.210
Nicole Bacon: Putting myself first putting myself first

129
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.000
Nicole Bacon: And and being really

130
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.020
Nicole Bacon: Like about it, instead of

131
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:29.700
Nicole Bacon: Feeling like I will let myself get pulled into other people's drama or even pulled into their lives and in to their lives and what's going on with them too much and just

132
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:47.100
Nicole Bacon: Remembering that I'm in recovery. I come first and I need you to come first. If I'm gonna do well at this and and go forward in my life because I want to go forward in my life and I want to

133
00:16:48.030 --> 00:17:06.270
Nicole Bacon: There's so many things I want to do. And I want to continue to get healthier. I want to continue to get to heal my skin. And I want to be self sufficient and and and eventually do some traveling, which I really miss but basically like

134
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:12.240
Nicole Bacon: Give you my cell myself permission to put myself first and and kind of

135
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:19.050
Nicole Bacon: Not necessarily not giving a shit about what other people think but kinda yeah

136
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Tiny. Yeah, so put self first depending on the subject matter, depending on the resource, it can change. So for a moment. Notice that you talked about self sufficient and earlier you talking about, I need to make money.

137
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.680
Right.

138
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If you get past of Miss belief that

139
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Work is always fun.

140
00:17:53.070 --> 00:18:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's never boring that it's never monotonous, you can get past that if we both agree. Sometimes it will be repetitive.

141
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Even like oh my gosh. Everybody wants to hear now.

142
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.450
Nicole Bacon: I've been doing the blue hair.

143
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I want someone to

144
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.850
I want

145
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: He's with the pain.

146
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can write if we say that's already a given I already know that sometimes it will be dull and monotonous and that creative spirit. I won't be yes. Other days to inject them really that stretch between you know acumen and creativity and really finding that edge because that's work.

147
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:33.900
Right.

148
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah if you already have that because it sounds like you caught out early SAID, WELL, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE GOT TO DO THEY GOT TO WORK. They got to where thing. I don't really

149
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No more excuses. Right.

150
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta do do this discomfort thing to earn a living so that I can have self sufficiency, so that I can travel and I'm done with that story, and I'm not going to get in my own way. So that's what I was hearing earlier.

151
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't leftover with

152
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: With the the putting yourself first. There's still a standard that you've got going on around beauty, though.

153
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: There's still something left there that I'm trying to leave bread crumbs for you to get to

154
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So take on for me. So I come in here and what I do is I set boundaries. Is that kind of what I do and create space.

155
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

156
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.660
Yes.

157
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if I'm having a bad day.

158
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I do if I'm in

159
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.790
Nicole Bacon: It happens.

160
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.560
Nicole Bacon: It happens.

161
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens but not to me. How can I ask someone else.

162
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If I can't do it.

163
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.760
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I do have. I think that's rooted from

164
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:07.320
Nicole Bacon: Still some weird trauma that's sticky from my my grandma when I was younger.

165
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:26.250
Nicole Bacon: When I get a pimple right when I was starting to really she'd be like, What's that on your face like the first thing that comes out of her mouth was down your face. Oh, come put makeup on and it's, it, it's kind of like a deep rooted almost like

166
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.720
Nicole Bacon: Well, let's play with no

167
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:35.070
Nicole Bacon: Mexican family. Yeah, I like beauty, like, have your hair done. Like, look look presentable.

168
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do it differently. I heard your, your history. Second, Mary. Hi Grandma on my left those the new one. If this is from Grandma. So yeah, we're not since we won't be doing. We won't be doing this, this sort of other stuff for a little while until we get

169
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There. Let's just do some some play some role play stuff and see what happens.

170
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The first, second, I'm going to say to you, I'm going to be grandma.

171
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.070
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

172
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to feel in your body. The, the, yuck. Right. The negative experience and you'll

173
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: you'll sit with it a little longer. This time, you'll know that that's part of the investigation that me as grandma. Actually, I care about how you feel physically when I said

174
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to know how you're doing emotionally and we're going to change the story. We're going to do some investigation that you didn't have the time to do because you went into self preservation

175
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And

176
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.790
Danger was perceived

177
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no time to investigate.

178
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.920
Nicole Bacon: Yeah well. She's got

179
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.770
Nicole Bacon: Me got me.

180
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.650
There.

181
00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I gave you the structure on what we're up to. So that's in the back of your head right

182
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.120
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm.

183
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And the physiology behind it. Is this like you were 12 or something.

184
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.040
Nicole Bacon: 13 yeah yeah 13 yeah

185
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

186
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your grandmother didn't create any space for you around that she presented with her story and locked it on to you and you were ill equipped

187
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And down. But you're not at all year old anymore. Right.

188
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You have your truth. You have your reality and that is what we're going to have it sit out here in between what I say and what you say it's going to just sort of float out here lot longer. Okay. Because that didn't get acknowledged at all before

189
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you didn't get a chance

190
00:22:52.290 --> 00:23:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To even tune in to what their response was to investigate it. Well, what is my truth, what, what do I want to say here. Can I say anything. What can I do. And so it's gotten kind of morphed

191
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.130
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm.

192
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's all the background noise that's that's going on. So I'm going to say something to you what I would invite you to do this time around is CF and you can create your own question doesn't have to be mind just now, but you may say something to me like

193
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandma.

194
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like for you to see this on my face.

195
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

196
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah, really different, because

197
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Of it is. I'm the one that's flipping out

198
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:40.710
Yeah.

199
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You got up, you probably didn't he just stood up walked out of the kitchen, you'd be doing your thing, and getting some seriously just solution across the floor just doing your little girl thing.

200
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.320
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm.

201
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: This big reaction out of nowhere comes at you.

202
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And you weren't ready but now

203
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we can tune into the wisdom of the body because it caught it before you even had an emotion, your body had a response. Before you even had a word for it. That's how fast it moves. That's how smart.

204
00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Our body is

205
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So this time, we may only get that far just pay attention to the sap to the zing. Right.

206
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.800
Nicole Bacon: I'm already feeling in my stomach talking about it.

207
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.230
Nicole Bacon: Already yeah yeah

208
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And this time, it can take. I'm not going to follow up with more haranguing it's just going to sit there and you're going to find your truth and you're going to see where that spaces and that lived truth of what you can do in that moment, that wasn't there before.

209
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

210
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:53.580
Okay.

211
00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever direction. It takes I'm here and I can guide. Okay. Okay. All right. So, and action.

212
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that on your face. Good grief. How can you even come out in public with that.

213
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.780
What is that

214
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.300
Nicole Bacon: Oh, Grandma, I don't know. It's pimple.

215
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me how you feeling in your body.

216
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:37.380
Nicole Bacon: Nervous. Okay, a little scared like a little scared. Kind of like whoa so intense.

217
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:48.810
Nicole Bacon: And I didn't, it wasn't a big deal before and now it's like a huge deal. And I'm focusing on it and it's like

218
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.020
Nicole Bacon: obsess about it now.

219
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you you answered very quickly. Do you know that

220
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: There was like no delay.

221
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So this time we're going to do it, but give yourself permission. Watch this. Watch how socially awkward. This is. But you get to do it in here. This is therapy.

222
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So in here, you get to do this.

223
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to take a big breath in to the belly, you get to do a box breath.

224
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: To send the message down right through that Vegas nerve, you get to go, oh, I know my head is say, Oh my gosh, this is catastrophic I need this woman to think of beautiful, wonderful smart because like like no duh, but my body's telling me we're okay that's in total contradiction.

225
00:26:52.380 --> 00:27:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I'll take a second breath. It's I feel smarter when my muscles aren't tense. I'm going to be able to answer this woman.

226
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Little differently now it's socially awkward and of course right but just for now just see if you can do it. Give yourself a

227
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.170
Moment.

228
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathe right into that stomach to fit out, give it that breath right and you're going to be telling those Oregon's down there. We're okay. I got you.

229
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.460
Okay, here we go.

230
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.520
What

231
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Grief. What is that on your face. Go Tara take care of that. I don't want to look at that.

232
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:45.810
Sinead

233
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.880
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, that was really jolting grandma.

234
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.800
Nicole Bacon: Like in my care carefree just being zone and

235
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.710
Nicole Bacon: rudely got displaced out of that to

236
00:28:53.790 --> 00:29:03.120
Nicole Bacon: Caring what you think. And then in that what other people think when that wasn't my natural state.

237
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can find right now.

238
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What you believe about yourself. Right now I am

239
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The presence of grandmas jolting statement. What do you end up believing about yourself.

240
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that negative belief, they got lodged in there.

241
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:36.660
Nicole Bacon: The negative belief is I'm ugly or not good enough.

242
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Check with the gut CFS. The one that really stung.

243
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.720
We can go directions with this.

244
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But I what I did notice was

245
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of a familiar style.

246
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.170
Of languishing what was going on for you right

247
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Since this is so artificial and didn't. It's not real. But notice how it's still

248
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.410
Nicole Bacon: Even though it's coming from me.

249
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would would never say that to anybody.

250
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But even even impression of it can still still hurt so

251
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Try this on.

252
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can. Oh, contrived whenever is asking me to say it.

253
00:30:53.910 --> 00:31:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it doesn't fit, then that's fine, right, because it's forced, but then you can discard it. And you can do wrong but just try it on as this little costume and and take it right back off.

254
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to say to you, you're going to breathe, you're gonna find your truth and then see if you know the actual emotion that you feel associated with that stomach with those thoughts. See if you know the emotion and

255
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The contrived part just say, Grandma, I feel

256
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.640
Nicole Bacon: You

257
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you sound like you're going to have some other sounds around you and that's okay too. Because that's like

258
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.020
Yeah.

259
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.660
Nicole Bacon: Okay ready yeah

260
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.200
So,

261
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning, how are you

262
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What is on your face good grace.

263
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.330
Are you

264
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing Yeah, nice and deep that big belly breath.

265
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Until you feel ready

266
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.070
Nicole Bacon: I feel sad about it. I'm sad.

267
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel sad.

268
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandma. When you see if you can find that one I did something

269
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:46.050
Nicole Bacon: I've been hypercritical me or judging me judging.

270
00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: put that all together. I feel sad I

271
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.140
Nicole Bacon: feel sad when you judge me.

272
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.300
Nicole Bacon: That

273
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.970
Nicole Bacon: It hurts.

274
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Check. Check with your gut. See how it's done.

275
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.430
Nicole Bacon: I can see how this is like rewiring definitely that's

276
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.280
Good.

277
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel sad when you're judging me

278
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I was just a fresh new me this morning, bouncing around doing a deal.

279
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you jolted me right there was this

280
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I had acceptance.

281
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good enough.

282
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember I was playing around with some different kind of

283
00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Questions before

284
00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:00.360
Nicole Bacon: We

285
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Do them, but we can. So again, try on artificial and grandma.

286
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like

287
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.160
Nicole Bacon: We

288
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know ridiculous off bounds. No way.

289
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm buying my distress. Right. Why am I lists gusting but that's not your experience that's mine. So

290
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe don't take it on at all.

291
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.850
Nicole Bacon: And see that question.

292
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Is within reach. Let's see what happens.

293
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be something like

294
00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What just happened to you.

295
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

Yeah.

297
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a strong opinion, you're just trying to get to the milk and whatever. And no, you weren't able to

298
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.270
Use like they're

299
00:34:55.470 --> 00:35:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Using right, she's the one that's got this big hoopla going on.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.930
Uh huh.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:03.150
So care.

302
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Care about her for a second. Be curious don't live in the hurt on this time. Not this time. This time, just be curious. She's not

303
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's her stick

304
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So go check it out.

305
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.660
Nicole Bacon: See me

307
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not. I'm just going through something

308
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: My experience.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay ready. Here we go.

Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, alright. So, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle. Oh, hi, sweetie. Good morning.

312
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:56.400
Nicole Bacon: Hey, good man.

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, look at you.

314

Gwenevere Abriel: Look at that. Are you going to take care of that.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you see that this morning. Did you see

316
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.250
Nicole Bacon: What this

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh.

318
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:19.830
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

319
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.030
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it's a pretty big pimple there huh

320
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.870
Nicole Bacon: Is it look bad isn't really read like

321
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.790
Nicole Bacon: You freaking out.

322
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What you got,

323
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to why you freaking out right

324
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're now observing her behavior. You can

325
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, are you really there or you lost in your own fear and distress.

326
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.800
Nicole Bacon: Partially there yet. Yeah.

327
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Partially there and they giggling helps

328
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:04.650
Uh huh.

329
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.220
Nicole Bacon: When I feel awkward. I get go. Yeah.

330
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that tension.

331
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's neat about the stuff that I'm asking you to do this weird awkward thing of breathing.

332
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it completely breaks the social norms of how quickly we respond to people when we're talking because we're supposed to be really sharp and smart and funny and our, we have our retards right

333
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:28.260
It.

334
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that's fun. And that's what we do but

335
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now when someone attacks like that when they come

336
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: With their story for their reasons.

337
00:37:45.480 --> 00:38:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You now have a skill in this timing of the breath and being quiet you being able to tolerate the awkward in a social situation when I can't is so powerful because I'm going to be over here really squirming

338
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And be filling it in. I'm going to be like, oh,

339
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Because why everything was going on, what's happening right i'm going to be all flustered, and you are going to keep your cool

340
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be busy taking care of yourself, making sure you know because it's a learning new skill of being able to differentiate someone else's opinion.

341
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: From my own opinion of myself, How do I care about this person's opinion. How do I hold on to myself and still love this woman, it's, it's hard. It takes time to do that when you're not rehearse doubt it.

342
00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.850
Yeah, tricky.

343
00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:43.800
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

344
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how I mentioned time when you say I'm going to give myself time to always take care of myself.

345
00:38:53.580 --> 00:39:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And that breath I get seconds and the mind works so fast, it could really end up being just a fraction of a second, but you just give a little bit of time.

346
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: To think of something to say.

347
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might end up being

348
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

349
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm shocked.

350
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I care about what you think grandma.

351
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: My go hurt.

352
00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

353
00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You really don't like this.

354
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Come from. I mean, you do know. Like, I'm like, right on time with my adolescence. I'm getting my boobs. I got a new stinky on on

355
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing you've noticed

356
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.540
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

357
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: There is choice. There's right that's just a different perspective.

358
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:01.740
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm.

359
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at all the distance. She's not threatening anymore. She's a little bit like, well, you didn't pick up on this earlier. Like, what's wrong with you, like, I'm an adolescent I'm right.

360
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: On time over here. Oh, great. What you do when you got one. Did you see me, you do the camera meal deal would you do. Yeah, I saw that yesterday I was broken. What do you do with it and

361
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, I'm curious.

362
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm safe inside. I can

363
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.660
Nicole Bacon: I can afford to be curious when I feel safe inside

364
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get there by being in a relaxed body. You just serve time and that breath you shoot time if you can tolerate the awkwardness of it. Sometimes it happy. You can regulate very quickly.

365
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.540
Nicole Bacon: But anything happens

366
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Socially to when you take that time you taking back the ownership of that conversation. They don't run you by someone saying something to you, you just

367
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, what are you doing, and you'll say I'm breathing. Well, somebody to give you a hard time about breathing. I don't think so. And

368
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Then they look ridiculous. I've just taken the breath.

369
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, all of that. All of that is available to you.

370
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you know that before we started talking, there's this whole other world.

371
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.510
Nicole Bacon: There's this whole other world.

372
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Of you interacting with a perceived threat. There's this whole other world.

373
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:40.380
Nicole Bacon: was awesome. It's awesome, because like i you know i a little bit with the giving it back in like humor. You know, like when

374
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:54.810
Nicole Bacon: People would like kind of poke fun you know I got that a lot when because my last thing speaking. And oh, big under them like tell me something I haven't heard you know like giving it back in a in a

375
00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:02.040
Nicole Bacon: humorous way. But as far as like the just breathing and and

376
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:10.020
Nicole Bacon: Not letting it affect me so much and and that's a powerful thing. I'm excited about that tool.

377
00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And when you really get it, you're going to be able to do it. So, you know, you can you can be doing it with clients.

378
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you repeat that again. I didn't catch that last bit and you were really didn't hear any of it, but you were breathing, you're giving your doesn't matter.

379
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and especially. This is a handy one i can't i can't wait to show you this one. This is just great. This one you memorize use it all the time. You breathe and they go, What the heck are you doing what's going on without breathing business was it what he says to me.

380
00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say

381
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, I'm just taking a breath. I can't eat, you know, what you're saying is really important.

382
00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to take time and really think about what you're saying. And if you've completely forgotten what they've said, Well, you've memorized that you can say that to anybody. And then you can say

383
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you repeat it again, or can we talk about it tomorrow and I have more time the phrases, what you're saying is really important.

384
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, you know what that does gives me time

385
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To collect myself.

386
00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I just say it all the time.

387
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm dissociating right

388
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

389
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: They will obviously be uncomfortable with quiet and their part is what's going on. I'm really thinking about what you're saying. And it seems really important to you.

390
00:43:51.660 --> 00:44:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to give it. I want to give it more time. I don't have time now I'm doing hair count. Can we talk in 15 minutes. You remember those fancy little phrases after you breathe the breath. It's there for you. It's going to help you use all of your brain.

391
