00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.720
Belis Aladag: Have to do it that way if you chew it or swallow it or something it bypasses your system and you don't

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:14.850
Belis Aladag: We'll do that. So I'll give you, I'll give you a week's worth, which should cover you through Monday, actually. And then when I see one day I'll give you more.

55
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.610
Anthony Thayer: Than we have to go through this process.

56
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.180
Anthony Thayer: This process, hopefully we'll get a better next time.

57
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:39.210
Belis Aladag: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Hopefully it's not as glitchy where and what happens is you go, you just the same thing you did you try to call into the virtual clinic.

58
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.690
Belis Aladag: But because the group is at nine just call them at like 815 820 if you can, if you're up just call them early

59
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:58.740
Belis Aladag: And say it doesn't hurt to check in early because what happens is they do whatever they need to do. They usually give you a survey, like, okay, how are your cravings, whatever. Some, some survey about your addiction and then they

60
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.080
Belis Aladag: Go. Oh, sorry.

61
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.120
Belis Aladag: It should be pretty

62
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:11.850
Belis Aladag: Maybe the first time will be a little bit longer but moving forward. The group from what I hear from the patients. It's a brief survey, it's not a big deal.

63
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:25.980
Belis Aladag: And then they give you a number a zoom number. And they're like, okay, well your group is meeting in this particular number today. You need that number so that you can then log in at nine and like start talking to us. So if you can do it.

64
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.400
Early

65
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.160
Anthony Thayer: So where was

66
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.520
Anthony Thayer: I was stuck in the waiting room and then that never happened.

67
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:42.240
Belis Aladag: So the virtual clinic NEVER GOT YOU THROUGH YOU WERE IN THE VIRTUAL clinic waiting room. Yeah, I said.

68
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.290
Anthony Thayer: Okay.

69
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.240
Anthony Thayer: I'm gonna go next time a lot

70
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.860
Anthony Thayer: Earlier do

71
00:06:46.890 --> 00:07:02.610
Belis Aladag: Earlier earlier is better because if you finish early. That's great. At least you have the number that you need to come to me you know that's what you need is the numbers. So they need to just give you a number that's their main job the check you in with whatever they need to do.

72
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:12.720
Belis Aladag: And then give you the number. So if you get the number earlier than nine that's great because then you can just be there login see me. Get your prescription, you know, do that whole thing.

73
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:23.250
Belis Aladag: Also email you now so that you have the you probably already have the 800 number, but I'm going to give it to you in the email again.

74
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:36.000
Belis Aladag: If the virtual clinic is all clogged up for some reason you're having trouble, you can try to override call the 800 number and say, Hey dude, I'm still on the thing. I'm not getting through what's going on and try to bypass it that way.

75
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.960
Okay.

76
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.480
Anthony Thayer: I said, Anthony an email.

77
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.350
Anthony Thayer: Okay, good. Okay, that might have made it worth. I don't know.

78
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.980
Anthony Thayer: I'm just glad you're here because I was like, What's going on with him. I was here at 12 waiting, waiting, like, yeah, he'd

79
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.630

81
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.600
Belis Aladag: Anyway, sorry about the technical stuff but

82
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.500
Anthony Thayer: First type thing.

83
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.080
Anthony Thayer: First time thing. Right. Yeah.

84
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:11.490
Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, I'm also going to prescribe Narcan for you. You know what that is the reversal agent in case of overdose.

85
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.210

86
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.540
Belis Aladag: It's a spray in the nostril. Do you live with anybody.

Belis Aladag: I mean,

92
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:38.910
Belis Aladag: It's, it's good to have it doesn't hurt anybody. If you, if someone passes down, you're like, I don't know if it's heroin or opiates, like what's going on with this guy, but he's not waking up to spray it.

93
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:48.000
Belis Aladag: Back and call 911 it is temporary. So you do want to still call 911 because they may slip back into the overdose.

94
00:08:48.990 --> 00:09:00.390

Anthony Thayer: I was severely I guys really abused in like my parents, where the, where the

141
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.790
Anthony Thayer: I'm sorry, I was like, really abuse and my stepmom and take me to these appointments and

142
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:19.410
Anthony Thayer: Get the doctor to like think of certain type of way that I go to the appointment and he's like, yep, or whatever, Stefan said I was just like, what, like weird, but I was taking taking Ritalin or Adderall and then concert

143
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:26.580
Anthony Thayer: And then I was taking so that's why when I was like 1516

144
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.670
Anthony Thayer: And all the way until I was like

145
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:38.040
Anthony Thayer: I don't know 22 and it works for me. Like I said, like really progressive and like you know

146
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.800
Anthony Thayer: But then it was like

147
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.230
Anthony Thayer: Had a couple mental

148
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.540
Anthony Thayer: Lost my prescription

149
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:56.400
Anthony Thayer: Not lost my prescription, but like wasn't seeing that doctor anymore. Moving to more like Sacramento kind of area.

150
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.920
Anthony Thayer: And then self medicating I started using like math and stuff.

151
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.600
Anthony Thayer: And then

152
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.940
Anthony Thayer: And then from there I tried like oxy cotton.

153
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:29.040
Anthony Thayer: And I was a really, really into oxy cotton, it was kind of like it was kind of like math for me. But like, it made me just really personable and stuff like that. And that's all I wanted was like really good character and like good features inside the body. You know, like

154
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:40.110
Anthony Thayer: And so then I was like heroin and just like all across the board wham, bam, just all the drugs and then on

155
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:48.870
Anthony Thayer: I've been doing this off and on thing for me. And then recently I just been Zana,

156
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.330
Anthony Thayer: Devastating. But these are not this regulars annex is there.

157
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.120
Anthony Thayer: I think

158
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:03.600
Anthony Thayer: In

159
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.400
Anthony Thayer: Depth.

160
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:08.790
Oh,

161
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.550
Anthony you're cutting off.

162
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.040
I'm here.

163
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:19.800
Can you hear me you were cutting off.

164
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:28.830
Anthony Thayer: I heard the part about the Xanax that they're not like regular Xanax, they're like super duper Xanax, that's the one thing you were getting into

165
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.160
Anthony Thayer: The other these are fentanyl for sure. Sentinel

166
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.320
Anthony Thayer: Put your tongue on them and you're done. Like you're done for a day and a half.

167
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:50.700
Anthony Thayer: And so then that so I found out and then that was just like, who I fell in love with it. I can just fall asleep and wake up whenever I you know

168
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:59.460
Anthony Thayer: Didn't have to think about, you know, I would just fall asleep and, like, just go back and scared my wife.

169
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.820
Anthony Thayer: Because I wanted to die.

170
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.190
Anthony Thayer: Like, you know, I wanted to go to sleep in a really good

171
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.870
Belis Aladag: when when when was that

172
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:29.850
Anthony Thayer: That was like after a complicated pregnancy. You like we had this fucking pregnancy and I'm supposed to do like hella grateful, but like, my life has been like the same way. Like we end up having a baby at one pound five ounces and like

173
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:36.240
Anthony Thayer: I don't know what how to think about that you know I'm saying, like, I just don't know how to process that like

174
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.750
Anthony Thayer: She's like, Well, I'm going to take care of my baby. It's like, well, you're the mom you carried the baby. You've been carrying the baby. You know what I'm saying. And then like

175
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:54.720
Anthony Thayer: They I don't new therapy or counseling. And I'm like, so I just like I tried self medicating we can just because I don't have a regular doctor, I don't have a regular description like

176
00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.900
Anthony Thayer: You know, I don't know what to do. Like I had no one to talk to you. So I started just get in this shirt like

177
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:16.530
Anthony Thayer: And fentanyl Xanax was the one. And so I just like, did that skit like scared the shit out of her and then like Lost my whole family like forever. You know, like I see my son like twice a week now and it's just not the same.

178
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.490
Anthony Thayer: So fuck you know

179
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.120
Belis Aladag: Okay. How old is he now.

180
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.380
Anthony Thayer: He's too.

181
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.730
He's two years old. Yeah. Wow. So he was born, really, really small.

182
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.700
Anthony Thayer: He was a micro preemie

183
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.980
Belis Aladag: Wow, he's

184
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:45.300
Anthony Thayer: Healthy 23 weeks, five days, but he's got some respiratory issues.

185
00:18:46.590 --> 00:19:04.830
Anthony Thayer: But like he's great. Yeah, he's he's great, he's just learning, learning, learning, learning, he's a little slow like he doesn't say I love you too easily or like words in three sequences like three words in a sequence. I'm kind of hard on because like

186
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:14.550
Anthony Thayer: Early know I needed I needed to be like get like staying with the program like staying with like, you know,

187
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.530
Anthony Thayer: Me hitting those milestones.

188
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.830
Anthony Thayer: Because it's important

189
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.160
Anthony Thayer: Like, I don't really want to have a child like that's disabled or

190
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.980
Anthony Thayer: Like, like me.

191
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.440
Anthony Thayer: You know,

192
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.450
Well, I wouldn't say you're done. It doesn't sound like you're dumb at all.

193
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:55.380
Okay, so that was two years ago that hard complicated pregnancy you not knowing what to do, how to deal with everything going towards the fentanyl Xanax and just almost wanting to, like, just like go and not wake up.

194
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:05.250
Anthony Thayer: Yeah. And then she just so you want to hear about more recent Yeah, she said, No, you're out of the house. Like, you're done.

195
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:14.070
Anthony Thayer: Okay, so, so, so she was cheating. Anyway, she was cheating. Anyways, so it's just like any, you know, but um

196
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.320
Anthony Thayer: So that was

197
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.650
Anthony Thayer: Abandoned terribly just like everything else in my life did kind of them. Um,

198
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.690
Anthony Thayer: I don't know, like I've been doing alcohol.

199
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.990
Anthony Thayer: And the now nothing just just Suboxone

200
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.000
Anthony Thayer: You know,

201
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:44.010
Belis Aladag: Yeah, so that's the most reason. So tell me, okay. So how did you end up in that 28 day or 30 day program.

202
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.980
Anthony Thayer: Oh, I got I got suicidal sort of cut my wrists.

203
00:20:48.630 --> 00:21:01.410
Anthony Thayer: And then I got help for it. They went there once got suicide or was too son got went there once, and then they helped me. They got me into an apartment that I smashed some alcohol like

204
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:13.860
Anthony Thayer: Like, wow, like a lot of alcohol got drunk and really like because I was already suicidal. And I was like, I'm gonna kill myself. I do not know you know and like

205
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:22.650
Anthony Thayer: I didn't want to cut my wrists or anything, but I was just drinking like contemplating and and everything like that. And it was just like

206
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:35.310
Anthony Thayer: I can't stay here and you were like, great. Fuck you know this is much harder. Like, and I had to go back to the mental Institute back to rosewood and then

207
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:41.760
Anthony Thayer: I saw this doctor who prescribe Suboxone and I've never been prescribed Suboxone because I was doing

208
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.140
Anthony Thayer: Those fentanyl the Xanax and stuff again.

209
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:58.530
Anthony Thayer: And so they said like, you know, do you think you have like a dual diagnosis. Like I said, I do have a dual diagnosis like drugs and stuff. She's like, Well, how about medication assisted treatment.

210
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:05.040
Anthony Thayer: And I was like, show like you know she's like, how much do you use a day, I was like, well, I can like

211
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:12.540
Anthony Thayer: I'm I'm pretty big already and then like I do have a high tolerance to

212
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:27.990
Anthony Thayer: You know, Ken my money put it for, I don't think so. But like I can do a lot of heroin and was doing a lot of heroin and doing the fentanyl too. And so she prescribed me on Suboxone

213
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:40.740
Anthony Thayer: The heroin and fentanyl ARE YOU WERE YOU injecting these things are you, what are you taking yeah rejected heroin. I took fentanyl in the form of a pill.

214
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:52.470
Okay, so then she got you on the Suboxone in the Suboxone really helps your cravings. Right. I mean, it helps the cravings. It calms them down. You're not resorting back

215
00:22:55.290 --> 00:23:05.040
Anthony Thayer: When you're on. Yeah, it's like it's kind of like i think i think this is what you guys are thinking, I don't know. It's like get me hooked on this instead of

216
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:19.140
Anthony Thayer: going out and doing how and stuff like that. Give me hooked on this right. It's basically something. It is a partial opioid so you're right about the hooked part is, yeah, you, you have a dependency on it because

217
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:35.790
Belis Aladag: If you stop it like you did, you know, you, you're kind of forced to you notice you're going through withdrawal. The withdrawal is slower to onset, because it's a longer acting substance, but it's still so so the point is, yes, you're dependent on it.

218
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:45.510
Belis Aladag: But if we use it long enough where your brain kind of gets back to normal. You know how you're saying you have a high tolerance and

219
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:59.280
Belis Aladag: Stuff heroin and fentanyl if we use this long enough, your tolerance may go down your brain receptors will regulate themselves again and be more sensitive again to to opioids and whatever.

220
00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:14.340
Belis Aladag: All that healing will happen to baseline levels and then we can, if you feel stable and you want to we can slowly get you off of this very, very slowly like one milligram at a time per month or something and like get you off of

221
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.570
Anthony Thayer: You have to eventually

222
00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.070
Belis Aladag: You know,

223
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.510
Belis Aladag: But you're right.

224
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.590
Belis Aladag: It's kind of like this is the safer alternative instead of

225
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:31.560
Belis Aladag: Doing all that crazy stuff this we know has a ceiling effect on how much it can stop your breathing. So your overdose risk is like super low

226
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:41.220
Belis Aladag: You don't have all the other risks associated with injecting and then using things off the street, we don't know the quality or what's really in the, you know what I mean, all

227
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:47.970
Belis Aladag: Those with that and the chaos, you know, the chaos and your mind, your money, your well being.

228
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:57.360
Belis Aladag: Yeah. So yeah, I mean that's sticking to the medication and staying away from the other stuff. That's the main goal right

229
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:04.470
Belis Aladag: Do you feel like that would be something you want to try to do again like that's what we want to do, right.

230
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.630
Anthony Thayer: That's what we're doing anything. Okay.

231
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.530
Belis Aladag: Good. Okay.

232
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.250
Awesome.

233
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.460
Belis Aladag: In terms of alcohol.

234
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:26.370
Belis Aladag: It's not a good idea to be drinking at all with Suboxone because again it is a partial to opioids. So I really would encourage you to stay sober from all

235
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.080
Anthony Thayer: Know, yeah. I have to. Yeah, I have to say server.

236
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.540
Belis Aladag: Yeah, and you're mentioning this mental illness. History

237
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:37.560
Anthony Thayer: Which

238
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.030
Anthony Thayer: Of all the different things, you're

239
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.200
Anthony Thayer: Diagnosed with

240
00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.630
Belis Aladag: borderline seems to be the most like relevant to you and you're like,

241
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.050
Belis Aladag: That's the one that like rings true

242
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:57.960
Belis Aladag: It's just the best idea to keep your mind clear of like I said mind altering substances as much as possible.

243
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:13.320
Belis Aladag: That includes medication you know like if we can get you off all medication, that'd be great to one day, but I think if we can keep this sensual like Suboxone right now is essential launch you alive. We want you to healthy and then we can slowly work on getting that off to

244
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:31.620
Belis Aladag: And then through bright heart health, you will have an assigned you have an assigned therapist. Her name is Serena. You can see her virtually as well. One on one if you want like once a week to just kind of get working on all this stuff.

245
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.630
Anthony Thayer: Yeah yeah

246
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:39.270
Belis Aladag: I think it'll be good for you. I'm so, so

247
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.730
Anthony Thayer: Excited actually about this program.

248
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:53.430
Belis Aladag: I think I think it'll be good. I think it's good because you can take it anywhere. Wherever you're at, you know, if you move out of the shelter wherever you're at. You have it. You have your phone.

249
00:26:53.460 --> 00:27:00.090
Anthony Thayer: Yeah, yeah. Um, and then what else can I tell you, okay.

250
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:10.050
Belis Aladag: So the suicidal stuff. It's, it's definitely worrisome. You know that it was happening. Multiple times. Multiple attempts. It sounds like right

251
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.270
Anthony Thayer: Through my life.

252
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.490
Anthony Thayer: Yeah.

253
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.950
Belis Aladag: And do you feel that you're a high risk right now.

254
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.100
Anthony Thayer: Yeah, I mean, some people might call me high risk, I don't think so.

255
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.950
Anthony Thayer: I really don't give a fuck. I'm just kind of just staying along for the ride.

256
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.780
Anthony Thayer: Okay, I get this Corona thing is kind of interesting to watch.

257
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:43.110
Yeah, it definitely plays a number on all of our mental health. Yeah.

258
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:46.890
Belis Aladag: So,

259
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:57.720
Belis Aladag: The thing is this. If you feel at any point that you're at high risk, like this is really bad like something's not good, then you need

260
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:06.900
Belis Aladag: You need like you know what you need. You've done it before with the rosewood. It sounds like that's where you would go that's the help you would seek right

261
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.210
Anthony Thayer: You call nine whatever

262
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.070
Belis Aladag: Because the thing is

263
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.510
Anthony Thayer: Good crisis.

264
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.730
Belis Aladag: Yeah crisis line and stuff. You need to have those resources available and you need to

265
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:35.280
Belis Aladag: know in your heart that that's you're not at that level because bright heart health. There's like this rule they make it very clear like high risk patients are not appropriate for our program because we're at a distance. I think that's the main reason why they say

266
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:43.440
Anthony Thayer: That yeah I don't think I'm high risk, and I have and I have other options available to me like if I ever got to that even point

267
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:57.000
Anthony Thayer: I know that you're not like you. There's nothing you can do. But like across the street, someone can do something like, I know. Yeah, so no high risk. Okay. Okay. All right. Um,

268
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:03.900
Belis Aladag: So we'll just say moderate at this point, moderate risk, you know, you're kind of passive, but maybe if we get you

269
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.700
Anthony Thayer: Back on your medication and you're not and

270
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.950

Belis Aladag: I mean,

278
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.310
Belis Aladag: I think when you talk to the therapist.

279
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.750
Belis Aladag: It's an idea. I don't know. Have you

286
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:23.100
Belis Aladag: So psychiatric meds. If you need psych meds, I would, we would make you an appointment through us again but with a psychiatric provider, because I'm an addiction specialist, but I don't, I'm not a psychiatrist I'm family medicine.

287
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:31.860
Belis Aladag: So do you think you're going to need that you would you like to be evaluated or

290
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.040
Anthony Thayer: I have PTSD, too. So it's just like

Anthony Thayer: I can't

292
00:30:51.600 --> 00:31:03.960
Anthony Thayer: Yeah, I don't see myself going without the meds right now. You know, I have plenty. So, but it definitely needs to be like schedule them like to do I call to schedule it

293
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:15.930
Belis Aladag: So I'll put in an inquiry, so that the team knows, you need this and they'll, they'll have that in the system, but you can instigate it too. So you call the virtual clinic again.

Okay.

360
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.630
Belis Aladag: Do it even have you been our patient before or

361
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.400
David Rudd: I tried like

362
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:39.390
David Rudd: I tried to do it like I didn't really try but I signed up and did everything, like, a year ago, but I didn't follow through. I didn't really do it groups or or nothing.

363
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.470
Belis Aladag: I see.

364
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:49.140
David Rudd: So that was good. And I'm sorry I couldn't transfer. I couldn't get on the meds. I was having a hard time just simply getting on the meds.

365
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.700
Belis Aladag: Oh, like inducing

366
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.640
Belis Aladag: parting thoughts on you, me,

367
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.350
David Rudd: Yeah, getting on to it.

368
00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:07.230
Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah. And, but I see from the system, you know, we have the database we can look at a controlled substances, looks like you saw my colleague, he's a great colleague of mine, Dr Reitman

369
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.860
David Rudd: And yeah, Doctor.

370
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.500
Belis Aladag: Was that at miracles were you at

371
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:22.020
David Rudd: A detox facility, did you get on sub you Tex. Yeah. Yeah, I tried that for a little bit. Okay.

372
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.920
Belis Aladag: So that was on the eighth of this month of March, right.

373
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.720
David Rudd: Yeah yeah

374
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:35.040
Belis Aladag: So, so, so what happened. So are you on it now or did you try and then fall off. And what happened. I

375
00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:36.480
David Rudd: I tried it.

376
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:48.780
David Rudd: I wanted to go as natural as possible. So I just, I took like one or one and one of the Go Natural and I came home after detox and and just failed.

377
00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.030
David Rudd: So it's been like what since the eighth, you said, Yeah.

378
00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:04.170
David Rudd: Yeah. And I just want to, um, I was thinking maybe I can get back on the something similar Suboxone Sublime Text whatever you think and

379
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:20.100
David Rudd: And do you guys have meetings in and try again. Really, that's all I can do. But I've never done like like a maintenance type like I've never been on long term Suboxone or or nothing but it's worth a shot. I think at this point.

380
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:34.200
Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah. So, so I hear you about wanting to be natural and like not have to take meds and like not have to do things, and like, you know, everything has its, you got to go to the groove, yet you know all the stuff that comes with it.

381
00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:42.150
Belis Aladag: Responsibility but but i i'm telling you I so I'm an addiction. Doctor, I'm Dr. Allen deck and I

382
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:58.170
Belis Aladag: I've been working with people and I've seen it all. Like, I've seen it back. We used to do detox, people would really demand detox. I just want detox and then get on in my life. And it's like, so many people would just fall right back in because of the cravings, you know,

383
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.980
David Rudd: You're right. Yeah, and I think a much better approach.

384
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.190
Belis Aladag: For a lot of people is to stay on the medication.

385
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:18.150
Belis Aladag: And then at a sweet spot at a, at a spot where you feel like, okay, this is just enough to get me comfortable where I'm not thinking about using I'm okay. Like I can get on in my life do whatever I need to do.

386
00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.710
Belis Aladag: And not have cravings right and not go into withdrawal.

387
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:35.040
Belis Aladag: And then, and then once you get to a place that allows your brain to heal so so unlike other opiates. This is still a partial opioid but it's different in the sense that it lasts super long

388
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:40.800
Belis Aladag: So it allows your receptors to come back to normal sensitivity. So, so like

389
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:50.940
Belis Aladag: Your tolerance will go down your everything will kind of regulate but that takes time and and the longer you're on the medication, the better for you.

390
00:40:51.540 --> 00:41:05.190
Belis Aladag: And then when you're at a place in your life where you're like, socially, like, okay. I'm okay. I got my job. I got whatever everything squared away. I feel very confident in my sobriety. Now I got some good months maybe a year under my belt.

391
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:16.290
Belis Aladag: Okay, now I think I'm ready to slowly try to get off this thing and then we can slowly get you like one milligram at a time like off, off the Suboxone or the buprenorphine and

392
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.150
Belis Aladag: People do well, you know, I feel like that that works.

393
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:21.810
Yeah.

394
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.220
David Rudd: Yeah, no, I want to try that. I'll be I'll be good.

395
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.050
David Rudd: Yeah, just try

396
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:35.040
Belis Aladag: This try it. And then, and you know, like you said, all you can do is try and put your best foot forward, I mean you just keep

397
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:38.040
Belis Aladag: Trying man like you got to do this. It's your life.

398
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.120
Belis Aladag: So talk

399
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:48.030
Belis Aladag: A bit about like how your addiction started like, how were you in your teens, like when you first started using any drugs like what how, what's your history with all that

400
00:41:48.270 --> 00:42:00.180
David Rudd: I think I'm as a teenager, I started young just experimenting like 16 or so and experimenting and I never really got to begin to alcohol but always smoke weed.

401
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:15.180
David Rudd: START SMOKING WEED. And I didn't mess for for a long time but seemed like I always getting I stopped doing the method I would always get in trouble. And I would always get in trouble. And when I was 30 I am

402
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:29.940
David Rudd: I am I got her I hurt my back and I had to go ahead, have a lemon next to me back surgery and and it started with the narcos and and and that whole story really, you know,

403
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.900
David Rudd: Waiting from there. Yeah, and

404
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:45.270
David Rudd: So yeah, so dang it started been like seven years I've been like struggling with this. I got introduced to like a na

405
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.910
David Rudd: Two, three years ago and

406
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:59.580
David Rudd: The longest I've had sober was like 910 months but working, working, like the program and stuff like that. And it wasn't all that long ago. Really was was

407
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:11.790
David Rudd: I got sober in April last year and I stayed sober for almost 10 months and then I just been struggling last couple months trying to figure just struggling so

408
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:15.300
David Rudd: Yeah, that's, that's really it.

409
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.190
Belis Aladag: Okay, so you said you were sober from like

410
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.340
Belis Aladag: April of 2018 or

411
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.640
2019 2019 okay

412
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.150
Thousand 19 until

413
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:32.790
Belis Aladag: Last when, like you said,

414
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:33.990
David Rudd: February.

415
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.770
Belis Aladag: February. Okay, and then February kind of fell off again. Yeah.

416
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:43.140
Belis Aladag: Okay, and you're trying and we're going to get you back.

417
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:52.710
Belis Aladag: Yeah. So what have you been, what is your use now like are you injecting I use snorting it are you smoking it. What do you, what do you do

418
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.460
David Rudd: I smoke it on the foil. Okay.

419
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:03.570
Belis Aladag: Okay, and how much would you say how do you quantify it. Is it money like how much you spend

420
00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:14.790
David Rudd: It's just been very, very little. This time, maybe like 10 bucks a day just I'm not allowing myself to get sick, really. Okay, just a minimal amount. Yeah.

421
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.430
Belis Aladag: Okay, um,

422
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.610
Belis Aladag: So, so yeah between

423
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:29.580
Belis Aladag: Suboxone and and sub tasks like the there's the motto formulation buprenorphine and then there's the combo.

424
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:43.230
Belis Aladag: Combo Mano it really doesn't matter it's supposed to work exactly the same way that the beauty is the active ingredient. The second combo thing is in there so people don't inject because supposedly if you

425
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:50.820
Belis Aladag: Melted or whatever it is, and try to inject it with that combo thing and then it starts taking effect and like puts it in reversal.

426
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.250
David Rudd: You know, it's like a river. Yeah.

427
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.600
Belis Aladag: But if you take it like you're supposed to under your tongue melting it

428
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.240
Belis Aladag: Either way, you get the same effect. It should be just buprenorphine effect, right.

429
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.290
David Rudd: So just

430
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:04.860
You know,

431
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:12.060
Belis Aladag: Is there a reason why you want it, is there one that you prefer, or you don't.

432
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:25.080
David Rudd: Yeah, well, I'm always heard that the the subjects that you don't have to wait x amount of hours, like you're not to wait a full 24 hours to take it is. I don't know if that's true or

433
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.980
Belis Aladag: Not true, not true. Again, they're both essentially work the same way.

434
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.050
David Rudd: Yeah right, then either one.

435
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.340
Belis Aladag: Yeah. Either one is fine. So, so I'll give you the combo. I'll give you

436
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.390
Belis Aladag: Depending on your insurance. Let's see.

437
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:51.000
Belis Aladag: Okay, I think that the tablet is usually the cheapest way to go. Um, it's just a tablet, you put under your tongue and you let it melt.

438
00:45:52.290 --> 00:46:04.770
Belis Aladag: And when you want to start it is when you start feeling couple of symptoms of withdrawal like physical right so either like you're crying in bed or you need easily sniffly you know everyone's different goosebumps.

439
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:15.240
Belis Aladag: Tools some pain. I don't know. So, so you have to have at least a couple of those guys happening to that you're like okay the the

440
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:28.050
Belis Aladag: The opiate is leaving my brain and I'm feeling it. That's when you know you're ready to take your Suboxone so it doesn't have to be 24 hours. It doesn't have to be 12 hours. Everybody's different. And how quickly they go into withdrawal.

441
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.160
David Rudd: Yeah, okay.

442
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:38.040
Belis Aladag: So for you, you're smoking like that small amount of day when, when do you smoke smoke all day. These look like a couple times a day, or like

443
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:47.730
David Rudd: Yeah, maybe just a little bit throughout the day, you know, like, like come hit it like twice throughout the day.

444
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:49.260
Belis Aladag: Twice. Okay, so

445
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.390
Belis Aladag: You had some maybe this morning.

446
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:56.760
David Rudd: Yeah, no, I've been waiting on this appointment. So this is like last night.

447
00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:05.610
Belis Aladag: Last night. Okay, so would you use again if you if you were just to use you would use again around now, or would you wait a little bit

448
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:17.700
David Rudd: I was just trying to get on the Suboxone really I was trying to just put out of my mind completely, you know, and just get get onto the medicine. Good. So that's where I'm at. But yeah, I would have smoked a long time ago. Okay, so you

449
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.100
Belis Aladag: Are you starting to see you're starting to feel uncomfortable.

450
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.000
David Rudd: I'm not so much but a little, a little bit.

451
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.370
Belis Aladag: So, so wait

452
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:37.110
Belis Aladag: You know yeah wait it's better. The thing is, you don't want to start too early. When you're still semi comfortable because it might put you into withdraw and then you'll

453
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.580
David Rudd: Feel that yeah I've had that happen before precipitated withdraw.

454
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.400
Belis Aladag: Yeah, so if you look pretty. Okay.

455
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:49.080
Belis Aladag: Yeah okay, you could probably last till tonight.

456
00:47:49.470 --> 00:48:02.010
Belis Aladag: Yeah, you know. It's one o'clock here my time, right, you're in California. So, um, yeah, like maybe 5pm. I don't know. You'll see how long you can last but

457
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:07.260
Belis Aladag: For you. Wait, the easier it is on your system and you'll probably accept it better.

458
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:12.000
David Rudd: If you wait run right if you if you can sleep through the

459
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.210
Belis Aladag: Night. And then if you wake up and you're like, Okay, I'm having children like really withdrawal, then take it. You could do it that way too.

460
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.100
David Rudd: Yeah. All right.

461
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:26.940
Belis Aladag: Just be safe, like, the longer the better, but you don't want to be in super agony either it's a balance.

462
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:36.600
Belis Aladag: Um, so I'll give you that. I'll give you the tabs. Um, I think what I'll do is I'll give you

463
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:50.370
Belis Aladag: I'll give you eight milligram tablets and I'll ask you to take half of it which is four milligrams. So I'll say, okay, when you're ready to start you take half of it.

464
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:58.380
Belis Aladag: See, and see how you feel. And then maybe later in the day, you take another half so you do have in the morning, half in the evening.

465
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:05.850
Belis Aladag: And see if that'll because you've been smoking a relatively smaller amount you're saying, I'm thinking maybe that'll be sufficient.

466
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:06.570
David Rudd: Of it.

467
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:24.030
Belis Aladag: But if it's not, if you're like, Well, half like the four milligrams is not holding me 100% I still get cravings and stuff and I need the whole tablet. And then we can increase it to like one tab and then maybe a half later on.

468
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:24.780
Okay.

469
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:34.140
Belis Aladag: So why don't I do that. Do you want me to give you enough as if you're taking one in the morning and a half later, just in case.

470
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.070
David Rudd: Yeah, that'd be good.

471
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:36.630
David Rudd: Yeah, but

472
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:43.530
Belis Aladag: Again, less is better because you want to be on the minimal dose, you need, but you don't want to be at risk of relapse.

473
00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:44.700
David Rudd: Right, okay.

474
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.640
Belis Aladag: So start with half and try to do half twice a day.

475
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:54.390
Belis Aladag: If you can, if you can't, then you go to a full tab and then see how long that last year and then take another half with eating.

476
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:54.870
Okay.

477
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.150
Belis Aladag: Um,

478
00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:05.190
Belis Aladag: What else, David. Okay, I got, I got a family history here from the past. I see your father has alcohol issues, right.

479
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:06.120
Yeah.

480
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:12.030
Belis Aladag: And tobacco, you were just about to smoke. So you do smoke tobacco.

481
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.140
David Rudd: Yeah yeah

482
00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:19.230
Belis Aladag: Um, any interest in working on that now or later maybe

483
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.260
David Rudd: Tobacco yeah

484
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:35.340
Belis Aladag: Because we could do like nicotine patches and then Nick, you were the patch and if you still feel like smoking, I can give you like gum or candy like a lozenge and you're like, pop that in your mouth for the oral thing.

485
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:36.450
On top.

486
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:38.490
David Rudd: Would be cool.

487
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.050
Belis Aladag: Yeah, let's do that.

488
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.760
David Rudd: I'm smoking.

489
00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.040
David Rudd: Smoking quite a bit lately. Probably like a pack a day. Okay.

490
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.740
Belis Aladag: So I'll give you the 21 milligram

491
00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.730
Belis Aladag: microgram. What's the word patch.

492
00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:11.100
Belis Aladag: Patch patch. You were one and for 24 hours. Some people take it off before bed but you can keep it on. It's up to you and then you take it off. You put a new one on somewhere else. The next day,

493
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.030
Okay.

494
00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.940
David Rudd: As soon as the work together.

495
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:31.380
Belis Aladag: Yeah, it works well. It gives you that nicotine. So hopefully you're not like nicotine craving, but people still have that, like, Oh, well I slow. This is what I would want to smoke. Still they have that on it. It's okay to take a loss. Do you prefer the candy or do you prefer the gum.

496
00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.970
David Rudd: Probably the candy. Yeah. And yeah, I think people like the candy better

497
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:42.300
Okay, so then you would pop a candy and each candy is worth one cigarette of nicotine.

498
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:49.770
Belis Aladag: Nicotine for the day, a whole packs worth on you, and then you're adding to it. So don't overdo the candy.

499
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.180
David Rudd: Right. Right. Okay.

500
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.390
Belis Aladag: And see how that works. Okay.

501
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:59.010
Belis Aladag: Yeah. Um, so we'll do those two things as well.

502
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:00.000
David Rudd: Cool.

503
00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:18.090
Belis Aladag: So we'll do the tablets will do the nicotine passionate the nicotine candy or lozenge, and then I'm also going to give you, nor can nor can is a spray in your nostrils that reverses an overdose. So like if you do live with your family, are you

504
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:18.990
David Rudd: Yeah.

505
00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:19.980
David Rudd: What do you live.

506
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.800
David Rudd: Your wife, my wife wife and kids. Yeah.

507
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:32.430
Belis Aladag: Okay wife and kids. So it's just something that you know you can show your wife, if you want, like in the event, God forbid, of an overdose where you're like, not responding. She can't wake you up.

508
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:41.760
Belis Aladag: She gets sprayed in your nose. It brings you back reverses the overdose, but it's temporary, you need to call 911 it's still you can slip back in if you don't get help.

509
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:42.630
David Rudd: Okay.

510
00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.760
Belis Aladag: So I'll order that as well.

511
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:46.770
David Rudd: Well, she will do that.

512
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.900
Belis Aladag: Are you on any other medications.

513
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.540
David Rudd: Oh, no, no. Okay.

514
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:59.580
Belis Aladag: And is there any risk of suicide. Do you have any suicidal thoughts or history in the past or

515
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.230
David Rudd: No, no.

516
00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:07.080
Belis Aladag: And and any meth use recently meth or marijuana or other stuff.

517
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.070
David Rudd: Marijuana marijuana. Okay. Okay.

518
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:20.790
Belis Aladag: And I mean, that's all I was going to ask you. Is there anything that you're that we're missing that we need to talk about

519
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.590
David Rudd: Um, no.

520
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.090
David Rudd: No.

521
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.530
Belis Aladag: All right, I'm gonna order this stuff for you.

522
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:36.630
David Rudd: It's gonna do, sorry. Is it can kind of like get ahold of you anytime or certain time, or how does that work.

523
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:42.900
Belis Aladag: Okay, so yes. So moving forward, I'm going to send you an email.
