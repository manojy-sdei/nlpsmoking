Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, hello there.

2
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You look tired still

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.969
ethant: Really

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.520
ethant: Good afternoon. I feel nice and rested.

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, good. How's things going. I haven't seen you in a year.

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.780
ethant: It was just, it was two days ago.

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, I'm just giving you a hard time

8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.800
ethant: Uh, I

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.360
ethant: Feel like

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.610
ethant: Emotionally, things are way better. I feel like I'm kind of like come around and not depressed anymore.

12
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.430
ethant: I'm

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.240
ethant: Not as stressed about work as I was

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.920
ethant: I mean it's it's still stressful. It's still the exactly the same situation, but I don't feel like as bad about it on a day to day basis, as I did before.

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.770
ethant: So I'm kind of like you or you know I'm I'm reacting to it more seemingly

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Maybe it's because you got a definite and there's no there's not a whole lot of unknowns left you know because you've already had that conversation. You know what, what to expect. You know what I mean. Yep.

18
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is kind of

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.080
Looked higher

20
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you look like

21
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just had this look for a second, where it was like, oh, oh.

22
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what's been happening, how has it been working at home.

23
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.880
ethant: Um, it's a little bit like Groundhog Day, sort of like every day. Is that the same

24
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.300
ethant: Yeah, I went out today and I hadn't even stepped out of the apartment in several days. I went to the supermarket, so

25
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How is that

26
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:09.090
ethant: I it could have been given, given that I know that things are getting crazier and crazier and I haven't been out for a while, they really could have been way more dramatic.

27
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:19.050
ethant: I don't know. I went there and I I needed a handful of things like bananas, which they had I wanted to buy some half and half, which they didn't have

28
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.890
ethant: I wanted to buy some bread and they didn't really have exactly like the normal selection, but they had some stuff.

29
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.800
ethant: They're totally out of ice cream.

30
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.300
ethant: There's just certain like sections of the supermarket that are just took. I don't know if it's the same situation where you are, but certain sections of serie just totally empty.

31
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:57.900
ethant: But this is a whole foods that I go to around the corner from my house. And it's funny because some things are perfectly well stocked like the fancy cheeses and everything. No problem, or even the it seemed like the the meats and the seafood and all that stuff.

32
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:09.240
ethant: You could have a feast, if you wanted to, you know, but no, you know, good luck trying to buy by, like, half and half, or take toilet paper like these things that

33
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:29.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That it's amazing when you when you go in and you see what people are clearing the shelves for and the selection. Yeah, definitely. I went into one store the other day, and there was like two boxes to cartons of eggs, and that was it. They were not, you know, yeah.

34
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I haven't been getting us into several markets and I haven't seen

35
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.130
ethant: Eggs in a while.

36
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The toilet

37
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.370
ethant: Paper thing. I just don't understand it. You asked me this question, and now I'm wondering myself.

38
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like

39
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.250
ethant: I don't know if it started as a rumor that likes toilet paper is going to sold out. And so therefore, everybody but but toilet paper or another.

40
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.530
ethant: Way to look at it as me, it's like all paper products are just selling out like

41
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He

42
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:08.070
ethant: at my local Walgreens. There's the section where they have toilet paper. Paper towels, Kleenex, you know, and that is one of the sections in the store. That's just there's literally everything is gone.

43
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's crazy. It is, yeah.

44
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.660
ethant: So there's gotta be something to that like it's part. I mean, maybe partially human nature, but maybe it's partially because

45
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.070
ethant: They maybe they don't stock that stuff as well because

46
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.070
ethant: It's like bulky and low profit margin. So they probably don't don't like

47
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.550
ethant: Us up you know they don't dedicate that much of the truck space to that stuff.

48
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.900
ethant: Right, and probably

49
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they probably never ran out like now.

50
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

51
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's for sure. Um, so tell me how it works. Going working at home. I know it's repetitive and but

52
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.730
ethant: It got kind of weirdly, I got a little bit exciting related to the coronavirus actually because

53
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.380
ethant: So I have this the reason that I my rain. My main like thing that's keeping

54
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.090
ethant: That's keeping me employee that they know that they absolutely need me for it's just like really dreadfully boring.

55
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.490
ethant: Audit that

56
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.430
ethant: That nobody knows how to deal with except they're learning. I actually give them more credit. They're learning how to deal with it, but I'm only I'm the one that knows how to deal with it.

57
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:40.590
ethant: So they need. They're keeping me around. I think kind of in their mind like oh if Ethan just gets us through this thing and it will be okay. And then if he left it wouldn't really be the end of the world.

58
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.830
ethant: So, but that thing is so boring. It's like the it's it's

59
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.500
ethant: It's ironic that it's going to be. I'm going to have it all over my resume, because it is a thing that a lot of companies need to deal with, but it's just not my area of like

60
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:05.820
ethant: It's like audit you know compliance and or, you know, complying to these industry standards for for security so that you can accept credit cards.

61
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.100
ethant: I don't know if you've ever dealt dealt with this before.

62
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:16.560
ethant: A lot of companies have to deal that even like smaller like my sisters and my sister runs a high school and they have to do some PCI thing every year.

63
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's for specifically for credit card usage.

64
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:31.470
ethant: Yeah, so, because there's so much because our economy rely so much on credit cards, and there were set, there's a series, they've continued, I guess, there have been like

65
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.800
ethant: incident after incident where these major

66
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:49.320
ethant: These companies are broke the, you know, they have a an intrusion into their payment processing systems and someone will steal like hundreds of millions of credit card numbers.

67
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.380
ethant: And then they sell them and try to do this fraud on them, which is a major problem for the banks and so the banks.

68
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.790
ethant: Over the years, they've sort of tried to transfer more and more responsibility onto the merchants.

69
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:12.720
ethant: For keeping those keeping the stuff secure, you know, as you know, like when you put a credit card number in a website or whatever.

70
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:27.420
ethant: So anyway, as part of implementing that this the banks and the merchants and everybody got together and made this sort of consortium. That's called PCI payment something industry standards.

71
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.930
ethant: Which comes down to all these rules that there's different

72
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.470
ethant: Levels that you have to comply to depending on how many transactions you do and what the

73
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.390
ethant: What the amount of the transaction is and how many credit card, whether or not you actually store credit card numbers, which is something that

74
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.960
ethant: My company does, which is kind of unusual. Like most companies.

75
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.750
ethant: Would they don't want to store credit card numbers because then you take on all this liability.

76
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.240
Um,

77
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.730
ethant: So anyway, every year, we have to go through this process and

78
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.700
ethant: We used to have a whole team. I'm not sure what to this, I told you before, we said, there used to be this whole security compliance team that as our company kind of downsized and downsize, and we got bought

79
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:30.270
ethant: More and more things kind of got piled on my team. And this is one of them. And then I lost more and more people and tells just me. It's like just me and I'm in this is this thing that I have to deal with. So that's the boring part but then the more exciting part is

80
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.560
ethant: We use these offshoring these offshore.

81
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:48.660
ethant: Content moderator people so like we're dating site and some people upload photos and you know personal descriptions onto their profiles and we actually have humans that moderate this stuff.

82
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:56.100
ethant: And we employ them in these giant that third parties. We've offshore it and we hire these companies in India to do that.

83
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:04.860
ethant: And so all those companies in India and Malaysia and the Philippines, they're having coronavirus shut down. And so they can't have their people in their office.

84
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:16.800
ethant: And so we have this network problem where suddenly, those people are going home to their houses in the Philippines and we need to figure out a secure way to connect them into our back end systems and like our big hurry like

85
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, we have to do it in the day or

86
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:18.840
Whatever.

87
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.220
ethant: So I've been involved in trying to get that to work that's been kind of fun.

88
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And have you been successful.

89
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.880
ethant: We're cutting corners, but we're kind of getting it. We're getting something getting it to work.

90
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. Yeah. So that's cool.

91
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:43.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. And so what are they going to do when you're not there anymore. I mean, how are they going to

92
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sure

93
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:55.170
ethant: They have a lot of people who are smart and who think they know what they're doing. And so that's that's how that's most of the battle is they're just willing to, like, dive in and figure it out.

94
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.160
ethant: But I can imagine there being some pretty major

95
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:13.800
ethant: Events in certain things happen. And I'm not around me, or there's a couple other people that really know the system. So if we're not around, they're just going to take longer to figure out what the heck you know what's happening in longer to fix it.

96
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

97
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And any news from the other company.

98
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.470
ethant: So,

99
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.170
ethant: I told them, give me a week.

100
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.520
ethant: To

101
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:40.800
ethant: To figure out what my timeline is. And that was a little more than a week ago. And then I actually had a conference call with them, but it wasn't that was on yesterday.

102
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:52.500
ethant: And that conference call wasn't about potentially working there. That was a conference call, where that we've been having bi weekly because my current company as a customer their company.

103
00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:02.790
ethant: So it wasn't, it was more to discuss that that business relationship. And so, notably in that call that the CEO and the CTO, like the guys that I'm friends with who might

104
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.820
ethant: Who are excited about the possibility of working there. They didn't even show up for the call. So they're probably kind of waiting for me to

105
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.960
ethant: start that process again about, you know, when I'm ready to

106
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.320
ethant: Yeah, and I haven't started it because I

107
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:25.560
ethant: Well, partially partially because I'm nervous. And I don't want to start but partially because I can't. I still it's still

108
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:32.730
ethant: It's still a month out before I can we even even longer than that, before you know a month and a half before I really want to leave some

109
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:39.540
ethant: I'm like delaying it a little bit. And what might happen in this time is they're going to fill the position and and and so I might miss out in a certain way.

110
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:48.000
ethant: They, they already opened the door to maybe if they do fill that position to creating another position for me.

111
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

112
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.270
Because now.

113
00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:01.080
ethant: It's gonna be interesting. What happens, it will see with the stock market down like this. Nobody's going to be hiring right

114
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.210
ethant: So,

115
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.550
ethant: Yeah, I could

116
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:15.510
ethant: Look, I have my other I have another buddy who was really aggressively trying to get me to work for his company and I was supposed to have lunch with him.

117
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:22.380
ethant: Yesterday, and then he canceled that lunch, just because of the whole shutdown.

118
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:23.910
Um,

119
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:42.060
ethant: So yeah, so yeah I'm maybe it's maybe I should be maybe this is a case where I should be worrying, you know, not unusual for me, but I'm feeling like God. Yeah, I think I told you, like, the longer I hang on to this job, I get this like sweets. My really sweet salary and I get to work.

120
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:42.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On this

121
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:49.890
ethant: Well, except for this boring PCI thing but um yeah so I'm kind of allowing myself a little more time to

122
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.760
Potter along the way in the

123
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.690
ethant: Whiskey excuse me in the

124
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.490
ethant: Mode that I'm on

125
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:07.500
ethant: The thing. The final decision, the final or though the firm news that I got you might remember is that

126
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.280
ethant: They aren't extending me, however.

127
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.650
ethant: I am I had, I was already extended through the month of June. So that's three months. Right.

128
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:20.670
Mm hmm.

129
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.250
ethant: Three and a half months that I still have

130
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

131
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:37.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you're just gonna play it by ear and just keep doing what you're doing and

132
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep doing what I'm doing.

133
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.850
ethant: In I'm

134
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:57.120
ethant: Assuming I want to kind of shoot towards close to that end date so that I can make as much money as possible and do as much as I can, at this company, you know, with of these projects that I want to do.

135
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:07.770
ethant: Then yeah, I should really kick in. I mean, I should be doing things now like preparing my resume and then like May, June.

136
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:16.860
ethant: Seriously, searching and then hopefully by because so it'll be doing July, it'll be July 1 that I would be available.

137
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's definitely a good plan. You know what I mean to have it ready

138
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:34.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Man may April may start working on it. Get it out. Yeah. And you can definitely feel the water than to on whether or not they

139
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:51.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are still, you know, going to have a position available for you or if they're, you know, because of this whole thing and we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or next week with this, you know, whole set down thing. I mean casinos are shutting down. You know what I mean. Yeah.

140
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.040
ethant: I know it's unprecedented

141
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All

142
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The neat thing about this.

143
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.950
ethant: This company that I want to go work for is that their

144
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:08.430
ethant: Business is remote access. So they they're potentially I hope that they're getting a lot of new customers right now.

145
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.090
ethant: So, and then, that's another cool thing is that I actually another thing that I learned just yesterday.

146
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:22.020
ethant: Was that spark the company that I'm working for, and they are open to being a customer of

147
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:31.740
ethant: banya in the company that I want to go work for for this remote access to. So if I if I successfully get that setup. So in other words, I'm sort of selling the product, even though I don't yet work for them.

148
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.090
ethant: Then, that'll be that'll be really good for

149
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.010
ethant: My that'll improve if anything, my chances are going to work for them.

150
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Nice. Nice. Well, that's really cool.

151
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would be in, I would probably be in the same position you're in and just kind of sit back and do what you're doing, you know,

152
00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:09.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just play it out by ear. Because again, we don't know what was going on. We have no idea what's coming, you know, we just got to kind of roll with the punches as things come out, you know,

153
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:16.350
ethant: Yeah, I'm obviously not like hyper competitive cutthroat kind of person so

154
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:35.640
ethant: So, but I've worked. I've been kind of mentoring people for on 10 years now at my current gig. And so many of them. So they've all worked for a year or two with me and then left and gone to every, you know,

155
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.490
ethant: Almost every tech company. You can think of in the Bay Area. So I have like contacts and all these companies so

156
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.150
Oh,

157
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool too. Yeah, so if

158
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.770
ethant: It comes down to it, I don't know, but I like to think I would have a good reference that a lot of places.

159
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Something tells me you probably will.

160
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.610
ethant: Get to the glasses. Everybody thinks I'm smart because I wear glasses.

161
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it's the brain. It's what I think it is.

162
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And your depressions. Good.

163
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:14.790
ethant: Better

164
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:29.250
ethant: I'm Mary increase my antidepressant knows but that was just a few days ago, or whatever that I so I wouldn't expect it to to have made a big change. Big difference, yet.

165
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe

166
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:39.090
ethant: The last freak out. I had was about my retirement. I know everybody's freaking out about their 401k right now but

167
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.040
I had this

168
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:47.820
ethant: So when I started working 10 years ago I put like turned on my 401K, I set the maximum

169
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:56.040
ethant: Contribution to it, and then I'd always heard like pretty much just let it do its thing. And don't pay to don't freak out, like, you know,

170
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.540
ethant: But I think that a little bit too.

171
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.350
ethant: Extreme and I literally didn't even log on to it for like seven years.

172
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:09.330
ethant: And then I logged on on like it's not as much money as I thought I would have in there. And then this just recently, last week or two, I realized like,

173
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:26.160
ethant: The default fund that they put me in somehow has been losing money. So I've been pouring all my 401k money into this. So you think over the past 10 years with the incredible stock market that we've had. And I've been in investing the maximum that I can that I'd be doing great. Right.

174
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so

175
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:46.590
ethant: But apparently I invested are the default fund that they chose for me 10 years ago when I signed up like lost money over 10 years. So basically, my whole 401k is just like shot and then so it lost money over 10 years and then this downturn or happens last even more money. So I'm like,

176
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:55.380
ethant: Compared to the cash that I put in. It's like down 40% or something like that. Whereas it should have gone up like 300%

177
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So that's it.

178
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.510
ethant: So I guess I have to work my life.

179
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Join the crowd.

180
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, I can't. There's nothing you can do to change it.

181
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.360
No.

182
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.690
ethant: I mean what complained to them that their property.

183
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:27.450
ethant: I guess I could sue them that, but still, it's like, then they'll say no, you should have been more, you should have been paying more attention to your investment choices and it's I gave him, you know, which is true. I should have

184
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.030
ethant: been paying attention.

185
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I would have never known, you know, with a 401k that you have to be pay attention to that. And, you know, I'm not like really familiar with, with it because, you know, obviously I don't have one, but

186
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:57.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would seem that if you started losing money for your 401K that you would have gotten some kind of email or an alert or her

187
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.130
ethant: Right, yeah.

188
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, when your credit score goes down. You certainly get alerts on that or you know what I mean.

189
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah definitely would have this would. I mean, it would seem to me we get some kind of

190
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, alert, you know. Yeah.

191
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know. I'm gonna ask

192
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.590
ethant: My mom wants me to go get a

193
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.060
ethant: Or my sister recommends a financial planner. So I'm going to go and try to do that in there.

194
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:36.660
ethant: It maybe there's some they'll look at it and maybe they'll say, God, you should sue them because, I mean, it really is. And I might be misinterpreting. It is the other thing, but it a bit from the best I can figure

195
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:43.950
ethant: There's all these graphs where it's like, here's the normal growth. Here's how the stock market ended up doing. And then here's your

196
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.490
ethant: Here's your mutual fund that I'm like oh my god why

197
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did that happen I think

198
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy. Yeah.

199
00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:03.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're going to get a financial planner to kind of help you weed through it and see what you can do about it. I'm

200
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.370
ethant: terrified of doing that because

201
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:13.350
ethant: That's going to be like the day that I grew up when I go and say, Okay, I'm 45 years old, you know, the first

202
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:21.120
ethant: couple decades of my working career. I was like an active drug users, but I didn't really make any money or save any money.

203
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:33.990
ethant: And then the second half of you know my working career I invested in this mutual fund was so bad. And I don't know how. So it's basically like they're going to look at my retirement situation and say, like, you're never going to be able to retire.

204
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:40.080
ethant: Or they're going to convince me, you have to save every penny, which I don't know want to live that way, you know,

205
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

206
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:47.640
ethant: I'M JUST SORT OF DREADING IT and the longer that I don't go at this point it's like longer that I don't go and deal with it. I can kind of

207
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.180
ethant: Ignorance is bliss. You know what I mean.

208
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. In some scenarios. I think you're right.

209
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:06.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But yeah, I definitely if I were you get a financial advisor and at least get some information and figure out what you can do.

210
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to change the track of it because you invest in it for that amount of time and the maximum out. I mean, it just doesn't make any sense that it's just like being poured down the drain. Right.

211
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:19.860
ethant: Right.

212
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

213
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how has things with you and Lily. I love her name by the way.

214
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.130
ethant: Things are great. She's like my

215
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:44.490
ethant: She's definitely it's like things we've had our rocky periods, but especially in the last year or two. It's that our relationship has been very stable.

216
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:46.590
So,

217
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.930
ethant: I'm very lucky to have her

218
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: House her restaurant. Did you wind up being they close it, they have to close it.

219
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.630
ethant: So there's still open for deliveries.

220
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:07.380
ethant: And they're just they were already just sort of, you can buy us a busy business is not great. They had this investor that sort of circling around that.

221
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.580
ethant: This would be the perfect ideal outcome is that

222
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.650
ethant: They kind of need an investor, who's going to put some money into marketing because they have like

223
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:27.690
ethant: Great food and five star reviews and every and they're based in downtown San Francisco, and they just need a little bit more of a like of a marketing push. I think they need to hire some social now social

224
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.150
ethant: marketing geniuses.

225
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:38.670
ethant: But the but the lily under business partner don't have the money to like or the time to like

226
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.500
ethant: To grow that part that part of the business so

227
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:55.530
ethant: Anyway, these investors came around and they're supposed to have these meetings, literally, this past, you know, and then suddenly the market crashed. So of course they're going to be, they're not going to have as much

228
00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.950
ethant: Money in the bank to be investing in restaurants. Right.

229
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I don't know, especially when most restaurants are closed right now. Anyways, other than take out, you know, it's like it's like a loss.

230
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I'm seeing, you know, some pretty promising.

231
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Headlines

232
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:27.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From, you know, the President on helping small business owners, you know,

233
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:42.900
ethant: Yeah, I told that to Loja several times. Like, it sounds like Trump. I mean, I don't know what's actually going to happen, but the definitely the government wants to do some sort of bailout plan for all the businesses that are going to, I mean, tons of businesses are going to go under. Yeah.

234
00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:45.750
ethant: So,

235
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, my name is packages.

236
00:24:49.740 --> 00:25:05.970
ethant: My life financial timeline is so funny because I did at one time, own a house which was in New Orleans, which was doubly funny because I didn't actually lose the house in Katrina, but then I did lose the house in the mortgage crisis, which was like a couple years after Katrina.

237
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.240
ethant: And

238
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:19.140
ethant: It was a huge bummer because I had this great little house and this low mortgage payment and everything and then I could couldn't swing the mortgage couldn't even swing the low mortgage payments.

239
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:26.070
ethant: So I had paid off like three quarters of it or something. But I lost all of it because it's the bank just ticket.

240
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.500
ethant: So that was like hundreds of thousands of dollars is down the very and then

241
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.800
ethant: The government came and said, Oh, we have to help all these these for you know because they had to bail out the banks.

242
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:46.320
ethant: So they're like we should help the little guys that actually lost their houses so they sent me this check. And so one day I get a check in the mail for like 30 $500 or something.

243
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.690
ethant: For for like losing my house. And I'm like, oh, just that's

244
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 30 $500 versus a couple hundred thousand. Yeah.

245
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a heck of a difference, you know,

246
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any issues with your meds. How's everything been going with your

247
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.340
ethant: Meds are fine. I'm sticking with the

248
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.100
ethant: The three day

249
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:16.860
ethant: Suboxone

250
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:25.710
ethant: I will I take the three day Suboxone and I take antidepressants to take the Klonopin but I try not to take it.

251
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:31.890
ethant: I've been pretty good at that. That day where I had a meltdown about my my

252
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.230
My

253
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.350
ethant: 401K. I took the Klonopin

254
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.130
ethant: Because that was definitely a panic day

255
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.060
Yeah.

256
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's what they're there for. Right.

257
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:52.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what about your sleep. I know we were talking about last week about you waking up or sitting up anyways and not

258
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stopping I

259
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.230
ethant: I'll ask, Well, yeah. After this conversation, but my, I think I stopped doing that.

260
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.460
ethant: Well, you said notice when I would do it. And I haven't been noticed myself doing it. So I think I'm sleeping better

261
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:18.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. That's important. Definitely. You gotta have sleep, you know, you got to have good sleep. Because if not, it just drags everything down, you know,

262
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And your, your diet still good.

263
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.800
ethant: Eating a little light.

264
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:28.890
ethant: Since the

265
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.710
ethant: Since the real lot of mandated stay at home. I don't know what happened but I kind of

266
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:53.460
ethant: I was eating really good like heartily for, like, since I sort of sobered up and started the Suboxone up until, like, a week ago. And then I kind of like fell off. And so I have like one meal a day ish but I should be really eating more.

267
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's time to think about. Yeah. You know, you just kind of lost her appetite. Oh, but

268
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.180
Yeah.

269
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.290
ethant: It's like I lost interest in food pretty. Yeah, I guess I lost my appetite.

270
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.310
ethant: Drinking coffee in the afternoon. Which probably isn't helping.

271
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, probably isn't helping. And is that changed or is that something you've always done

272
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.120
ethant: You know, part of

273
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:39.210
ethant: I'm allowing myself to to take naps in the afternoon. I don't. I used to do this. Occasionally, but I'm doing it more like I did it today. I did it yesterday.

274
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:50.940
ethant: So yeah, I get up and I kind of have breakfast ticket and then I take a nap in the afternoon, and then maybe have dinner, maybe not so I really got to focus on having like a hearty dinner every night.

275
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, sometimes you gotta you know you got to make yourself.

276
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be able to sit down and and and do it and it's healthy for it keeps your immune system, you know, going in and you know there's all kinds of benefits you know that

277
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, definitely. Um, and you're eating still eating healthy or

278
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:30.720
ethant: I think I eat pretty healthy, well, we don't have a whole lot of fresh veggies around. That's the one thing but like i well i have a smoothie, which some days I make a smoothie out of berries and other days I make a peanut butters movie.

279
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.240
ethant: That's kind of my breakfast, and then I'll have like a sandwich for lunch and then

280
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.230
ethant: Dinner is kind of that's where

281
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.430
ethant: I've been inconsistent.

282
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:53.010
ethant: We have some good good stuff. We have some meat in the fridge. So that's what I'll do today.

283
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make some dinner yet.

284
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.350
ethant: I'll have a nice hearty dinner.

285
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:00.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See

286
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.940
ethant: I'm gonna make a note of things to turn around. So our next meeting. And you can say, Look at all this great stuff. I did.

287
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let's see. So you're sleeping better your depressions better. Yeah.

288
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any change in your anxiety or they just they fluctuate, or is it just

289
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stressful.

290
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.040
ethant: I kind of

291
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:47.160
ethant: Yeah, of course. It fluctuates, I feel like I was seriously like depressed and seriously anxious and with good reason for a lot of these things are major things. So, but now the like the last couple days. I feel like I'm kind of stabilized, at least.

292
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:54.810
ethant: Now, I don't feel like I'm yeah so I'm still a little anxious and a little depressed, but it's not severe

293
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:57.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It may be

294
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:05.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The next over the next week you know your depression meds have been raised. So maybe that you'll feel the difference in that to, you know,

295
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's see, what else they did. We did. We plan on last week.

296
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.570
ethant: You wanted me to journal. When I talked to myself through something but

297
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.940
ethant: Remember when I was saying like, oh, you know, I don't have to take medicine about, you know,

298
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:31.380
ethant: You're like, Oh, that's great. You should really know when that happens. And so I didn't even know whether that happen once this week, I have to admit,

299
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:47.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the, the, but you. Okay, so one time you took your, your anxiety med right when you had your freak out. Yeah. And so if we were, if I remember correctly, last week, you had them two or three times.

300
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

301
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you can kind of even monitor engaging with, you know, when you feel that you need.

302
00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The mad. Yep.

303
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.300
ethant: That's true.

304
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So even looking at it from last week to this week it's it's definitely changed because you had your main one. Yeah, definitely.

305
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's there's a plus. That's improvement in there too. Yep. Right.

306
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good point. Pregnant in your sleep.

307
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.840
ethant: I'm taking a note about and focus on eating.

308
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.160
ethant: More consistently.

309
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.130
ethant: Let's start a special Rebecca journal here.

310
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just gotta remember that, you know, if

311
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:51.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's about the routine and that consistency with things right and drinking water eating exercising, if you're able

312
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, watching the thoughts.

313
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:09.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that go on in your head, you know, when are you feeling most depressed when you feel feeling most anxiety and what's really going on you know in your mindset when those things are are

314
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At its peak, you know,

315
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:19.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially when you know the being homebound is all well and fine but there's going to be a point where

316
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cabin Fever may said,

317
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:30.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, yep. And so really being, you know, kind of being prepared.

318
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, for that you're in. You're in San Francisco.

319
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so the whole city is like shut down in San Francisco.

320
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.400
ethant: Yeah it is, but

321
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:48.120
ethant: You know, the way they worded it it's like stay at home, except for essential activities, but almost

322
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:50.790
ethant: Everything.

323
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.330
ethant: You know, a lot of things are essential activities.

324
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:02.760
ethant: So like bars and restaurants like restaurants are closed for eating in. That's a pretty big deal.

325
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.000
ethant: But you can still get takeout.

326
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:16.140
ethant: But everything else, you know, and you're not supposed to go to work and, you know, schools and worker shut down. So those are all really big deals, but other than that.

327
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:27.270
ethant: Everything else that we do in life is is an essential activity like you're even allowed to go out and go for a walk. You're just not supposed to get too close to anybody that you don't live with.

328
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:33.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And have you been walking, because I think that was something else that we talked about.

329
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:38.880
ethant: I haven't been, but let me make that part of my daily plan for this coming late

330
00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I think you were going to call your, your family.

331
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Correct.

332
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.920
ethant: We talked about it. I don't remember making a solid commitment about like, I'm going to every day. I'm going to go

333
00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.300
No.

334
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:07.050
ethant: But I want to make that commitment. So let's do that. This week this week, walk every day, maybe with, oh, you know, I've been

335
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:21.060
ethant: I'll just say walk every day. I am worried about getting too close to like admin or kids, they're all sick that we don't think they have the coronavirus but they all have like colds and coughs and stuff so

336
00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ah, yeah.

337
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's

338
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.750
ethant: The thing is, it's like you don't even want to get close to your family. If you can

339
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:42.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you can avoid it. Yeah. Especially if they're not feeling well and they're, you know, struggling with some kind of cold, the best you know thing to do is just really, I mean not and it does suck, you know,

340
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then let's see what else were we talking about last week.

341
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.920
ethant: I could bring up my journal from that day.

342
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.230
That would have been

343
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.980
The 11th.

344
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:44.790
ethant: Oh, you said yeah so other other therapy assignments tried taking a bath with soothing music and a candle before bedtime. I didn't do that. I should, although I did get into

345
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:56.400
ethant: Is taking a shower at night to relax myself kind of getting into this like wind down routine at the end of the end of the day.

346
00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay. And how is that been working

347
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.620
ethant: That's great. I love the feeling of getting in bed being all clean and like relaxed and everything.

348
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.240
ethant: Rather than get in bed and like toss and turn and not sleep all night.

349
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:13.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

350
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.300
ethant: That was my previous pattern.

351
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:20.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So if it's a shower. You know, and that's working. You know what I mean.

352
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Do what you know do these things that you've already tried that, you know, you know, work.

353
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they're important.

354
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.930
ethant: work every day.

355
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.620
ethant: Stick with wine down routine.

356
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.940
ethant: Cool, cool.

357
00:37:54.390 --> 00:38:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And did you check into, well obviously if you're taking a shower at night and it's working, then you wouldn't need any kind of

358
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tea. I know we talked about different types of tea that would help. But, you know, if you've already got you know honed in on what's working, you know what I mean I wouldn't change it. Yeah.

359
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. And how's your mindset, then

360
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.580
ethant: Again, I give him, I feel, given the circumstances that I'm doing pretty well. Okay.

361
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No triggers or no cravings or

362
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:39.450
ethant: No, I've noticed that that because I was thinking about how I that incident with the pill and then I was like,

363
00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:51.180
ethant: I noticed that I did not. I have not wanted to go and try to to seek out drugs.

364
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.000
ethant: That feels good. Yeah.

365
00:38:55.530 --> 00:39:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. And, you know, the fact that you that you owned it and you walk through it.

366
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:01.530
ethant: Yeah.

367
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean it. That's a huge piece because part of, you know, recovery is that if we keep secrets about things like that that happened.

368
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:10.290
ethant: You know,

369
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then that really can feed into our addicted part of our brain.

370
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you didn't do that. You do the complete opposite which you know is totally great and awesome because it really kind of deflates it it takes the power out of it, you know. Yeah, yeah.

371
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I just wanted to

372
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To give you kudos on that. That's important. You know, we oftentimes we get we worried that, you know, we're going to be judged or you know no one's going to work with us or you know whatever that mindset goes into of negativity and so we'll hold the secrets and they just

373
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like a festering internal sore that

374
00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:04.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: just sits there until you know we're willing to come clean with it but you know you didn't do that and and that's that's huge.

375
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:18.510
ethant: Yeah, yeah. That feels good. Like, I appreciate you saying that, and it was kind of like intuitive like immediately after I did it, I was like, I knew that I had to talk about it if I didn't talk about it, then it would be like

376
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.620
ethant: Yeah, then it would be the secret and then maybe it just seemed like it would be worse.

377
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So ah yeah

378
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:34.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on.

379
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My caves. Like, do you ever have problems, having your cable.

380
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: TV with your Catholic on

381
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:48.750
ethant: Occasionally,

382
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then whatever you wrote, you have to go back

383
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

384
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do it all over again. It's like

385
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.050
ethant: Are you taking notes if

386
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.070
ethant: You're if you're typing while while we meet you do it very subtly. I never noticed

387
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No I don't take notes because all of our sessions are recorded

388
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:20.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so what I get to do is they're transcribed and then I go in and I review them. And if there's any information missing that I make sure that I put it in there.

389
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:39.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But generally are transcribers are really, really good. So I can go back and take a look at. I could do that myself to instead of having your poetry journal and go back and just take a look at you know our past week. And what we were talking about and making plans for but

390
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.090
ethant: Another thing was DDT and put that on for this week.

391
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Duty.

392
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you have a good time to practice DVD skills like is when you're walking

393
00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:58.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

394
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:09.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I think we talked about it but like staying in the moment being present, but really paying attention to what you're hearing and smelling and seeing

395
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:21.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On your wall, you know, and just don't pick one thing, but really tried to hone in on the different things that you're seeing, and that you're feeling that you're hearing you know smelling

396
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:24.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's, it's like

397
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:33.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting in touch internally with your senses all five of your senses, you know, yep.

398
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:34.710
Good.

399
00:42:52.620 --> 00:43:05.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What happens is I hear this little when the virtual clinic. It is trying to talk to me or tell me something here, this little click, click, like, you know, in my ear.

400
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, he's kind of weird, you know, if I have my computer up and I don't have my earbuds in if I'm across the room. I can hear it. And so I gotta run to the computer and look and see what's going on. It's insane.

401
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you're going to work on, you're going to look up and research dvd

402
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.670
ethant: Yep. So here's my list. Focus on eating more consistently.

403
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:38.820
ethant: Continue to count anxiety meds and the times that I'm able to self regulate my panic walk every day stick

404
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:52.920
ethant: Stick with wind down routine every day like showers read about DPT. For example, when I'm walking tune into not just one thing, but all the senses. Yes.

405
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. And another piece of

406
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: keeping you in the present moment. And you can do it like when you're washing dishes or when you're

407
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really just being present making your mind not be someplace else, but be in whatever activity that you're engaging in

408
00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:16.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again,

409
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The practice that I got was washing dishes and so you feel the sync up even though you have a dishwasher.

410
00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:30.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, feel, you know, fill the sync up and put your dishes in and feel it like really feel the dishes and feel the warmth and

411
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:48.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what do you close your eyes and and you know really pay allow the other senses to come forth and, you know, and that's a practice you so you you practice while you're walking you practice when you're doing daily living activities, you know,

412
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The better at it, you get

413
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and then you stay out of the stress of the future.

414
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the regrets of the past.

415
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:02.700
Make sense

416
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of amazing when you can do it. And so that's just one

417
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: DVD skill DVD has like several radical acceptance.

418
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why is my end.

419
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Holders in there too. You know, paying attention to hungry angry lonely tired.

420
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because those are definite slippery slopes, you know,

421
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So we'll go over a little bit.

422
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:41.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A little bit throughout the time. I don't want to bombard you with too many at once, or like what. Wait, what part before was that, you know,

423
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not at all, but just kind of handling one thing at a time.

424
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:47.970
It.

425
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:50.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: does sound like a plan.

426
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:50.580
Yeah.

427
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, so what are you going to do for the rest of the evening.

428
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:03.210
ethant: It's another day where I've like I was said. I took a little nap in the afternoon. So I have to work. It's a work night.

429
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're gonna

430
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get to work for a while.

431
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:11.640
ethant: I'm gonna work. I'm gonna eat. I'm gonna shower and do my normal night night routine.

432
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you going to bed at the same time every night.

433
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.390
ethant: Other than a couple nights when I stay up really late for

434
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:30.150
ethant: I kind of allow myself to stay up late for one reason or another. Yeah, I'm pretty, I had my like 11 to 12 O'clock bedtime.

435
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:42.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Okay. Because again, it's that routine and that consistency and your body gets used to that routine and consistency with, you know, going to bed, getting a certain number of hours of sleeping.

436
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:50.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting the nutrients that it needs sleeping and eating, you know, exercise.

437
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:56.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is what really kind of helps build that solidity you know

438
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:03.510
ethant: Yeah, I'm good. I'm pretty good with routines when I pick them up like my journaling or my smoothies.

439
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. But, um,

440
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.450
ethant: Yeah, there's, there's something that I still need to to develop, I think.

441
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Once you think they are.

442
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:26.490
ethant: Well, like the ones are talking about, like, I like my first week I was talking about exercise. I still don't really have a I haven't worked a consistent exercise thing into my

443
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Schedule schedule.

444
00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:39.600
ethant: I think this is just a like it. It's a tumultuous time so it's funny. It's a little hard to introduce normality into

445
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:57.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Into everything. Yeah, I know you have to find some kind of balance and normalcy when things are chaotic. Yeah. You know what I mean. And you're right, it is, you know, everything is changed works change, you know, life as we know it is changing right now.

446
00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But again, that's why it's even more important now that you have some basic

447
00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Routine and schedule that you stick to

448
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a whole world outside can be crazy.

449
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.620
ethant: Yeah.

450
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:19.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that doesn't mean that you have to be inside your head right doesn't mean your emotions have to be just means everything outside of you everything you don't have control over.

451
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:20.670
Yep.

452
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So everything you do have control over. You know, if you were staying in this consistent pattern. You know, it stays level, even though the world around us is

453
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All over the place.
