00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.710
Joshua Lopez: Was kind of

9
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.710
Joshua Lopez: I read one of her posts and she just seemed like really down. I called her on my break to see what was going on. I kind of

10
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.550
Joshua Lopez: Brought up the irrational acceptance explain to her how it worked. And it seemed to really help her.

11
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.480
Joshua Lopez: You know, and it made me feel good that I could actually have somebody, you know, made me feel really good.

Joshua Lopez: Like everything in my life is going pretty good. I'm doing well at work.

18
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:10.560
Joshua Lopez: Well, struggling as far as money goes. I've got all my furniture and places looking really nice like everything seems to be going well. I just, I cannot shake this

19
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.200
Joshua Lopez: The sadness that I feel

20
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.270
Joshua Lopez: And

21
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.950
Joshua Lopez: I don't know. I've just I've accepted things and I'm

22
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.030
Joshua Lopez: rolling with the punches and I feel like everything on the outside, seeing really good

23
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.310
Joshua Lopez: I just

24
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.030
Joshua Lopez: Sad, I guess.

25
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't seem to know what the problem is, is that right

26
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.130
Oh,

27
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.300
Joshua Lopez: I do. I just

28
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.100
Joshua Lopez: I miss. I just, I'm still missing jack. What am I missing my kids right now.

29
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.900
Joshua Lopez: The same the same or just get shaky.

30
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Have you been away from the kids.

31
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.160
Joshua Lopez: Since Sunday.

32
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Has it been progressively getting more and more sad.

33
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.050
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, it was, it was a bit sad, even when they were here want to see it was like Saturday.

34
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.730
Joshua Lopez: I kind of just came in my room and just close my door and just had like a little cry session.

35
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.440
Joshua Lopez: Friday or Saturday and then Saturday night.

36
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:54.150
Joshua Lopez: My daughter was asking, you know, what time that they're going back to their moms. Of course it was Mother's Day so she you know thought they might be going back early which she never anxious to go back, but she was for Mother's Day with your mom work all day to, like, eight o'clock.

37
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.440
Joshua Lopez: And when I told her that she just went into tears.

38
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.140
Joshua Lopez: She's like, you know,

39
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.000
Joshua Lopez: Mother's Day. I'm supposed to be with my mom, you know, what next Father's Day. I'm not gonna be able to be with you.

40
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.740
Joshua Lopez: And then I just kind of just talk with her, you know, I didn't have a really heart to heart talk with her in a little while.

41
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.780
Joshua Lopez: You know, and that's one of the first times that she's ever told me how she's really felt during all this

42
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:35.040
Joshua Lopez: Like when I'm at moms. I can't help but look at the door, thinking that you're going to walk through it in anytime dad really miss you and I'm there.

43
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:46.380
Joshua Lopez: I'm over year. A I know mom doesn't ever come over a year, but I still see that come through that door, and we're going to spend time and watch your movie.

44
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.580
Joshua Lopez: Do these family things. And if it broke my heart.

45
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.150
Joshua Lopez: You know, just

46
00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.240
Joshua Lopez: Just accepting that that will never be you know like will never

47
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.280
Joshua Lopez: Never get to share those moments anymore like that, you know, it's even when things get better, it'll

48
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.750
Joshua Lopez: Just be different at all.

49
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.330
Joshua Lopez: You know I

50
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the reality is, Josh. This is, this is the truth. Right. This is where that you meet that radical acceptance.

51
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And

52
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I think in the past, you might have been trying to use distraction to get over this and not have to feel it.

53
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your feeling on it and you're going to be okay. And I know it doesn't seem like it right now, but you're going to be okay.

54
00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little, a little reality testing for just a second. Let's dip into a way it was.

55
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How often did you have movie night where everyone sat together and sat around and enjoyed as a family, everyone together.

56
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.590
Joshua Lopez: And it was really frequent for a long time really frequent

57
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.990
Joshua Lopez: Kind of cloudy and murky. The last like year we were together but

58
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.530
Joshua Lopez: I mean, that used to be like once a week. We'd go buy ice cream and root beer and

59
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.590
Joshua Lopez: We'd make root beer floats.

60
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.690
Joshua Lopez: You know, buy pizza or make something at home.

61
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.890
Joshua Lopez: You know, at one time before. Everything's our default part we were

62
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.740
Joshua Lopez: A super tight knit family.

63
00:07:54.450 --> 00:08:02.490
Joshua Lopez: We're always in the same room, no matter if we're doing different things, or the same thing. We all were tight knit.

64
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.450
Joshua Lopez: It's like that last year that we were together.

65
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.740
Joshua Lopez: We were in completely separate different different rooms before

66
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.320
Joshua Lopez: You know, it just

67
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.810
Joshua Lopez: Wasn't the same

68
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It was already that division.

69
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Happening over this last year.

70
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.950
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, well, the last year, we're together.

71
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.900
Joshua Lopez: It's crazy, but we're going on a year apart now.

72
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

73
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.690
Joshua Lopez: Keep track of time, but it's rounding to a year now.

74
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So, just so that I understand what you just said, are you saying that you guys were following each other around in the same room.

75
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Two years ago, or it started to change. Two years ago.

76
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.600
Joshua Lopez: Um, no, we were. I mean, I'm sure there were little changes, two years ago.

77
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:19.800
Joshua Lopez: But for the most part it was that last year were together that it just the dynamics of our family just completely changed that last year.

78
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It was last year together. So this is just me really getting a time frame here.

79
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So there was already this pulling apart, there was already that we're not coming together and having a weekly movie night where there's root beer and pizza and let's let's all very intentionally come out of our rooms, get off the screens and be together.

80
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It was already changing

81
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not cry then just hang in there. This is a Socratic dialogue. I don't mean to offend. It's just, it gets the mind going. Okay, why not cry then

82
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.340
Joshua Lopez: Don't think I realized it, you know, I don't think I really

83
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.450
Joshua Lopez: Was a tune with what was happening at the time.

84
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.460
Joshua Lopez: You know, I just

85
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:20.070
Joshua Lopez: Think I was getting more angry and pushing a lot more know towards the end that we fought a lot about was that she was never around

86
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:36.810
Joshua Lopez: And then what would aggravate me the most, she would say, well, school and work have to come first and never ever once complained about her schooling, even though that took up a lot of time, even though that was

87
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:54.240
Joshua Lopez: You know its own little thing. I never once said, hey, you're spending too much time at school or, you know, get off your homework and come spend time with us. It was never that you know it was, you're not spending time with us your unit. I mean, it just

88
00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:07.860
Joshua Lopez: Wasn't sad. Yeah, I guess, because I didn't know it was as bad as it was. I guess I didn't know we were so disconnected, even though the signs were there. I didn't

89
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.400
Joshua Lopez: Think I was a tune with what was going on.

90
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of you that that might have been what was going on, that there was already this distance happening and you weren't in touch with it. What do you make a view that that that might be what was going on, what's your opinion of you, let's say,

91
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.620
Joshua Lopez: I just, I wish I would have been more aware

92
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.730
Joshua Lopez: Or maybe I would have seen it better.

93
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.500
Joshua Lopez: Wish

94
00:11:48.420 --> 00:12:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the solution. Let's just go to judgment for a second, what's your opinion of you that you did that. Just keep it really simple not going to overanalyze it, what's your opinion of you that that happened, be more attuned to what was going on around you, not emotionally

95
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.050
Joshua Lopez: Disappointed disappointed that I didn't see it sooner.

96
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What could you have done if you were in touch.

97
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What could you, what action, could you have taken if you were connected

98
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To love connected to your own loneliness and sad. Right, what could you have done differently. I know it sounds weird, but just imagine that was president like feeling as sad as you are right now but it being watching her excuses of I gotta go to school. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta write

99
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What my truth and

100
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.600
Joshua Lopez: GOT OFF MY ASS sooner would have

101
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.170
Joshua Lopez: Done what I'm doing now a whole lot sooner.

102
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:07.770
Just

103
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.030
Joshua Lopez: Because I feel like I failed as a as a man

104
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.290
Joshua Lopez: Like I just grew soft

105
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.920
Joshua Lopez: And I stopped being a man and I

106
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:28.020
Joshua Lopez: Just go back in that time, I would have manned up a long time ago.

107
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, let me just make sure this is the direction so far. I don't know that this is the direction I was kind of thinking, I'm a little surprised that you went there with it.

108
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Certainly wasn't the direction I was thinking you were going to go

109
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you telling me that at that time.

110
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Your wife are sending you a message of get off your ass. You think that's the message, who was sending you

111
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.080
Joshua Lopez: So,

112
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You think she wouldn't have gone to school and have worked as much as she did you think that if you were off your ass. I'm using your wording. Okay, just to keep it simple. If you got off your ass. You think she would have

113
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Then home for weekly route their pizzas and movies.

114
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:24.180
Joshua Lopez: So I think that's where she started to lose attraction for me, where she started losing feelings for me.

115
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:28.590
Joshua Lopez: I do

116
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.900
Joshua Lopez: But I mean, in hindsight, you get know for sure, you know,

117
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but

118
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.040
Joshua Lopez: I do feel like

119
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.640
Joshua Lopez: I stopped being that man that she wants. Love you know I do feel like

120
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.530
Joshua Lopez: You know I

121
00:14:53.970 --> 00:15:01.200
Joshua Lopez: Try to take ownership for my mistakes and I'm done. Just blaming myself, but I do, I do feel like I

122
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:12.840
Joshua Lopez: I stopped being that man, you know, stop being a provider at one time I was a great provider was a hustler. And I don't mean hustler, as in

123
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.400
Joshua Lopez: On the street drugs you know i hustled it took care of my

124
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.240
Joshua Lopez: But I just I got really complacent and they got really just

125
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.360
Joshua Lopez: out of tune with who I was.

126
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:44.910
Joshua Lopez: As much as all this really sucks. And it really hurts. I honestly feel like I needed to have a fire lit under my ass because be now I'm doing pretty well, you know, was it for

127
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:54.990
Joshua Lopez: This divorce. I think I would be on cloud nine right now without things are, you know, they can really good money.

128
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So put it put a pin in that for a second.

129
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So you think she would not be spending time downstairs or upstairs with her sister. You don't think she'd be doing that you don't think that she would be taking on the belief system of her sister. You don't think all these other stories. You told me you think

130
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all because you were not off your ass. Is that right,

131
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:32.610
Joshua Lopez: Feel like add a huge part in it, yes I do feel like her sisters influence had a part in it is well

132
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:39.780
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I'll never know for sure. I just know what happened but

133
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.080
Joshua Lopez: You know I know when I was

134
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.540
Joshua Lopez: I know I didn't have this type of problem before in it. I mean, that just

135
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.650
Joshua Lopez: I can't say for sure.

136
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.770
Joshua Lopez: Thing.

137
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.540
Joshua Lopez: Did you feel like that attractive there.

138
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.310
Joshua Lopez: Her attraction for me. Did fade, because I was

139
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.090
Joshua Lopez: Was an awfully I do. I didn't feel it.

140
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the other stories, the reasons why I know about your HER SISTER IS BECAUSE YOU WOULD EXPLAIN IT THAT WAY used to tell me

141
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't like used to tell me I don't like that she is not spending time with me. She spends all their time or their sister. Do you remember you used to tell me that

142
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:45.960
Do

143
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You never said anything about

144
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm less attractive in some way.

145
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This was right.

146
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So was it just

147
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to see which one was kind of more real.

148
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.360
Joshua Lopez: I honestly just

149
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.460
Joshua Lopez: Think

150
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.820
Joshua Lopez: I think they're both real. I mean, I think they're both really real.

151
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:19.950
Joshua Lopez: You know I

152
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:26.820
Joshua Lopez: Don't think I fully grasp my responsibility and my role.

153
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.520
Joshua Lopez: You know, I think, I think it's clear now.

154
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.880
Joshua Lopez: Than it was then.

155
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.860
Joshua Lopez: I didn't like all the time that you spend with their sister. I didn't like that.

156
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.990
Joshua Lopez: We felt second to her, but also think that

157
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:56.250
Joshua Lopez: I can't just put the blame there you know i i know my role in it. And I know, I know. I stopped being a man you know i know i stopped eating.

158
00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.950
Joshua Lopez: There it just

159
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.140
Joshua Lopez: You know, just, I don't know how else to explain it just

160
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.410
Joshua Lopez: I do feel like I

161
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.820
Joshua Lopez: I played a huge role in it for sure.

162
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So like

163
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Is just shifting a little bit. Let's go back to what was working for for Evelyn, and what was working for you. So this radical acceptance. That was the term radical acceptance.

164
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not being used right now. Not today. Not with but you also were presented with it wasn't a regular day it was Mother's Day haven't gone through this before. Not like this. Not exactly like this.

165
00:19:48.960 --> 00:20:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may feel it at Christmas. You may feel it at home, you may have to grieve each one of these expectations but I predict Joshua that with more practice of what we're talking about that each time it comes up the feeling of, oh,

166
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish it could be this.

167
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That first that first staying will probably emerge.

168
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And then quickly if you use this radical acceptance and say that's me wishing my life was something else and I can suffer that loss or

169
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I could not suffer.

170
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The pain is real. The grief is real. It's this on top of it, as if to say,

171
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to punish myself an order to remember it punished and punished and sit in that suffering.

172
00:20:52.530 --> 00:21:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Look again. Look, I mean, didn't you start thinking about all the other things the other things that are going to come up, it's going to hurt. It's going to be awful. Look at all these. Look at all my loss and over and over all these things that are not anymore.

173
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You can spend a lot of time and you can wipe you out.

174
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you know that's happening up here.

175
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that the sun comes up. It was set again and then it comes up and it says again.

176
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And

177
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Your wife Jacqueline maybe she grieves to maybe she doesn't, she's doing. She's living her life.

178
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It continues to move forward. Tell me what suffering does for you. Why are you suffering. Why suffer.

179
00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:58.860
No.

180
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think you need to

181
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We can grieve and grieve it and say, Oh my gosh, but you don't have to do this suffering the differences. This you notice

182
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: My gosh daughter.

183
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I hadn't thought about that. I didn't think about it, this is Mother's Day, and she has this busy work schedule.

184
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't think ahead. I didn't think we got to create like this other way of doing this weekend, and we got to be on purpose about it or we could have and what can we do right now.

185
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't do that and didn't get into solution you went in your room and hurt and suffered

186
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And then she added to it was her own suffering and then she projected into the future. And then you both suffered, and then you suffered because you're both suffering and it's just sad, sad, sad, sad.

187
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could not and see this as an opportunity to have your daughter all to yourself.

188
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And be like, I'm feeling kind of greedy. I got you on Mother's Day. Let's celebrate her and how can we do it. Oh, it lets you and I do this collage lets you and I write this poem about Mommy, but you didn't

189
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You did the other way. The suffer route.

190
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you know it's okay, it's okay to celebrate being with her.

191
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's a it is a really radically different way of approaching a day and I get that. But the power of the ability to do opposite action.

192
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It can have a profound impact what my automatic instinct is I just want to fall apart and cry. I want to close the door lock it and not think about my daughter hurting

193
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it just makes me hurt more. I feel her loss. I feel her pain and mine.

194
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And the opposite of that would be what on that day, what could you have done that was the exact opposite of that.

195
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't think of it because you are hijack your hijacked by the amygdala, the one that comes up and says, we're so sad. You can't even think straight

196
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have other parts of your brain, the one that solves problems, the ones that can think through can shop for a couch and analyze price points delivery of return policy that part of the brain. This part but you don't have access to it when you're wiped out like that.

197
00:24:53.010 --> 00:25:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's when you really will get that switch of will. This frickin socks. I don't have her in my life. Life is different. And what am I going to have to do to change.

198
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I could fall apart. And you always have that option you can dip into it if you want to. That's your human right to suffer. Or you could jump into that living room.

199
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And you met her on that emotional level and you right you had that talk talked with her.

200
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what did you do to honor

201
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're not with her that she's working and that we still need to acknowledge Father's Day. What did you end up doing.

202
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.070
Joshua Lopez: I meant to take the kids to at least get her some flowers.

203
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:54.780
Joshua Lopez: But you know cuz actually it was pretty sad. So I said hey you know tomorrow or we you know if you guys want to get her something we could get her something

204
00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:05.940
Joshua Lopez: Sadly, when I went to drop them off and we went to the store prior to dropping them off. I left my card at home so I couldn't even do that for them.

205
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:15.090
Joshua Lopez: Sadly, it just the pretty bad evening that that evening, I went to pick up my prescription. They closed super early because of the whole covidien

206
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:25.050
Joshua Lopez: Not a good evening. Then of course party with them is never easy, I just

207
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.440
Joshua Lopez: I just, oh my gosh, I miss their little voices.

208
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you do.

209
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.250
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I do call them though I'm grateful. My daughter has a phone.

210
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:48.570
Joshua Lopez: So I do call them in the evening, just to say hi. Yesterday I was excited. I got home and

211
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:58.920
Joshua Lopez: My daughter's birthday present or god bless her birthday was the night I ordered her something the, the left it on her doorstep. One of the neighbors ticket.

212
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.390
Joshua Lopez: So I called them out. A recent the package. This time they were smart enough to put it in the mailbox.

213
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.420
Joshua Lopez: So yesterday. It came in. I called her super excited to let her know her, her birthday gift here.

214
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:19.170
Joshua Lopez: Funny story. I can't take her shopping or couldn't just go to the store and get it.

215
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.230
Joshua Lopez: I told her to have a little shopping spree on

216
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.520
Joshua Lopez: Online.

217
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.590
Joshua Lopez: I wasn't sure what she got

218
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.230
Joshua Lopez: In the box to to make sure it all came in.

219
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.250
Joshua Lopez: I know I spent $65 I didn't know what I spend

220
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.540
Joshua Lopez: $60 on

221
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.310
Joshua Lopez: Literally, she ordered to make up from Ultra. I don't know if you know what Alta is

222
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I do

223
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.360
Joshua Lopez: We're talking for little tiny

224
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:54.600
Joshua Lopez: concealer. I think like a brush something else. I mean, we're talking for little items for

225
00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:04.980
Joshua Lopez: But she was excited she was happy. And that's what mattered. You know, I wasn't it really care about the price or what it was.

226
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:15.000
Joshua Lopez: You know i don't i don't let her overdo it with makeup, but she's, she's a teenager, you know, I'm a better experiment with it at the house, she could put it on.

227
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:28.170
Joshua Lopez: Before we leave if she's wearing makeup, you know, she's looking like she's 17 then of course not, you know, I'm not letting that slide, but she she did, she put it on and you know really

228
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:39.240
Joshua Lopez: I don't know how to word it elegantly. I guess you know you can't really tell she's got a ton of makeup on. You know, she does it very, very lightly and

229
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.400
Joshua Lopez: Peacefully, yes.

230
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:42.750
Okay.

231
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, like that. Sorry. That's a sweet one

232
00:28:55.050 --> 00:29:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so you did use radical acceptance with covert notice that it you could. There's plenty of people that gets themselves wiped out with. I can't go out and go to a restaurant. I can't throw my daughter son a party and they wipe themselves out with that.

233
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You see how expectation doesn't match reality and we can get really miserable. But you didn't do that with the birthday party, why not

234
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:35.640
Joshua Lopez: I don't know. I've noticed really everything else in my life. It's been pretty

235
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:49.080
Joshua Lopez: Pretty easy to accept certain situations and other things, other aspects like I said on the outside, everything is looking really good. It's this one thing that I just

236
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.150
Joshua Lopez: You know what I mean. I

237
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.390
Joshua Lopez: Think I'm pretty good with that when it comes time to

238
00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:05.220
Joshua Lopez: Eating you know now that I'm making good money. I do wish I could take like my kid out to a nice restaurant. But instead, what we do is we we do take out you know we just

239
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:17.910
Joshua Lopez: Call in advance of sitting there waiting in an hour line to get food because you know what I mean, I've just kind of adjusted to the whole Kofi I mean I've decorated my entire apartment online.

240
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:29.250
Joshua Lopez: patiently waiting, you know, for stuff to come in. There wasn't messy right now. I would go to actually be excited to show you some of the cool stuff that we did.

241
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.350
Joshua Lopez: Thursday.

242
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:42.690
Joshua Lopez: My niece watches my kids because I told you we do we care. We care. So my short week I got the kids, but out of those seven days. I work two days and my niece.

243
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:52.740
Joshua Lopez: watches the kiddos because she lives couple apartments down Thursday. She did not show up and she told me she was only going to be here to like 12

244
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:58.110
Joshua Lopez: But I called my kids on my first break to find out. She hadn't been here at all. So,

245
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:08.760
Joshua Lopez: I asked my boss. If I could use some PTO and I took off early. I got here, our table had just came in that day of my daughter, put it together.

246
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:19.110
Joshua Lopez: Then we're like, you know, we need an entertainment center. We went got an entertainment center that one was a lot more difficult to put together. We took us about three hours.

247
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:30.180
Joshua Lopez: My daughter really enjoyed, and I really enjoyed the, the one on one time me and her had I gave her the left side to put together. I did the right side.

248
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:42.960
Joshua Lopez: I read the instructions and was like, okay, we need three screws and I didn't double check her work. I didn't tie in her screws. I just let her. You know what I mean. I did you know cuz it was like mirrored I do the

249
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:50.340
Joshua Lopez: Price I she does the left side and long as she saw what I was doing. She did it and she did an amazing job she

250
00:31:51.060 --> 00:32:01.110
Joshua Lopez: Enjoyed it. Most kids would have after an hour would have been probably frustrated or board. She really enjoyed doing it. And I could tell because when we're done. She took pride in it like

251
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:07.590
Joshua Lopez: I can't believe we did that dad, like, you know, I mean, it was, it was an awesome day Thursday was a great day.

252
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:18.270
Joshua Lopez: Then Friday I do recall the timeline now Friday was the day that I was just sad and I don't know. I don't know why I really just

253
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.710
Joshua Lopez: It was such a great day Thursday, like a great day.

254
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.890
Joshua Lopez: It just hits me out of nowhere. Sometimes it just

255
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.240
Joshua Lopez: It is it is draining it does wipe you out.

256
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.390
Joshua Lopez: One thing I've gotten good at is when I'm at work, a

257
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.480
Joshua Lopez: This is something you taught me.

258
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:52.290
Joshua Lopez: A while back when I was working at Walmart and at Walmart. It was hard to do just the job the way it was. It was hard to lock it out.

259
00:32:53.520 --> 00:33:05.700
Joshua Lopez: But I tell myself. Whenever I start to feel a little down at work to tell myself a you at six o'clock when you clock out if you want to have a crisis session on the way home, you're welcome to do so, but

260
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.630
Joshua Lopez: Right now.

261
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.780
Joshua Lopez: Right here you you can't, you know, you just

262
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:23.070
Joshua Lopez: And it does help me get through my day. It really, really does. And sometimes I get in the car and I don't have that crisis, you know, some days I can't wait to get in the car, just to let it out.

263
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.960
Joshua Lopez: You know,

264
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.430
Joshua Lopez: Just

265
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.370
Joshua Lopez: Become making progress. I just

266
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.490
Joshua Lopez: You know, I have my moments for sure.

267
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hope you can see that there's nothing wrong. You're not doing this grief thing wrong. You're, you're

268
00:33:48.030 --> 00:34:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're appropriately sad massive change happened. The only part that I kind of want to wedge myself in there a little bit and offer something else is around

269
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How

270
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: In a given moment.

271
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You can use

272
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Accepting

273
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And the part that I struggle with because i'm not i'm not you. I can't quite tell if it's that

274
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You catch the negative

275
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: opinion of yourself. I wasn't a man, I didn't step up. That's the one I wonder if it's what's holding up

276
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The resolution of this grief. I just wonder if you haven't really accepted that yet.

277
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

278
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If we have to go there if I have to adopt that language to and say, okay, you were lazy.

279
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You were complacent.

280
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of the worst things

281
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they the worst that you could possibly be is it that

282
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.550
Joshua Lopez: Like okay, I get what you're saying, but

283
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You said that will try it on. Let's do it the other way around. I want, I want to play with, with a few minutes that we have. I want you to say out loud, the worst.

284
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you were during those last year, year and a half, that you are together with her. What's the worst. What's the ugly shadow side and let's use acceptance, but sit with it. Not shame, not, not that. But what you did or didn't do. You're not too thrilled with

285
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You name it. You did a little bit of it earlier, but let me listen

286
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:54.840
Joshua Lopez: I got lazy.

287
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Lazy

288
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.560
Joshua Lopez: Didn't

289
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:04.020
Joshua Lopez: didn't fulfill my own expectations as a man

290
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.030
Joshua Lopez: You

291
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.120
Joshua Lopez: Know a shame.

292
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.380
Joshua Lopez: Most of all, I wasn't

293
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.280
Joshua Lopez: Wasn't the provider that I should have been

294
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

295
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna stick with this for a little bit. We're not going to move from here just gonna, we're gonna go back and forth. Is it true that you were lazy yes or no.

296
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. You remember consciously thinking. Fuck that. I'm not going to look for a job today. You remember thinking that

297
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.330
Joshua Lopez: I'm not in that sense. But so

298
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how you were lazy. I don't quite get it.

299
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.320
Joshua Lopez: Wasn't

300
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.530
Joshua Lopez: WASN'T TRYING TO

301
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.560
Joshua Lopez: wasn't trying to find anything great wasn't

302
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.330
Joshua Lopez: Making excuses, rather than finding solutions.

303
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we. Well, let me drop the lazy and will say I was making excuses.

304
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Does that sound true like that no one can wiggle you out of that when you were making excuses.

305
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: For not trying harder. Would you say that's the worst.

306
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the truth.

307
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I was making excuses for not trying harder.

308
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I think we're getting somewhere. All right. And does that make you feel ashamed.

309
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Think we're at the heart of it right there. OK, now let's see if this one's true

310
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you meet

311
00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your image of what a man is

312
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it bring us back to a man does everything he possibly can. It does not make excuses.

313
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it right back to this original one brings us. And then of course you feel ashamed.

314
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can. I can even draw a line through it. It's really back to you made excuses.

315
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: For not trying 110% or at least 90% 9598 100% you could have done more.

316
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.410
Absolutely.

317
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And that constitutes the man image. Like if you'd have done more if you stop making excuses why then you would have fulfilled this expectation of really important piece of being

318
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: A man.

319
00:38:46.770 --> 00:39:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And that brings up the shame you didn't you made excuses. Okay. And then on the I wasn't a provider part. Is that also part of it. Because if you had stopped making excuses and tried harder, not let anything like I'm gonna go go go go go. Um,

320
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You believe you would have been a man and a provider.

321
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. And now the economy has. There are some constraints to it, which

322
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you can be out there literally walking the street knocking on doors 24 seven and still, the answer is no. Would you still be ashamed.

323
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.850
Joshua Lopez: Right.

324
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, so it's about making excuses.

325
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want freedom from the suffering. Can you please sit with it now and on it.

326
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I make excuses. It was the easy way out, looking at how difficult it is to go work manual labor again or whatever those things were no more excuses.

327
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: On it, tell me.

328
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did and what you didn't do. One more time, really refine it and let's put it to rest.

329
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.190
Joshua Lopez: made excuses.

330
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.370
Joshua Lopez: Not dry a

331
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.970
Joshua Lopez: Look for ways to blame Jacqueline to

332
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.930
Joshua Lopez: Excuse my own behavior.

333
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:55.020
Joshua Lopez: Look for excuses to just stay where I without be complacent to not provide to not wake up and see how I was hurting her or kids or anybody even myself.

334
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that happened.

335
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That happened.

336
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with that that happened not shame but you did.

337
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not you. That's a behavior. You were overwhelmed.

338
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's forgivable

339
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It is this

340
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's completely forgivable as in, so what

341
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You were a man, the whole time your provider. The whole time you were overwhelmed by the complexity of that the fact that you use an old mechanism of denial

342
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Utterly forgivable completely forgivable

343
00:41:46.080 --> 00:42:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a good person who was overwhelmed, who could not get out of the muck couldn't do it. You did everything you could you did not know how to get out. I truly believe that. Do you know the you did not know how to get out.

344
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You did what you could

345
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's forget

346
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.830
Joshua Lopez: It. Yeah.

347
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:20.850
Yeah.

348
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to see it and others, and you're going to need to forgive them to

349
00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're going to see it in them. And you'll say all day. You're in for a rough ride because when you snap. It's called a rough and you're going to see it in your children and you're going to wish.

350
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to wish you can spare them, you're going to be like, Oh, please, just do it the easy way, the way I want to teach you, but they won't

351
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to do it the hard way.

352
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're going to learn what self forgiveness is they're going to have to learn what all of that letting themselves down

353
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The choosing denial instead of the hard stuff, which is what treatments all about what you were still in was addictive thinking your head was in your ass.

354
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

355
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of my clients heads are in their asses.

356
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm playing, but you see what's happening. Don't you remember now, think back, how many times did I show up with you and I would go

357
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still haven't called your primary care physician and I would bang my head again. And I'd say you haven't made any progress, didn't I do that over and over, I would be like,

358
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I suck as a therapist. I just suck. Maybe we need a different one. And so I remember thinking that, and I would tell Dr. Brown, like I'm terrible. I can't get anything

359
00:43:47.760 --> 00:44:07.950
Joshua Lopez: But I do, I do. I remember as we were talking about making excuses. That was one of the things that popped up in my head. I was gonna bring it up. I was like I was even making excuses with you for a long time. I really was like, I just, I was I was making excuses for everything.

360
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I tell you I watched you the whole time. There was nothing I could do

361
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To shake you to say, Josh. Your, your heads in your ass.

362
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I couldn't work. There was nothing I could do. I was like, you're depressed, your back hurts and you're not taking action to find out about shoulder. Let's get you to a doctor. Let's see what's going on. Let's get in your life.

363
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You were wiped out without unemployment it frickin wiped you out the image of yourself and the reality you needed radical acceptance, then

364
00:44:49.500 --> 00:45:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But nothing. I tried everything. There was nothing I could do you had to go through this. You did it, and you're almost to the other side of it, but you can't go back and chastise which means web yourself. You can't go back and do that.

365
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You did the best you could

366
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That unemployment. Am I right, just about my two out. You couldn't sit with it. How can this be

367
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.540
Joshua Lopez: Did it really

368
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.480
Joshua Lopez: It really did like I'm

369
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:35.610
Joshua Lopez: Just I felt worthless. When I got laid off. I felt like, here I am again I'm you know I just

370
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But that wasn't you.

371
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We are employed, one day, and we're superstar. I'm the best therapist anybody's ever had. I hear it, and then I'm this bitch.

372
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wanted

373
00:45:54.420 --> 00:46:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And then if they want to transfer. Oh, you're horrible. You're the worst. And then the next time you're the best. You're underpaid. It goes all day long. If I have to grasp on to one of those. I am going to be, yo, yo, a roller coaster all all the time.

374
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I this changing opinion that you guys have. Am I the changing opinion of children have a husband of people outside of the store that have opinions of me of neighbors or is there something please put that doesn't move a truth about me that just sits there like this.

375
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one.

376
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That was there and you weren't in touch with it. And that's the stuff I talked about when I say that's identity. That's the core sense of self.

377
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's when I would say that is you the man just happens to be a different gender. Not that it's better than women, but that your, your PR your person.

378
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You're born lovable and sometimes we have shitty jobs and we heard our back and sometimes we have awesome ones. It's just a job. Some jobs.

379
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Our culture has signs a bunch of money to another job doesn't give too much money. But it's harder work like it makes no sense. It has nothing to do with who you are.

380
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just job that guy's got a good job. He can afford more expensive. Shit, it's just the job. The man's probably a jerk, frankly, we've got to get to know him first.

381
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a job. You were there all along.

382
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're still there.

383
00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.590
Joshua Lopez: Yeah. Makes me

384
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.470
Joshua Lopez: When

385
00:47:51.510 --> 00:48:02.730
Joshua Lopez: I just hearing it that way. I'm, I'm hoping that I can sit with it, it seeps in and I don't want to make excuses and being being stubborn anymore.

386
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.500
Joshua Lopez: You know, because it does make sense. It does. I

387
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:14.070
Joshua Lopez: Think lazy was the wrong word. I think making excuses and

388
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:17.100
Joshua Lopez: You know, kind of self pity.

389
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:36.150
Joshua Lopez: I mean, I know I've come a long way. It's not easy to admit that, hey, I wasn't, you know, wasn't a man, at that time, or, you know, I mean it's you don't hear a guy say that very often, you know, it just accepting responsibilities just pushing forward.

390
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's the one. Notice it just went when you do sweeping judgments like that I wasn't a man, that's a shame response that's an all encompassing I'm bad, but when you go to. I just didn't have the skills to say to you, one of your

391
00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel dead inside. I don't have contact with what's going on. I just want to cry. I can't believe I'm not bringing money into this house, but you never made contact like that with me.

392
00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You stay real superficial way out here. We could have been grieving. We could have been making contact contact back then but we stayed light and fluffy light and fluffy and nothing, nothing could move you. Now you're like a different client you make contact. Now, you feel what you're saying.

393
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're like a different dude.

394
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.180
Joshua Lopez: I definitely feel a bit different.

395
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.090
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I just

396
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.370
Joshua Lopez: Keep hoping that

397
00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:46.230
Joshua Lopez: Happiness isn't too far away really believe that

398
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:48.990
Joshua Lopez: I'm hoping

399
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.120
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

400
00:49:53.580 --> 00:50:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just remember, it smells that it's going to come. You're going to remember you.

401
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you a happy man, it doesn't come from outside this stuff. Remember I was telling you. Good job, bad job someone likes me doesn't like me, you can hold it for a second, then let it go.

402
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't hold on for long. We can't hold on to attachments like that all that cute furniture you have up and smoke.

403

Gwenevere Abriel: You got an earful

410
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:42.960
Joshua Lopez: I'm

411
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:56.250
Joshua Lopez: Also wondering if maybe you could talk to Dr. Reality. I don't know what happened with my last prescription, but she only prescribed me two strips. I don't know if I was on some kind of bridging that I wasn't aware of

412
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, so I have been listening to

413
00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe she made a mistake. I don't know. I'll be, I don't know. So here I am, I'm in Slack, which might is my computer communication platform. And I'm going to message her. What do you want me to say first of all say Josh is here.

414
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But what else do you want me to say as far as

415
00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:38.190
Joshua Lopez: I don't know if it's possible, because I just got a text message like 10 minutes prior to joining the meetings, I didn't really get to call and see what prescription was in but Walgreens contacted me and said that a prescription ready for me. I don't know if that was the

416
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:50.790
Joshua Lopez: mock them or not. So I'm just, I honestly. Maybe I should just text you and I get a little more info on what's waiting for me at Walgreens could maybe she saw her mistaken rope. Another prescription

417
00:52:51.930 --> 00:53:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: As much as you can take me out of it. I would appreciate so go just take me as much as you can out and go into just log into virtual clinic and say, Hey, guys.

418
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm this went sideways do it as soon as you can before she goes to sleep.

419
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will tell you she's got I think other things going on in context of her life. So be persistent be clear on what you want.

420
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What went wrong what you want, not the long story. Don't make excuses for that, that, that I think that that the note script went in for this. This is what the doctor had intended. Can you communicate. This is what I want.

421
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To dance around she she needs things really concrete just this. I got this. But this is what we agreed on, or this is what I thought the prescription would be just make it really easy for her to just fix it. But yeah, check.

422
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.040
Mark

423
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:49.650

424
00:53:51.240 --> 00:54:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you you know what it means to have two strips that means that means applesauce and raisins. To me, it has no meaning does means nothing to me you like you know what does. You are how many days that covers. I am like, Well, yeah.

425
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:15.810
Joshua Lopez: It only covers so many days and then I switched my my pharmacy and virtual clinic before we met, but it was

426
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:21.270
