36
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.180
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

37
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.040
Erika Romero: I bet you do.

38
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:16.020
Dominique Pozo: So I just wanted to kind of down, you know, download and process what happened in group yesterday. How was that for you.

39
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.970
Dominique Pozo: You know, to share with Leticia and and

40
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.190
Dominique Pozo: How was that

41
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.150
Erika Romero: It was, it was good. I mean, I'm

42
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.270
Erika Romero: Glad that she received it as, as well as I thought she, you know, I was, I was hoping she would

43
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:51.750
Erika Romero: Because, for some reason, like you, I don't, I don't know how you are but ME PERSONALLY I FEEL people I feel people in my heart at certain people. I can feel

44
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.680
Erika Romero: A connection with and for some reason. Yeah, kind of just

45
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:11.400
Erika Romero: hit home for me. So, you know, she seems to be going through a lot of the same stuff that I've gone through in my past and even, you know, some of my presence and so

46
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.800
Erika Romero: Yeah, you know, it was it it was

47
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.530
Erika Romero: It was hard for me to process everything that

48
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.200
Erika Romero: That it brought up.

49
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.740
Erika Romero: You know that her her story brought up but

50
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.980
Erika Romero: But it's okay you know I

51
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.110
Erika Romero: This stuff that's going on with me in my lifetime.

52
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.710
Erika Romero: I put a long time ago in. So I've had a lot of a lot of time to

53
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:58.950
Erika Romero: Work through through you know my ISSUES AND IN MY HEART ACHE AND AND MY heartbreak and and all that. And the emotional and the psychological stuff that it it did.

54
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:14.400
Erika Romero: But I mean, you know, there are times like, you know, hearing the teachers speak, you know that it brings up my own my own past and in so when that happens.

55
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:37.320
Erika Romero: Every day I think about my path that's not something that you know I shoved away in a closet and and make go away. You know, I think about my past all the time and and if it's not one thing. It's another and some days it's everything. And sometimes it's still, it's still

56
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.320
Erika Romero: Hurts, but I've learned how to process through it and so

57
00:06:44.370 --> 00:07:00.150
Erika Romero: I've learned that sometimes you just gotta cry, you know, and like that and let that go. And that's the way that I process. And then I have to realize, you know the past is the past. There's nothing that you can do about the past, I fix those those

58
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.170
Erika Romero: Those parts of my life. And so I'm okay with it now.

59
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.880
Erika Romero: You know, I have to accept what I did to my own mind. And what I allowed other people to do to my life.

60
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.280
Erika Romero: But like with my daughter that that's still pretty new.

61
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.540
Erika Romero: Although it's been going on for quite a long time.

62
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:33.240
Erika Romero: It, you know, it's still fairly new, as far as the last incident. You know what I mean. So

63
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.270
Erika Romero: So that that that does

64
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.060
Erika Romero: Make it hard sometimes.

65
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.720
Erika Romero: But again, you know, if I've already learned how to process through that and and

66
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:55.080
Erika Romero: But I'm still human. And so it, you know, it still does this hurt and you know she's my daughter and so

67
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:08.910
Erika Romero: But I mean it really hasn't been something that I've dwelled on or even after our session yesterday. It wasn't something that I you know dwelled on and

68
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:18.060
Erika Romero: I, I feel for Leticia just because I know you know I lost my two oldest boys and I never thought that back in so

69
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:37.800
Erika Romero: And so I feel her, you know, I went through that the holidays and days and in all that where I didn't get to to have, you know, have them a part of my life. And so I know where she's coming from right now where she felt that I was it

70
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:47.010
Erika Romero: Let me, let me tell you about my drug my drug habit when when I became a drug addict. The first time.

71
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:58.890
Erika Romero: When I left my ex husband that was. I thought to myself, I never go back to drugs again, never. And I never did.

72
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:07.920
Erika Romero: I never touched that stuff again, nor did I have the cravings for it, which was really weird because everybody I've ever talked to is always told me

73
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:17.310
Erika Romero: Oh, I have cravings and so I don't know what that's like. I honestly don't even now with the pills. I don't have that craving. I don't have that.

74
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.440
Erika Romero: You know that

75
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:39.570
Erika Romero: Without part of me that, you know, we're lucky she was talking about, you know, feel like she's going to backfire. Well, I haven't had that I've never had that I didn't have first time I'm not having it now. And so I can't sympathize or empathize with that. I can't, I don't know how for me.

76
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.000
Erika Romero: Because I stepped out of it so quickly and so easily.

77
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.590
Erika Romero: it frustrates me sometimes to hear other people talk about it like that. You know what I mean.

78
00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:03.660
Dominique Pozo: I'm gonna I'm gonna, I'm going to interject for a second there because I I could and I want to acknowledge to that, I, I, kind of, I stopped the whole group from any

79
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:18.810
Dominique Pozo: Any conversation when Leticia said, You know, I don't feel strong I'm not feeling I feel weak. I feel all these things. And I noticed a few of not just you, but a few people like trying to lift her up and and

80
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.420
Dominique Pozo: And I

81
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:30.240
Dominique Pozo: I want to check in around that. Because what you just said reminded me of that moment in group yesterday. Do you do recall that

82
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:40.020
Erika Romero: Remember it. Um, what do you mean as far as what like what are you trying to figure out what are you trying to understand

83
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:53.460
Dominique Pozo: Well um I you just said something about how it, it's hard for you to relate and it's hard for you to hear that, you know, I think that's what I heard, or what did you tell me I don't want to put words in your mouth.

84
00:10:54.630 --> 00:11:06.150
Erika Romero: Yeah, it's just hard for me to, to understand, honestly, because I didn't have that. So I mean it's not that it's it just frustrates me because I don't know.

85
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:16.200
Erika Romero: how that feels. You know what I mean, I don't know how to come from that. I don't know how to empathize with that or sympathize with that. I don't

86
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:33.240
Erika Romero: But I know what she's feeling internally as far as her emotions and what she's going through. And really, that's all that I was trying to convey was that I knew what she was going through, because I've been. I've been there and I've done that and

87
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.240
Erika Romero: It but I mean as far as

88
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:47.790
Erika Romero: You know having cravings and stuff like that. I just I you know that's not something that I've ever said, Oh, well, you have to just get on your feet. And, you know, and

89
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:54.000
Erika Romero: And stop the craziness. You know that's not that's never something that I would say, I just don't know how

90
00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:11.670
Erika Romero: to empathize with that. You know what I mean. Gee, I don't know how to relate to that because I don't. I've never been in that situation when I like you time that I've quit using drugs. I have just quit cold turkey and never had the craving for it. Never gone back to it so

91
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:13.320
Dominique Pozo: I'm

92
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.830
Erika Romero: Mad i don't i don't know how i don't understand that.

93
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:25.170
Dominique Pozo: So I so my curiosity and that's why I wanted everyone to just stop for a moment because what I was talking about was the window of tolerance. Do you remember that.

94
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.660
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and

95
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.430
Dominique Pozo: So my curiosity with you in particular is, you know,

96
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:48.270
Dominique Pozo: What is the discomfort about, you know, what could because that's what I sense. It's like, you know, kind of continuing to speak to her because there was some discomfort, whether it was frustration or inability to relate and so

97
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.680
Dominique Pozo: I'm just wondering

98
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:58.680
Erika Romero: You got, you got me wrong completely wrong fly continue to talk to her, I continue to talk to her, because I know how she feels

99
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:06.180
Erika Romero: As far as everything that she's going through and drug part I can't understand because I don't know.

100
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:15.660
Erika Romero: But I wasn't even trying to touch on that at all. I never even tried to touch on that all I was trying to do with trying to let her know that, you know, because I know

101
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:25.200
Erika Romero: When you were going through all that you're losing kids and you're trying to get your life to getting trying to get sober and you're doing this, that and the other.

102
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:35.520
Erika Romero: You know people who have no first hand experience can tell you are well yeah, it'll be okay. You're going to get through it, you're going to be fine, you know,

103
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:43.050
Erika Romero: And for me that's frustrating that pisses me off because first of all, how are you going to tell me because you came out of a textbook.

104
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:58.590
Erika Romero: That you're going to tell me how I feel. And what I'm going through. And what I'm going to get out of. And, you know, all I was trying to let her know with that I have already been there and done that. And so I know how she's feeling in her heart.

105
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:10.200
Erika Romero: As far as touching on her drugs. I never touched that situation not touch that subject, I have no I didn't speak on it and all will I speak on it because that's her her situation.

106
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.640
Erika Romero: All I wanted her know is that you you know when you when you're talking to other people that have never been there.

107
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:31.290
Erika Romero: It's hard for you to feel like they do understand like they get you like they know how you feel when you speak to somebody who's been there and done that.

108
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:43.650
Erika Romero: He you know that they they understand what's going on inside the turmoil. The heartache, the heartbreak everything that you're feeling emotionally

109
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.970
Erika Romero: You know that they've been there so

110
00:14:48.990 --> 00:15:04.440
Erika Romero: They can relate to you, they can feel you they can you know and I would never be the one to tell her. All you're going to be just fine. You're in a walk out of, you know, with flying colors or you're going to get through this and a month or a week or year

111
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:12.240
Erika Romero: That's not my intention in the least and nor will I ever ever talked to somebody like that so

112
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.470
Dominique Pozo: What I'm telling you.

113
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:27.930
Erika Romero: I can tell them I can't tell them what they're going what they're going to do. I know where I came from. I know what drove me. I know what got me in and out of my situation, but that's not them. They're not me. I'm not them.

114
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:41.340
Dominique Pozo: So I'm really hearing that you what you're what you were wanting to do is offer her empathy. You know, like you, you understand you've been there. You've had your own version of this, and you, you feel her

115
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:59.310
Erika Romero: To do but touching on the drugs. I can't. And I won't. Right. That's not something I'll talk to anybody about, I can tell you off. I can be here for you. I can, I can be an arrow. If you need somebody to talk to you.

116
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.510
Erika Romero: You know, I've tried to help a lot of people get sober.

117
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:15.810
Erika Romero: But to to interject myself into their addiction. I won't, because that's not i'm not them. I don't know.

118
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:32.250
Erika Romero: What drives them, you know, they're not emotionally, the same as I am. I'm not emotionally, the same as they are. And so what drives me is not the same thing that drives them and what gets them through what gets them through their stuff is not the same thing for me.

119
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:43.590
Erika Romero: I will never touch on that situation, but I do know how to empathize with somebody who is going through what she's going through, because I've been there myself. I've done that I've, you know,

120
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:54.450
Erika Romero: You know, I, that's all I would try to let her know that you know that she's not alone. You know, that can be a very lonely place.

121
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.480
Erika Romero: Can be a lonely situation, it can be

122
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.260
Erika Romero: And you can have a million people around you and

123
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:09.540
Erika Romero: If they've never been there, it's hard for them to understand, you know, where you're coming from what you're going through what you're feeling

124
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.150
Erika Romero: I wanted her to know that she's not alone, that there is somebody in her group that's been there.

125
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:22.470
Erika Romero: I don't know everybody else. I just want to hurt another that there's somebody in her group that has been there.

126
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.260
Erika Romero: You know, and that I felt what she's yelling

127
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.680
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think it's a i'm i'm still

128
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.170
Dominique Pozo: Figuring out how to work with the group and bring in the

129
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.450
Dominique Pozo: The

130
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:59.100
Dominique Pozo: The practice of just sitting with the discomfort, you know, and just letting it be and I, I'm actually wondering from our session last week. I know you know you talked about

131
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:14.160
Dominique Pozo: That what was the word that he used bondage. The that there's some bondage. And I'm wondering how has that been for you this week. And have you been able to to make some time and space to really

132
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.940
Dominique Pozo: I don't know. Explore and touch into That uncomfortable feeling

133
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.540
Erika Romero: Yeah, I got to thinking

134
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.910
Erika Romero: About it and it. Gotcha. I'm

135
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:34.290
Erika Romero: Thinking about where that comes from, because I guess I really haven't really been that as far as

136
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.750
Erika Romero: Giving myself the opportunity to think about it.

137
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.350
Erika Romero: A pretty busy and so

138
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.620
Erika Romero: Tapping into my emotional

139
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.920
Erika Romero: Side is not something that I do very often.

140
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.300
Erika Romero: Yeah, I figured it out. I figured out what it was, um,

141
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.800
Erika Romero: So I think for me it's just more

142
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:12.030
Erika Romero: Yeah, I've always been, I've always been in relationship that relationships marriages that I don't feel

143
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:24.930
Erika Romero: Where I have the freedom to be me and to do the things that I want to do. And when I do do the things that I want to do, then I get the accusation Starcom coming into play.

144
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.360
Erika Romero: And so

145
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.770
Erika Romero: You know, like this trust and accusations of cheating and

146
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.230
Erika Romero: stupid bullshit.

147
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:50.280
Erika Romero: And so that's where my trap is because every single relationship, including this marriage is now that we're, we're starting to tap into that now with my husband. Now, but in every single relationship. I've been in

148
00:19:51.630 --> 00:20:00.900
Erika Romero: For some stupid reason that seems to come about. I don't know why I don't know where that so I feel like there's always that

149
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.640
Erika Romero: You know that kind of that having that thumb put down on you. You know what I mean to

150
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.040
Erika Romero: Not that there's a restriction on on what you do.

151
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:26.610
Erika Romero: And how long have you been on and all that other stuff. So that's where that came from. At some time to explore that, because that was something

152
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.510
Erika Romero: That broke through

153
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.330
Erika Romero: Between my husband and I last week.

154
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.670
Erika Romero: Hmm, beginning of last week.

155
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.050
Dominique Pozo: It's kind of, it's really

156
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.040
Dominique Pozo: Interesting. It's interesting that it keeps happening. What do you think

157
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.860
Dominique Pozo: Why do you think that keeps happening.

158
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.410
Erika Romero: Either

159
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:48.900
Erika Romero: I don't know.

160
00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.670
Erika Romero: Evidently, I have some very immature and

161
00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:00.120
Erika Romero: Insecure men in my life so

162
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:09.780
Erika Romero: All right, I had had and so that actually, like I said, that just spoke out about a week ago at my house.

163
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:17.640
Erika Romero: Or so, you know, and it's like I even feel like sometimes we're that I can't go to the bathroom without

164
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:31.320
Erika Romero: Or take a show without, you know, I'll tell my husband. I'm gonna go take a shower. This adults usually might time why, you know, have my time for me. You know, I can take care of myself and just have

165
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:41.280
Erika Romero: some me time well. Next thing I know there's a two year olds running through here, my husband's coming in the bedroom and it's like

166
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:55.350
Erika Romero: Well, part of I'm taking a shower. Is it clear, you know, this is my only time during the day where I get to do something for myself. No.

167
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:15.120
Erika Romero: You know that that that becomes an issue or becoming an issue. I go to the store for too long. And are you know what is considered for too long. I'm stuck in my house 24 seven I go to Walmart and I spend a couple hours there and the phone calls, start

168
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.550
Erika Romero: Are you coming home. When are you coming home, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

169
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.220
Erika Romero: Blah, blah, blah.

170
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:32.610
Erika Romero: You know, so it just, it gets really just mundane and you know just seems like it's just us being a psycho.

171
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:48.150
Dominique Pozo: I'm going to pull up there's this way of communicating called compassionate communication or nonviolent communication and they have these great charts on needs and feelings and

172
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:49.920
Dominique Pozo: Needs.

173
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.000
Dominique Pozo: And

174
00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:08.850
Erika Romero: I'm not getting very good reception. So because we have, we're going through a windstorm out here really bad. So I just want you to know. I'm trying to adjust myself and before you know it. I'm going to be up on the roof with my up in the air.

175
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:15.450
Erika Romero: I'm just trying to adjust myself. So if you if I, if you can't hear me, let me know. Okay.

176
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.440
Okay.

177
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:29.070
Dominique Pozo: So I have a list here of different needs and just think about when you when you imagine that bondage that you've been experiencing that feeling of bondage. What needs.

178
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.480
Dominique Pozo: Are in our in there are behind that bondage. That really want to be honored.

179
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.330
Erika Romero: Got through the first list.

180
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.820
Erika Romero: There's several of them here.

181
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.260
Erika Romero: You want to know what they are.

182
00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:01.500
Dominique Pozo: I do because I yeah I wanted you to connect with some of them and then be able to identify because

183
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:14.640
Dominique Pozo: I'm hearing you know when you say like, what part of me take a shower. Don't you understand, I imagine, whoever's on the receiving end probably get kind of defensive yet if you were to say when I say I'm gonna take a shower. It's

184
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.520
Dominique Pozo: What's up,

185
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:20.880
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I can't hear you.

186
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:30.540
Erika Romero: I, that's what I think it you know i don't i don't say that. I think it. I think it because I'm one of those people have a really hard time

187
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:40.350
Erika Romero: Controlling what I say either a sharp tongue. And so if I say something like that. It'll turn into an explosion. Yeah.

188
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:49.890
Erika Romero: So generally, when I speak to people have to think about what I'm going to say before I say and take a day or two.

189
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:51.840
Erika Romero: And

190
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.050
Erika Romero: I've learned as I've grown

191
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.700
Erika Romero: To really watch what I say and think about what comes out of my mouth because, if not all, a lot of you.

192
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.330
Erika Romero: Know like don't say that. I don't say that. But I think it

193
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:22.530
Dominique Pozo: Hahaha. I'm, I would like to know what needs are behind that. When you think, Gosh, I just, I just want to take a shower and then what you know have that time for yourself that meantime what what needs are in their

194
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.010
Erika Romero: Cooperation.

195
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:37.620
Erika Romero: Compassion. I think that you have to have some sort of compassion for somebody out to be able to start give them that job for them, you know, and I mean that that

196
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.350
Erika Romero: That just comes with it. I'm

197
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.270
Erika Romero: Empathy.

198
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:55.920
Erika Romero: mutuality. Because I do it with my husband, you know, I keep the baby out let him take a shower. Make sure that you know he has time to do what he needs to do.

199
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.460
Erika Romero: When he gets dressed you know it.

200
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.120
Erika Romero: So respect and

201
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.810
Erika Romero: Support to know and to be known.

202
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.890
Erika Romero: To understand

203
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:25.230
Dominique Pozo: How do you think identifying these needs. How do you think this would help.

204
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.540
Dominique Pozo: Get your needs met.

205
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:39.240
Erika Romero: I don't, I don't even know. I don't even know how to communicate with men anymore.

206
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.570
Erika Romero: I just, I've just come to the conclusion that they're all the same.

207
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.510
Erika Romero: No matter where they come from.

208
00:27:51.180 --> 00:28:00.720
Erika Romero: A quality. I mean, I think you have to be equal, you know, our thought process our respective thing has to be well

209
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.440
Erika Romero: And I don't think that that necessarily have been

210
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:18.390
Erika Romero: My independence. I mean, that's what I feel gets taken from me is, is that independence to be able to do what I want to do by myself.

211
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.870
Erika Romero: The space.

212
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.650
Erika Romero: Awareness.

213
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:48.960
Erika Romero: To be aware of that, you know, I'm a human being. And I like to, you know, I'm around a two year old every minute of every day you know that needs to be something that hey, maybe we should like a breather, you know, go to Walmart for a couple hours. That's what I'm getting

214
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.630
Erika Romero: I'm getting some me time

215
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.220
Erika Romero: Quiet Time.

216
00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:01.320
Erika Romero: Away time, you know, I'm like I said, I'm an hour 24 hours a day, seven days a week with a two year old.

217
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.280
Erika Romero: You know,

218
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:10.080
Erika Romero: I'm 46 years old, I don't have that energy that I used to have. I don't have that anymore.

219
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.940
Erika Romero: When I take a shower when I go to Walmart, go to the store.

220
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:22.350
Erika Romero: At a time where I you know just breathe a little bit and get a little bit of time.

221
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:35.370
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean, these are so valid these this whole list of needs. These are universal needs. Everybody has them maybe some are stronger for some people, or you cry.

222
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.800
Erika Romero: No, I'm sorry.

223
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.390
Erika Romero: I

224
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.760
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I just didn't want to know. That's fine. I didn't want to talk over you if you're crying.

225
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:46.680
Erika Romero: Yeah.

226
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:56.220
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so these are yeah everybody has these needs. And like I was saying some for some people, they're a little stronger, like, you know, maybe for you that

227
00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:03.570
Dominique Pozo: That need for the space and the freedom and independence. The autonomy that might be stronger for you than for your husband.

228
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:13.260
Dominique Pozo: And there's nothing wrong or right about it. It's just the way it is. And so my hope is by by being able to identify with more words.

229
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:20.430
Dominique Pozo: And detail, you know, what is it that you're needing when you go and you take that time for you. Maybe he'll understand because that's

230
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:27.060
Dominique Pozo: That's the whole point of this way of communicating is that by identifying one's needs and feelings clearly

231
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:43.950
Dominique Pozo: And being able to claim them and name them. Hopefully it softens another person to say, oh, okay. That makes sense. I can understand. They may not like it. It may not be what they wish for what they want. Yet, hopefully they can understand that a little more of where you're coming from.

232
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:45.720
Erika Romero: Right.

233
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.160
Dominique Pozo: And maybe

234
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.060
Erika Romero: It would be

235
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.310
Erika Romero: It would be nice.

236
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:51.780
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

237
00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:05.490
Dominique Pozo: Like I imagine in that in that situation where you want to take a shower. You know, the way that one would use the NVC the nonviolent communication model would be to say,

238
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.170
Dominique Pozo: When

239
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.130
Dominique Pozo: When you and your granddaughter. What's her name.

240
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:12.900
Erika Romero: Oh, yeah.

241
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:25.830
Dominique Pozo: When you and Aaliyah came through my room after I named that I wanted them as a shower, I felt frustrated and, you know, agitated, because I have a need for some space and

242
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:36.900
Dominique Pozo: A little bit of autonomy and whatever the other needs. That's how that's how the model works. So it's naming the feelings that come up because these needs were not met.

243
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.470
Dominique Pozo: Anyways, just wanting to

244
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.120
Dominique Pozo: Share more tools with you.

245
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:49.680
Dominique Pozo: And it's kind of hard to make somebody wrong for what they're feeling, you know, that's a hard thing to do.

246
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.880
Erika Romero: Oh yeah, but that happen.

247
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.290
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

248
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.240
Erika Romero: I think i think that's

249
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:04.800
Erika Romero: A huge issue between my husband and I, when I feel like I tried to express

250
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.380
Erika Romero: How do

251
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.390
Erika Romero: What I'm thinking and you take things

252
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:30.390
Erika Romero: Personal. I mean, yeah, everything as an attack on it. I mean, it's not it's not an attack. It's just, you know, I need to understand that, you know, this A, B and C. This is how I feel about it and I am

253
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:39.930
Erika Romero: The biggest source of contention to see my husband and I have my granddaughter because he's on one end of the spectrum, and I'm on the other end of the spectrum.

254
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:40.650
And

255
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.480
Erika Romero: What we do with her and how we discipline her

256
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.470
Know,

257
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.440
Erika Romero: And so that becomes a huge, huge ordeal, between the two of us.

258
00:32:54.630 --> 00:33:06.930
Erika Romero: And when I tried to talk to him about it because very offensive and everything that I try to talk to him about becomes very offensive to him, but it's not that I'm trying to be offensive.

259
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.190
Erika Romero: I'm not even angry. I just want him to understand

260
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.830
Erika Romero: How I feel about it, you know.

261
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.610
Erika Romero: For him, the team. I don't know because he's never

262
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.570
Erika Romero: He's never really been it and much have

263
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:31.860
Erika Romero: Very many long term relationship first wife, you know, and

264
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.200
Erika Romero: He has a daughter, but he didn't get Tracer. So this is his first

265
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:40.230
Erika Romero: Child raising

266
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:51.360
Erika Romero: And so I think that He does it by, you know, and I've raised a lot of children. I didn't raise my tool this point but I pray, a lot of children.

267
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:53.700
Erika Romero: I've been married before

268
00:33:54.210 --> 00:34:02.790
Erika Romero: Might assets and had four boys and I read his four boys I raised my daughter, my gun on me. My niece and

269
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.730
Erika Romero: So every is a lot of kids and

270
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.880
Erika Romero: And so I think that

271
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.260
Erika Romero: Because he's a newbie, and I'm an old

272
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.680
Erika Romero: Man think that we don't quite understand each other. You know what I mean. Because I like

273
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.320
Erika Romero: That newbie phase. You know what I mean, where I, you know, everything is very catchy.

274
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.030
Erika Romero: You know,

275
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:51.750
Erika Romero: So for me, I'm already set in my ways as far as how to raise children and how to discipline children and all that. And so like I said, we're completely on the opposite ends of the spectrum as far as raising children goes. And so, yeah, like I said, that becomes a very huge

276
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.050
Erika Romero: Tension between him and I

277
00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.960
Erika Romero: Believe I had picked him over that.

278
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.150
Dominique Pozo: Huh, huh.

279
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.850
Dominique Pozo: Huh.

280
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:14.520
Dominique Pozo: Well i know i i put it out there and I, it seems like it's still too early, but I do imagine at some point, it could be helpful to have a session with the two of you and just

281
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:23.970
Dominique Pozo: Be able to use some compassionate communication on both ends to Pratt to start practicing it so that both of you can be heard and understood more

282
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:26.610
Erika Romero: You know,

283
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.920
Erika Romero: Like I said that to that will be maybe something to add.

284
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.990
Erika Romero: later on down the road. Yeah.

285
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.220
Erika Romero: I think that he he

286
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:47.580
Erika Romero: I think he thinks that this is this is just for me. And so right now we're just gonna allow it to be just for me.

287
00:35:48.030 --> 00:36:03.240
Dominique Pozo: And it sounds actually as after I said that I was like wait, she just told me she needs more space more me time so I can see where maybe you'd really want this time for yourself. Actually not inviting him in and just having, having it be just for you.

288
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:10.920
Erika Romero: Yeah, for the time being. I mean, that's not something that I'm opposed to exploring later down

289
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.170
Erika Romero: Yeah, it's done that way, but

290
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.900
Erika Romero: That's definitely not something that I think I'm ready to do yet because I don't

291
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:21.390
Erika Romero: Um,

292
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.190
Erika Romero: I don't know. I don't know how he would take that to be honest with you.

293
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.730
Erika Romero: Like I said, this for him. This is an Erica thing.

294
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.350
Erika Romero: Oh,

295
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.320
Erika Romero: Boy Yeah.

296
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.200
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

297
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:54.750
Dominique Pozo: So we still have a little bit of time anything anything up for you that you want to bring in, we probably can't do a really deep dive, but we can address some you know anything

298
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:04.590
Erika Romero: No, not that I can think of. Like I said, I just this last week was just kind of

299
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.020
Erika Romero: just brought up a lot of old feelings and

300
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:17.850
Erika Romero: Old things that you know that I've that I've dealt with, you know, and moved on from but

301
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.660
Erika Romero: I really haven't had anybody

302
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:23.640
Erika Romero: That

303
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.800
Erika Romero: That's been in my life that has

304
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:36.420
Erika Romero: Dealt with my all my situations. And so when everything was brought up on the t shirt.

305
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:50.340
Erika Romero: Not a lot of stuff for me. You know what I mean. So, so a lot of stuff that had already been dealt with and moved on from just kind of like, you know, that roller coaster cart that just kind of comes and shows you from behind.

306
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:55.920
Erika Romero: Yeah, kinda was. It kind of a products and things. But I mean,

307
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:58.380
Erika Romero: I'm okay.

308
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.580
Erika Romero: But that those are just things that

309
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.400
Erika Romero: You know, every once in a while. They come, they come back up to the surface and

310
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:22.200
Erika Romero: When I think that that gives me an opportunity to when that happens, it just gives me an opportunity to kind of just release everything that you know that I'm kind of feeling all at the same time.

311
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.340
Erika Romero: I'm kind of like that reason to cry. You know what I mean.

312
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.450
Dominique Pozo: Yes, yeah.

313
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.400
Erika Romero: That makes sense.

314
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:45.690
Erika Romero: Yeah, from all these little frustrations here and there it is, you know, and you're like okay, whatever, you know, and you just keep pushing, pushing those little things you know away and saying, Okay, well, whatever, whatever, whatever.

315
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:53.250
Erika Romero: And you know they frustrate you. And you know, it puts you off, and you know that you have these feelings when

316
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.960
Erika Romero: You suppress those and you kind of just move on with your regular day, you know, and

317
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:10.050
Erika Romero: Because frustration as a part of everyday life, it's you know it is. But sometimes, so they they kind of sneak up on you and they stack up like that. Django game. You know what I mean.

318
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.280
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

319
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:18.990
Erika Romero: stacks and stacks and stacks and before you know it, it comes tumbling down and I guess that was, you know, every once in a while.

320
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:29.370
Erika Romero: Some thoughts come back in and that that that you know breaking piece that piece that gets put on that kind of just sends everything tumbling down

321
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:37.890
Erika Romero: And and they're not really big thing. There are little things, you know, but at the same time there it

322
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:50.640
Erika Romero: Was like stacking those blocks, you know, you might start with a few little blocks, but you may keep backing them stacking them for you know you've got a tower, man. Yeah. And so that's

323
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.200
Erika Romero: You know, I guess that's just a reason for

324
00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.970
Erika Romero: You not to have that released sometime

325
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:09.630
Dominique Pozo: So it's a good. Yeah, sounds like it was a good good release to be able to just kind of let let the tears move that may have been stalking for a while.

326
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:14.850
Erika Romero: Yeah, well, I'm not, I'm not one of those kind of people who

327
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:37.320
Erika Romero: Tend to take things too seriously not. I mean, and I, I have the I can push things aside and say okay well I don't care, whatever, you know, and it just keep pushing them, but at the same time, you know, I still have that humanity is he

328
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.690
Erika Romero: Speaking up to me.

329
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.220
Erika Romero: And when you start

330
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.540
Erika Romero: When you, when you have that release.

331
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.870
Erika Romero: You know, any, any refer you realize that you're crying about

332
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.950
Erika Romero: Everything that happened 25 years ago you know

333
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.170
Erika Romero: I'm already done with that.

334
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.650
Erika Romero: Let's come back and you know

335
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.350
Erika Romero: What's good

336
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.100
You know,

337
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.310
Erika Romero: All negative

338
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:26.640
Erika Romero: For me, I, I tend to think that the things that we go through in life.

339
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:35.280
Erika Romero: They're not just challenges I think there for us for me anyway. I can't speak for us. But for me.

340
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.840
Erika Romero: What I go through my life makes me who I am today.

341
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:56.460
Erika Romero: And everything that is good, is what made me who I am today. And I've learned a lot from everything that I've been through everything that play every negative beings has bought something positive to my life to

342
00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:00.360
Erika Romero: Which is weird because

343
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.680
Erika Romero: You're getting

344
00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.330
Erika Romero: You're getting very broken up.

345
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:15.870
Dominique Pozo: Actually, I can't hear you so well maybe I wonder if you take yourself off video and then

346
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.000
Dominique Pozo: Maybe I can just hear your audio. Sometimes the video makes

347
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:21.150
Erika Romero: It.

348
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.530
Dominique Pozo: A lot harder.

349
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.020
Erika Romero: How's that, can you hear me a little bit better now.

350
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.730
Dominique Pozo: That's better. Yeah, and

351
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:34.380
Dominique Pozo: And if you take the video off, it'll probably be even more clear. We only have a few minutes. So it's, it's okay. You can take the video.

352
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.300
Erika Romero: If you want. Yeah, that's right.

353
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:39.330
Erika Romero: You hear me.

354
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.040
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's better. Yeah.

355
00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:56.640
Erika Romero: Okay, yeah. So for me, you know, you wouldn't think that negative negative things that go through in your life would bring positive change. But it for me. It did. It brought a lot of positivity for me and I've learned how to

356
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:14.340
Erika Romero: To not do certain things or treat people certain ways, and you know it has made a positive impact in my life. My ex husband used to my my kids. His father used to beat the living tar out of me, me, me and beat me and sometimes

357
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:18.210
Erika Romero: I didn't think I was gonna make it to the next day, but

358
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.550
Erika Romero: That being said,

359
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.960
Erika Romero: That always gave me something to

360
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.820
Erika Romero: That I learned not to treat people. That way you know

361
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.940
Erika Romero: Because I was always an asshole and excuse my language.

362
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:42.060
Erika Romero: But as a child as a teenager, I wasn't asshole. I was mean to people I you know I was always fighting. I was always in trouble.

363
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:44.730
Erika Romero: And so

364
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.940
Erika Romero: You know when I went through that with my kid's dad. It was something that I

365
00:43:51.960 --> 00:44:03.330
Erika Romero: Had to take that negativity and turn it into something positive for myself in order to be able to move on, more than anything, you know, because I had to learn something from that.

366
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.790
Erika Romero: And so that's what I learned.

367
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:13.050
Erika Romero: That you can take a lot. You can take your negative and you can turn it into something positive.

368
00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:20.220
Dominique Pozo: That's, that's pretty I think helpful to not spiral into depression. So that's a great

369
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.360
Dominique Pozo: That's a great

370
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:27.360
Dominique Pozo: Gift you've taken. So let's, um, we have about a minute left. I'm thinking. Can you name two

371
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:36.510
Dominique Pozo: Big strengths that you've come through from everything all the difficulties that you've experienced and moved through what are two really

372
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.470
Dominique Pozo: Positive strengths that you've walked, walked away with

373
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.600
Dominique Pozo: That you carry now.

374
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:56.910
Erika Romero: The ability to appreciate myself and and the courage to move on with each situation that comes about one step at a time.

375
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.780
Dominique Pozo: One step at a time. That's great. Yeah, that's such a

376
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.330
Dominique Pozo: Big one to get.

377
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.340
Erika Romero: Here.

378
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:10.320
Dominique Pozo: So,

379
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.900
Dominique Pozo: What do you think is the next step, thinking one step at a time. What's the next step with

380
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.320
Dominique Pozo: Improving your dynamic with your husband.

381
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:27.900
Erika Romero: I think personally I'm not much like I said I'm not much of a talker.

382
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.880
Erika Romero: Because I have to really think about what I say is I am an asshole.

383
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.710
Erika Romero: It's so bad.

384
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:49.860
Erika Romero: Things come out of my mouth, it really shouldn't. And I don't think about them. So I think more than anything. It's just being able to find the ability and the words to use to be able to talk to him and express

385
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.900
Erika Romero: How I feel what I'm thinking and how it affects me

386
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:03.060
Erika Romero: And I think that's, that's one of the things that I'm really gonna have to work on, because I don't know.

387
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.300
Erika Romero: Me, I just, I think.

388
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:22.830
Erika Romero: I think more than anything that I've learned just to be a brick wall. You know what I mean, understand, you know, and kind of just let things bounce off of me, you know. And I mean, and just move on and and go on to the next thing. And, okay, well, whatever, you know,

389
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:24.600
Erika Romero: But

390
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:37.170
Erika Romero: I really have to be able to talk to people and an express because me personally it's easier for me to talk to you out of my life than daft sit down and speak with you.

391
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:50.940
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah so that that's something we can work on if you're if you're open and you want to we can work on more compassionate communication skills and you and I can do some role playing and work on it and I'm going to bring it into group next week to, I think,

392
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.550
Dominique Pozo: It will be helpful for everyone back

393
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.780
Erika Romero: Sounds good.

394
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:59.310
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. So let's, um, do you want to look at our calendar.

395
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.910
Dominique Pozo: This is actually a, let's see.

396
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.040

397
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:17.520
Dominique Pozo: So next, next week. I can see you on Wednesday. Again, and I think a good time.

399
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.290

402
00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:45.000
