Yeah.

14
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, how much sleep. Are you getting

15
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.670
JESSICA G: Have been sleeping like Brad for the past couple of days.

16
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what are we thinking that's caused by what are your guesses.

17
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.910
JESSICA G: I don't know.

18
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.290
JESSICA G: Idea.

19
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it I can't fall asleep or it's I do. And then I wake up and can't go back to sleep. What's the sleep pattern will think

20
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.330
I'm

21
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.290
JESSICA G: I'm like half awake half asleep.

22
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Like all

23
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that lack of sleep is going to

24
00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably contribute to more intense emotions when they come, you're aware of that kind of keeping that in mind, that's going to feel more intense.

25
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you might be irritable. You're going to feel more irritable. When you're sad. You might feel more sad and an anxious, you might feel afraid. Okay, so it's going to dial that up.

26
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I just get the sense that there's something else going on. I can't quite put my finger on it.

27
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said everything's kind of good. I'm just wondering if there's been something on your mind.

28
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.370
No.

29
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.540
JESSICA G: Not that everything's good been a, it's been a high week for me.

30
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So your mood has been what

31
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.600
JESSICA G: Happy

32
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What's been going on.

33
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.130
JESSICA G: I've just been working and

34
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me all about it.

35
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.680
JESSICA G: Yeah, I've been. I've been working with my grandparents and then with the other company.

36
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.440
JESSICA G: Pretty cool.

37
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, and what are you thinking about your clients.

38
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.100
JESSICA G: They're, they're nice they're nice I have such good luck.

39
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.400
JESSICA G: Yeah, I have really good luck with with that.

40
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.860
JESSICA G: Thankfully,

41
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so feeling happy. So while you're at work. You're with people that are nice and what are you noticing so far because part of I think this process has been

42
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention to your intuition. When you see signs, maybe talking on the phone or business practices or whether it's at work or even in relationship.

43
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That you tune in and honor your intuition. So what are some things that you've either likes that your intuition is messaging or cutting down on the back of back burner. Like, I'm going to keep an eye on this.

44
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.800
JESSICA G: Um,

45
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.460
JESSICA G: Let's see something that I kept on the backburner was that, um,

46
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:22.110
JESSICA G: On Friday when I went to the client's house. I got there and the clay has like two little kids and not boyfriend and stuff and

47
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:36.360
JESSICA G: And so when I went in there, they were still sleeping, but he told me to just start on the dishes and the dishes were awful like they were the whole family's dishes.

48
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I don't like it.

49
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, not a maid.

50
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, okay. So that's confusing, tell me that's back burner. So tell me the thought. That's the image that's the memory. What's your thought about. That's the whole family's dishes.

51
00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.340
JESSICA G: Just

52
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.690
JESSICA G: To keep it on the back burner and make sure to document it in case you know it gets worse.

53
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.160
JESSICA G: But then I met the people and they're really nice people and you know it's it's

54
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.860
JESSICA G: It's not that big a deal.

55
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know it's just me. So you can say it's a big deal if you want to, to don't deprive yourself of that option.

56
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's just see

57
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not in the front burner because just a new job. I like the people I just started. So it's not front burner. It's back burner for lots of different reasons, right.

58
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to document.

59
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.000
JESSICA G: It.

60
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what right what I think happens every time. How will it become front burner topic.

61
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.110
JESSICA G: I'm

62
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.100
JESSICA G: Just if they expect more from me.

63
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.870
JESSICA G: You know,

64
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, because I don't know what more is I don't even know what the job description is once you tell me what is what's the actual job.

65
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.520
JESSICA G: Like housekeeping.

66
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.850
JESSICA G: Grooming

67
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.600
JESSICA G: And meal prep, stuff like that.

68
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so it's, it actually doesn't surprise you that

69
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That those dishes are there you are troubled by light housekeeping for one person, but this is clearly, you know, four or five additions from a meal that was more than just one person right

70
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:58.710
JESSICA G: Okay. And so, yeah, like I said, like say she's like, Oh, I need to do laundry or something like that, then

71
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:09.330
JESSICA G: And then it's like, not just her clothes, the little kids clothes and both the little kids. And you know what I mean, like, that'll be an issue. Well, I don't know, because

72
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:29.250
JESSICA G: I don't know because she can't she's I don't know exactly. They didn't tell me what exactly what's wrong with her but I kind of got the gist of it from what the boyfriend was telling me, and she had her spleen and her gallbladder removed and stuff.

73
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.810
JESSICA G: And so she's always like sick or something, I don't know.

74
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.680
JESSICA G: But that was just something that, you know, I kept on the back burner and

75
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.440
JESSICA G: if something else comes up and you know

76
00:08:48.630 --> 00:09:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So how I'm just curious, your, your organization is billing. This is a medical service. In other words, you're providing a service that is built through her insurance. Is that correct,

77
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.590
JESSICA G: Yes.

78
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it called What's the service you're providing

79
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:11.070
JESSICA G: A home health care home care ager home health carried or something like that.

80
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I would want to know.

81
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would really want to know what the, the actual tasks are

82
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It might boost your confidence around

83
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:44.940
JESSICA G: It's different with each patient like with some patients there and mobile. So you have to go and you have to, like, change the diapers. You have to bake them and with other patients. It's just, you know, like light housekeeping because they cannot move around.

84
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.610
JESSICA G: As much

85
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you keyed in on is in and of itself laundry and cleaning dishes is fine. It's just, I'm not the whole family's made. I wonder how

86
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder how you'll make a decision down the line to either push the topic.

87
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And discuss it or maybe you'll make a decision. It's not worth it. I like this job. And what difference does it make to me, I'll just do it. You're, you're gonna have to run that line, only you will know where it's being crossed, but you'll know

88
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.190
Mm hmm.

89
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now it's on the back burner.

90
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:30.120
JESSICA G: And I really, I honestly like it's it's therapeutic for me to clean and

91
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:42.330
JESSICA G: You know, and just the and then I'm proud of my job because it's, it can. I can take like a really messy kitchen and and make it clean and pretty, so

92
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's rewarding.

93
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.760
JESSICA G: Yeah yeah

94
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweet. And was there a sense of gratitude from that family as well.

95
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:55.980
JESSICA G: There was

96
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. And how about the home health part

97
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there some sponge bathing. Is there any of that sort of calming hair washing hair cleaning any of that.

98
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.000
JESSICA G: Now with that patient.

99
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:18.060
JESSICA G: Okay, now with that patient. She's, she's capable of doing it herself. Um, there the my patient before that.

100
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:27.060
JESSICA G: You might need assistance, especially the day that I went she had just gotten out of surgery or something. He said, and

101
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.090
JESSICA G: They did something to her kidneys. I didn't really understand, but I guess she had like a really bad.

102
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:46.020
JESSICA G: UTI. And so with her. I'm gonna have to probably sponge later.

103
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that like a okay or what's your thought about that.

104
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Not as rewarding as cleaning a kitchen.

105
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.630
JESSICA G: No.

106
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, some people like it. They think, you know, like that hands on kind of thing.

107
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so here's what I heard. Though I heard that my client likes working

108
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not notice you've been happier.

109
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. This week I've been happy. So you, it sounds like have enjoyed getting back in that groove.

110
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What about where intuition and sort of relaxed vigilance, you can have a relaxed body, but you can stay kind of aware

111
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what's going on around you. What about in the work. People the administrative staff and their business practices because you've got taken advantage of last time there is unequivocal truth in that.

112
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to just tune in there and say, what are you doing differently to make sure it doesn't happen again.

113
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.770
JESSICA G: I don't know. I'm just being more vigilant, I guess.

114
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.120
JESSICA G: This company seems seems a lot more legit.

115
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how

116
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:28.080

117
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: One there. So that's one

118
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.930
JESSICA G: That's a huge difference.

119
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: hello and how are they paying you is it cash or with it with an actual check with the business name on it. Like, how, how is this going

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.440
JESSICA G: My mom kind of

129
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.250
JESSICA G: Did this thing where

130
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.160
JESSICA G: Because I was under family plan with her and her boyfriend.

131
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.850
JESSICA G: And me and she was like

132
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:46.680
JESSICA G: I had spoken to her about another a deal that they had excuse me with my cable company, um, for their mobile service. And she was like, Well, why don't you do that and I'll pay the the the down payment and everything. And that way you can start building your credit up

133
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:55.110
JESSICA G: But basically to like get me off the line announced, like, Yeah, you know, whatever. If you're buying me a new phone.

134
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:03.030
JESSICA G: So I called and I got the new phone. I used to a card to pay it, and then

135
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.990

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

143
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.110
Gotcha.

144
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a bit. Let's take another look at I'm half sleep.

145
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

146
00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: See

147
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: notes here.

148
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not aware of anything, any thoughts that were going on.

149
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:21.210
JESSICA G: No, like all get up and it's weird. I'll wake up because I need to go pee and then not all stand the restroom for like

150
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:38.730
JESSICA G: Hours is dozing in and out of sleep and and i like on my phone. And I'm like, what am I doing like I'm supposed to be asleep and I get it, I get like frustrated with myself and I, you know, wash my hands and everything and go lay down and then

151
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:45.930
JESSICA G: Just stuff like that or like all of a sudden, I'll catch myself like sitting up

152
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

153
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.470
JESSICA G: And then whenever I do finally get comfortable.

154
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.650
JESSICA G: The baby is like cuz he sleeps with us.

155
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:09.150
JESSICA G: So the babies like has his foot in my face or the fans in my face.

156
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.710
JESSICA G: He's a wild sleeper. He needs his own bed.

157
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, well. Now, a lot of families have different opinions on that. He needs his own bed, what's your approach to the age when that happens, like, what, what's your approach on it.

158
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:35.880
JESSICA G: I think what I'm trying to work towards honestly is me and him getting us getting a two bedroom and me and him getting our own room.

159
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:36.750
Okay.

160
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So you're thinking about, hey, this income is making you think maybe a go. Go get your own place.

161
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.070
JESSICA G: Not my own place just my own room.

162
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.300
JESSICA G: You know, yeah.

163
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.870
JESSICA G: I just need my own space. I don't know.

164
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:55.950
I can't you

165
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, not your own place. So you still want to live with the boyfriend.

166
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.670
JESSICA G: Yeah.

167
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.910
JESSICA G: Yeah, I mean, it'll be easier. I'm both the list.

168
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.620
JESSICA G: You know,

169
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I believe.

170
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, you're in a one bedroom. Is that right,

171
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.370
JESSICA G: A LOFT you

172
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Okay, so do you want to set that as a goal, like something. Okay. Yeah. So we'll put gold.

173
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Okay. So in your own words, what do you want to do.

174
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.490
JESSICA G: I want to move into a bigger place and get my own room. Okay.

175
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Bigger place.

176
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This my own

177
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: In my own room or my own bedroom or like what

178
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.300
JESSICA G: Yeah, my own bedroom.

179
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Bedroom

180
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.450
Okay.

181
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if just now you just discovered what's keeping you awake.

182
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it is you get to be alone on the toilet, right, because no time as anybody, I'd be sitting on there with you.

183
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a nice alone time and you're sitting up. Whereas in the past. There's been some this experience of when you're laying down right there's

184
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe some some history that hasn't always been perfect about it and there's kid a little kid foot in your face. And what about. Tell me about what kind of a sleeper your boyfriend is over there.

185
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.190
JESSICA G: She's a really heavy sleeper like he doesn't

186
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.120
JESSICA G: Hear anything, anything like that.

187
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Do you like that about him or not like that about him.

188
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.510
JESSICA G: I mean, it's fine. He doesn't complain about me.

189
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.730
JESSICA G: That's good.

190
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:03.390
JESSICA G: I'll be up at all hours of the night watching TV and he doesn't say anything. So that's cool.

191
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:05.430
JESSICA G: So,

192
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been hearing more and more about

193
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That

194
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: backlit stuff of our TVs in our, in our phones and our computers and that that hour before bed for for sleep hygiene.

195
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That we rather than pull up YouTube video and movie that we pull up a magazine and a book. And we actually sort of sit in a chair. We read there. And then we make bed just for sleeping.

196
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense.

197
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might be inconvenient because maybe we're used to watching TV in bed and that last hours watching TV, but I'm thinking, you might want to play with some other slut sleep hygiene techniques.

198
00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your sleep is interesting because you're tired, obviously you're able to sort of doze off in the restroom. But then you notice you're sitting up in bed you talking about watching you know TV if you picked up a book. What do you have around it. You could pick up

199
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.190
JESSICA G: The Bible but I've actually okay so

200
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:28.710
JESSICA G: I've been trying that for the past few days. Now like I don't turn the TV on anymore okay because I noticed that

201
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.420
JESSICA G: The baby doesn't sleep.

202
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.490
JESSICA G: He's dawn if there's anything you want sleep.

203
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.600
JESSICA G: And that means I don't sleep and so

204
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:50.760
JESSICA G: Like I've made it to where when we go to bed. It's everything's off and you know we're laying down

205
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.650
JESSICA G: So it's been like that for the past few days and he goes to sleep, but now I can see

206
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So notice, I know I've asked before about reading materials and I know you mentioned the Bible but

207
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If you look at it more like I want to read something that sort of sends the message that it's time for me to go to sleep. This is, this is what the wind down. It's not deep thinking you see where is that the Bible requires a lot of thinking and analysis and it might bring up big topics.

208
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is a little fantasy. You know, so fiction book or something might have a different

209
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Mindset. Do you have anything around or something you can pick up. What do you have

210
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.310
JESSICA G: I have a large selection.

211
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But I haven't heard about one what you got.

212
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.080
Oh,

213
00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:03.240
JESSICA G: I don't know, there's like the I don't know them by name. There's one that I didn't finish reading. It's about the dash Acacia

214
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

215
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.940
JESSICA G: Okay, sure. That was

216
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.180
JESSICA G: Pretty interesting. I didn't like it because I'm

217
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.860
JESSICA G: Like they took her away her father's older and she was a little girl, and they sent her to this like

218
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.740
JESSICA G: Madam, or something like that. And I, I didn't like it.

219
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh you've picked a topic that you know

220
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You know for some might say there's a sexual exploitation here of another human. So I'm not sure that's going to be your best go to book.

221
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, maybe picking something

222
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.810
JESSICA G: Something else like it.

223
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:59.670
JESSICA G: Something else. Yeah, I have a habit of buying books. And I'm like, Okay, I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it. And I just, it's just not the same anymore as when I was younger. When I was younger I could knock out books like one a day. And now I can't

224
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.500
Yeah.

225
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So what else

226
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you have a ton of books in there. What's

227
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What's in there.

228
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:11.550
JESSICA G: Um,

229
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.920
JESSICA G: I would have to go grab them.

230
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll pick one that you're trying to that's not

231
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That feels neutral.

232
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Not emotionally provoking but neutral.

233
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.020
JESSICA G: Well, the ones I like

234
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you like

235
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your style.

236
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.340
JESSICA G: Chapter chapters.

237
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:22.290
JESSICA G: It's called an enchantment of rabid ravens I read like where am I

238
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.310
JESSICA G: Like on Chapter two.

239
00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you like about it.

240
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.510
JESSICA G: No chapter three.

241
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.260
JESSICA G: I'm just said it's like

242
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:49.620
JESSICA G: The girl falls in love with somebody. SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO AND HE HAS HE HAS magical powers.

243
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.080
JESSICA G: And then this is the memoir of the geisha one

244
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:57.810
JESSICA G: Yeah.

245
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, maybe. For now, that might not be go to

246
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe enchantment of a raven maybe that one that sense of that personality of defiance and sort of getting in touch with the juice of knowing one's own vision and, you know, I kind of like that idea.

247
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: selfishly wanting that kind of for you. You know what I mean.

248
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get back to this goal. I feel like we're getting some pieces together here. I want to move into a bigger place with my own bedroom. Now that's the goal now every day you can be doing some small thing to get you there. So sometimes it's every day I will

249
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Reduce one extra spending thing from my shopping list or it might be every paycheck. I'll have automatically transferred such and such amount of money. So for you.

250
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think of something that you need to do more of or less of what could you be doing that eventually we'll get to that goal.

251
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.290
JESSICA G: Well,

252
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.080
JESSICA G: The apartments there.

253
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.940
JESSICA G: Um,

254
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:28.200
JESSICA G: I guess I could put more pressure on Ramon, because since he works for the company and they told him to just give his 30 days and we can move into the apartment.

255
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:45.810
JESSICA G: And I haven't been putting pressure, like I haven't been pressuring him to talk to them because I don't think it'll be the same if he talks to them. They kill get half of the rip off, you know, so we won't even have that big of an expense in the rent and

256
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.480
JESSICA G: BUT I KNOW IF I DON'T PRESSURE him if or if I don't like tell him to do it that he will

257
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it about him that he can get the better deal.

258
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.230
JESSICA G: Because he works for the company.

259
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah. Oh, I see. Now does he has he done something like this before.

260
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.040
JESSICA G: Yeah, but I was behind it like

261
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Strings. Yeah. Um, so what's interesting is, so he has the connection but you have the communication skills to pull the strings.

262
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: To get him to say so. So what I'm on this is what you say this is what you do if they say this and you can explain kind of how to get this lower deal this lower amount right

263
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.440
JESSICA G: And at first, like it was, it was like

264
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:46.950
JESSICA G: Um,

265
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.640
JESSICA G: How can I explain it like at first he was just he wasn't taking me too seriously.

266
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.500
JESSICA G: But then my brother, but then I talked to my older brother.

267
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.350
JESSICA G: And he was like, Yeah, well, because he works for the same company and

268
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:19.950
JESSICA G: He kind of talked to him and told him, Hey, you know what, like it's a good idea. You guys are paying less for you guys will pay less for two bedroom, even if you pay full price, you know, all of that. So I'm

269
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.140
JESSICA G: Just this is what you're going to tell them you're going to tell them that

270
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:36.180
JESSICA G: You want to move out because the stairs. Because you guys have outgrown the apartment and the stairs are too dangerous for the baby. He's already fallen down

271
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I see you to leverage the baby.

272
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.010
JESSICA G: Yeah.

273
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: safety, safety, safety.

274
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.790
JESSICA G: Which I mean as an ally.

275
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.230
JESSICA G: But

276
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an it's an hair extension of the truth.

277
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.900
JESSICA G: Yeah yeah yeah

278
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.640
JESSICA G: Even alone, and he

279
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:13.050
JESSICA G: And he did it. And he did it. The very next day after my brother talked to him. The very next day he did it. But then I asked him the other day. Hey, well, so what's up. Did you give it 30 days. What's going on with that and he said that he hasn't seen the property manager.

280
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.020
JESSICA G: Which is alive because how do you work together and not see to

281
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Have no idea, not even getting in that one.

282
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So I put a month. But you tell me on the target date. When do you want to be able to have the money and have everything set up was a goal that you have, what would be a date.

283
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.500
JESSICA G: I would say

284
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.580
JESSICA G: May 20

285
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's what I have. Okay. Okay.

286
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:02.430
Sounds good.

287
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright and obstacles that will get in the way. What are some barriers that might make getting is it moved in, or by five. What am I getting the way

288
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.160
JESSICA G: I don't know. Just us lagging

289
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

290
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.050
JESSICA G: Or the apartment, not being available anymore.

291
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:39.900
JESSICA G: Right now.

292
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I love that. Wait.

293
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So how does that feel to have texted him right in the moment. As soon as you thought of it.

294
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it

295
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

296
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So you notice that you're the one pulling the strings. Right. You're the one operating the puppet.

297
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.110
JESSICA G: He said, I'm doing it right now. All

298
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:10.740
Right.

299
00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.970
JESSICA G: Cheers. I'm tired of those

300
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And you share this other apartment doesn't have stairs.

301
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.850
JESSICA G: Well, it's on the second floor.

302
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.590
JESSICA G: Okay, but

303
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.640
JESSICA G: I won't be having to go up and down stairs all day.

304
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.750
JESSICA G: doing housework and stuff.

305
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.020
JESSICA G: Okay, so you said about me pulling the strings.

306
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what does that say about your, your sense of self confidence, your sense of self, trust your sense of identity and self esteem. What do you think that says about who you are, that you're able to

307
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what to do.

308
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.520
JESSICA G: I've just had to assume that role.

309
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.110
JESSICA G: Because he's used to his mom doing it.

310
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:18.210
JESSICA G: So now that responsibility has fallen on me I have to call and make a

311
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.990
JESSICA G: doctor appointment dentist appointments

312
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.630
JESSICA G: Like if I don't do it. He won't go or he won't make them himself but

313
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:31.590
JESSICA G: Now I've gotten to the point where it's like

314
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:46.680
JESSICA G: Like for example, I was the one that had to ensure the car, otherwise it wouldn't have happen right you know I'm I've gotten to the point where I tell him like you need to do this by yourself. I'm sorry, but I don't know how else

315
00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:54.720
JESSICA G: To. I don't know how else he's gonna learn, you know, because that's the way I learned

316
00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:06.510
JESSICA G: And so I just tell me you have to do these things on your own sheets talked about getting on the on the phone line with me and getting a new phone. And I was like okay well call

317
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:17.100
JESSICA G: And he didn't. He was like, No, I'll call later something you wanted me to call and I'm not gonna do it. I told them. Okay.

318
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:18.960
JESSICA G: No.

319
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.650
JESSICA G: You're not going to get a new phone and

320
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:24.930
JESSICA G: You know,

321
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

322
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:27.630
So,

323
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

324
00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If you get impatient, much like his mother did you taking her place. You know, inadvertently we don't mean to but we end up reinforcing

325
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That

326
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Non action. So his not taking responsibility in a sense you and mom are reinforcing it by coming up behind him and scheduling it

327
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And he just has to wait.

328
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Till you guys can't take it anymore.

329
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all he has to do is just wait.

330
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So this will be interesting to see where your conviction is on whether you're willing

331
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: To wait it out, he if he doesn't feel the inconvenience of it. Why, why would. Why would any of us really I don't want to do those things, either.

332
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Not if I know if I wait another couple weeks, somebody's going to do it for me. I'm going to wait. I'm just going to

333
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Somehow fix it.

334
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you can tolerate that.

335
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Then he might just learn the inconvenience. It's not worth it anymore. Maybe he can go faces fear, whether it's confrontation or something like that. I don't know. You think that's it.

336
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:48.720
Yes.

337
00:36:50.580 --> 00:37:01.200
JESSICA G: Yes, and see when he first got here. Like, I tried so hard to because like the first few days he was crying every day.

338
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:09.930
JESSICA G: He would cry and you know he was really like it was hard on him the move. He's never been away from his mom.

339
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.520
JESSICA G: I'm solo, the first

340
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:31.980
JESSICA G: Few months I tried to make it as comfortable for him as possible. I was really attentive to him, like, you know, like I was just grateful that he even came like he took the responsibility and, you know,

341
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.940
JESSICA G: And I wasn't getting anything back like he wasn't

342
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.500
JESSICA G: Seeing all that effort that I was putting in the normally I wouldn't

343
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:57.480
JESSICA G: And so I feel like a lot of that's where a lot of those admin comes from, like, when he first got here. I literally grabbed him by the hand took him to this place where he works at and

344
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:09.030
JESSICA G: I had to stand there and watch them felt application because they told them all. Bring it back whenever you're done. And so we she was about to start heading out the door tone and they'll fill it out right here and talk to the people.

345
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.950
JESSICA G: Like literally like

346
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.350
JESSICA G: You know, so

347
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jessica, you have an older son. It's what you have

348
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:20.340
JESSICA G: Yes.

349
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think there's a part of you that knew that was going to be the deal.

350
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Just between you and me. We don't have to tell anybody else, but you probably on some level, you were happy to just have him and and that that's okay too.

351
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean you end up kind of wanting more. And there is more to a relationship than that. And when that comes up. If it does, well then, okay, fine, but this is what you want for now. Okay, fine, but you don't get to beat yourself up for it.

352
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And

353
00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you got you got someone who you basically said, I will take on the role of parent

354
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Mommy.

355
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you won't be surprised that he's acting like a baby.

356
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But another part of being a parent is what you did with the application.

357
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Are you say no. I believe in you. You can do it now and you go outside. He stays in there and fills it out himself. It's like, like we would a kid, we would say, well,

358
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This is we would role play and we say this is how we do it. And I think you can do this piece of it. Let's at least set the appointment. And so we progressively give more and more responsibilities. So for him, if you want to be.

359
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You know the one not having to do everything you could kind of

360
00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it incrementally. Well, can you start with making the call, at least start with the schedule. I'll follow it up with blah blah but it would mean a lot to me if you would do this one piece and this is what I would say to I'm just assuming he doesn't know what to say. Because he may not

361
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But just now. So maybe he did you think he already knew what to say to the owner

362
00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.510
JESSICA G: I'm, I'm pretty sure because my brother told him what to say.

363
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so someone else took that on and said this is what she say oh the baby you know he's that risk taking the stairs and so gave him some. But notice how someone needed to give him the skill and what to say how to leverage something to try and

364
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, be persuasive a persuasive argument.

365
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

366
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If you let that in Jessica and say this is this is the man he is

367
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And not fight it.

368
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it won't be a resentment, like if you can say, I kind of knew this was going to be the gig.

369
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And so slowly, I will talk with him and say, you know what

370
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to be in charge of all of our annual exams.

371
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever made one to wonder how I navigate that conversation, what I have, I have to have my insurance card with me at the time because they're probably going to ask me if my insurance has changed. That's what I tend to do

372
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have an appointment book and I can cross check and make sure that it's no less than a year. That way it stays free there's little things that we do.

373
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That we take for granted because we've been doing it for years.

374
00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But he won't know those things. And so he may pop up and say, I don't have time you you've got all this time you go do it. I already work. And so what can happen is they might

375
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Pop up and act like it's nothing but a thing. But really they're insecure and they just never done it.

376
00:41:51.120 --> 00:42:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can give them an out by kind of saying you know that when I the first time I did it. These I was kind of uncertain, but they're actually pretty friendly and this is what they're expecting and these are the things

377
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

378
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:08.460
JESSICA G: I think it just frustrates me like that's the problem with my cousin, you remember I was telling you about my cousin.

379
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.270
JESSICA G: I just get frustrated because

380
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.220
JESSICA G: I don't know I don't know I

381
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:29.010
JESSICA G: My mom has always made sure that she was like, No, you can't. You calling you do this or you do that by yourself and like you know

382
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.750
JESSICA G: And

383
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:38.490
JESSICA G: She felt like she was like shoes, she tried her best.

384
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.120
JESSICA G: To make me like, you know, but

385
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.950
JESSICA G: So it's frustrating to me because

386
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.520
JESSICA G: Like their mom means like holding their hands and stuff. And they're still acting

387
00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica. It can be a mixture

388
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Like maybe a part wanting to be baby ourselves. I want that baby and I want to have to rely on someone like that it can be that and like that's not good for cousin to learn independence. It can be a really complex experience. And if it's a cousin that

389
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The one you talked about in the previous session. That's this whole other layer of

390
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Cheat is not being held accountable and now you're babying her It's just. Now it's really complicated.

391
00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

392
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:38.400
JESSICA G: Now, I was living with that Auntie, and she had moved out.

393
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.210
JESSICA G: And she likes sabotage.

394
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:59.760
JESSICA G: It was weird. Who's your she was weird. It was like she sabotage to me being there, you know, and I was getting really close to my auntie. I was helping her out a lot. And then she started coming around more and

395
00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:14.760
JESSICA G: Like she stirred up so much drama that I was to the point where I literally from one minute to the next. I told my brother, I need to get out of here, his girlfriend went and picked me up all the way to grovel

396
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:22.320
JESSICA G: from Albuquerque. And I left that same night cuz I was like, I'm not going to do this.

397
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you uncomfortable giving me the cousin's name for some reason. Are you ready to do that. Or it's still bringing some negative feelings up

398
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about saying the name does something that just saying, but even saying cousin is progress because originally it was, I don't want to say, right, notice

399
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, I don't want to say who it is. And then on your own last session. By the way, I didn't have to even encourage it. You did it on your own on your terms.

400
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So all I'm saying is, I know you don't even have to tell me or you could you know that you could make up a name, and I wouldn't know the difference. Right. You do realize that

401
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Only reason why I say it is because when the she's she she sabotage. I could be thinking it's on t see so I don't know my she's I don't need my know my pronouns.

402
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the only reason why I like to know the players.

403
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The name itself. So that's all you don't even have to tell me which is pay attention to your body as I even brought it up just well I do. I don't want to. Or yeah, why am I not telling her, or just kind of pay attention to you on your terms. You get to decide okay

404
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.490
JESSICA G: And it's crazy because, like, all this is coming up now when it didn't before.

405
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:47.760
JESSICA G: Like before, like, you know, we were so close. And I had this mentality where

406
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.020
JESSICA G: Like I just forgave them.

407
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.720
JESSICA G: And now I'm pissed off.

408
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.180
JESSICA G: Now I'm pissed off for myself.

409
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:08.100
JESSICA G: And

410
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.400
JESSICA G: I'm okay with that, you know,

411
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's part of this reprocessing and therapy. What if it was I forgave before I was angry. What if I forgave before I was sad. What if I forgave before I worked through it.

412
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean you can't have acceptance. Right. It doesn't mean you can't get to that I can hang out with these people and not be like want to scratch our eyes out. I think you probably you can get there, but there may have been missed grief.

413
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be causing resentment and that might be what we're doing is I'm bringing as I bring up that old stuff. It might be coming up to the surface. Do you think that's what's happening.

414
00:46:56.550 --> 00:47:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah. Okay. Do you like a de

415
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:06.840
JESSICA G: Yeah, I didn't even give my myself a chance to, you know,

416
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.320
JESSICA G: To be mad being angry.

417
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.700
JESSICA G: So,

418
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How could you you've been having to to be with so much scarcity and you're being told.

419
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not enough. We don't have enough. There's barely enough. You're scrounging for this and you're getting by with just the bare minimum, how on earth would a young woman or a little girl think there's any room for you to be angry.

420
00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You had every reason to think if I'm angry. Everyone will leave me.

421
00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If I stand up for myself everything all my resources were disappear. Is that a possibility.

422
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:53.640
JESSICA G: Yeah.

423
00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.730
JESSICA G: But it happened anyway so

424
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I tried it the other way, they forget left me anyway.

425
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.390
Yeah.

426
00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:07.980
JESSICA G: Yeah.

427
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a perfect thought. Yep.

428
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I like this one right now, someone said to me.

429
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: at a pivotal concept that really made the difference for them, this, this, I've been playing with it to just to see if I like it. See if you like this one.

430
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm going to be 40 someday.

431
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you are going to be someday.

432
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I picked for you because you're a young one for me, it's going to be 60 someday.

433
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to be 40 someday. So sit with that for just a second. Just gonna be mean.

434
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not gonna not gonna die. I'm going to be here, raising my, my little boy, I'm going to be 40 someday.

435
00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I want to be doing.

436
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I might as well get started on it. Now I'm gonna be 40 anyway. I might as well have invested in this. And in this. What are those things, Jessica, you want to invest in, because you're gonna be there. Anyway, what do you want in the rearview mirror. What do you want to have invested

437
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:28.950
JESSICA G: Mainly, my son.

438
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.490
JESSICA G: And I catch myself.

439
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:41.250
JESSICA G: Saying that like thinking something similar to that like

440
00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.150
JESSICA G: Like I'm never going to get this moment back

441
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That is true.

442
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:54.630
JESSICA G: And so I try to make the best of it for him.

443
00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:04.380
JESSICA G: Like yesterday, every time. He's been throwing fits. When we go to my grandma's because he wants to be outside

444
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

445
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:14.550
JESSICA G: So, yesterday I wasn't on the clock. I just was hanging out over there. I told my ground might help her make and by analysis and

446
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:32.100
JESSICA G: My son wanted to go outside. So I stayed outside with him and I just followed him around, and you know he wanted to go up and down and up and down and yeah and I just for like a couple of hours. I should, you know,

447
00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.060
JESSICA G: Up and down, following him around, and then

448
00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.500
JESSICA G: He was happy it was worth it to see him happy.

449
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:47.100
That's right.

450
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to see your son.

451
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Get everything he needs.

452
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You can feel the difference

453
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you can see all my son's happy and although it might be a tedious task for you. That's the investment you would like to see

454
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the stuff that was not given to you.

455
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You are giving it to him.

456
00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, keep doing it while it's working.

457
00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. It feels it does feel the soul to give what we did not get. There's no getting around it.

458
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.230
JESSICA G: But, um,

459
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.090
JESSICA G: I've been pretty upset, though, because

460
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.700
JESSICA G: I feel like he's

461
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.180
JESSICA G: He shouldn't be angry when he gets angry.

462
00:51:47.280 --> 00:52:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, okay. I know I got you. So, so I feel what you're you're making up a story about his dialing up of anger. So what are you making up that what is that saying about you as a mama. What is that saying about what does that do, what do you do in there and what you do in your head.

463
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.570
JESSICA G: Like what

464
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.710
JESSICA G: I got, what did I miss what did I miss like

465
00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

466
00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Here. Okay.

467
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are thinking that anger is a sign of what

468
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Can she do

469
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to come true. Just because you tell your therapist, you might as well say it out. You're having it in your head. It might be keeping you awake. Honey, it's going to be something else. And if it is, will face it together and your it's going to be fine. But name it you, I got you.

470
00:52:55.740 --> 00:53:00.990
JESSICA G: Like what if they did something to him and I didn't know about it.

471
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. What if they touched my little boy. Is that what you're trying to say.

472
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. All right. Hey, I got you. I know that's what you think I know what those tears are

473
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It is your worst nightmare and I get that.

474
00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we said we said it out loud. So what you said was the story you're telling yourself as he's angry when we go want to go to Grandma's and it's because we get cooped up inside of grandmas.

475
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's what you told me, but she said something else.

476
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's someone's touching him over there and I haven't been seeing the signs. Well then, can't do anything about those moments you can have that heightened awareness, your heads, not in the sand. You just said it out loud. So what would be some signs.

477
00:53:54.570 --> 00:54:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we were outside at grandma's and this fret was still there. Or we could draw a picture. Here's what it's like to be at grandma's. What's the feeling you have when your grandma's and it's a feeling, and he draws a picture. Okay.

478
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you can be his little therapist that a mom is in everything. It's our spiritual leaders, our teacher therapists his dad, his mom. It's everything a mom isn't everything. Okay.

479
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. But when you're terrified of it, you're not going to want to draw a picture because you're not going to want to know the truth.

480
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So you step into that awareness. Why don't you rule it out. We could draw have a little, a little picture. Let's see what it looks like. What's the feeling AT MOMMY'S house and you draw a picture and let him draw

481
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Because kids want to play. Let's play us sock puppets or I don't know what, there's lots of different ways to use play but kids language or not is someone touching you.

482
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Kids want to play. That's how children communicators. They do it through play so he's communicating something

483
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we can we can just if you have the courage to sit with that that's going to be how the information is going to be exchanged then he'll feel it that my mom's feeling confident and and it's safe for me to share because kids can pick up on five their parents not able to write

484
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear this information. So then there's play maybe we can do finger painting and what colors, does he pick for this one. What does he do you know he's too. Right. Yeah. Okay.

485
00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's some crayons and let's draw a picture of the feeling. Let's do happy. Oh, you draw a picture of happy.

486
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say where is that, where do you feel happiest oh damn house or when I'm with my stuff my stuff my little stuff. Damn. Well, what about sad. Let's what colors that are and he draws that one.

487
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can say where is that that's, I don't get my apple juice. Yeah, can you get that much communication.

488
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.930
JESSICA G: Yeah, he's trying

489
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.250
JESSICA G: He's trying so hard to put his words together.

490
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so, but you so it has to right so developmental that might be a little advanced. We got to pull it back even further. So I'm

491
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be he might first learn the names of emotions. It might be starting a little slower learning and learning what an emotion is this is happy.

492
00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We're playing. So when you're planning to say I'm feeling happy. Are you feeling happy or smiling were giggling. That's the emotion happy. How are you feeling

493
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that IKEA or Lord for relaxed or whatever happy as I only know a few Spanish words I use it does help chunky like think is chill.

494
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Investment mucho.

495
00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: From us long as

496
00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But, um, maybe it's there, it's like, Okay, and let's have those words so that we can communicate so that he can communicate

497
00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: On his frustration. Okay, so let's come back. I know my next client will be here but you just shared something really fragile and important, so tune it go back into the body.

498
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some breathing.

499
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So nice belly breaths.

500
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see see that the bodies. Okay.

501
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You live through a thought of the worst thing and you are okay.

502
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: No danger. What he's judging you. Nobody's coming at you with any violence or aggression. You're just all you did was have a thought you had a perceived thought and scary maybe and sad and you are okay.

503
00:57:59.250 --> 00:57:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we moved

504
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Up in the neck.

505
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:04.110
Yeah.

506
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So the same skill that you have about

507
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get that landlord on board. It's the same brain that frame that you came up with in vivo can come up with these other ones for learning more about what's going on with son. Okay.

508
00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe we'll start with language of feeling words. This is a picture and then whenever you see him happy. You go over to the picture and you're like happy and then you show happy and he's smiling that's that's happy.

509
00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Except the Spanish word or maybe you're doing two languages, I don't know, or sad. That's sad. Are you sad when I have tears.

510
00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Get my way I'm sad.

511
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When someone teaches me or or you can teach him creepy like

512
00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, can teach and that way. What's a creepy feeling when you get around someone that you don't trust I feel creepy.

513
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but someone touches my body part, they're not supposed to only you touch those parts or you've asked your mom to help or your dad or someone you trust so you could go into that if you wanted to talk about through that creepy.

514
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that that body awareness.

515
00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

516
00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:36.330
