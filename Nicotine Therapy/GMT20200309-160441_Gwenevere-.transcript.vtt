16
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I could invite a conversation if that would expedite things for you. Just tell me what to write

17
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.930
Bethany Shadid: Oh, well I just told Jamie. She said she'd send Krista message.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.570
Bethany Shadid: bottle of water.

23
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.340
Bethany Shadid: Who

24
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.760
Bethany Shadid: Guess what I found out this week.

25
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: How many

26
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.660
Bethany Shadid: That circling

27
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.350
Bethany Shadid: The generic for so long that I've been taking forever.

28
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.300
Bethany Shadid: One of the wonderful side effects is migraines.

29
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.040
Bethany Shadid: And nobody ever talked to me about that I've just been getting imitrex forever.

30
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.430
Bethany Shadid: And it's been horrible this month.

31
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.400
Bethany Shadid: Because I haven't done birth control. And so I guess circling

32
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:39.120
Bethany Shadid: Effects that and that's why you get the migraines. So now, because I haven't had the birth control. It's made it. Well, it's just been lots of fun.

33
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are you thinking about that medicine. Do you want to, when you get connected with a provider. What do you want to do.

34
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.120
Hmm.

35
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.110
Bethany Shadid: I like it.

36
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.400
Bethany Shadid: I've tried other ones and had a

37
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.050
Bethany Shadid: Pretty severe allergic reaction.

38
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.050
Bethany Shadid: To like

39
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.540
Bethany Shadid: The Wellbutrin and Abilify so I don't mind.

40
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.320
Bethany Shadid: It's not as bad when I have the birth control, so hopefully I can get that shortly.

41
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you think about the medical status. Um, I know you've been working hard at it. What's the, what's the barrier is it can't get ahold of physician is it

42
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Timing scheduling can't reach the person I need what what's preventing you from I remember the hiccup with a psychiatrist piece. I remember that was just a pretty bad referral, it just didn't work.

43
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But what about specifically hey I need a psychiatrist, an independent contractor, a small group.

44
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.420
Bethany Shadid: Right. Well, I had a doctor appointment. This last Monday with my primary

45
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.060
Bethany Shadid: And I shared

46
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.040
Bethany Shadid: With her that I the referral. She put in didn't work.

47
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.220
Bethany Shadid: Then, and they sent me to a place where they don't manage the medication most

48
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:40.530
Bethany Shadid: She's like, Oh, I know. I was like, you know, I'm just having a really hard time getting access right to the people that I need to get, like, oh, I know she's just like, it's horrible across the board. Just get your name on the list and they'll get to you. Eventually, and it was like

49
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.550
Bethany Shadid: Okay, yeah.

50
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know

51
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just ask you

52
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if I'm calling the number on the back of the card under behavioral health and I say I need three names of psychiatrists

53
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: names and numbers that are accepting new clients. Does your insurance company call and check for you. Do they email you a list. How does it go because that's what I would be doing

54
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.870
Right.

55
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:26.250
Bethany Shadid: I hadn't done that because I haven't gotten my new card for the year yet, but I can have my old card, which I know I can call you know use that number and and I guess I can do that. I

56
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.750
Bethany Shadid: Honestly, truly.

57
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:42.780
Bethany Shadid: Put it on the back burner because my Medicaid. I'm getting my medication right circling

58
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:57.450
Bethany Shadid: That she finally approved my PCP. I see. So it got put lower on the priority list with everything in, but

59
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.480
Bethany Shadid: That's a really good idea. And I don't think about doing that.

60
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there we've got that that could be useful. It's just sort of this proactive. I'll just call myself. I'll get these names and numbers.

61
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll start, you know, a minimum of three or four names numbers call call I'll see if they're accepting new clients.

62
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:32.430
Bethany Shadid: Right, because I'm used to the way that it goes like my PCP, just put in a new way for me to see gastroenterology

63
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.770
Bethany Shadid: For

64
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.320
Bethany Shadid: The liver swelling stuff, even though you know I told her.

65
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:55.950
Bethany Shadid: I think it's connected to this genetic thing with the kidney stone. She's like, well, Jay handles all that. So she put her referral and they literally called me on my way out of the door to make the appointment so

66
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.950
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, it's

67
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.530
Bethany Shadid: I'm used to them.

68
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.940
Bethany Shadid: Doing that and I think that's part of the reason I

69
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:14.970
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I was waiting for her and didn't think I was get that answer. But yeah, I can call I can do that.

70
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Melanie

71
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.110
Yeah.

72
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a few things that you have done that have felt

73
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Pleasant relaxing.

74
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Nourishing rewarding.

75
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: replenishing refueling the self care.

76
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.390
Bethany Shadid: Like this past week.

77
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.290
Uh huh.

78
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.200
Bethany Shadid: I went to church.

79
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.170
Bethany Shadid: When Saturday evening.

80
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What was that like

81
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.210
Bethany Shadid: It was great.

82
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.280
Bethany Shadid: And I really needed to hear a message and

83
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.000
Bethany Shadid: It was about

84
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:14.100
Bethany Shadid: Being led and it really tied into what we're doing know having that

85
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.960
Bethany Shadid: You know, visual imagery, the Trinity.

86
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.610
Bethany Shadid: Wisdom nurture, nurture.

87
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.180
Bethany Shadid: And really

88
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.370
Bethany Shadid: following them.

89
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.190
Bethany Shadid: Calling

90
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.460
Bethany Shadid: About your heart, you know,

91
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:49.920
Bethany Shadid: And I've been so lost as to what to do about my job and

92
00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:04.140
Bethany Shadid: It's a lot easier for me, the sounds awful. But it's a lot easier to put up with the craziness at work.

93
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.670
Bethany Shadid: And continue getting the check and then it is to

94
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.970
Bethany Shadid: Think about

95
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.850
Bethany Shadid: Looking for a job and having to learn all that over again and everything.

96
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.910
Bethany Shadid: I think I had gotten complacent. You know, this week was really tough but

97
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:39.660
Bethany Shadid: You know the weekend comes around and I'm like okay and then I'm okay until Monday when I think about going back

98
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.560
Bethany Shadid: But hearing the message.

99
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:55.830
Bethany Shadid: Really got me thinking that I'm you know i i took this job because it was the one that became available right away and

100
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.360
Bethany Shadid: I needed to get my parents house.

101
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.760
Bethany Shadid: Yes. And I did that. And now I'm here.

102
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:18.510
Bethany Shadid: I really do need to ask myself, those questions like, is this really what I want to be doing is this really what I want to be investing in

103
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.680
Bethany Shadid: Is this good for me and

104
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.400
Bethany Shadid: I think it's clear that it's not

105
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.420
Bethany Shadid: I

106
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.120
Bethany Shadid: I really struggle with that decision, but I had a friend.

107
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.490
Bethany Shadid: From my first nursing job back in the day.

108
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.440
Bethany Shadid: Great Christian friend who's very supportive.

109
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:55.350
Bethany Shadid: We just haven't kept in touch. But she reached out to me and told me that

110
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:02.220
Bethany Shadid: There are two positions available at her job.

111
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.710
Bethany Shadid: With his order orthopedic group.

112
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.160
Bethany Shadid: But it would be managing

113
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.090
Bethany Shadid: Specialized pain management patients.

114
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.260
Bethany Shadid: Like, wait. At first I didn't really think about it. But then I thought, Oh, my gosh.

115
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

116
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.770
Bethany Shadid: So cool. I have so much experience with that.

117
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:41.010
Bethany Shadid: I would be able to talk to people, frankly about, you know, if it's really that they're having continued pain or if they just can't come off the beds or

118
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:48.870
Bethany Shadid: You know, it was like, wow, like my own personal situation gives me so much.

119
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.780
Bethany Shadid: Experience.

120
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.200
Bethany Shadid: But

121
00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:04.530
Bethany Shadid: I'm terrified at the same time, it causes so much anxiety, thinking about change. Change is hard for me.

122
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.760
Bethany Shadid: But I'm going to apply.

123
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.840
Bethany Shadid: And

124
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.530
Bethany Shadid: meet up with her for coffee and talk about the position.

125
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.050
Bethany Shadid: It was kind of a godsend because I was just like, Okay, God, like

126
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:36.510
Bethany Shadid: This isn't good. But I don't know where to go. And I feel overwhelmed by having to look again it would that happen. It just felt so

127
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.070
Bethany Shadid: Right.

128
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not expensive let's let's do some some

129
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Shared

130
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You've said

131
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting the Holy Trinity, or however you're thinking about it lead

132
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are at work. How do you take, I'll let my faith lead I'm enjoying having a check. I'm enjoying it. I'm not living with my parents.

133
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a temporary thing. It's interesting the wording used earlier said, I don't know if this is what I'm supposed to do what I was expecting you to say was, this isn't where I'm supposed to do, but instead you said this isn't what

134
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a where the, where changes.

135
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Our audience.

136
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The people in need changes. All you do is just relocate what you do. Well, you just are moving the people you're just doing it over here. So I wonder

137
00:14:51.270 --> 00:15:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If maybe you change that this. I don't know if this is the right place for me. See how it sounds more like this. This what I'm doing this, giving this comes naturally this being able to see the unique needs people that that's just going to be now I'm doing it with this group of people

138
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: He might just not be in the right places all

139
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:22.200
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I think that goes into a little bit of something else that I was thinking about, which is

140
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:31.590
Bethany Shadid: What are my hangups about leaving and I feel

141
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.920
Bethany Shadid: Such a sense of

142
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.840
Bethany Shadid: sadness that I like that. I would be letting down

143
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.630
Bethany Shadid: All these co workers that I've gotten really close to you and I realized that

144
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.600
Bethany Shadid: My job isn't just a job. It's my

145
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:09.510
Bethany Shadid: It's what I put everything into my friends that I hang out with him in there. It's what I spend my time thinking about what I'm not there. It's

146
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:26.370
Bethany Shadid: I've turned it into so much more than a job and I do make a difference in the lives of patients and co workers and that's very hard for me to

147
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.780
Bethany Shadid: Walk away from almost like

148
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:51.390
Bethany Shadid: I feel like if I leave things are going to get back and I haven't obligate you know like it's an obligation to make sure everything's gonna be okay, or they're going to be okay or but patients before I leave, and I can't do that. But

149
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.210
Bethany Shadid: That's obviously I think

150
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.290
Bethany Shadid: On a you know subconscious level why

151
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.160
Bethany Shadid: It's hard for me to actually put action into leaving

152
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's have split screen. Okay, fine.

153
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll wait till you blow your nose.

154
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm one one side it's disappointing.

155
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: People. Yeah.

156
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: letting people down

157
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And over on the other side.

158
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's disappointing myself.

159
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit without a little while. Just

160
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't rush out it

161
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Going back and forth from the screen and one side, it's

162
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: They need me to be there with it. I need them.

163
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To support disappointing them.

164
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to change where I'm working because I don't want to disappoint. These people pay these patients.

165
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And then move to the other side.

166
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the same.

167
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to disappoint myself. What's on that side. Tell me about that side. Can you even visualize

168
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What that is

169
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.430
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I could

170
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:39.420
Bethany Shadid: I did think about that. This Week in or this weekend and

171
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:51.480
Bethany Shadid: I thought about how I be able to do what I love, which is make a meaningful difference in the lives of my patients.

172
00:18:52.530 --> 00:19:01.140
Bethany Shadid: I would feel, you know, it's something I'm passionate about. I would be in an environment with a friend that

173
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.030
Bethany Shadid: Is

174
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.290
Bethany Shadid: emotionally mature and able to take care of yourself.

175
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

176
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.980
Bethany Shadid: That I might actually have a life.

177
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.460
Bethany Shadid: Outside of work.

178
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's on me.

179
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, prevention of disappointing myself it's to flip it to positive and we say

180
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

181
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not taking care of myself at this current workplace, but I could this other one. So it's again it's prioritization of

182
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I could spend more time.

183
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: With my own growth and not disappoint myself.

184
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If I were somewhere where there were more emotionally mature people

185
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you could see the energy spent taking care of other people.

186
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Then could be

187
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: A few of these people know how to take care of themselves. There's more energy and reserve left for the self.

188
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.370
Bethany Shadid: Right.

189
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.600
End of the day.

190
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it can be a risky thing because that does mean there's time for your growth. And when you've been busy focusing on other people. There hasn't been a demand.

191
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There hasn't been that it's just you're used to exhaustion. You're used to give, give, give, empty tank that's been what you've been doing for a long time and intellectually, you know it.

192
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But doing it differently, which means to not be needed. Watch the difference if you're not needed. But what if you were valued.

193
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you weren't needed if you are valued. What if you were appreciated.

194
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Financially

195
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you were respected at this workplace. What if you almost Heaven forbid you demanded it.

196
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: As an internally, like you protected your boundaries.

197
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you were valued.

198
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.160
Fine.

199
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But if your unique unique style of working

200
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Was understood

201
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't for go unique style because everyone has their own, you're not the only one.

202
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But she honored yours and you just as you started this other job saying it was there but you let that go. Then it was a

203
00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad for not being able to focus my attention or whatever you did with this, but

204
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That classroom.

205
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have been at the one you're getting a check from

206
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you grateful.

207
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: For its lessons.

208
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you haven't learned to me out. But what are you grateful for the lessons that they've offered you opportunities to learn

209
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.830
Bethany Shadid: I've definitely been able to

210
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.190
Bethany Shadid: Tap into a place

211
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.920
Bethany Shadid: inside of me that

212
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.020
Bethany Shadid: I can feel the anger. Now, when somebody

213
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.080
Bethany Shadid: Is

214
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:57.090
Bethany Shadid: pushing my boundaries or doing something that's not right. I have been able to speak up for myself more than I had not perfectly, but more than I had and

215
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:04.830
Bethany Shadid: Recently, I've been able to, you know, be assured that

216
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.430
Bethany Shadid: I can trust my gut that I'm doing the right thing.

217
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.420
Bethany Shadid: Even if other people don't see it that way. I

218
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.780
Bethany Shadid: Have been able to

219
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.680
Bethany Shadid: Distance myself.

220
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.620
Bethany Shadid: From them and know that love is not on the line, but

221
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.900
Bethany Shadid: It took me a long time to get here. I

222
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.830
Bethany Shadid: Think another

223
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.870
Bethany Shadid: Big one

224
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.470
Bethany Shadid: Is me recognizing that

225
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.380
Bethany Shadid: These people that I work with.

226
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.760
Bethany Shadid: They're flawed.

227
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:03.750
Bethany Shadid: And that

228
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:12.750
Bethany Shadid: Even though they might be in a position of management above me or whatnot, that they

229
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.030
Bethany Shadid: Use tactics that are not professional

230
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.640
Bethany Shadid: To get to me and I used to

231
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.550
Bethany Shadid: Just and I still struggle with it, but I used

232
00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To second

233
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.010
Yeah.

234
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: They use unprofessional tactics to get to me.

235
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, to get to the part I was with yeah bentel to get to, you know,

236
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No, nothing to do with the Bethany, they are

237
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Professional and just leave it.

238
00:24:53.940 --> 00:25:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The very approach, the fact that they would leverage your vulnerability. The, the fact that they didn't listen to things you've said in the past or whatever.

239
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the unprofessionalism the fact that they would benefit enjoy seek to undermine you. That's the unprofessional. But when you say that thing to get to me that's too close it's it's it's as if

240
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not they're going to do it to someone else. IT IS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM

241
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: They're making intimate and personal something that needs to just be about a task. It needs to be about performance and need to be, you know, only about content they are unprofessional and just leave it out here, way out here.

242
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to continue to be unprofessional long after you've left them.

243
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.350
Bethany Shadid: True.

244
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.120
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

245
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You let it hurt you.

246
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.530
Bethany Shadid: Dude,

247
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know I'm challenging you a little bit and I was asking for a list and you're doing a great job. And I want to make sure you're not also skimming over

248
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit when you were saying that loves not on the line. Remember how you describe it. I turn this job into more so much more

249
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.170
Bethany Shadid: I guess I should say I let

250
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.030
Bethany Shadid: That

251
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.680
Bethany Shadid: Go with my manager, supervisor.

252
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:34.680
Bethany Shadid: Okay. Not everybody else but with them because I really don't care what they think.

253
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long

254
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How many days if you have that thought when they giggle and really don't care what they think. How many days because that I don't recognize

255
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.890
Bethany Shadid: Um, yeah, that's been the past like three weeks.

256
00:26:51.210 --> 00:27:09.270
Bethany Shadid: Ever since I started talking to HR about what was going on. Okay. Sadly, I did need a little bit of confirmation from them. But, you know, like it didn't just come from me right away that

257
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:19.140
Bethany Shadid: If this is wrong and and i know it's wrong, and that's enough. Like, but when somebody else side and said,

258
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:33.720
Bethany Shadid: This is not okay you know that did help reinforce all of it, but I hate my friend bought me this these funny little notepads called self therapy.

259
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:40.080
Bethany Shadid: And you check box and funny things that we pass them to each other and

260
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.820
Bethany Shadid: One was, I did one called a paper tantrum.

261
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:53.910
Bethany Shadid: And wrote down my issue with management and then I put there was a section that asked

262
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:04.110
Bethany Shadid: Like how do you really feel or something that I wrote down. It's their loss because I was leaving

263
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: VoiceOver.

264
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.700
Bethany Shadid: And yeah, just

265
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a different, that's a different position, a sense of identity, then their own professional to get to me.

266
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.460
Bethany Shadid: Yeah yeah

267
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's their loss.

268
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.180
Yeah.

269
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one we want to reinforce and don't minimize yes you went outside validation. But why don't we you know it's it's you sought solution.

270
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

271
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Solution through the appropriate channels.

272
00:28:49.470 --> 00:29:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't write keep asking for some validation from someone that has emotional immaturity and can't give it you. You made a complaint, there's something missing here. They're unprofessional. I'm going to go through the chain of command plan. I'm going to make my point. And you did.

273
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:08.760
Bethany Shadid: You say,

274
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.280
Bethany Shadid: That I feel proud of myself.

275
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. We've got to do that. We've got to say, Well, listen.

276
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Look what you if you do it from here. It's like, well, I want to check. You're there to earn a living.

277
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: These morons are getting in your way of you, earning a living.

278
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can either you tried to address it directly to the best of your ability, didn't work, then you went up the chain of command and you went to HR and said, you know, is there any remedy here so that I can continue to earn this check

279
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not don't know

280
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The original list gratitude. I'm glad I get to feel anger. I have spoken up

281
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I can trust my gut you caught it a few times. This is my feeling I feel this something sideways. You went to HR okay you have had moments where you've been able to distance

282
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This boss. I don't need their love I need them to tell me what to do, how to do it. Give me evaluations and do it in a respectful professional way.

283
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. I don't need their love. I don't need their approval. You've been giving that power to them. When really it belongs to someone that deserves your trust.

284
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Friends and

285
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.210
Yeah.

286
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you also said, I don't care what they think.

287
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a big one. That's really big.

288
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.790
Bethany Shadid: They seem so small to me now.

289
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.050
Bethany Shadid: Like, it's a very different perspective.

290
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you're able to consult with this idea of going and looking elsewhere to a different job that's any. It could be that this one isn't it either.

291
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.500
Bethany Shadid: When you say

292
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: a godsend. And it's it's these things i don't know that i don't know

293
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you'll meet the same child, my guesses, because this is still pretty new, you'll meet the same challenges and you'll be telling me I can't believe I'm doing it again. And I'll say, I can believe it.

294
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.970
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I, I haven't

295
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:50.640
Bethany Shadid: How would you say, I think that's the part of the scariness do I trade this for more, you know, fun over there, but at the same time, I think in in the position that I'm in now.

296
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.340
Bethany Shadid: It's gotten to the point

297
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.750
Bethany Shadid: That I don't feel safe.

298
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, tear

299
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.810
Bethany Shadid: In my

300
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.780
Bethany Shadid: Life for my license.

301
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, dear. Okay, I hear you.

302
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.820
Bethany Shadid: It's very clear.

303
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:18.810
Bethany Shadid: And actually when I came into group last week and was a mess.

304
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:21.270
Bethany Shadid: It was because

305
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:29.370
Bethany Shadid: I had a meeting with my boss's boss and him that went

306
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.510
Bethany Shadid: It's very clear. I barely see this guy ever and

307
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:45.180
Bethany Shadid: He had a very formed opinion of me based on what he got from my manager out

308
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.190
Bethany Shadid: And

309
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:55.830
Bethany Shadid: Was basically like ultimatums oh and

310
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:16.650
Bethany Shadid: I was told to leave the emotion out of this, you know, they even told me that I i I'm the reason why there's so many serves discontent among employees because when they see me upset.

311
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:30.570
Bethany Shadid: It spreads negativity. So they told me because I was tearful that I needed to go get myself together before I could come back in to the office.

312
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you handle that.

313
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:40.080
Bethany Shadid: Um, I, I would say if I'm being honest. In the beginning, I was trying to defend myself.

314
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.320
Bethany Shadid: And then I realized

315
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:56.430
Bethany Shadid: They really don't want to know or hear anything. I have to say they're not trying to work this out, they're

316
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.850
Bethany Shadid: Laying out their expectations so that if I don't meet them, you know,

317
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:10.920
Bethany Shadid: I don't know. But it became clear and so every time.

318
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.320
Bethany Shadid: The higher up guy would tell me

319
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.670
Bethany Shadid: What the expectation was I would agree and I would just point out

320
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.920
Bethany Shadid: Why it hasn't gone that way and

321
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:33.570
Bethany Shadid: Tried to hold the, you know, my tears in but

322
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.730
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I just, I wrote it off after like

323
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.230
Bethany Shadid: I knew what it was for. And I knew that.

324
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.790
Bethany Shadid: I didn't take it in personally like I did.

325
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.410
Bethany Shadid: But afterwards.

326
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.800
Bethany Shadid: To co workers came up to me.

327
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:16.200
Bethany Shadid: And told me that they overheard a conversation between this my manager his boss and HR on the phone because they were in a conference room that

328
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:22.020
Bethany Shadid: And had her the lady in HR that I've been talking to on speaker.

329
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:44.970
Bethany Shadid: And so they were being loud and they overheard that conversation. But they said when they got off the phone with her. They kept talking and my one friend, my one coworker was so distraught by it that she told me she's like she was almost in tears, and she told me she's like

330
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.380
Bethany Shadid: I

331
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.210
Bethany Shadid: I love working with you, but she's like, I

332
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:57.420
Bethany Shadid: I have to tell you honestly that you need to find a different job.

333
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Why did you like, what does she mean by that.

334
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.700
Bethany Shadid: She said, I, I overheard you know this. She's like,

335
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.280
Bethany Shadid: I don't even want to tell you what they said because it was so horrible.

336
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.290
Bethany Shadid: But

337
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.310
Bethany Shadid: I want I want you

338
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.440
Bethany Shadid: To

339
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:30.150
Bethany Shadid: I don't want you to be this situation. She goes, I seen a co worker previously forced out like this.

340
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.560
Bethany Shadid: And I don't want this to happen to you.

341
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:59.100
Bethany Shadid: And so I, I want you to, you know, be look for another place as much as I don't want to lose you, you know, I want you to be okay. And I said, thank you. And I was a little concerned, you know, I told her I was like, are they taking that was like, I know.

342
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.800
Bethany Shadid: You know, I've been in the past, very upset by the things that they've

343
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:18.270
Bethany Shadid: Duggar said. I said, But out of self preservation. Does this have anything to do with them taking action against my license and she was like, no, she said, but

344
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.760
Bethany Shadid: They made it very clear that

345
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:36.450
Bethany Shadid: My counterpart, and everybody are on board with the plan and I'm the one that's causing all the problems. She's like, I just don't want to go into how they said things because I think it would really hurt.

346
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:43.320
Bethany Shadid: And so I said, well, thank you. And then I had another co worker covered basically

347
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:50.070
Bethany Shadid: Tell me, she overheard it and that she couldn't believe what she heard and

348
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:57.360
Bethany Shadid: You know, it was just really shocked by the behavior and

349
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:15.390
Bethany Shadid: So that's why when I came into work that Monday, the thought of going back or Tuesday walking in after like hearing that I was a real mess. Plus, I had a had a conversation with my dad.

350
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.140
Bethany Shadid: That really threw me off.

351
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.510
Bethany Shadid: And since then, I've been able to

352
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.300
Bethany Shadid: Get my feet back off the ground a little bit, but it was

353
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.610
Bethany Shadid: It was devastating in

354
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.010
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

355
00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.550
Bethany Shadid: Okay, I was not a good

356
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Little we need to put a little space.

357
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That you make out of

358
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: THOSE UGLY rumors, the ugly talk

359
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that people don't appreciate

360
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:15.870
Your

361
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Transparency of your emotional life and your skill you have the ability to share both not everyone does.

362
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.340
Really

363
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a skill deficit on their part, you've got challenges and giving away your power and you're working hard with me on that. But just hold on for a second.

364
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Devastating

365
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Devastating because

366
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: They filed a complaint against your license.

367
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:48.630
They have

368
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So they can do on the spot that so wait

369
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

370
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:58.830
Bethany Shadid: It was bad. It was good.

371
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if I don't even know what it is but but Bethany, the devastation. I just watched your face hurt. I'm just you feel pain.

372
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a meaning that you make out of, I'm guessing.

373
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Certainly at the workplace. It is the meaning

374
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the part that we can have some power renewal. If we understand what meaning you're making out of the ugliness of others. The unprofessional ism of others how you make it

375
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.200
Yeah, you

376
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So before we go to dad, I want you to grab it. What's the meaning the I'm gonna I'm gonna say it irrational because it's right. What's the irrational thought I am what what meaning. Did you make out of that ugliness unprofessional.

377
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.170
Bethany Shadid: They're right about me.

378
00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh for goodness

379
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:01.020
Yeah.

380
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not and and I'm assuming you're that you are what

381
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.590
Bethany Shadid: Level that I'm

382
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:16.050
Bethany Shadid: That I can't take direction.

383
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.570
Bethany Shadid: That you know insubordinate that I'm not

384
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good enough.

385
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.290
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. Not good.

386
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Not wait there. I love the but

387
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because boy is where we want to go. So I'm not good enough.

388
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And that, watch, watch.

389
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the devastation.

390
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Good enough. This is devastating.

391
00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.590
Bethany Shadid: I don't know.

392
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.490
Bethany Shadid: No, because I'm not in that place right now but

393
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When she did a second ago, as I needed you know you started to tear up

394
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:11.250
Yeah.

395
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.200
Bethany Shadid: Be honest about if that's what was so devastating or if it was something else.

396
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:28.890
Bethany Shadid: No, I, I think it. I think that's what it was, I think, to I'd had that from our last session when

397
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:37.650
Bethany Shadid: We made the connection about that insecurity of I'm not lovable right

398
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.180
Bethany Shadid: How tied in that is and

399
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:54.030
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I would say that, yeah, that they're right about me it reinforced that internal insecurity.

400
00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Me name. It doesn't mean don't take my words, you name it, then what's the insecurity. I was devastated because they're right. I am

401
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.190
Bethany Shadid: Not good.

402
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and that's devastating yeah what

403
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're

404
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You're taking in the assessment from people that are unprofessional. They don't deserve the credibility. You give away immediately they don't deserve it.

405
00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell you something. Just because someone has a label because they have money and they have authority. You are not diminished and do not give away your self appraisal to them.

406
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't deserve it there unprofessional.

407
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, you can stay there the whole time. We can work these kinks out and you can be a real bad ass over there. Or you could get out and we can do it in much much much smaller increments the same way I wanted you to get out of your house.

408
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can use it and do it, work it in smaller increments you gave away your power to someone that didn't deserve it. Right.

409
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.530
Bethany Shadid: To be honest with you, I don't think there's ever been a point in my life.

410
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.100
Bethany Shadid: Where I've ever question.

411
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.090
Bethany Shadid: What somebody the position of authority over me.

412
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.480
Bethany Shadid: Or been able to question

413
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.660
Bethany Shadid: Right. Like, I think we always sleep.

414
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:29.700
Bethany Shadid: Like

415
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.500
Bethany Shadid: But it's never been okie

416
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Position I'll respect the position. I'll do it.

417
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't respect the delivery, the person, all I will

418
00:44:49.740 --> 00:45:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All respect the position because it it has the, the ability to can me, things like that. But what you do. You literally you take your emotions. Look what you do if I respect the position look

419
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I show up on time they do their stupid little tasks bat bat bat bat bat bat bat, but you don't you do you take what is vulnerable and precious to you.

420
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You make it vulnerable to their behaviors, these people that didn't earn your trust.

421
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.420
Do it.

422
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: KEEP YOU HERE until you have tested the water that's all well you make vulnerable to another's actions. That's trust. Did they deserve.

423
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What you do is you show the emotion you put it out there, but they don't deserve that they're not trustworthy. You can respect the position.

424
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you show that underbelly stuff. Give it time see if they're worthy.

425
00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are friends. Those are people were right, a therapist or someone that

426
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Can hold that space, most people aren't trained taught interested. They don't want it because they can barely handle their own emotional life.

427
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

428
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard you. I've never questioned someone of authority, but look what you're doing. What are we pull it apart, we say

429
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, you're my boss, I gotta answer you. You're the one right number evaluations, you're the one to get to give feedback and. OK, so my paychecks. You're going to kind of, okay, I can respect that I'm not, but I won't

430
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Put right that's why that loving the line stuff is. I won't put value that hits the heart. I'm not going to tell you my personal stories, you're not going to get that piece of me until you've earned that privilege.

431
00:46:48.360 --> 00:47:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: People tell us where the best Bethany, we're not we're we're selfish greedy little people. Sometimes it's not our fault. We've come to this behavior because it works for us. So use discretion.

432
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.820
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I

433
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:05.220
Bethany Shadid: Mean, that's

434
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:07.980
Bethany Shadid: Kind of my willing right

435
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:15.900
Bethany Shadid: Like I I always give people that trust right away.

436
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.090
Bethany Shadid: Even if

437
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:25.860
Bethany Shadid: I never, you know, I never I'm not a discerning person.

438
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.840
Bethany Shadid: Almost like for me to be discerning would be bad.

439
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:33.300
Bethany Shadid: If

440
00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't see it. That's, that's the investment and the toxic calm environment you grew up with.

441
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't allowed to do that, you're, you're demanded every morsel

442
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that issue, she demanded it. You couldn't even not smile about something you didn't want to do the emotional space.

443
00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: She there was there was no room for you to differentiate you understand. Yeah.

444
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:06.030
Bethany Shadid: I've seen that in a big way in the how it's

445
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.940
Bethany Shadid: lingered in my life.

446
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all, no label on it, you are learning, you were not taught this you're learning it here with

447
00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Test it out in new environments. It's a skill. It's called individuation there's a reason why this word and measurement exists because it's in psychological text.

448
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's what some families do to their children because an adult doesn't give their child a chance to have her own psychological life her own thoughts, your own feelings you were wrong. Okay.

449
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You're learning. Now, how to sit. When you say my own gut. I'm like, Okay Google. You're getting better at it. But it's, I think there's still some learning to do pay attention. What do I like oh I this guy on

450
00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:00.990
You pay attention.

451
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Now hold on to that.

452
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good enough.

453
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Devastating

454
00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm unlovable right in there, not lovable that piece right there. Right there. Right there. Did it happen again that you went to that sponsoring belief with your father and I don't know what the story is. But is it possible that that happened there. Yeah, yeah.

455
00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.820
Bethany Shadid: I think it was more so because I had

456
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.650
Bethany Shadid: Gone to my parents out of

457
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:48.270
Bethany Shadid: Once again, right. So again, I wanted to give them a heads up.

458
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.380
Bethany Shadid: About possibly having me change my job.

459
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:53.490
Why

460
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:58.140
Bethany Shadid: Why

461
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:06.330
Bethany Shadid: Well i right since then definitely realized that I

462
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:12.390
Bethany Shadid: Don't have the appropriate outlets to talk about those things and so

463
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:19.710
Bethany Shadid: I'm by the time I see them, you know, even though I know that place.

464
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:28.860
Bethany Shadid: It comes out and actually I really felt like I was being better about it like

465
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.430
Bethany Shadid: I was telling them about some of the issues at work. But I was really

466
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:38.880
Bethany Shadid: Confidence in what I was saying.

467
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I

468
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:46.980
Bethany Shadid: Definitely was over doing the defense of myself, my actions.

469
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:55.320
Bethany Shadid: About the things going on at work. And my mom's listening. There's something because she's in the medical field.

470
00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:09.990
Bethany Shadid: I can go into some of the things, and she understands it better than my father right but i was going on, you know, I was like, I just want to give you a heads up things at work are really rough kind of

471
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.820
Bethany Shadid: And I may have to change jobs and

472
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.850
Bethany Shadid: Was like, oh no, why, and then I start bringing up some things and

473
00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:29.400
Bethany Shadid: Then at the end of it was like, but you know, I, I've been going into way too much details like I just wanted to give you a heads up.

474
00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.960
Bethany Shadid: And my dad had been quiet the entire time.

475
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.030
Bethany Shadid: And then

476
00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:38.940
Bethany Shadid: Out of nowhere.

477
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:42.420
Bethany Shadid: He says, you know,

478
00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:50.550
Bethany Shadid: You don't talk to us that much. So I don't know. You know what's going on, you've just been really

479
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:58.350
Bethany Shadid: In a bad i don't know in a bad place. I forget how you said it, but he was like

480
00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.720
Bethany Shadid: I knew that there was something wrong. He goes, but I can't help it as

481
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.040
Bethany Shadid: I hear you.

482
00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:23.100
Bethany Shadid: Know, pointing out how they did this wrong and they did that wrong, and the whole time and you're defending your position and you sound quite arrogant.

483
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.410
Bethany Shadid: Now, and

484
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:42.930
Bethany Shadid: you're unsure of yourself. He goes, but, you know, this was the same way you acted when I got fired from your job in North Carolina.

485
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.930
Bethany Shadid: And I can't help but wonder if is everybody wrong.

486
00:52:50.070 --> 00:53:08.970
Bethany Shadid: Is everybody else wrong and you're the only one that has, has it right. He's like, I mean, I can't tell. He goes, but I'm a little concerned because what it sounds like to me is that you're the victim and everybody else is wrong. And if you're the only one that's right

487
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:11.340
Bethany Shadid: And

488
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:16.290
Bethany Shadid: I I lost it and just cried.

489
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.100
Bethany Shadid: And I was trying in my head to

490
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:32.580
Bethany Shadid: Think of how to deal with it and i and i did i came back. What would you do if I said, Dad, I know that you love me.

491
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.250
Bethany Shadid: You care about me.

492
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.280
Bethany Shadid: That's why you're

493
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.850
Bethany Shadid: Concerned about this.

494
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.010
But

495
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:58.830
Bethany Shadid: And I think they interrupted. That was like, well good. I'm glad that you know that is that I'm just telling you this because I look

496
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you didn't get a chance

497
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so first don't linger linger.

498
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Five years ago, two years ago, a year ago, would you have been able to catch

499
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oregon d been to self-reproach I'll never have my own Psychic space. I'll have to always accommodate to these people. I don't have my own preferences. I don't have myself.

500
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, this time you caught it. He did some crying. But guess what you did. Remember, you did something to make that happen. And I'm impressed.

501
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.830
Bethany Shadid: Okay, thank you.

502
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell you something. I don't remember if you remember it while you were speaking highly activated.

503
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.430
Bethany Shadid: So through the

504
00:54:53.940 --> 00:55:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine that had you caught it fractions of a second before if that intensity hadn't gotten quite as high as it had. I bet you would have remembered even more.

505
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay out stay proud of that.

506
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm glad you should, because that's all you need. It's that same skill. It's just catching things earlier and earlier and earlier, the more you and I rehearse things, the more you're practicing it with people, the easier it is going to be to remember. Now you got interrupted.

507
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm Dad, what did you want to finish thing to me.

508
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.680
Bethany Shadid: That I just

509
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.220
Bethany Shadid: I can't

510
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:58.110
Bethany Shadid: I can't explain to you, everything and all the ins and outs, so that you can make a judgment about whether I'm right or wrong. I just wanted your support.

511
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What would support feel like

512
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.880
Bethany Shadid: You know, just to say, I'm really sorry. That sounds

513
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:10.320
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

514
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, changing jobs is is hard, especially making that decision that's rough.

515
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:18.120
Bethany Shadid: Right.

516
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like you know about it almost like you've kind of made up your mind you sound confident that this is this is the right move for you.

517
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:31.950
Yeah, it's, it's

518
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.130
Bethany Shadid: It's just go back

519
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:43.500
Bethany Shadid: To six of the past two weeks. I mean, so, but yes, be at work.

520
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.040
Bethany Shadid: You always sick what's going on.

521
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.960
Bethany Shadid: And I said I would have those people that stress.

522
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.650
Bethany Shadid: It manifests very physically

523
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

524
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

525
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And your therapist version of this. Do you want to know your therapist version of what it might sound like. Like, can. Some people right they can hear this. This one's voice in their head. Sometimes

526
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's an extremely

527
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:18.270
You do.

528
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it would be like this.

529
00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Old dad. Oh, I can tell right now, how much you care about you know me, you know, staying on top of my finances and and taking ownership, for my part, at work, and thank you for that. I'm real clear about it. The reason why I brought it up today was just to give you a heads up.

530
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To make to include you in my life.

531
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad, what, what, what are your concerns about mine changing john

532
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember that question before, where he actually having an emotional reaction. It's about his fear.

533
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:01.170
Bethany Shadid: But

534
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You switch it do, is you stick with content, but you don't, you, you. You have been listening in and and it's amazing how definitely once you get this. It's just picture this like sheer curtain.

535
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can see your dad through it, but it's filtered through this show this gauze of of linen or something. And over here it's I'm hypothesis topic up

536
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: My topic you already know your motivations and yes sir motive by our emotions drawn and rickles for whatever but you've already made that up. So yeah, I dad. So the reason I'm bringing in you persevere, but you get distracted.

537
00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: By his assessment of you being overly. As if being self assured was a problem.

538
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You with some powerful stuff. Bethany, Eric.

539
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But you stay if you can stay here.

540
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Your content is all you can check in and make sure if he heard the content, but you've got distracted with I bet that word arrogant and that, that one hurt.

541
00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:21.390
Bethany Shadid: Oh,

542
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:22.560
Bethany Shadid: You know what

543
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:25.800
Bethany Shadid: I did forget till you said that

544
00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:29.670
Bethany Shadid: He, he did. He was like,

545
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:42.060
Bethany Shadid: Whatever this happens. He wants to know. He's like you haven't been telling me what's going on, like, I can't solve these problems for you, you know, would would

546
00:59:42.390 --> 01:00:00.900
Bethany Shadid: Well, he doesn't say that. But that's like the way it comes out as I can't manage all of this, if you're not talking to me about all these problems in it. He goes, if you're the one who doesn't want to tell me about your finances. He brought that into it doing did I was able to say, Dad.

547
01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.680
Bethany Shadid: I bet I did. I ask you for buddy.

548
01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.460
Bethany Shadid: I only came to tell you what's going on.

549
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.660
Bethany Shadid: I said, Whoa, where did I ask for help.

550
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.390
Bethany Shadid: I just wanted to fill up

551
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.870
Bethany Shadid: So I was able to do that but

552
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.570
Bethany Shadid: You're right, I got

553
01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.210
Bethany Shadid: I was really thrown

554
01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.280
Bethany Shadid: Off my

555
01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Battle

556
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: For five minutes after but listen to

557
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This. Listen, listen, listen.

558
01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So what

559
01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if you're arrogant.

560
01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Any you don't get this. So what in your family of origin, you're not allowed.

561
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To focus on you.

562
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it throws off the system where mom is the centerpiece of all in and of itself.

563
01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You have no chance of being arrogant, you have no chance of that negative term. But in order for you to give yourself permission. So what

564
01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: very arrogant.

565
01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what, that's that space of I get to be angry, I get to have that pendulum swing and guess what if I was even selfish, you are still amazing

566
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you don't like the response from the environment when let's say you are arrogant or selfish or whatever it is right that extreme.

567
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to know in real time. I don't like the effect people to kind of snub me they don't invite me places. Well, okay then you make an adjustment but the fact that you have a right to be arrogant to

568
01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's family of words and conditioning right there.

569
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.690
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, big time.

570
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A you're not. Number two, what if you were. Hey, are you still look at this one. Yeah, but you still love me if I was ever gonna

571
01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: See it, it is a posture. See that laugh because you're a bad ass right then you're like, yeah, this feels so far. And for me to be arrogant. I hardly even know what to do with it. You see it. I've been working on that.

572
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's funny. It does not have the heat and the meaning that you give it. This will take time does, and you can I say it out loud in these really big ways

573
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you can see you have a choice. It doesn't feel like it in the moment and I really get that

574
01:02:48.270 --> 01:03:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But that breath work before you go to the house before you say I'm going to share my vulnerability with my father, my mother, you better get ready. What is that whenever you're telling me, Oh, she says to breed. I own I

575
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, wait a minute. Why am I telling them, maybe I wanted to tell them

576
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, wanting to know. I'm going to tell them to stick with my content. I'm going to breathe and I'm going to redirect it back to my intention. I'll ask them how they feel about it you rehearse it don't go in with nothing. These are skilled professionals you missy.

577
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:28.260
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

578
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:33.300
Bethany Shadid: I did something that I have to tell you because I wasn't sure.

579
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:46.260
Bethany Shadid: I we did it by my mom had a puzzle out over table it when I first got there. I started working on it with them and they just weren't bombarding me with questions and I felt that level of distress.

580
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:55.830
Bethany Shadid: And I said to them, I said, you know, how about before we get into everything we just take out for a little bit.

581
01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what did they do they look up, did they look at you like,

582
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:13.200
Bethany Shadid: That. Yeah, they were pretty surprised, but they went along with it and it made me feel better, but I don't know. But yeah, that makes me feel good about myself.

583
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.240
Bethany Shadid: Oh,

584
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:17.310

Bethany Shadid: I don't know. Let me find out after I talked to Krista

Good to you.

596
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:00.630
JESSICA G: Oh,

597
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:06.270
JESSICA G: Sorry. Give me one second. I'm just

598
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.970
JESSICA G: space heater for my baby.

599
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll go open up a note, while you're doing that.

600
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.240
JESSICA G: Just

601
01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:49.020
JESSICA G: Robot, make sure it's closed. Okay.

602
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so where are you out. Where are you out as far as like your emotional

603
01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you've got a lot on your plate, you've been thinking about going out into the workforce again. What does that mean, and

604
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: My confidence and then some roller coaster ride with bright heart health, and something you mentioned through text about your mom and I kind of want to know more about that. But where are you at what's pressing for you.

605
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:28.380
JESSICA G: I try to be okay. Like, I try to, like, be happy, you know,

606
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:31.980
JESSICA G: For the most part, I'm

607
01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:40.770
JESSICA G: I've completely changed my attitude towards my son's dad. Okay. And I guess.

608
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:49.230
JESSICA G: Oh, sorry. My baby got sick yesterday and so kind of been up

609
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:51.420
JESSICA G: But, um,

610
01:06:54.270 --> 01:07:03.270
JESSICA G: I guess it's it's more impactful to me because it's more immediate like it's more right here, my face, the whole thing with my son's death.

611
01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:04.680
JESSICA G: Okay.

612
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.300
And let's spend time with that.

613
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:08.460
JESSICA G: Um,

614
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:13.050
JESSICA G: I've just really changed my attitude towards him. Like, I'm just

615
01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:15.180
JESSICA G: I just stopped.

616
01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:24.270
JESSICA G: expecting him to do anything. I stopped.

617
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:31.590
JESSICA G: waiting for him to change. I just stopped. I stopped. Yeah.

618
01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a big difference, isn't it.

619
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:36.420
Yeah.

620
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.660
JESSICA G: Yeah, but now he's like all

621
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.350
JESSICA G: I guess you noticed the change. And he's like,

622
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:51.360
JESSICA G: kissing my ass know for lack of better words.

623
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

624
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well okay so

625
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What you wrote

626
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Was help with the baby I'm being able to to help around the house right to be helpful to kind of pay attention.

627
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he contributing in that way.

628
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.440
JESSICA G: I'm

629
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:16.800
JESSICA G: Not so much.

630
01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.770
JESSICA G: But he's just trying to be nicer and it just

631
01:08:25.530 --> 01:08:28.770
JESSICA G: Like he tries to talk to me and like repulses me like

632
01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess.

633
01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:36.660
JESSICA G: Right, I was like Italy really

634
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right. It's at this point, it seems funny doesn't seem genuine, I'm guessing.

635
01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.350
Okay.

636
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So you said of all the things that there are to talk about today the most pressing is what's going on with. Yeah. What's his first name.

637
01:08:58.230 --> 01:08:58.770
JESSICA G: I'm on

638
01:08:59.610 --> 01:09:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on

639
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's pressing there so

640
01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:18.600
JESSICA G: How was the other night. The other night I got really upset because I got

641
01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:22.650
JESSICA G: We were supposed to take the baby to get a haircut.

642
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:34.620
JESSICA G: But that was his sorry that was his idea that was him. And so I got ready and then I was, he was like, well, where are we going

643
01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:36.570
JESSICA G: I was like,

644
01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:46.680
JESSICA G: What do you mean, where we going and just just i just like are only taking the baby to go get a haircut is like, Well, I'm not going to go get a haircut.

645
01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:50.430
JESSICA G: Anymore, I'm not going. And I'm like,

646
01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.090
JESSICA G: And so we ended up going to the market, they were having a sale for me.

647
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:03.360
JESSICA G: But they were already closed because we were too late. I kind of took a long time getting ready.

648
01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.310
JESSICA G: And then

649
01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:15.300
JESSICA G: I was like, well, let's go walk around. Let's go take the baby to walk around inside at least like you know she stuck in the house all day.

650
01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.160
JESSICA G: And then

651
01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:29.220
JESSICA G: He just started like treating me talking to me real like he started talking down on me and

652
01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:31.860
JESSICA G: Like

653
01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:37.080
JESSICA G: Saying things under his breath. I don't do anything and

654
01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:44.670
JESSICA G: Stuff like that because he took the baby out of his car shoes and I was like here, put this in. He had him on top of the car.

655
01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:50.970
JESSICA G: And he didn't have a jacket on, and nails or a evening time

656
01:10:52.020 --> 01:11:01.860
JESSICA G: And I kind of like I went in. I told him here. Put this jacket on him. Please Like, I'm to the point where I'm like, Please, just put it on him. It's not about me, you, it's about

657
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:10.350
JESSICA G: The baby you know he's like well why can't you do it, and this and that. And I'm like, I just didn't even say anything. It was

658
01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:22.050
JESSICA G: Like he's over here time the baby shoes has the baby on top of the car. What am I supposed to do, like, go and meet them and put the jacket on the baby. You know, like, put the jacket on a mirror right there.

659
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:29.700
JESSICA G: I'm just like he was just talking to me like I was trashed. And I was like,

660
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:34.650
JESSICA G: That was bad. That was a really bad moment and

661
01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:35.520
So wait,

662
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So you felt okay let's stay with that.

663
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So on one hand, I don't care.

664
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I gotta stop thinking about asking him to change, but there's still this space where you

665
01:11:53.250 --> 01:12:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's around being the parent where you're both parenting. At the same time, if you have a request for him to be parenting in some way. There's the overlap. So yes, maybe it'd be nice to have distance, but when it comes to the baby. There's conversation. There's expectation

666
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:19.410
JESSICA G: Yeah, yeah. And it's, it's still like just as a human being, you know, it hurts to be treated like that and

667
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:29.340
JESSICA G: Yeah, because the way she was talking to me like he said more stuff under his breath. And he was just being so rude to me and it's like

668
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:34.680
JESSICA G: It just made me feel like crap because what am I supposed to do, like, I don't

669
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:57.720
JESSICA G: I don't have anything. I don't have money to buy my son anything about the mall or to buy him a hot a corn dog or anything like you know and I know that in that part in that aspect. I'm kind of depending on him and I feel like he knows that, too. And he just talks to me like crap.

670
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:08.760
JESSICA G: And I'm just like, I'm not. I'm not. I don't want anything from you if you want to buy your son some fries or whatever, that's on you, but I'm okay. I'm have food at the house.

671
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:13.950
JESSICA G: That I went in. I got by myself, not having a job.

672
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:15.900
JESSICA G: But

673
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.970
JESSICA G: He could

674
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.070
JESSICA G: Uh huh.

675
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: My question is,

676
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that this is an opportunity to

677
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Explore how you have been drawn to this type of person how tolerant, you have been and how you're changing your tolerance for unkind.

678
01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication and treatment or is it an opportunity to identify a skill that you might want to have as you continue to navigate this relationship. If you go in either direction or another one. Where do you want to spend the time today.

679
01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:23.970
JESSICA G: I think I'm pretty I'm pretty set on the skills I think I want to explore more why I chose that kind of person because like honestly, even when I was on drug. I never allowed anyone or treat me like that ever and I was

680
01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:26.850
JESSICA G: Okay, so

681
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you want to understand why. And that's consistent with a goal that you've said, you want to understand how your childhood has affected you that's that's consistent with some things that you've been saying. So we can go into that.

682
01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to touch base on the skills. One more time. The only reason why I'm bringing it up is because you notice how earlier you said, I felt really bad.

683
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you say you were using the skill of what

684
01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, if you're using a skill. Would you really feel that bad, or was that a moment when the baby was on the top of the car that a skill was forgotten and it wasn't used

685
01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:10.680
JESSICA G: Yeah, probably.

686
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:18.330
JESSICA G: Probably and then throughout our whole trip like to the mall. I was just off born

687
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.340
JESSICA G: I was just defeated at that moment, I felt defeated.

688
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.240
JESSICA G: You know, yeah.

689
01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is an interesting moment.

690
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You're very acutely present with deficit don't have don't have money don't have

691
01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Transportation don't have power don't have don't have and you felt defeated.

692
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You could turn it around. This is a real skill, Jessica. I'm not saying this will be remembered right away, but I think you're just the gal, to be able to do it.

693
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When you register this

694
01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go to. But I'm on

695
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like for you to carry this burden for this family for these months for these years to be taking care of us to make sure that we have

696
01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: A CHANCE TO EVEN COME HERE IN THE MALL. What's this been like for you. Hold on. Don't say anything. Just look that in

697
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Do it again from on

698
01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All of a sudden, you know, right now I'm thinking about how

699
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what it's like for you to carry the weight of responsibility of this family.

700
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it like for you.

701
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now looking at me, Jessica. Do I look defeated.

702
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, the situation is the same. I'm still dependent the content hasn't changed. I'm still sitting in a car, listening to someone

703
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Knives and arrows through words ugliness labels names criticism are coming at me. That hasn't changed.

704
01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're not true. So I've decided to focus on

705
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What ramones fear is

706
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And it takes a real effort to do that.

707
01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Means I have to have my wall up that barrier that

708
01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundary that doesn't let in anything.

709
01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, of course, when I protected. Now I can look over the wall of protection and see what's going on with him, so I can peek over

710
01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.210
And I can say

711
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

712
01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like for you to have to take care of us a lot of pressure. What's it like for you.

713
01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm safe over here now because I've got what he's saying.

714
01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't affecting me never earlier in the week you're able to do it. You're just like, I don't care what this guy thinks to me anymore. I'm not going to try to change him, but he got to you being stuck and helpless. You got to you got under your skin.

715
01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you remember this now and you say,

716
01:18:32.670 --> 01:18:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to listen to what he has to say.

717
01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: He said, ugly things

718
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: He's saying only things I already take time for self reflection I do it with my therapist. I do it with various people. I don't know that I want this man's opinion of me right now he's not, he's not kind is this to help me grow.

719
01:18:53.070 --> 01:19:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe with the ball up and then guess what I feel safe. And now I can use curiosity.

720
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Over being I can use that and I say that very specifically as a skill I can choose curiosity. A room on

721
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Just now, I'm thinking about how hard is it for you to have all this pressure on you to take care of us. Like right now I don't have any money in my pocket right now and I'm and I'm leaning on you for that do for me. I'm used to working, but what's it like for you to have all this pressure

722
01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's get real justice. I'm rolling out these ideas.

723
01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: seem ridiculous.

724
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Seem like Oh, that'll just piss them off. What do you think what's coming up for you.

725
01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:43.740
No.

726
01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:46.680
JESSICA G: No.

727
01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.360
JESSICA G: I mean,

728
01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:52.440
JESSICA G: That's not something I've

729
01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:58.410
JESSICA G: ever asked him before I thanked him for

730
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:06.480
JESSICA G: My I remember we had that. And I think him, but I've never really asked him what it's like

731
01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:10.440
JESSICA G: I feel like

732
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:16.050
JESSICA G: I don't know. I guess I just always felt like he's just like,

733
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What this is so. JESSICA What i right in front of you is a complex psychological interaction, but I'm skipping all the theory and I'm just modeling it for you. But what's actually going on for you and

734
01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: For mom.

735
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is quite a departure from the game will call it of

736
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: He's is if

737
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to tolerate it, because you are stuck. That's the old game. That's the game that happened in the car on the way to the mall.

738
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You played by his rules.

739
01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel defeated that he set that up. You agree to it. I know it was unconscious. But you said, yeah, unless then because you're making money, but you agreed to it. If you can swallow that

740
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a hard one to swallow it, then you participated in it. Okay, I won't work. I'm working on my recovery. I want to be with my baby but it means I'm going to tolerate your crap.

741
01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you and I can agree on that, that this is a game. Those are his rules, but you agreed to him. If you say yourself. I'm gonna change the rule.

742
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to believe what he says. Not that criticism stuff.

743
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The one where he attempts to make me feel small. Wait a minute, that's not true. I'm really intelligent capable industrious loving affectionate ambitious woman. I just happen to be working recovery and not working right now.

744
01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's doesn't how you define that's not how you define this is temporary. He's always going to be a turn, yo.

745
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get a job when you want one. But this personality thing it's harder to change.

746
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: No job. Yes, have job in recovery and a relapse have a baby don't have a baby. Those things change. Those are circumstantial they change.

747
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: His personality.

748
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we are, we're at this moment, if you can remember and and probably it's going to help come after you do the breathing. I know you gotta remind that you can do the breathing when you notice someone's being been

749
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing.

750
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, do the belly breathing. Get back to your truth. Get back in your body, not into that emotional distress, not in that perceived threat if this guy keeps talking like this, he might kick me out, he might not take me places you might not give things to my son.

751
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we're in that perceived threat response that if you do the breathing, you're going to remember more of the cool things. You and I are doing

752
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll come up with a way to opt out of his game.

753
01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You change the rule because look what I just did what I said to him, I said,

754
01:23:06.810 --> 01:23:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not listening to your BS. Basically, it went boiling and it bounced right, it didn't, it didn't sting.

755
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, who has the power

756
01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You do.

757
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If he can't hurt you. With ugliness.

758
01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you ask him a question about how he's feeling and it's calm. It's quiet. This tone of voice. This one year and now this this sort of low kind gentle way of speaking

759
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: With you by grounded first before you started talking and, well, how you feel. And we can say the same thing with the next town and it won't work.

760
01:23:47.520 --> 01:24:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to get chill in our right, we got to feel centered in our truth that I'm lovable. This is circumstantial, you may be a turd for the rest of your life. I'm not gonna give you credit for how you assess me I don't, you don't have credibility with me right now.

761
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that thing when tend to do ask him how he's feeling. What's it like for him.

762
01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's still talking about the same topic. It's about your being dependent on him. Isn't the topic. Still the same where once the first one was I'm defeated. Well, guess what topic is still

763
01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I ain't got the money you got it. But now I'm turning to curiosity and I turned to him and I say,

764
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just now striking me that I don't have any cash on hand and I'm kind of dependent on you in it in a big way. What's that like to, to be, you know, responsible for us for all the burden on you.

765
01:24:49.890 --> 01:25:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is role play. What might that do for your self esteem if you could remember to breathe and to ask a feeling question though so feeling question. That's a what I call a process question. It's not put the sweater on

766
01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't logistically get to it. This is a process your meeting him on a process level.

767
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I don't mean that right as the sweater is on or on, you know, it might be later on when it's, you know, sweaters been put on or not, he'll survive to survive a few minutes without it you might get the shiver. But Toby. Okay.

768
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:33.360
JESSICA G: You got sick.

769
01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

770
01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

771
01:25:40.410 --> 01:25:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be okay we'll be okay. We get sick so

772
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine

773
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Catching that feeling of defeated early enough that you could remember to breathe. And remember, I'm okay.

774
01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't credit what he's saying, and how we assess as me and I'm going to use this skill of choosing curiosity over being right. You're not going to argue about being right.

775
01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're done with that one. For this particular exercise, you're done. Now you're just going to lean in announced the question.

776
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:18.090
JESSICA G: I think I need my journal

777
01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a hard one to pull off.

778
01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:22.320
Yeah.

779
01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.830
JESSICA G: Hold on one second. Okay.

780
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:54.690
JESSICA G: Baby

781
01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:01.500
JESSICA G: You want to take your medicine here.

782
01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.420
JESSICA G: Okay baby.

783
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:10.740
JESSICA G: What

784
01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting some cuddling.

785
01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So what we did just now remember that I interrupted you. And I said, let's talk about that skill you said you've already got the skills and what you wanted out of today was to do more insight and understanding and we haven't even gotten to that.

786
01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:55.920
JESSICA G: Well, I kind of regret I came in like regretted that once I said it because I knew that.

787
01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:08.460
JESSICA G: We, it was better to talk about the skills and what I should do I need to be better equipped on how to handle this situation and

788
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Because look what you started with. You said, Well, what's going on with me as about, you know, right.

789
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's situational and it's yes it is connected to a vulnerabilities probably brought into your life. Someone that's going to help you heal a wound from earlier but

790
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Your day to day life, whether you can cope with it really important, your ability to sort of manage it in a way where you feel it's adaptive

791
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to have as many skills as possible. So if you're writing anything down for me. I will tell you this is a specific skill of choosing curiosity over being right. And in fact, I'm going to put it in your relapse prevention plan.

792
01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I have other things in there. I have

793
01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: grounding in the five senses box breathing. I have

794
01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like

795
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: My drugs aged my body that was something negative consequences substance use, I'm worthy of respect with something you'd said just for today. I'm letting go of all of this weight I carry on my shoulders. That was something else. You said

796
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know my brain is healing because I'm actually processing everything starting from my childhood trauma. These are things you've said.

797
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This skill right here. This one I choose curiosity over being right will feel foreign and weird because most people spend their time coming up with evidence to win an argument.

798
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I already assume you're right.

799
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Follow that rely on that you're already right

800
01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But what will work in this moment with someone who doesn't work with logic, Jessica.

801
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Being right won't when

802
01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't use logic.

803
01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to keep using He's cold. You want to go. It's not gonna work.

804
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

805
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: If sometimes this one will be the right skill. Other times it may not

806
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But it could get you through a moment where you don't feel defeated instead you register. Ooh, this is a time with me. I'm already starting to feel sorry for myself. I'm feeling bad about me. My worthiness.

807
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: On that thermometer just went full sunk way down. Okay, this is it. What do I remember, I remember to breathe.

808
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: She said to remember. Choose curiosity over being right. Wow, how you do that.

809
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You ask a. How are you feeling about question of the other could deal with your mom.

810
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do anyone who wants to talk on a crazy level, it doesn't work from logic, who wants to hurt you. You want to shift the conversation.

811
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, Ramon, it's interesting that this is happening now is reminding me. I've been thinking about what has it been like for you.

812
01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: All this pressure on you to take care of us financially. I know I've shared my gratitude. But what's it really been like for you.

813
01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Now here's what happens to your self esteem. When you talk like that.

814
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't seem like your self esteem would go up like for someone to actually ask an open ended question watch to hold someone else's feelings.

815
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It must mean that I'm okay.

816
01:32:56.550 --> 01:33:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: To open my interest to someone else will wait. You know what that reinforces

817
01:33:02.730 --> 01:33:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine.

818
01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I can actually listen to your shit.

819
01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what that reinforces I'm fine.

820
01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If I can listen to you.

821
01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I must be fine. I have that to give. I'm not operating out of scarcity.

822
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is going to completely change the rules of the game.

823
01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The rule that set up the way it is now is you're supposed to get hurt.

824
01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not hurt you are curious. Well, hey,

825
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It just made me think about I'm sitting with no money and and and

826
01:33:51.810 --> 01:34:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe think about what I was just not. Not that I don't have an ability to jump out of the car and go, go get a corn dog. But what's it like for you to be responsible for us all that pressure and we have changed.

827
01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The game.

828
01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Very complicated because if you use the wrong tone. You're a phony. If you're not actually curious, Jessica, this won't work. It will feel like a game and he's skilled at it and may come at you with something else. So if it's genuine and this is why this is really key.

829
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can find even a point 0000001 interest.

830
01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: In what it's like for him.

831
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:44.250

833
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:15.330
JESSICA G: Medicine someone

834
01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: like sugary sweet.

835
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:23.790
JESSICA G: Yeah.

836
01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:30.180
JESSICA G: Know, he doesn't drink it. I know he likes to squirt it, so I'm gonna have to go find where he

837
01:35:31.410 --> 01:35:32.310
JESSICA G: Started a

838
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:33.810
JESSICA G: Clean

839
01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's be realistic here. Are you thinking all i won't remember this. Are you thinking, I don't know how to do it or I don't care about it, like, what, what's going on in your head.

840
01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.330
JESSICA G: Yeah, like I'm and

841
01:35:49.500 --> 01:36:01.230
JESSICA G: I'm going to give it a try, but I'm gonna have to try really hard because right now I'm like, I don't want to know. I don't want to even give him that, you know, but

842
01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:04.860
JESSICA G: What I'm doing right now is it working.

843
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And watch. He's already sending insults the differences, watch. I'm in charge. I'm directing the conversation. I'm not hurt what it says in the moment to your self esteem, self efficacy is I've got this in order for me to ask this question.

844
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to be okay. It forces. I'm actually okay

845
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You have steer the conversation and then maybe he will go into it's been hard. It's really hard. It's hard to be responsible. Yeah, I was thinking it might be. I'm thinking about getting a job to we've been talking about that.

846
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You are in charge in the conversation.

847
01:36:57.450 --> 01:37:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, right now it seems like what it's all it'll just feel overwhelming. Is that what you're thinking, what are you thinking

848
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:12.180
JESSICA G: I don't know, I think.

849
01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.760
JESSICA G: I would really have to like

850
01:37:18.570 --> 01:37:19.860
JESSICA G: Put my pride down

851
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:22.680
JESSICA G: When I do that.

852
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That you found it. That's exactly the moment because pride wants to be right.

853
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't it

854
01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It demands it.

855
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:45.810
So,

856
01:37:47.130 --> 01:37:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch what it looks like. Again,

857
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me your worst Dominic

858
01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me your worst criticisms.

859
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:05.250
JESSICA G: How are you even gonna pay

860
01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.430
JESSICA G: How are you even gonna pay

861
01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:16.710
JESSICA G: For the wreck. You don't even have money. How would you even pay all that right, I forgot you can't

862
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:19.980
JESSICA G: Pay

863
01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:23.100
JESSICA G: You don't do anything.

864
01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your worst. Come on. He says worse things in that. Let me hear it.

865
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:38.370
JESSICA G: Why can't you do it your freaking workplace.

866
01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah i can i can imagine I would look like that. I was thinking myself about my worth and maybe wonder, what is it like for you. Ramon to to have this burden on you to pay for things

867
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The game is who gets hurt the way he has it set up, who gets hurt.

868
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to keep playing by his rules where you get hurt you get hurt you get hurt. Okay. All right. So you have tried also using logic and evidence that you are worthy and does it work. Does he see your worth.

869
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So your way, as you said, doesn't work. So if we just change the game all together.

870
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you say to me if I said that I was thinking about my worthiness to just as we were driving in the parking lot and I was thinking I can't just jump out Ramon, what's it. What's it like for you. How does it feel for you to be responsible for for us.

871
01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, if you were going to respond to me. What do you

872
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you gonna say, if you remember

873
01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:06.930
JESSICA G: I don't know.

874
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. You don't because it's a different game.

875
01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, because I'm not hurt.

876
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To understand if we're if we're right and this is a gas later, which we're playing. We have a theory that maybe that's the case. Do you know they get fueled by any of your emotions, your happy ones, your negative ones, all of it.

877
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you get fueled by either one. So if you just don't have any

878
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're opting out of the game.

879
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Just decide I'm not going to let it hurt. I'm just

880
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I i say i do have value.

881
01:40:51.810 --> 01:41:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of let someone else to find me. This is really inconvenient right now but sure you've already got some a plan in mind on what you're going to do.

882
01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:02.430
Okay.

883
01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to try it. I'm going to come at you and I want you to feel the defeat the insult as it hits to notice where it feels if it's in the chest. For me, it's here the throat. I always feel stress reactions here.

884
01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's in your gut, maybe it's in your shortness of breath shoulders legs back hands sweaty headache.

885
01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:34.140
JESSICA G: Wherever you think it's like right here, like in the bottom. I feel like I get a ball.

886
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh that someone. Well guess what, that's where our larynx and fences, where we breathe. We speak we eat really important place right in here.

887
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So you recognize it as okay this is my signal, this is my signal, this is my signal to what my what brief.

888
01:41:52.650 --> 01:42:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then those few fractions of a second happen. So you're going to remember the number one brief number to choose curiosity over being right. You're going to care, even if it's a tiny little bit, you're going to ask a question about what I'm going through

889
01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In a nice sweet tone and a genuine telling you got to find the truth and otherwise you'll be snippy

890
01:42:13.890 --> 01:42:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it can be a phony because people pick up on that. But the point is, you don't get yourself hurt because now you're not feeling my narcissistic me. Okay, so here we go.

891
01:42:26.490 --> 01:42:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, why don't you take care of this. You just go handle it. You haven't seen him sooner. I'm just going to leave you in the mall and you can just work it out. You're so great.

892
01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Already right

893
01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to defend it. He's already rude insulting abusive that's already a fact you can change them. Those are already true PLEASE DO, JUMP past that new choose curiosity, what can you ask that you're genuinely interested in. Let's just see what comes up for you.

894
01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I was very nasty.

895
01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go.

896
01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: He's using his power over you to leave you in the mall.

897
01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not hurt.

898
01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see what's going on. You choose not to go crazy or get hurt.

899
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just say you're a psychologist and you wanted to deconstruct this man's thoughts. See if you can go there. What if you were the therapist, you were holding the baby and you were curious about

900
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what this man cares about right now, what of what he's worried about what everybody's afraid of. I wonder what his concerns are. Can you imagine that a psychologist or therapist might wonder what he's thinking might care.

901
01:44:44.850 --> 01:44:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Why

902
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.780
JESSICA G: Don't we

903
01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:49.470
JESSICA G: Go ahead. I kind of got some ideas. But I feel like

904
01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:57.990
JESSICA G: They're wrong like I was kind of thinking of asking him like, whoa, like, what's wrong with you like

905
01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, what's wrong with you, like, oh, that could go wrong with you, you basically said something wrong with you. You know what he's gonna say nothing, you idiot. Like, there's no way that'll work. You're right. That's that that one.

906
01:45:15.450 --> 01:45:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it has to have the actual content in it. Notice how every time I ask a question. It has I'm already directing him what to look at. I'm going to do it.

907
01:45:25.710 --> 01:45:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be me and Ramon told you

908
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.770
Okay.

909
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, oh yeah, leaving me alone would really be stressful. I'd be, you know, kind of left here with no resources.

910
01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is hard. That's, that's hard for me in this place.

911
01:45:45.480 --> 01:46:00.750
But it also makes me think about how hard it might be for you to have all of this burden on you to, to, to be in charge of where we go and picking up my medicine. Do we have food and paying the rent. What has it been like for you over this last year.

912
01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:04.140
In a you feeling the intensity of it now.

913
01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.390
What did you notice

914
01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:12.780
JESSICA G: Sorry, just

915
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:20.490
JESSICA G: He handed me a syringe and I didn't know. I thought it was empty. And I kind of squirted it at him.

916
01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:24.720
JESSICA G: With water, though he playing with water.

917
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you notice in my little role play

918
01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want me to do it again. Are you distracted with the baby or what do you need

919
01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.070
JESSICA G: I guess it feels like it's giving him a sense of like validation

920
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what, when someone has a narcissistic injury, Jessica, which it sounds like he does. That's exactly what he needs.

921
01:46:58.710 --> 01:47:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're not busy trying to preserve your pride. You just need to get home. Am I right, not be stuck with them all. And doesn't that help him.

922
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And it gets you home. You're not calling. What's wrong with you is showing that you're actually care.

923
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a different game.

924
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to opt out of all the games say f few you abusive MoFo. Call the police and move out. You ready for that game.

925
01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:34.350
No.

926
01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Plan, this one.

927
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:38.700
JESSICA G: Yeah.

928
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can. I mean, if you don't mind being a filter for a while or moms or whatever, you know I'm saying, like, you do have lots of other choices. I'm just giving you

929
01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That psychologically, you don't hurt. Hi.

930
01:47:54.330 --> 01:47:54.720
JESSICA G: Okay.

931
01:47:56.010 --> 01:47:56.310
JESSICA G: Good.

932
01:47:56.490 --> 01:47:57.780
JESSICA G: Very good.

933
01:47:58.590 --> 01:47:59.220
JESSICA G: Thank you.

934
01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

935
01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But in that's your pride right now. That was your pride talking that was, How dare I give him something he's trying to take a little bit, but I have he's going to take. That's his game. I'm telling you.

936
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Took his game, sweetheart. You have everything you need, you have actually elected to focus on your recovery and be with your son. I want you to think about that.

937
01:48:27.450 --> 01:48:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It is really inconvenient that he's using that. Right, let's face, but you've bought into it on some level, and you've said, Okay, I will tolerate this nonsense. But I get these benefits.

938
01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can sit with that you can do this part.

939
01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:51.630
JESSICA G: One second. Okay. No problem. No, I'm telling the baby.

940
01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

941
01:48:58.380 --> 01:48:59.460
JESSICA G: I'm gonna try it.

942
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:01.770
JESSICA G: I'm gonna just opt

943
01:49:02.610 --> 01:49:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Out you just opt out. I'm not gonna let in the the accusations what he's saying doesn't have credibility. Why do you live virtue.

944
01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You decide how you feel. You decide. Yeah.

945
01:49:40.650 --> 01:49:41.400
JESSICA G: He's thinking

946
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.550
Thinking thinking, thinking,

947
01:49:58.050 --> 01:49:58.500
JESSICA G: Okay.

948
01:50:05.670 --> 01:50:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a couple minutes before my next client comes in. So I want you to kind of take a look and see what

949
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: More reversal more review more discussion around pride.

950
01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Brainstorming worst case scenarios I think about what you need.

951
01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, listen.

952
01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You could decide, you could say, I'm not going to do it this way. That one's talking about. I'm gonna do my way for a while. I'm going to prove

953
01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to prove on right and I'm a good lovable person, you know what, finally, finally, you'll get it, you'll get it. I'll just keep hammering away at it.

954
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.780
He'll get it somebody

955
01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:01.830
JESSICA G: Well, I think. I don't want him to. I don't want, I don't care if he gets it or not anymore at all.

956
01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:04.380
JESSICA G: I just

957
01:51:05.610 --> 01:51:09.960
JESSICA G: It was just feeling stuck, you know, but I don't even don't even know why medical

958
01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: This are horrible things that are being sent to you. Sometimes they're going to get to us, but the quicker you catch it right in here. You feel the type

959
01:51:20.610 --> 01:51:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing in the throat. You feel it, you go, Okay, what's this thing. I'm going to try. I'm gonna try it opt out. He wants me to hurt. That's where he gets his fuel.

960
01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

961
01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, I don't have any credit for how this guy assesses man. I don't care what he says about me. I know my own worth and so I breathe.

962
01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I say, Ramon, I was thinking on the way over here.

963
01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What is this year been like you're having to take care of us.

964
01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:10.530
JESSICA G: But I need to make sure I'm like really grounded and

965
01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:12.750
JESSICA G: Have my wall.

966
01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, we got to do the skills for us. That's why I keep saying the breath is going to help you remember the other parts which is I was born lovable. You can picture your protective your nurturing wise figures around you.

967
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, what would we, you know, who would say these things maybe embracing that that sort of protective figure that confidence of like who would do the speaking right now. What if some people take on the voice of therapist, you can pretend I'm there.

968
01:52:41.070 --> 01:52:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, What would, what would she say what would she say to this, she would put a little snarky then she'd be like, Okay, this is a game. This isn't life or death. This is just a game. He's been setting the rules. If I keep showing up so distressed. He's thrilled.

969
01:52:59.610 --> 01:53:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I just

970
01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: My quiet defiance opt out.

971
01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, kind of hard, not being able to have my own money. Right. I say it. I'm true. Yeah, I know, it kind of sucks. I gotta gotta work on that. It's definitely on my, on my plan. I'm going to get a job, but it's made me think about what this has been like for you.

972
01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I have changed the rules and engagement.

973
01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not. I mean, you can do anything. Just stay quiet, don't say a word not lead a virtue right walls up I'm breathing, you're quiet. Maybe you never say a word.

974
01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just inside. You're like, You're a fool you don't hurt me. Sticks and stones. I don't know. That's another version.

975
01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're getting hurt over someone else's assessment of you. You don't even tell you what he thinks. But you're letting it hurt you.

976
01:53:59.670 --> 01:54:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't make any sense.

977
01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:02.670
Yeah.

978
01:54:09.690 --> 01:54:10.380
JESSICA G: Not even

979
01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter what he thinks it matters what you think of you. And so there's some part of what he's saying that you actually think is true. That's what concerns me

980
01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:36.030
JESSICA G: That I

981
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:41.250
JESSICA G: Know I do a good job. And I know I'm a good one.

982
01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we're at the top of the hour. Let's schedule. Again, but I also, I'm curious about

983
01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been kind of playing around with the idea of seeing what resources out there to kind of get back

984
01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Get back in the

985
01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Job world training.

986
01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:11.970
JESSICA G: Yeah, and I've been looking around and everything, but my mom.

987
01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:23.370
JESSICA G: I kind of made a plan. She said that if because I told her that I'm going to start working again. She said, okay, but before you start working thing you

988
01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:32.970
JESSICA G: Can you guys come over here for like a week. Oh, and so I was like okay, that, that's fine. That's fine.

989
01:55:34.170 --> 01:55:38.130
JESSICA G: I can go for like a week and then when I get back.

990
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:42.060
JESSICA G: Get back on it and

991
01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:50.010
JESSICA G: Start working so like the final like

992
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:55.800
JESSICA G: You know, little vacation before

993
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:59.790
JESSICA G: I start working. Okay.

994
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're okay with that.

995
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:07.290
JESSICA G: Yeah yeah I'm right. I know what my mom is trying to do, but it's not

996
01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting to live there or something where she what's her scheme.

997
01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:18.360
JESSICA G: She doesn't want me to go back go back to work, because she doesn't want me to leave the baby.

998
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would you ask me, where's that coming from

999
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:28.710
JESSICA G: Know, to leave him like to like leave him in a daycare with a babysitter or something.

1000
01:56:30.210 --> 01:56:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I find that really ironic right that she would say that, like, I don't

1001
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, wow.

1002
01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of projection, did she do a fair amount of neglect there.

1003
01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:46.830
JESSICA G: Oh, yeah.

1004
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:53.970
JESSICA G: Oh yeah, that's why I'm just like, man, I'm gonna go and make the best of it and

1005
01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:58.170
JESSICA G: Out of make sure I come back.

1006
01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:01.770
JESSICA G: When I said I'm gonna come back.

1007
01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you know what's up you can see what's going on.

1008
01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:07.770
JESSICA G: Yeah.

1009
01:57:08.190 --> 01:57:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What really so let's get

1010
01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Going I'm 11 O'clock next Monday's that still work for you.

1011
01:57:16.110 --> 01:57:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. That's beautiful. Play with it, see if you like it, tell me how hard it is, tell me some of the work. None of it works. I completely forgot, whatever it is. I'm interested in the whole spectrum. Okay, brief.

1012
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably it'll be body you're gonna feel it. First, you'll breathe. Then you'll remember

1013
01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll notice is the body responds before. Okay, it's going to do it long before you're going to get words for things and memories.

1014
01:57:41.730 --> 01:57:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The body's going to respond. You're going to feel it here instantaneously. As soon as a threat response happens you're going to feel that that not right here and you'll say, okay, what what what's, what is this, I need to breathe.

1015
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna remember the phrase what

1016
01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you guys remember

1017
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Choose curiosity over being right.

1018
01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:08.970
Yes.

1019
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:13.080
JESSICA G: Choose curiosity over

1020
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What point 0000000 a piece of curiosity. Do I have. I don't love love love love love love like loving love love him. But for this moment. And it changed the rules of engagement and I'm going to ask a question about how how he's doing around this. I hope he feels

1021
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: He feels

1022
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The pride, leave it at home in the freezer.

1023
01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, little mama. I will see you Monday ANA

1024
01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.860
JESSICA G: Okay, thank you.

1025
01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's connected to group.

1026
01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:55.050
JESSICA G: Yeah. Okay. Cool.

1027
01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:55.530
