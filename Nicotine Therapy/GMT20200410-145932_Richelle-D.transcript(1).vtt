Daron B: You get that bad word. I never saw my daughter, my kids and software about I think like that.

44
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.690
Daron B: I mean,

45
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.390
Richelle Direny: I can get like that.

46
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.280
Daron B: I can't. No.

47
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.980
Daron B: I can't allow myself to get one. I

48
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.610
Richelle Direny: Mean

49
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.850
Richelle Direny: It's, it's, it's great that you you know you'd like to think of your children, but so

50
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.110
Richelle Direny: Did everybody else who has done stuff like that who has

51
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.340
Daron B: Children, because the

52
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.570
Daron B: Older kids his kids like she shouldn't be about

53
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.440
Daron B: This owners should be about like maybe 1617

54
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.530
Daron B: Right now, he's got a couple of younger ones are probably like 10 or 11

55
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.330
Richelle Direny: So for him,

56
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:45.480
Richelle Direny: He's thinking about his kids and he's saying he may be better off gone because then it won't have to see him like that. So it's all a matter of

57
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:55.890
Richelle Direny: How are you really truly looking at life are you looking as at my fist constantly being defeated, or are you looking at life like this too shall pass.

58
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.100
Daron B: Life like

59
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:16.860
Daron B: Things happen like I can put it like as in like, you know what I mean, like, take what he did, or two I will do is I feel like I could do that too. So I'm kind of up to it to myself for me to do that. Anyways,

60
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.690
Daron B: Just say

61
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.100
Richelle Direny: I mean, so it's not a bad thing.

62
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.360
Richelle Direny: It's a good thing that you admit to it areas.

63
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.400
Richelle Direny: To into myself.

64
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.970
Daron B: Right, and I'm a Christian. So

65
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.550
Richelle Direny: You are

66
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.950
Daron B: Yes, and definitely Kirsten

67
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.530
Richelle Direny: Okay, because I know you said that your mom is into the God thing. And when you said it like that. Okay.

68
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.500
Daron B: Definitely a Christian.

69
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.820
Daron B: Noah's it says in the Bible. Take your own life, you know,

70
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.530
Daron B: That's not

71
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.180
Richelle Direny: A belongs to you. Right.

72
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.320
Yeah.

73
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:13.800
Richelle Direny: But you know, I mean, but the reality of it is life does happen, we lose hope, especially in a time like. Now, when you're not working or you have bills to pay.

74
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.020
Richelle Direny: You have going on.

75
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.060
Richelle Direny: One does tend to feel hopeless, um,

76
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:31.320
Richelle Direny: I don't know for you, but I know oftentimes everyone's complaining, who has children is that when their home, they eat they eat a whole lot more.

77
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.460
Daron B: My phrase was just cleared out. I went to spit like almost $300 which probably will be cleared out within the next

78
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.400
Daron B: Probably like two, three more days.

79
00:06:48.570 --> 00:07:06.630
Daron B: I cook a lot like really like very, very, very good could probably to open up a restaurant, one day, like I'm very good at it like I cook a lot. So sometimes it's also me cooking like for like a million people when there's not a million people here. You mean

80
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:16.740
Richelle Direny: But it's okay so I know some culture, what it's one thing to cook and that's good that you like to cook. Maybe you could move here and cook for me because

81
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.100
Richelle Direny: I don't know.

82
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:25.980
Richelle Direny: But, um, but it's one thing to cook. But then in wisdom, you're saying all right.

83
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:35.580
Richelle Direny: let's cook these meals or cook these things. So the food doesn't go bad, because things that are you can't leave certain things in the refrigerator tool on because then it will eventually go back

84
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:46.890
Richelle Direny: So if you cook it and you tell everyone. Listen, your it's going to be portion out because whatever we have has to last for a period of time.

85
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:55.230
Richelle Direny: Like I'm sure as much as you go and use, but I know when I spent $300 at the grocery store like I wanted to cry because that's a lot.

86
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.690
Daron B: And

87
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:07.230
Richelle Direny: Then when you're doing that every week or every other week, simply because they're consuming more because they're home. And when you're home. You think you're hungry when you're really not.

88
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.240
Daron B: Arrive right

89
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:17.130
Daron B: So it's crazy cuz he you know I'll be like, You just ate hard Dad Well,

90
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.530
Daron B: No.

91
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.320
Daron B: I get that a lot.

92
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.880
Richelle Direny: So you tell them you have to use your school stomachs.

93
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.370
Richelle Direny: When you're a home, you have to, you have to if you're in school, would you be eating a million times your day.

94
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.470
Richelle Direny: No. No, you wouldn't.

95
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.670
Richelle Direny: It HELL YOU EAT YOU EAT maybe twice for the day.

96
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.500
Richelle Direny: We're cool.

97
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:53.910
Richelle Direny: So let's think like we're in school. And when you come home, you get a snack. And then you have to wait till dinner. So technically, there's really four times that you're really consuming food. So let's act like we're in school every day.

98
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.740
Daron B: Every day.

99
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.180
Richelle Direny: And it's hard.

100
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.600
Richelle Direny: But, but you have to be because and the reason why I'm saying it that way.

101
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:15.510
Richelle Direny: Sometimes it's hard to conceptualize and to grasp it, because what you're doing is that you're stopping yourself from getting overwhelmed tomorrow when you realize that

102
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.510
Richelle Direny: The food is finish.

103
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.530
Daron B: Right.

104
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.230
Richelle Direny: I have no money to go get more food.

105
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.140
Richelle Direny: Right six little kids are looking at me.

106
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.540
Richelle Direny: What am I supposed to do.

107
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.570
Richelle Direny: You can go to bed hungry and you can go on a fast.

108
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.760
Daron B: But they can

109
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.000
Richelle Direny: They can, but do they understand it.

110
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:49.740
Richelle Direny: So, you know, do you know when it so no by no means am I suggesting that you do this.

111
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.310
Right.

112
00:09:51.930 --> 00:10:03.930
Richelle Direny: I know. Like sometimes like if I might hit say, Oh, I'm starving. I'm like, oh you starve it okay let me pull up some look children from Africa. Let me show you what starving look like. Don't tell me you starving, because you don't look like this.

113
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:16.320
Richelle Direny: And so it is you're hungry. Okay, but you just ate an hour ago. So you're not hungry, you just feel like you're hungry so you could wait till lunch, or you could wait till things are prepared.

114
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:31.170
Richelle Direny: So it's just really reiterating that concept because you also have to think about your own mental health, your own stressors. If you and your, your, your children's mother you you have a little bit of income coming in.

115
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.110
Richelle Direny: The fields needs to be paid everything needs to be done.

116
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.120
Richelle Direny: You have to really think about what is what

117
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.410
Richelle Direny: And I see that you smoke so you also have to support that habit. Right.

118
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.670
Daron B: Yeah, I love to cook this is bad.

119
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.140
Daron B: terrible way to get like hear my voice right

120
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.230
Daron B: Yeah.

121
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.360
Richelle Direny: And

122
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:02.640
Richelle Direny: There's so much to think about. That's why I said like life does happen, but then you don't know how life will hit you.

123
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:18.780
Richelle Direny: And it will hit, hit you as a consequence to the small things like I you know I another group that I do. You're not a part of this group, but another group that I do. It was where we were talking about the coronavirus and you we talked about

124
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.420
Daron B: Something you're thinking, oh, well, I'm a healthy person. There's really nothing wrong with me.

125
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:30.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, there's nothing wrong with you. You've never been told, something is wrong with you, but I noticed that you're a smoker.

126
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.380
Richelle Direny: When you get sick.

127
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.560
Richelle Direny: Can your lungs handle all of that.

128
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.980
Daron B: For every so often.

129
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.940
Daron B: You sure makes it

130
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.030
Richelle Direny: When you get sick. How, how did when you get sick is

131
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.810
Richelle Direny: Our home if it's a

132
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:59.370
Daron B: Respiratory call it's pretty good news, good, bad, no, you can't breathe.

133
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.170
Richelle Direny: You when you cough. It's just like until it lingers longer it's worse for you.

134
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.300
Richelle Direny: Because you can't handle it.

135
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:22.710
Daron B: Right, here's a hack in your life. I just a little brief. I know you don't think you're about to sit right next to me to turn a video game or we say in a meeting, right. All right, give me a minute let me

136
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.860
Daron B: See, yeah.

137
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.690
Richelle Direny: Well, I'm guessing everybody's back home from grandma's

138
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:43.650
Daron B: From there, but there was we told him. Well, they've been with me all week for the weekend to go back when tired man aren't given back during the week when she goes to work.

139
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.340
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you share custody of all your kids.

140
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:55.800
Daron B: Joby not legally. But yeah, Malaysian was legally said I have not paid on is the child support for a reason. But yeah.

141
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.390
Richelle Direny: That's a conversation for

142
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.970
Richelle Direny: You say you wish evil.

143
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:04.980
Daron B: Right.

144
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.120
I don't think you wish you

145
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:19.500
Daron B: Know I wish it was like, yeah, does that I was paying the light. Where are we taking care of through the week. So why would I be paying child support. Well, you already have weakens your

384
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.640
Know,

385
00:33:52.290 --> 00:34:04.020
Daron B: I mean, I just want to do your music and just get it out. I really couldn't care less about performance. I mean like I right or right or be music to, you know, be like, I would like to be a songwriter.

386
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.000

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:31.500
Daron B: But most people own their own businesses as far as food.

392
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:33.360

444
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:54.390
Richelle Direny: Is it that it's just music wanting to be a songwriter RMB. Like, what exactly are you looking to do you say that you're a Christian, but how does that look like for you going into that music industry.

445
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.950
Richelle Direny: Are your beliefs. What is it that you want to, what are your standards.

446
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.750
Daron B: For

447
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.550
Daron B: I don't know. We saw it like this.

448
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.720
Daron B: America, right. The third thing I want to do is, like I said, I

449
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.940
Daron B: Go about getting the things I need to be able to do it.

450
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:19.980
Daron B: You know what I mean.

451
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.450
Richelle Direny: But, but, as I'm saying what I'm asking you is

452
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:34.260
Richelle Direny: What it is that you out of, out of the hundreds of things that you just named out that you do that you're a part of your

453
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.380
Richelle Direny: Two things that I absolutely love

454
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:50.190
Richelle Direny: But you need to now pick apart those two things and ask yourself what is it that I really and then come, bring it down to those two things. One of them is going to have to

455
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:51.810
Richelle Direny: Take

456
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.490
Daron B: Is in

457
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.760
Richelle Direny: The music industry. What does that look like for you.

458
00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.860
Daron B: All these people

459
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.270
Richelle Direny: You've been around.

460
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:06.060
Daron B: In terms of people trying to do the same thing. I feel like I just like, you know what I mean, like,

461
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:14.790
Daron B: The music, things like we're like, just under release things you know name when I write like to release stuff that's in my head, then

462
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:26.970
Daron B: Like I said over there just sober music and actually like be all the way in there like you know me, my performing and everything. I felt like we'll get into the old woman.

463
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:30.690
Daron B: You know, so

464
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:49.710
Daron B: Yeah, I mean, like the food thing will be like a really big thing to do. She's, she's a great coach, just like me, like we could do together and be able to work on that together just going about getting it out. You know what I mean.

465
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:56.580
Richelle Direny: When I hear you're saying in everything that you go back to your keeping it on it. You're not taking it out.

466
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.530
Richelle Direny: Actions to match what's in here.

467
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:03.090
Daron B: Right.

468
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.730
Daron B: Gotta move switching mode or

469
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.160
Daron B: Buddy.

470
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.240
Richelle Direny: Good. You said he has to look at you.

471
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.030
Daron B: As a bottle or so.

472
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.230
Daron B: We'll see the talk to him the host stop.

473
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.410
Daron B: Hey. Hey. Hey daddy right here.

474
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.420
Daron B: Grab your brother, real quick.

475
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.540
Daron B: Where's this bottle.

476
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.060
Daron B: Bottle is

477
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.090
Daron B: Might want to use the restroom, or he needs to change his diaper so

478
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.350
Daron B: Oh no, I said, Oh, my head so double tired still

479
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:29.130
Richelle Direny: What do you do to get the thoughts you have and put it on paper.

480
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.260
Daron B: I don't even know where it comes from everybody like bro, the lot of

481
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:44.310
Daron B: The Urban music you even think it was me. A lot of it will be like tennis, it's like, why are you not doing this and this. I'm like, I don't even know where it comes from.

482
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:59.310
Daron B: I just start writing and and again until whole wide set of, like, Oh no, I hear it, like, because I'm going to make my own beats and everything right, very good at this stuff like you don't understand if I send you my music. You would not believe it.

483
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.100
Daron B: I got very, very good at this.

484
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.680
Richelle Direny: So what's stopping you from

485
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:13.320
Richelle Direny: Putting things into taking what's in your head and putting into action and seeing it come to life.

486
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:20.820
Daron B: There's always something gets was always sort of throws. We're out of fellowship are doing things out what to do.

487
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.970
Richelle Direny: And what did name one thing, the most recent

488
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:37.200
Daron B: Well, I got a star right and then Susa right and there's a kid proves it or I start writing soon as I start to see you.

489
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.020
Richelle Direny: Take yourself out of the house and go somewhere where there's no disruption.

490
00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.220
Daron B: Yeah, that doesn't happen.

491
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.340
Daron B: By leave. It's hail.

492
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:59.010
Daron B: Rochelle like for it to be like some crazy as arguing over something one I would even work.

493
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:12.180
Richelle Direny: So, okay. So in the moments gets asleep during the day. Wake up when everybody's everybody's asleep in the middle of the night, do your work. So then what

494
00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.830
Daron B: You got to come up with

495
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.830
Daron B: Now, I know, but that won't happen. Right. You're fired. Move. It's where you go.

496
00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.570
Richelle Direny: To the kitchen to go write something

497
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.250
Daron B: You know,

498
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.650
Daron B: That'd be argument.

499
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.280
Richelle Direny: Is there a history why there's the paranoia.

500
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.510
Daron B: I mean, kind of, I'm not really though because it don't

501
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.790
Richelle Direny: Say, not really. Which one is it

502
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:54.420
Daron B: I mean like past of like before we even got together. I mean, knew that. That's old let it go.

503
00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:09.000
Richelle Direny: So what is it that you okay let's let's reach free frame it or restructure it, what is it that you can do to take what's in here.

504
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:22.260
Richelle Direny: Put it into action. Keep the wheels turning where the byproduct of it is supporting you and your family and being in a better place. That's what you're working towards

505
00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:22.890
And

506
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.110
Daron B: Possibly

507
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:33.420
Daron B: more plausible have a situation where would be. We need to do more food. But like I said,

508
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:40.020
Daron B: I have to figure out how to go to throwing that legal like it's already

509
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:41.370
Richelle Direny: Their

510
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:49.200
Daron B: purpose was to do is just, I didn't have what I need it as far as being able to sell food.

511
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:51.660
Daron B: Is not going to turn

512
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.070
Richelle Direny: Okay, so now you're in quarantine.

513
00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.820
Richelle Direny: Everybody's informed, how

514
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:17.220
Richelle Direny: Heather, you take some time together to figure out doing your research online writing it down. And so when everything starts opening back up. You can get out there and do what it is that you need to do.

515
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.620
Richelle Direny: Now on asking how can you do that.

516
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:26.550
Richelle Direny: Because saying, I don't know how to do it.

517
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.170
What are you doing,

518
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:36.810
Daron B: Google just look up things like center be able to have time to sit down and be able to look up what I needed to get done.

519
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:43.080
Daron B: I mean pretty much everything else I can do as far as getting the food. I know have no problem getting the food.

520
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:59.760
Daron B: And I'll have no problem getting into containers. I don't have no problem getting the bags and things that I need to be able to do it. I just, I have I'm having a problem of figuring out my though the legal way and we be able to do it.

521
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.300
Richelle Direny: So, which is getting your which is getting your vendor's license.

522
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.290
Right.

523
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:05.670
Daron B: Right.

524
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:06.060
Oh,

525
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:14.790
Richelle Direny: And getting your vendor's license what it is that you in her because you're talking about you guys doing this together. Right.

526
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:15.750
Yeah.

527
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:30.210
Richelle Direny: So what is it that you can both do in terms of doing your research so that the first thing that you do once everything starts opening back up is going out and getting your vendors license.

528
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.350
Word.

529
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:33.720
Daron B: Away. Like, look it up.

530
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:45.900
Daron B: It's like really really figure it out studies as a study or what the what I need to get done. You know what I mean to read up what how to go about doing it or probably could be doing

531
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.520
Richelle Direny: A vendor's license. Isn't it something that you're applying for through the state.

532
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:57.270
Daron B: Yeah, that's what I mean like, but I gotta figure out how to even apply to the state, you know,

533
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:14.070
Richelle Direny: So you go on the website. The state's website. Sometimes they have like a search a search on the top where it says obtaining vendor's license and it will take you to whatever page and it gives you a list of what it everything that you need to do in order to obtain this license.

534
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:27.960
Daron B: Right. I mean, I could double check. I'll check it on. I'm just gonna say like, so like I'm talking about good. Sorry. Then I'll probably get aggravated my the middle

535
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:42.750
Daron B: Because like I just certain things. I will understand, and then later when I need that help to figure it out like some I also do busy or, you know, maybe now just lose interest by that time.

536
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:58.380
Richelle Direny: Or could it be that you just have way too much on your mind and away all these things. And then all these ideas that you have that when it takes when it comes down to putting it in motion, you get overwhelmed and you start saying, oh, I don't understand. Oh.

537
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.170
Richelle Direny: And then could it be that

538
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.750
Daron B: Good. Is that a lot

539
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.690
Richelle Direny: Because it doesn't say it's nothing to understand. It's not like you're taking a test. At least I wouldn't

540
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.100
Work.

541
00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:21.330
Richelle Direny: It's just like it's going to be blunt and just say, it sounds like much more of a cop out because then you have 10 things on your mind.

542
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:26.370
Richelle Direny: And when you're forced to focus on the one thing

543
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.270
Richelle Direny: It's very hard for you to focus on the one thing

544
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.500
Yeah.

545
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:43.140
Richelle Direny: What do you do in when you're in when you're when you're writing your music. Are you able to focus on what it is that you're writing

546
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:44.790
Daron B: Do

547
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.720
Richelle Direny: You understand everything that you're doing when you're writing

548
00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:49.770
Yeah.

549
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:59.730
Richelle Direny: And you put a you formulate because I mean with music with rap or whatever it's art because it's like it's almost like a point

550
00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:00.870
Daron B: That you're right. Yeah.

551
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.430
Daron B: Very, very time poetry setting, especially to do real hip hop.

552
00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's a point

553
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.840
Richelle Direny: But then to do this but like I remember in school when they were teaching us to write poems I didn't like it.

554
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:16.350
Richelle Direny: Because you got a rhyme, the different things and it has the flow.

555
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.150
Daron B: And it's always rumors.

556
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:25.650
Daron B: Is the windows at school, when the class will have to do posts and we'd have like a little bit. I'd win those

557
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.850
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and I would be the one that will been cheating because I've been looking at your paper.

558
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:34.140
Daron B: That would have been me. Oh, very good poetry.

559
00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:43.740
Richelle Direny: Okay, but that's an art within itself. So if you can do that. It tells me you can focus. You can zoom in on the one thing you can

560
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.710
Richelle Direny: You're just opting not to

561
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:59.520
Richelle Direny: Because that's what you're passionate about what you love what you think about when you wake up when you go to sleep throughout the day is what you put your time and energy into

562
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:13.140
Richelle Direny: Everything else is a byproduct to that everything I have time, I like it, but no. Oh, somebody else do it. I'll do the end thing you do all the work that goes along with it. But when it comes on to your music know

563
00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:24.210
Richelle Direny: Leave me be, let me do my thing we want to start it. You want it to you, you can completely focus in you can zoom in on it. Tell me where I'm wrong.

564
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.510
Daron B: Right.

565
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.630
Richelle Direny: No. No. Tell me wearing what I just said, I'm wrong.

566
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.400
Richelle Direny: So what are you going to do, I mean,

567
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.030
Richelle Direny: You're frustrating yourself you're

568
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.380
Richelle Direny: Overwhelming yourself.

569
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:59.340
Richelle Direny: It is not like overwhelming you it is not things that's overwhelming you it's Deron overwhelming daring because Darren is saying, I want to do this. I want to do this. I like this and I like that. And I like this. I can make money in all these different areas.

570
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:12.510
Richelle Direny: NOTHING STICKS because you don't put the time and energy into it because what your passion is what your deepest desire is what your love is

571
00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:29.490
Richelle Direny: Is music and there's nothing wrong with that. Because I think by itself. I love music I like listening to music. I personally don't care for rap. But I have to say the one rapper that I really did like truly, truly did love is DMX

572
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:39.900
Richelle Direny: Because you understood what he was saying his words were very clear. It wasn't like, what the hell are you talking about money.

573
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.000
Daron B: Like

574
00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:45.030
Richelle Direny: That was the only rapper that I would sit and listen to

575
00:51:46.680 --> 00:52:01.890
Richelle Direny: Um, so, but that was art. That was a gift. I love listening to music. I can't really sing a lick. But I love listening to it. One day I wish when I in this in my next life. I will be a singer, but that's a gift.

576
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.220
Daron B: As either say her so she is

577
00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:07.650
Daron B: really dope answer.

578
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:12.150
Daron B: Who your real friends. Yeah, this is very dope.

579
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.700
Richelle Direny: Then, if that's what you love.

Richelle Direny: Hi Brittany.

672
00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:58.680
Hello.

673
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:00.570
Richelle Direny: How are you

674
01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:02.010
I'm all right.

675
01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:05.430
Richelle Direny: I'm good, I'm good.

676
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:07.710
Richelle Direny: Let's see.

677
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:21.390
Richelle Direny: How is everything going. I know you were gonna figure out, like when we met in group, you were talking about your landlord and everything that was going on with your landlord.

678
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:27.600
Brittany Dingess: I haven't heard from Oregon, we paid ran this way and

679
01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:33.510
Brittany Dingess: I haven't heard anything else about her wanting to sell the house.

680
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.390
Richelle Direny: Did you did you know what, remember you were going to look into.

681
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:55.020
Brittany Dingess: The houses and apparently it's in a guy i don't i'm not ever met this guy, but he is your local realtor. The house is technically, and he his name. According to like the

682
01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:58.020
Brittany Dingess: I looked online for

683
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:05.400
Brittany Dingess: Like property records and stuff and the houses in this guy's name. He's a local realtor

684
01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:06.960
Brittany Dingess: And

685
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:19.470
Brittany Dingess: So I and I tried to reach him and I have not gotten a call back or I messaged him on Facebook and I have not received a message or a call or anything.

686
01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.000
Brittany Dingess: So I don't really know what the story is with with that.

687
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:31.680
Richelle Direny: Huh.

688
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:38.520
Richelle Direny: So, I mean, you just have to give it time because remember everything right now is

689
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:43.680
Richelle Direny: Everything right now with everything being on lockdown. If you send

690
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.420
Richelle Direny: Messages or anything like that.

691
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:52.590
Richelle Direny: But so if it's in a realtors name. That means that she was using

692
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.590
Richelle Direny: A real estate company to rent it out.

693
01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:11.040
Brittany Dingess: Well, from what I understand from what I've been, this is just kind of hearsay. How much of it is accurate. She apparently was doing a rent to own that thing from this guy.

694
01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:30.750
Brittany Dingess: And then his bike basically kind of like subletting the house out to us. Mm hmm. Um, I don't know how much she's paid in or how close. She is to being, you know, having it paid off and they only been in her nine. I'm not really been able to find out.

695
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:50.250
Brittany Dingess: A lot. But it does appraise I mean the house. It was appraised I think five or six years ago and it appraises for almost $100,000 so you know it's, it would be a good investment, but it still needs a lot of work done.

696
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:53.700
Brittany Dingess: Which I mean

697
01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:05.850
Brittany Dingess: Where we just don't have the income really to just walk in and, you know, buy a house that doesn't need anything that's already halfway want it to come anyway so

698
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:11.340
Brittany Dingess: You know, I have always expected to put some work into it.

699
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.630
Brittany Dingess: And I just want to make sure that

700
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:28.050
Brittany Dingess: We're not gonna you know if she does all end up offering us the chance to buy it. I don't want to end up making a mistake, like, you know, legally and have something

701
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:32.580
Brittany Dingess: You know, weird going on.

702
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.350
Mm hmm.

703
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:47.820
Richelle Direny: I mean, it's something. It's definitely homework that you can, you know, to, to kind of see where things are where thats related. You know what that's concerned it's definitely something to look into, I would say.

704
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.800
Richelle Direny: In the at the same time.

705
01:03:55.710 --> 01:04:05.370
Richelle Direny: Hold on, let me pull up yourself at the same time. You just have to decide if she wants you to move out. And she's trying to get you to move out. You have to look into.

706
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:11.400
Richelle Direny: You know what your options are. Do you want to buy it. Is it is it

707
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:19.800
Richelle Direny: Financially, is it a good thing for you guys to invest in it or buy it, knowing that it has the potentials

708
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:32.700
Richelle Direny: You know, is there any liens on it. You want to, I mean, and that's what a real estate attorney will do or. Yeah, real estate attorney, they will look into. Is there any liens. What is going on with the house. So it's something to definitely look into.

709
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.120
Richelle Direny: And doing everything, you know, all within the legal parameters that are there.

710
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:41.640
Brittany Dingess: I just

711
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:59.550
Brittany Dingess: All of the feedback. I've received, and this has been from people at the courthouse from police officers in this area has all been incredibly negative feedback just about of our landlord and her husband and how they

712
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:05.400
Brittany Dingess: Have a pattern of basically trying to

713
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.500
Brittany Dingess: You know,

714
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.310
Brittany Dingess: I mean to say it. Candidly, they just have a pattern. I'm trying to screw people out of their money.

715
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:28.050
Brittany Dingess: You know, any which way is that is possible. And I know that she's got a couple of civil lawsuits against her. So, you know, that's why I can't help but feel like she has a hidden agenda with it or she's about to

716
01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:34.230
Brittany Dingess: Lose it or something's about to happen with it. But no, I

717
01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:40.680
Brittany Dingess: I think if she offers to sell it to us. I would

718
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:51.210
Brittany Dingess: Ultimately prefer to try to get like an FHA loan or something so that we would owe the bank and not owe her

719
01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:54.990
Brittany Dingess: Hey, you know, buying crap from her and

720
01:05:56.970 --> 01:06:01.080
Richelle Direny: I know, I know. The nice thing with FHA and I real estate attorney or

721
01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.200
Richelle Direny: What you call it will tell you this.

722
01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.120
Richelle Direny: Was an FHA loan.

723
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.720
Richelle Direny: Is that they're because they're protecting their investment.

724
01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:14.520
Richelle Direny: Their money.

725
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.340
Richelle Direny: Um,

726
01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:30.420
Richelle Direny: It's because it's because they're ultimately in protecting their investment there you're going to be protected from it as well because with FHA

727
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:41.730
Richelle Direny: Is that they're not going to allow the seller to sell them the property for more than it's worth.

728
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:49.950
Richelle Direny: Right. They're not going to allow the seller to sell something that needs a lot of work.

729
01:06:50.970 --> 01:07:04.590
Richelle Direny: And then they're trying to basically sell you like what they say, with the car thing like a lemon. They're trying to sell you on home that it it has. So that's and they make you do. I think they make you to an inspection.

730
01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:06.810
Richelle Direny: They make you do like

731
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.940
Richelle Direny: What is it called

732
01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:26.640
Richelle Direny: Appraisal they make you do all this stuff because they want to ensure that these things are rectified before you sell the home. So let's say you do an inspection and the inspector comes out and they said hey listen. There's like $10,000 worth of work that needs to be done here.

733
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:36.750
Richelle Direny: FHA will tell you you need you need to do some Batman. Or you would have to come down $10,000 on your asking price.

734
01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:45.180
Brittany Dingess: No, I mean I know like from what we can see. Structurally, it looks good. However,

735
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:56.490
Brittany Dingess: I mean termites and that kind of stuff are not always visible and this is the like structurally and the only thing that worries me is

736
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:02.190
Brittany Dingess: It's been probably like four or five years ago.

737
01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:25.680
Brittany Dingess: The house was I think being rented to this elderly gentleman anyway drove his car into the end of the house. And essentially, I guess it like almost collapsed. So I had to dig out at one end of the house, like a huge ditch to go up under the house and put it on a deck, so

738
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:36.510
Brittany Dingess: That whole end of the house. Like it's, I mean, it's almost laughable. But it's kind of like it goes, kind of like it a slight angle. You know, like it's

739
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:46.680
Brittany Dingess: Not so noticeable when you're walking on it. But if you go to put like furniture in one of the back bedrooms, or something. That's pretty noticeable and

740
01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.160
Brittany Dingess: I'm not ever like really I don't know too much about how that works to fix that.

741
01:08:53.730 --> 01:09:10.110
Brittany Dingess: A husband, so that they'll have to jack up the end of the house and put it on like some kind of supports, but I mean what ultimately it ended up doing this House previously didn't have any kind of basement. Now it's got personal unfinished basement. They put that into the house up on

742
01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:27.780
Brittany Dingess: cinderblock Foundation and the main floor support that goes through the whole house a bomb attack which, I mean, I don't know. I don't know if that will pass inspection or not. I'm not sure how like how that kind of stuff goes

743
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:32.160
Richelle Direny: That's what I'm saying. And that's if when you're when you're getting ready to buy a house.

744
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.870
Richelle Direny: That's what that will do

745
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.760
Richelle Direny: That's what the inspection does

746
01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.340
Richelle Direny: You're in Tennessee. Right.

747
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:39.570
Yeah.

748
01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:54.720
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so that's what the inspection. The inspector will do. I mean, I know. I don't know if I would think that it would be the same or anywhere you go. But I know here in Florida. That's one of the reasons why you know

749
01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:02.160
Richelle Direny: When you're doing when you're purchasing a home. I think it's elective the inspection. You don't have to

750
01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:13.800
Richelle Direny: But a lot of people do inspection, you pay three $400 to get someone to come out and inspect your house. And the reason why they're doing that is that they're telling you all of the things

751
01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.850
Richelle Direny: Because they're checking for termites, they're checking for all that stuff.

752
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.560
Richelle Direny: As it's related to your state, some of the things that are prevalent in that state and in homes or whatever they're checking for all of that.

753
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:34.560
Richelle Direny: So when they check all of that when they finish their report they send you a very detailed report on everything that they think that needs to be done.

754
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:49.770
Richelle Direny: Like here in Florida. One of the things that they talk. They tell you, like, for us it's imperative, like we have to have a cooling system we have to have your condition, we have to. There are certain essential that you need in your house like we don't need heating because, I mean,

755
01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:52.290
Brittany Dingess: It never really gets to go

756
01:10:52.410 --> 01:11:07.140
Richelle Direny: It doesn't get too cold, but you need you need cooling. You need central air because you will suffocate and die in these places. So, like, if, if, first of all, like for FHA

757
01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:26.340
Richelle Direny: They would come in and they would say, hey, the air condition is old and it needs to be changed. And this is can't know. So the seller will have to change it or they will have to give you money towards it to get it changed. Um,

758
01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:30.090
Richelle Direny: You know I know that's one thing that needs to be replaced here.

759
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:44.010
Brittany Dingess: Is the central heating air and there's no well there's like an inadequate insulation over part of the house. There's an attic there, you know, an attic, you can actually go up into

760
01:11:45.150 --> 01:12:07.590
Brittany Dingess: But there's not adequate, or I guess maybe it's old. But anyway, so in the summertime, and part of the house was built the most of the house was built in like 1930 something. But then in the 70s, they built on this huge room was a fireplace and stuff. And that room has no

761
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:20.820
Brittany Dingess: Insulation it because it doesn't have an attic. It's like the exposed beams. You know, it's really pretty large cosmetically but in the summertime, it'll get 85 degrees in this room with the air conditioning on

762
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:30.450
Brittany Dingess: Because there's no insulation and there's eight windows and one room and I mean it's just, you know, I know that there's stuff that needs to be

763
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:37.200
Brittany Dingess: Done. But as far as putting insulation in this one room. I don't. I mean, it will take

764
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.270
Brittany Dingess: A lot of work.

765
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:41.880
Brittany Dingess: You have to put a ceiling in and

766
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:55.740
Brittany Dingess: So, and I know the H back system doesn't mean it's not like super old it works. It's just it struggles from top of

767
01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.280
Richelle Direny: You know, to keep it like things like that.

768
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:17.220
Richelle Direny: Things like that, you would need to, um, you know, that's what FHA protects you from, um, so let's you know let's say in a specifically FHA because FHA, the bank won't sell you. So like again here essential items like you need

769
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:27.600
Richelle Direny: Zoom. You don't need a washer and dryer, but you need a stove in a refrigerator. You don't need a microwave. You don't need a dishwasher. But you need a stove in a refrigerator.

770
01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:40.800
Richelle Direny: So if the house doesn't have these essential items they won't allow you to sell the house, unless you have these essential items that are working so

771
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:57.720
Richelle Direny: Like or running water or a water heater. So before you close on the loan. So these are the things. And so, towards the end of you closing on the house if let's say your water heater breaks down that stops the purchase of the house because now the seller has to fix it.

772
01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:58.860
Yeah.

773
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:13.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. So like I think that happened to us want us were right before we close her home. They came to do a last the very last inspection.

774
01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:23.550
Richelle Direny: And when they came to do the very last inspection the water heater went completely we they knew that it was it was going out, but it was still working.

775
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:32.400
Richelle Direny: But alas inspection that's stuck. I decided that it stopped working. It wasn't so then it stopped the purchase of the home. So now,

776
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:41.460
Richelle Direny: You have to get it fixed either you get it fixed or you sign something to say that you have x amount of time to get it fixed. After you sign

777
01:14:41.910 --> 01:15:00.870
Richelle Direny: And once you got it fixed, then you have to provide it. So that's what I'm saying. Those are the investigation that you and your husband would have to look into if she wants to sell you. So it makes you if if your intuition is telling you hey there's something shady going on. Do your research.

778
01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.870
Richelle Direny: Do your research to see if

779
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:23.130
Richelle Direny: If home ownership is best for you right now. And if it is, if this is where you want to stay. If it's not, then I'm not where you want to say you want to go somewhere else, then now taking that consideration. Do I continue renting renting or do I

780
01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:34.080
Richelle Direny: Go into really thinking about home ownership. So at least doing your active research, keeping your mind busy so it doesn't stay focused on the fact that I'm

781
01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:40.290
Richelle Direny: Staying focused on the fact that you don't have to

782
01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:48.930
Richelle Direny: You're not overwhelming yourself with the fact that you're home not really doing a whole lot

783
01:15:50.100 --> 01:16:01.950
Richelle Direny: Because hey, I might not be physically working but I'm thinking about by tomorrow and what my tomorrow is going to look like in terms of do we stay here and continue renting or look to purchase.

784
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:09.690
Richelle Direny: Or do we start looking to move. And what does that look like on the income that we currently have right now you understand

785
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:17.430
Brittany Dingess: I actually got a text message about 45 minutes ago from my work.

786
01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:35.280
Brittany Dingess: And it just basically said, you know, hello. We hope everyone's doing well. But we're just letting y'all know that we're not going to be working the week of the 13th, because all the companies that we manufacture for still shut down so

787
01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:51.120
Brittany Dingess: I like half of almost probably at least half of our plant manufacturers parts for Volkswagen and the Volkswagen plant and Chattanooga is furloughing everybody starting tomorrow.

788
01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:53.130
Richelle Direny: Oh, wow.

789
01:16:53.610 --> 01:17:02.640
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, and Nissan is another part of our plan that we make parts for and they just furlough 10,000 people in Tennessee and Mississippi

790
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:12.810
Brittany Dingess: And the really the only other parts of our plan is we make a few parts for Kenya and then like a few parts for Toyota

791
01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.450
Brittany Dingess: And I think that's really about it.

792
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.450
Richelle Direny: Oh,

793
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.450
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, so I don't know what it's

794
01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:32.610
Brittany Dingess: Amazing how it I guess it depends on, however long you know the people who were making parts for the plants that were making parts for say shut down.

795
01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:38.940
Richelle Direny: But then, weren't you in healthcare. At one point, or one a school for health care or something of that nature.

796
01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:43.350
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, I'm still I'm still in school around human services.

797
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:45.690
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm

798
01:17:45.900 --> 01:18:01.140
Brittany Dingess: Supposed to be doing an internship at a counseling agency. The agency is closed down right now. So I actually, I just had a video call with my instructor for that class.

799
01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.760
Brittany Dingess: I'm going to hour ago. And they're going to let us count.

800
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:19.680
Brittany Dingess: Like research papers and I had my agency supervisors and 40 hours worth of training on Telehealth and

801
01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.990
Brittany Dingess: Suicide Prevention and and cognitive behavioral therapy and stuff.

802
01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:42.930
Brittany Dingess: And they're going to let us count all of that towards our requirement for hours and then I'll also will also get incomplete. So hopefully when the agency starts to open back up. We can go in and get some direct contact again but

803
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:45.360
Richelle Direny: Now when you say when you say

804
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.840
Richelle Direny: When you say for

805
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:52.620
Richelle Direny: Human Services specifically what

806
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:58.830
Brittany Dingess: It is, it's a I've got a concentration in addiction to be

807
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.590
Brittany Dingess: A substance abuse counselor.

808
01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:04.110
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you want to go into

809
01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:11.610
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, this is just my this is just a bachelor's degree program. So I plan on getting my masters and

810
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:17.040
Brittany Dingess: I had originally thought psycho psychology, but

811
01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:22.140
Brittany Dingess: I've been told by a lot of people that social work would be better.

812
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.960
Brittany Dingess: To get a masters degree in

813
01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.960
Brittany Dingess: Oh, I'm not sure yet.

814
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.990
Richelle Direny: Instead of just a general psychology degree.

815
01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:36.090
Richelle Direny: And it's a specialized it it's it's what

816
01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:47.850
Brittany Dingess: I found there's some schools that offer there that are accredited schools that offer online master's degree programs and some really specific

817
01:19:48.630 --> 01:20:01.200
Brittany Dingess: Areas. I actually found one that is like a specialized master's degree program in substance abuse counseling. So, I mean, I'm kind of leaning towards that. But

818
01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:04.620
Brittany Dingess: I don't know.

819
01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.470
Brittany Dingess: I mean i i don't like I don't know how

820
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:20.940
Brittany Dingess: If that would restrict me like the more specialized that are free is less people would hire me or you know what I mean. Because, like, if

821
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:38.070
Brittany Dingess: If I go and get a degree a master's in in something that's like incredibly targeted like that and then say I you know I can't find a job at any of the rehab facilities or something and don't have the money to open my own practice.

822
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:48.030
Brittany Dingess: You know, and I have to get on and like it if just like a regular counseling agency. I don't know how that would impact me

823
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:49.710
Brittany Dingess: It didn't lie.

824
01:20:50.430 --> 01:21:00.540
Richelle Direny: It is very restricted when you're doing. So let's say you do addictions counselor, you're an addictions come. It's very specialized because the degree is very specialized suggests

825
01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.500
Brittany Dingess: That Brett.

826
01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.970
Richelle Direny: Course, everything is geared to just that, not to say

827
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:12.210
Richelle Direny: You, there are classes that you will share with someone who is in social worker or

828
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:17.730
Richelle Direny: A licensed counselor or I mean not can license count like marriage and family.

829
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:18.780
Brittany Dingess: Counseling. Yeah.

830
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.550
Brittany Dingess: That's a big one as well.

831
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:34.590
Richelle Direny: That not to say that lucky their courses that won't cross because you're expressing it. But eventually, so it's kind of like everybody starts off on their individual journey and at some point you merge.

832
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.060
Richelle Direny: You understand you emerge and then eventually you go back off.

833
01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:40.020
Brittany Dingess: So that

834
01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.180
Richelle Direny: Means that you

835
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:53.700
Richelle Direny: You know, if it is if you're just looking at human services at being in the helping profession. You can if you do something very general.

836
01:21:54.900 --> 01:22:05.250
Richelle Direny: And you become licensed in something very general that general degree touches on all aspects of it. So then you're a little bit more marketable.

837
01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:06.780
Brittany Dingess: Right.

838
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:14.430
Richelle Direny: General degree in comparison to the specialty. So for instance, like I'm a licensed social worker.

839
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:15.660
Brittany Dingess: Mm hmm.

840
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:22.110
Richelle Direny: It's a general, it's an umbrella to everything else. So

841
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:31.140
Richelle Direny: Like a licensed a family counselor. That's very specific and edition. Right. You know, so it's a very specific

842
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:39.750
Richelle Direny: A mental health counselor is very specific your exams are also very specific

843
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:46.170
Richelle Direny: You understand. Whereas for me, I have to know everything.

844
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:48.960
Richelle Direny: When I

845
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:52.380
Brittany Dingess: Agency supervisor is she's

846
01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:06.870
Brittany Dingess: She's got several like license stuff, but she's just like a licensed counselor, just like you know in general licensed counselor, but she's

847
01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:16.020
Brittany Dingess: She, she also has more specialized stuff like marriage and family therapy and divorce recovery and like a whole bunch of other stuff, but

848
01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:18.810
Richelle Direny: You can specialize in different things, but then

849
01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:20.790
Richelle Direny: When it's all said and done,

850
01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:29.550
Richelle Direny: Like I would be a little bit more marketable then a person who is just an addictions counselor who is just the marriage and licensed counselor.

851
01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:43.170
Richelle Direny: Who just now. If I'm going after a job that's specific to license in marriage counseling where that's it's just couples counseling. If it's very specific to that, then that person with the degree would would

852
01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.860
Richelle Direny: Will get it over me. But the difference is I would be the supervisor over all of it.

853
01:23:51.360 --> 01:24:00.630
Brittany Dingess: And you can take Medicare, because only social workers last and social workers can take Medicare, which I didn't know until I started doing this internship, but they

854
01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:07.290
Brittany Dingess: The my soup by agency supervisors husband is the office manager and he was

855
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:27.570
Brittany Dingess: He was an engineer at some point. So he's got like three computers set of an office and he has shown me like explain to me like all this stuff about how the insurance works and how to get in network with insurance and like all that stuff. So I did not. No one ever told me, the only

856
01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.470
Brittany Dingess: Last and social workers could take Medicare but

857
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:38.550
Richelle Direny: I think in some states. In some states, they don't recognize some degrees.

858
01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.020
Brittany Dingess: That's what I learned. Yeah.

859
01:24:40.290 --> 01:24:50.670
Richelle Direny: Like this. Yeah, you're some states that you have to be a licensed social worker you if you like to do, especially to do the individual counseling piece of it.

860
01:24:51.120 --> 01:25:00.210
Richelle Direny: Is only the licensed social worker could do it because some states what the reimbursement won't go to. So, and when you're in school, honestly.

861
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:06.960
Richelle Direny: You know you speak with a counselor or what have you. I always say you have to do your own research.

862
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:25.050
Richelle Direny: Because no one tells you about, like, oh, if you specialize, then this is the limit to it in comparison to what is it, what are, what are your interests. What do you ultimately want to do because I am a licensed social worker, but

863
01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:35.880
Richelle Direny: If I only want to focus and I only want to work in the field of addictions counseling, then that's my specialty. That's where I do all of my work.

864
01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:40.590
Richelle Direny: But then if I want to do something else. If I want to come away from

865
01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:52.170
Richelle Direny: Being an addictions counselor, then I can I have the experience in addictions counseling, but I want to do something different. I could just take my experience with addiction counselor or somewhere else.

866
01:25:52.710 --> 01:26:08.100
Richelle Direny: You understand. So that's kind of the nice piece about being to do the social work aspect of it because the social worker when you're taking that that national exam I have to know your stuff. I have to know that person. So I have to know everybody stuff.

867
01:26:09.930 --> 01:26:27.870
Richelle Direny: And that's how my test is geared because it's it's it's general to everyone stuff, whereas each specialty their exam is only geared towards that one thing where I have to know everybody stuff and I'm the only one I think I can supervise everyone but everybody can supervise me

868
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:40.710
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, I've noticed a lot of the schools that offer online master's degree programs are out of state and I've noticed that

869
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:51.900
Brittany Dingess: Like different states will have different degree programs and some of them I have wondered. I mean, you know, okay, well, it's an accredited school, but I just

870
01:26:52.320 --> 01:27:02.790
Brittany Dingess: Because like some of these degree programs. I've not ever even heard of. And I'm like, I can find in that, you know, like 30 degrees master's program only

871
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.840
Brittany Dingess: Not everyone would honor, you know, not every state would honor

872
01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:21.750
Brittany Dingess: I think it's in Illinois or Indiana, it's online school

873
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:27.840
Brittany Dingess: And they have some like incredibly specific

874
01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:32.880
Brittany Dingess: Degree program. I'm like a whole bunch of different

875
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:35.610
Brittany Dingess: You know, different things, but

876
01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.910
Richelle Direny: That is true. Everything every state because and that's another thing, um,

877
01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:53.280
Richelle Direny: I can get licensed in multiple states be so and so in your schooling, you have to ensure that the school that you're getting your degree from

878
01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:04.140
Richelle Direny: Allows you to be able to words transferable. That's because that's the thing. It has to be transferable. There are certain coursework that you do.

879
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:12.060
Richelle Direny: That like I think with all of the coursework. I did I was able to go to all the different states and be licensed

880
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:22.320
Richelle Direny: Were some state may require that I go back to school like one of the states, they're a little more ridiculous California requires that I go back to school. And I'm not trying to do that.

881
01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:36.660
Richelle Direny: So then I gotta go back to school for a minute, and I'm not even trying to do that. So, um, so there are some states, but you. You just have to really when you're when you're

882
01:28:37.410 --> 01:28:54.000
Richelle Direny: Determining what you know if you're doing your bachelor's or your masters, you have to determine if this particular school and whatever they whatever they're offering their degree program. You have to look is it transferable to anything. Um, is it

883
01:28:55.170 --> 01:29:02.700
Richelle Direny: When it comes on to becoming licensed eventually will. What is it accredited. So you have to look into all of that. You can't just go with what

884
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:12.120
Richelle Direny: You have to do your research. Ultimately, yeah, you can just do whatever the one person tells you, you really have to do your research and looking at all. That is, you know,

885
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:21.990
Richelle Direny: Is it going to benefit me or am I going to, it's going to require that later on. I have to go back to school because even the older you get. You're not trying to go bust your brains.

886
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:38.130
Brittany Dingess: I've managed I enrolled, the school. I'm getting my bachelor's degree program is the University of Phoenix and a couple years ago, they actually told us that they might suddenly become

887
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:40.710
Brittany Dingess: Like non accredited

888
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:49.320
Brittany Dingess: But that didn't happen. So like they're still accredited and I had heard of them. A lot of the time, but I enrolled in 2014

889
01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:56.070
Brittany Dingess: For four and a half year degree program and there's because I've had so many surgeries and just different things happen.

890
01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:06.390
Brittany Dingess: Since I enrolled and I had to take several leaves of absence and stuff I've managed to turn a four and a half year degree program into like a seven and a half.

891
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:16.920
Brittany Dingess: year degree program because just, I mean stuff will happen. You know, I've had, I've had four surgeries in the last four of four years alone.

892
01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:25.260
Brittany Dingess: So my name is but like some of the schools that offer

893
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:30.630
Brittany Dingess: Master's degree programs. I've heard of like their brick. You know, like brick and mortar.

894
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:34.800
Brittany Dingess: Universities that just have online.

895
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:41.640
Brittany Dingess: My you know programs now. So that's what I'm trying to do is find a university that

896
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:47.610
Brittany Dingess: You know I'm familiar with like reputation wise and that kind of thing.

897
01:30:48.690 --> 01:31:06.630
Brittany Dingess: Something that's maybe like a little more recognizable that actually has a physical campus and stuff, even though it may be out of state because I feel like doing an online program from a better known or like a more respected school would

898
01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:18.420
Brittany Dingess: You know, be better off in the future. I know, like a lot of people make fun of University of Phoenix because it's like the school that anybody can get accepted to

899
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:20.130
Brittany Dingess: A

900
01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:21.900
Richelle Direny: Degree from them.

901
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:25.950
Brittany Dingess: That's, yeah. That's who I'm with now so

902
01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:28.800
Richelle Direny: They're in their stuff is accredited. I don't know what people

903
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:30.480
Brittany Dingess: Good.

904
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:34.470
Brittany Dingess: People, but I am people make fun of them. And I'm like, I mean, I

905
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:45.750
Brittany Dingess: Everything I've done and this is my, this is my last year with them. I mean, it's always been really thorough, I feel like it's, you know, I've been really good.

906
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:46.740
Brittany Dingess: With

907
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:51.480
Richelle Direny: The University of Phoenix cuz I did it. I didn't do it online. I did it.

908
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.570
Richelle Direny: I did it on ground here in Florida, because they have like the satellite satellite

909
01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:16.290
Brittany Dingess: So they have the have to near kind of near means like an hour to each one ones in Knoxville ones in Chattanooga, but I wanted to go to one of the physical ones, but they didn't offer the Human Services program on like you know on in person.

910
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:19.860
Brittany Dingess: I don't know. I think they only do nursing stuff in.

911
01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:20.760
Brittany Dingess: Person here.

912
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:22.410
Richelle Direny: Oh, they

913
01:32:22.650 --> 01:32:25.080
Brittany Dingess: Sing in like education or something, maybe

914
01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:27.690
Brittany Dingess: They don't offer much in person here.

915
01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:28.650
They

916
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:36.000
Richelle Direny: I think they're legit and I mean when it's all said and done, I mean I got my bachelor's from them.

917
01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:47.880
Richelle Direny: And everything I did with them was transferable to a regular university to get my masters everything. So, you know, at the end of the day, people can say they can make fun of them. But hey, I got a job, don't

918
01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:49.770
Richelle Direny: Have a degree don't

919
01:32:51.450 --> 01:33:01.080
Richelle Direny: Nobody cares what university you went to, as long as you have the credentials to show that I am certified. I have a degree in it.

920
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:06.690
Brittany Dingess: And I mean, I still. I mean, I maintain like my GPA.

921
01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:20.670
Brittany Dingess: Is like three on almost a 3.5 so I mean it. You know, I've always done well all through up until I graduated high school, I always had 4.0 GPA.

922
01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:27.450
Brittany Dingess: Hmm. And I actually went to the University of Tennessee right out of high school.

923
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:31.320
Brittany Dingess: I wanted to be a medical examiner

924
01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:33.840
Richelle Direny: Oh, yes, yes.

925
01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:47.130
Brittany Dingess: Under index and I ended up having a bunch of health problems and I lost my scholarship and all that. But I learned really quick in college when I went to the University of Tennessee that

926
01:33:47.820 --> 01:34:05.070
Brittany Dingess: I mean it was just not really stick to keep a 4.0 GPA anymore. I mean it. You know, I was, I had to work too. So like I was working full time and try and go to school full time during the day and I mean it just, you know, my GPA never dropped below, like a 3.2

927
01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.510
Richelle Direny: Well, unless oh what it see. So now this is where

928
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:20.520
Richelle Direny: Your cognition. It's what what was important to you, having the GPA or actually understanding what it is that you were doing.

929
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:32.520
Richelle Direny: Knowing the work, understanding the work being able to apply the work, or are you just stressing yourself just watching the GPA, the grade point average because

930
01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:41.160
Richelle Direny: You can have the grade point average you can help you can have a 5.0 and you come out and I asked you a question. You're like, I don't know, I just did to get a grade.

931
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:42.360
Richelle Direny: You see what I'm saying.

932
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:51.840
Richelle Direny: Do you want to know that your counselor had a 4.0 GPA or that your counselor, actually, um,

933
01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:58.170
Richelle Direny: Love and wants to help you on wants to work with you and know what the heck, man. It is that they're

934
01:34:58.170 --> 01:34:58.950
Doing

935
01:34:59.970 --> 01:35:08.220
Richelle Direny: Oh my doctor, he went to hell, man. He graduated Kumar. What is it cool whatever these all

936
01:35:09.090 --> 01:35:22.110
Richelle Direny: You understand, he was the valedictorian and he did this and he did that. But he has no bedside manner that when you have a conversation to him. He can't break it down into layman's terms for me to understand

937
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:33.210
Richelle Direny: What you understand what is more important to you, the GPA or knowing what he achieved in school or knowing that when I go to see him that he actually cares

938
01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:44.940
Richelle Direny: That he actually is doing his best to educate me on whatever it is that I'm coming to the end with and he is going to provide me with the care and assistance that I need. And I'm not just going to be another number

939
01:35:47.190 --> 01:35:47.460
Richelle Direny: And what

940
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:49.590
Brittany Dingess: What got me started.

941
01:35:49.650 --> 01:35:59.250
Brittany Dingess: WITH HUMAN SERVICES IS I wanted to learn how to relate all of my life experience into like a legitimate way.

942
01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:12.270
Brittany Dingess: To benefit other people because I know that a lot of people that go through addiction go through a lot of similar situations that I have been through like being homeless sexual assaults, you know, just different things and

943
01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.830
Brittany Dingess: You know, I, I went through like that whole cycle for so many years.

944
01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:35.460
Brittany Dingess: I feel like if I didn't try to use it to help somebody you know now that I have kind of came out on the other side, and it would all be in vain. I mean, it would all be for nothing, you know,

945
01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:37.380
Brittany Dingess: I struggle.

946
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:46.920
Brittany Dingess: For all those years for nothing. But if I can help. I mean, not people that like after I when I first started on Suboxone

947
01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.530
Brittany Dingess: Almost five years ago.

948
01:36:51.690 --> 01:37:00.780
Brittany Dingess: People would like people that are worked with and you know there's people that knew me that knew that I was trying to get

949
01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:06.780
Brittany Dingess: Clean and trying to you know that I got back in school and I was trying to do better.

950
01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:23.070
Brittany Dingess: Would come to me and I would still end up counseling them. You know what I mean like unofficially but it's just, I've always kind of been that person that people call in the middle of the night or, you know, the people have always feel comfortable talking to

951
01:37:23.850 --> 01:37:24.510
Brittany Dingess: Me because

952
01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:26.280
Brittany Dingess: You know i mean i'm

953
01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:30.210
Richelle Direny: You're doing it from a judge the non judgmental stance, you're

954
01:37:31.290 --> 01:37:36.390
Richelle Direny: Empathetic fans, you're doing it from I've had the experience. So I know

955
01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:44.730
Richelle Direny: At least from based on my experience. I understand. I mean, I know exactly what you're feeling. I know how I was feeling

956
01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:56.070
Richelle Direny: I but I understand the feelings. I understand your responses, I understand, because it was the same way when I went through it. Now, as a counselor, you're not gonna

957
01:37:56.850 --> 01:38:08.100
Richelle Direny: Even though you experienced that you're not going to necessarily impose what you went through and say, Hey, do it. Everybody every situation is very different. How you respond to something is very different.

958
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:18.240
Richelle Direny: But you definitely go from non judgmental stands, whether you experienced it, or you didn't, you shouldn't be judgmental because

959
01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:31.740
Richelle Direny: To help the person to under to say, Hey, it's okay. It happened. It's not okay that it happened, but it happened. Now how are we, how can we work together to help you get through it.

960
01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:40.470
Richelle Direny: For it so that whatever happened to you doesn't change you who you become, it doesn't define who you are.

961
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:54.750
Richelle Direny: And it doesn't impact your tomorrow and the impact that it will have one. So, tomorrow is just kind of how you may be looking deal with situations in the emotions that comes with it. The trauma, so

962
01:38:56.190 --> 01:39:06.420
Richelle Direny: You know your experiences and I think it with everyone you know all you're doing the law of the land says that you need a piece of paper, I need this piece of paper to help you.

963
01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:20.280
Richelle Direny: That's what the law of the land says, So you already have your gift you already have your life experiences that you went through that were unique to you, to help you, which has mold you to

964
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:40.650
Richelle Direny: Be able to help those identified people that you will come in contact with. So you already have it within you. You already have your rights to do what you do the law of the land just says you need to go get this in order to prove that you can go help someone

965
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:52.920
Richelle Direny: Understand and because we have suing people. The law of this piece of paper just kind of protects you to some degree.

966
01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.510
Brittany Dingess: To help me do

967
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:59.310
Richelle Direny: You understand because through through your, your, your, your

968
01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:08.310
Richelle Direny: Through your studies, you will learn to that you can't be your friends counselor can

969
01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:09.780
Brittany Dingess: Right.

970
01:40:12.330 --> 01:40:13.080
Richelle Direny: Um,

971
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:15.720
Richelle Direny: But you have to, you have to understand

972
01:40:15.930 --> 01:40:26.520
Richelle Direny: So, in order, you went through what you went through in order for you to be able to go out there to be able to help others. You have to not understand.

973
01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:45.180
Richelle Direny: Your own anxieties your own triggers. How does your trauma feed your anxieties your past trauma. How does that feature anxiety. Um, how does your life circumstances and situations and everything that you've been through, how has

974
01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:55.290
Richelle Direny: How were those things a trigger to anxiety to depression that led to your drug addiction.

975
01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:02.160
Richelle Direny: The choices that you've made in life and where you are today.

976
01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.910
Richelle Direny: through everything that you've went through.

977
01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:15.780
Richelle Direny: You're now in that place where for you in counseling whether group or individual is for you to

978
01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:30.690
Richelle Direny: Understand how does your emotions affect how you think and how does your thought process affect how you respond to everything.

979
01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:36.570
Richelle Direny: So it's like cognitive behavioral therapies all about your thoughts. How does that

980
01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:44.550
Richelle Direny: Interact and how does that produces a reaction. So through counseling, you're going to learn that

981
01:41:45.570 --> 01:41:55.230
Richelle Direny: You'll read it in books, they'll tell you from other people's perspective and understanding their studies. But now you've lived it. You were living in

982
01:41:56.010 --> 01:42:05.430
Richelle Direny: Your living it through all of the experience you've went through life. Now you're you're now starting to your own it, you accept that it did happen.

983
01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:09.810
Richelle Direny: But now you're trying to understand how

984
01:42:11.610 --> 01:42:20.700
Richelle Direny: How do I respond to all of this. How does my my anxiety triggers my addiction or my need to use

985
01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:29.280
Richelle Direny: How does my anxiety or my depression or my PTSD. How does that

986
01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:40.530
Richelle Direny: How did I use the drugs to numb or to stop me from feeling or to drown out those thoughts.

987
01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:48.450
Richelle Direny: How did all of that, like, how did they all work together and how was I able to get through it. What are the things that I did.

988
01:42:50.490 --> 01:42:57.000
Richelle Direny: How do I understand what coping skills are, and how do I apply it to each and every situation that I encounter.

989
01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:02.220
Richelle Direny: Those are all the things that you're going to, you're, you're learning

990
01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:11.910
Richelle Direny: You're teaching yourself. Ultimately, so that you can get to that place where you go out there to be able to assist someone else.

991
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:17.190
Brittany Dingess: I'm flying it. I mean, it's

992
01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.770
Brittany Dingess: It's taken me up until fairly recently to realize

993
01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:28.110
Brittany Dingess: Like the sexual assaults I'd always thought, you know, I mean, I knew that it happened.

994
01:43:29.130 --> 01:43:37.950
Brittany Dingess: I knew there wasn't anything I can do to change it and I knew that it wasn't my fault. So like for years. I thought that it didn't affect me at all.

995
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:43.800
Brittany Dingess: But I mean, and it's been fairly recently that I've realized

996
01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:56.460
Brittany Dingess: That it doesn't really affect me on a conscious level as much as it does subconsciously is being like fearful people and I don't like to be around new people or

997
01:43:57.510 --> 01:44:06.690
Brittany Dingess: You know, like around groups of people. I just feel very distressing and then the thing that really set off the PTSD.

998
01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:14.220
Brittany Dingess: In October 2018 I took my dog out for a walk, and my

999
01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:28.770
Brittany Dingess: My female dog and myself got attacked by to stray dogs. So I mean she lived but I mean they tore her apart and they beat me pull me down the side of a mountain.

1000
01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:46.260
Brittany Dingess: So since that happen and then it wasn't what happened to me so much as seeing what was happening to her and not being able to find them all. I finally claw my way back up to the house and be on the bedroom window.

1001
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:56.850
Brittany Dingess: My husband was asleep, because he work third shift at the time. And he came out and he had to kill both the dogs to get him off of our dough, but

1002
01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:00.330
Brittany Dingess: So from like from that day forward.

1003
01:45:01.710 --> 01:45:10.710
Brittany Dingess: I don't sleep in the bedroom, I sleep in the living room because I feel like if I go into the bedroom where it's nice and quiet and everything.

1004
01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:23.160
Brittany Dingess: Something will happen in the house and I want here and like won't be aware of it and I've known that I mean I'm known that that is a big part of like what triggered really triggered the PTSD, but

1005
01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:24.300
Brittany Dingess: Why it. Mm.

1006
01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:26.010
Brittany Dingess: Hmm.

1007
01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:27.390
The quietness.

1008
01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:35.550
Brittany Dingess: Well, and that and I mean it even before the dog attack happened though I

1009
01:45:37.530 --> 01:45:55.440
Brittany Dingess: For a few years now, from time to time, I'll have like not I guess they're like night terrors. I don't remember dreaming anything but I'll scream and fight and curse in my sleep and stuff. And I had somebody point out

1010
01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:57.330
Brittany Dingess: And

1011
01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:13.170
Brittany Dingess: I hadn't been that long ago it was last year sometime I had somebody point out that it was probably, probably got something to do with those assault and it's just, you know, I mean, it's like so consciously and I don't remember dreaming anything

1012
01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:19.320
Brittany Dingess: But my husband or wake me up. I made an album, or sometimes I wake myself up because I'll just be screaming and like

1013
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.810
Brittany Dingess: Fighting against something

1014
01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:27.390
Richelle Direny: During the assaults, did you find that if you can remember. Did you dissociate.

1015
01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:29.160
Brittany Dingess: Well,

1016
01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:35.550
Brittany Dingess: Both times I actually got drug like kind of like Ruthie, I guess.

1017
01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:48.270
Brittany Dingess: One, I remember. Still, the other one I don't really remember at all, but the one that I can remember bits and pieces of I did try to fight back, and then

1018
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:55.860
Brittany Dingess: The. It was the guy that I was dating at the time was actually the guy that drugged me,

1019
01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:06.510
Brittany Dingess: He took me so that he could steal. He wanted to steal my car, my credit card. So he took me after he drugged me, and I passed out. He took me to another guy's house.

1020
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:25.470
Brittany Dingess: And then stole my car, my credit card when the guy sexually assaulted me with his girlfriend layer, which I mean I can remember her looking through the bedroom door, and I was trying to, you know, like I was so out of and I didn't really fully understand at the time I was happening.

1021
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:38.790
Brittany Dingess: You know, like that. And I didn't, I didn't know how I got there, I didn't know, really, you know, other than like exactly in the moment. What was going on because I was

1022
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:43.920
Brittany Dingess: Just so out of it, but then to make it even worse.

1023
01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:48.240
Brittany Dingess: The guy that I was dating came back to pick me up.

1024
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:55.980
Brittany Dingess: And had told the guy that assaulted me that I was

1025
01:47:57.870 --> 01:48:09.510
Brittany Dingess: That I was like working with the cops to burst people that were selling drugs. So anyway, when I finally kind of came to I was tied to a chair with the gun to my head.

1026
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:20.970
Brittany Dingess: Because the guy thought that I was gonna turn me into the car i don't know what i mean i don't know and I was just, you know, it was so much happening so fast.

1027
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.730
Brittany Dingess: And i mean i

1028
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:31.320
Brittany Dingess: I don't even. I don't know how I didn't die just from the overdose, he drugged me was Zyprexa

1029
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.300
Brittany Dingess: The

1030
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.400
Brittany Dingess: Medicine. I was on for the

1031
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:44.460
Brittany Dingess: Bipolar Disorder, they put it in. I don't know how many it was Zyprexa as artists like the dissolvable ones.

1032
01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:46.530
Brittany Dingess: That control that.

1033
01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:50.910
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, and he i had i mean i was prescribed them.

1034
01:48:51.720 --> 01:49:02.370
Brittany Dingess: Even one would knock me out. Like I would sleep for 12 hours if I just took one barely and I actually learned this from somebody else that was there and

1035
01:49:05.010 --> 01:49:15.300
Brittany Dingess: The guy that I was dating was the only one that knew where I hit my medicine which was down in the wheel wheel and the trunk of my car underneath my spare tire because I didn't want anybody to steal them are getting to them.

1036
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:24.840
Brittany Dingess: And take them and have something bad happen. You know, so I'm the guy that I was dating tried to blame it on our friend that was there.

1037
01:49:25.410 --> 01:49:30.540
Brittany Dingess: And the friend ended up finally come unto me. A few months later, until on me. You know what

1038
01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:36.930
Brittany Dingess: He's the one that did this, you know, I don't know how many pills. He gave anybody crushed him. We had order pizza.

1039
01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:52.530
Brittany Dingess: And we got to deliver Mountain Dew. I guess I went to the bathroom or something came back, he had crushed a bunch of them up and put them in my dream and I made in the next thing I know, it was 18 hours later, when I was finally fully waking up so

1040
01:49:52.770 --> 01:49:55.530
Brittany Dingess: You know, I don't, I don't know.

1041
01:49:58.230 --> 01:50:13.470
Brittany Dingess: And I think from what I can remember. You know, I knew that I was being assaulted. I didn't act you know couldn't quite piece together like what it meant. You know, I couldn't. I could barely I didn't know where I was at. I didn't know

1042
01:50:14.490 --> 01:50:24.690
Brittany Dingess: How I got there, you know, I didn't know what do I mean I didn't know really anything. I was just so driven, but I do remember happening and I think I did kind of just

1043
01:50:26.850 --> 01:50:28.980
Brittany Dingess: Pretend like you know I wasn't

1044
01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:31.830
Brittany Dingess: There for the longest

1045
01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.990
Richelle Direny: You dissociated

1046
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:39.720
Brittany Dingess: I think, and I definitely feel that I did, you know, as I

1047
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:46.890
Brittany Dingess: Fully regained consciousness and could remember more and started kind of peace and more and more together.

1048
01:50:47.670 --> 01:50:54.660
Brittany Dingess: I just kind of blew it off. Always and was like, well, I mean, I know that it's not my fault. I never blamed myself.

1049
01:50:55.590 --> 01:51:06.180
Brittany Dingess: For it happening even though I was hanging around. I mean, I was hanging out with the wrong people, but I didn't drove myself. I didn't take myself there I you know I mean it wasn't my fault.

1050
01:51:07.710 --> 01:51:15.870
Richelle Direny: But when you say, but when you so you said that you like, you know, of course. And for anyone that's assaulted. It's never their fault that

1051
01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.040
Richelle Direny: Says, Hey,

1052
01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.630
Richelle Direny: You know, can you do this for me.

1053
01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:33.960
Richelle Direny: It's never your fault, but you're saying that having those experiences that night terrors and now. And then what happened to the dog. How can you correlate like your, what happened to you.

1054
01:51:34.650 --> 01:51:45.180
Richelle Direny: And even with your because you specifically decided with you and then your female dog with these two stray dogs that did that in that moment, feeling helpless.

1055
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:57.630
Richelle Direny: When that moment of silence of everything going on. Did it give you a flashback of everything that happened to you and then is that part of the reason why you don't sleep in the bedroom.

1056
01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:02.160
Brittany Dingess: Didn't immediately do that. But after

1057
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:06.060
Brittany Dingess: I may not, you know, my main concern.

1058
01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:22.590
Brittany Dingess: Like the day the dog attack happened was just trying to make sure she was going to survive and realizing and appreciating the fact that she had just saved my life because I'm you know it was two straight pit bulls and I had my

1059
01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:29.070
Brittany Dingess: My male dog out and they didn't bother him. I mean, they tore her apart and

1060
01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:42.660
Brittany Dingess: So the first day and all night. That night I was just focused on. I mean, I went to the hospital led to stitch me. I wanted to leave you know I wanted to go be with her so

1061
01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:53.970
Brittany Dingess: Once we got her to her bit that morning. The next. Well, we took her to the emergency, but they said that she would leave nothing bottles damage. I stayed up with her online.

1062
01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:59.730
Brittany Dingess: But I'd say over over like the next few days and

1063
01:53:01.290 --> 01:53:11.490
Brittany Dingess: I did. I mean, I started to think about. Like other times similar times where I was helpless, you know, trying to find something off and how

1064
01:53:13.530 --> 01:53:20.730
Brittany Dingess: You know, just like whether literally or, you know, metaphorically being torn apart like how it affected me and

1065
01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:37.890
Brittany Dingess: When I first stop sleeping in the bedroom, I made excuses. You know, like how she hadn't have emergency surgery and stuff. So like I was trying to legitimately trying to stay and watch over you know where she was at being there with her and then it just

1066
01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:52.380
Brittany Dingess: I mean I guess I realized that I felt more comfortable being where I could feel like I was probably, you know, for me, like properly keeping an eye on things and I don't

1067
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:55.410
Brittany Dingess: It's not like I know that

1068
01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:06.870
Brittany Dingess: There's, you know, not going to be stray dogs like breaking their house and attack anybody you know i mean i just

1069
01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:18.810
Brittany Dingess: I knew that a lot of it was not probably rational that I feel that way, but it's just where I suddenly found myself more comfortable feeling like I could

1070
01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:27.660
Brittany Dingess: Just monitor everything like that hyper vigilance and that's when I really it and it took you know i'd say to

1071
01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:43.080
Brittany Dingess: My husband. I actually noticed it first, because any little sound like you know anything bite. I was up and I had even told him, I said, You know, I wouldn't be surprised if I developed some

1072
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:50.040
Brittany Dingess: PTSD symptoms from this just from, you know, like it was so much as

1073
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:53.070
Richelle Direny: Well, you know, so 50% comes from the dog attack.

1074
01:54:53.250 --> 01:54:56.040
Richelle Direny: Yeah, which is already there.

1075
01:54:56.370 --> 01:54:57.300
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, and that's what

1076
01:54:58.170 --> 01:55:00.570
Richelle Direny: The, the, the situation with the dog.

1077
01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:02.580
Richelle Direny: Just fed into

1078
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:17.160
Richelle Direny: It was like more things being added to your trauma. So it's like I already have PTSD. So here it is. And then as you associate because when you're talking my mind started thinking about did part of this make you

1079
01:55:18.210 --> 01:55:26.220
Richelle Direny: Added a tool or fed into how you felt about males because here it is that males were the ones that attack you.

1080
01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:40.590
Richelle Direny: You had a female and a male dog and these male dogs attacks your female dogs. So it's just like feeding into your already pre existing thoughts or feelings towards maybe a particular gender.

1081
01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:50.700
Richelle Direny: The trauma of what happened to the dog already felt fed into the trump the trump the trauma that you've already experienced in life.

1082
01:55:51.450 --> 01:56:01.920
Richelle Direny: And that feeling of helplessness that feeling of someone taking your power and control away from you. So even if trauma happened to someone that you don't know

1083
01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:21.570
Richelle Direny: Whatever that trauma is that occurred with that person. It's going to mirror the trauma that you've already felt. And so it just feeds into in solidify whatever thoughts and feelings that you're having about a particular thing a particular gender a particular situation.

1084
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:26.790
Richelle Direny: So even if you're trying to come out of or work through those issues.

1085
01:56:27.810 --> 01:56:42.120
Richelle Direny: Something just happened or you heard something happen to someone it further confirms how you're already feeling and thinking. So it's like, how dare you. Now, think you can get healed from this. Let me show you that you can. And now I'm going to

1086
01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:53.640
Richelle Direny: I'm going to reintroduce or something else is going to mirror it so it's for you to learn that no one

1087
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:59.520
Richelle Direny: Can take the power they think they can take power and control away from me.

1088
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:03.030
Richelle Direny: I'm only as powerful as you allow me to be

1089
01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.320
Richelle Direny: You understand that concept.

1090
01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:20.790
Richelle Direny: I'm only as I'm not that powerful, but you can make me powerful by making me think and feel that I have that power and control away from me for over you.

1091
01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:29.760
Richelle Direny: So a person is only as powerful so you the situation of your trauma has already been there. This is not now.

1092
01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:49.740
Richelle Direny: I got PTSD number to know your PTSD is already your PTSD. It's just different things. It feeds into it. So it just reminds you did. I am I really healing from the trauma or if everything just feeds into my unresolved.

1093
01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:53.730
Richelle Direny: Trauma that I've experienced

1094
01:57:54.810 --> 01:57:57.750
Brittany Dingess: It wasn't until probably

1095
01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:21.360
Brittany Dingess: I don't know, maybe four, six weeks after the dog attack that I really started to piece together everything over the last, you know, nine or 10 years that had happened, and the pattern that I was seeing like with my responses to different situations and the dog attack was like

1096
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:27.930
Brittany Dingess: I knew it was different in. I mean, it did. It did involve me, but it was just a different type of

1097
01:58:29.010 --> 01:58:32.910
Brittany Dingess: Different like a different type of tangible trauma. You know what I mean, like,

1098
01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:43.200
Brittany Dingess: I guess it would be something I would like into like a bad car wreck versus a sexual assault. I mean, it's the same like it kind of causes the same thing, but

1099
01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.370
Richelle Direny: The same time

1100
01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:47.940
Richelle Direny: It's just, it's just packaged differently, but it's the

1101
01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:52.710
Brittany Dingess: Same right that's what I'm. That's what I'm trying to say. So I mean it's

1102
01:58:53.910 --> 01:59:09.150
Brittany Dingess: What has happened now is where i mean i used to when I was, you know, like late teens, early 20s, I was incredibly emotional like I would cry. I mean, I was, I was pretty much all I guess.

1103
01:59:10.410 --> 01:59:17.340
Brittany Dingess: All my doctors back then would say like I was textbook bipolar with the highs and the lows and everything.

1104
01:59:18.810 --> 01:59:34.530
Brittany Dingess: And over the years. I kind of flattened out like where I didn't really have the highs, but I had a lot of lows and I would cry lot since the dog attack. Nothing bothers me. And I know that it's not because nothing actually bothers me but

1105
01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:38.670
Brittany Dingess: You know, it's like a response to the trauma to try to

1106
01:59:40.230 --> 01:59:42.060
Brittany Dingess: Not just not feel

1107
01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:44.970
Brittany Dingess: You know, that way I you know I didn't like

1108
01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:46.800
Brittany Dingess: Have a totally a

1109
01:59:48.990 --> 02:00:03.600
Brittany Dingess: Like a pathetic towards and I mean I feel empathy for other people, but like for me for saying oh thing situations like personal situations like I don't cry. I don't yell. I don't get upset.

1110
02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:08.910
Brittany Dingess: And you know i'm not i don't i mean i

1111
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:16.500
Brittany Dingess: It's not because I don't think I don't feel that way anymore. Like I'll feel it in my head, but it just doesn't you

1112
02:00:16.530 --> 02:00:17.700
Richelle Direny: Numb yourself. So when the

1113
02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:18.690
Richelle Direny: Trauma happens

1114
02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:21.210
Richelle Direny: It's almost like you go into immediate shock.

1115
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:23.550
Richelle Direny: And when you, when I

1116
02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:34.230
Richelle Direny: Nominate you disassociate from it. It's like, like you want to feel, but you don't. So it's almost like you said your physiological response to the trauma.

1117
02:00:34.710 --> 02:00:44.040
Richelle Direny: And it's perfected because every trauma. That's it. All your traumas are packaged differently. So it just goes back to the original one.

1118
02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:57.300
Richelle Direny: What you have not. You haven't begun the work to process that and work through it and learning healthier ways to deal with the trouble Urkel through kids because you can get over stuff.

1119
02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:00.420
Richelle Direny: How to work through it, how to get through it.

1120
02:01:00.630 --> 02:01:10.260
Richelle Direny: How to effectively get through it in a healthy way where it's not continuing to affect you and you're right over time you'll find that anything that you go through

1121
02:01:11.970 --> 02:01:13.170
Richelle Direny: Or you experience.

1122
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:22.140
Richelle Direny: It's not it doesn't stay in your, your, your sub. It doesn't stay in your president. It's not in present consciousness.

1123
02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:24.000
Richelle Direny: To practice.

1124
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:27.180
Richelle Direny: So the things that we do, how we respond to something

1125
02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:28.980
Richelle Direny: I could say something to you.

1126
02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:49.980
Richelle Direny: And it will trigger you and you're like, why did I respond to her that way. And if you really stop and think it's something that I said in the way I said it in how I said it that that it was it was it's related or to link to the trauma. So like, even when you said the the when the

1127
02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:51.780
Richelle Direny: Guy quit as quoted you

1128
02:01:52.170 --> 02:02:00.870
Richelle Direny: The woman was standing there, she was peeking through the door. So like you could be in your room. And if I kind of have cracked the door and look in there, it will startle you.

1129
02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.690
Richelle Direny: And you will have a response. And then you're screaming and yelling at me and I'm like, why are you responding like that. I was just looking in.

1130
02:02:07.050 --> 02:02:15.090
Richelle Direny: It's because it reminded you of what that lady did while you were being assaulted. This is what she did. So it's, it's always a starch reminder

1131
02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:25.530
Richelle Direny: And it's just like you don't understand it because it's so far back in your subconscious that you don't realize that your reaction is to something that happened a long time ago and

1132
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:35.910
Brittany Dingess: You know, I've never hid the fact that I was assaulted. I mean, it happened, you know, and I've mentioned it to other counselors and stuff. It was kind of always like that. I asked me.

1133
02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:51.240
Brittany Dingess: And I answer honestly. And so, you know, yes, this happened. And this is what happened. And then they were asked me if I felt like it had affected me and I would always say, well, I mean, I don't, you know, I don't think so. It doesn't seem too because

1134
02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:56.400
Brittany Dingess: I mean, I guess part of me didn't want it to have affected me

1135
02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:03.960
Brittany Dingess: And this was before I understood more about like about PTSD and stuff.

1136
02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:18.090
Brittany Dingess: So, you know, I just, and I mean I don't know the part of male generally didn't think that it affects me because it didn't affect me the way I thought it should. I like how you know women that are assaulted sometimes will

1137
02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:32.550
Brittany Dingess: You know, not be able to like be, you know, in an intimate like sexual relationship with a man. And there's different things, because it didn't affect me. That way I feel I assume that it hasn't affected me at all.

1138
02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:49.590
Brittany Dingess: But now that I have. I think that the dog attack kind of made me revisit things. It was just, you know, like you said, like the helplessness and not being able to fight an attacker off.

1139
02:03:51.180 --> 02:04:01.320
Brittany Dingess: As you know, kind of made me consciously Revisited and really think about the breakdown of it's been this year will be

1140
02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:12.450
Brittany Dingess: 11 years since the first one after the other one. I don't remember at all. Somebody had slipped me a bunch of Xanax and I mean I don't remember it at all. I wouldn't have even though

1141
02:04:12.450 --> 02:04:18.180
Brittany Dingess: It can happen had the person that did it to me, not in told me about it like

1142
02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:20.490
Richelle Direny: Several months later, you're unconscious

1143
02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:24.480
Brittany Dingess: As it will. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, I don't, I don't know that.

1144
02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:32.130
Brittany Dingess: If that has bothered me or not because I literally don't remember. I mean, I remember when I was at a party, but

1145
02:04:32.970 --> 02:04:40.290
Richelle Direny: The thought of it is going to bother you, whatever the details of it. It's not going to bother you, because you don't know it because your contract.

1146
02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:50.280
Richelle Direny: But the thought of this. This was another thing that it's the thought. And so with the thought, your brain will create a whole bunch of things that might be false, simply because

1147
02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:59.700
Richelle Direny: You only remember from from A to B, but from detail all the way to Z, you're not going to know because you weren't there you meant you weren't

1148
02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:18.630
Richelle Direny: So you're only going to remember this is so for you. Your hyper vigilance is because of the thing that you remembered leading up to the assault that you are told about or your I hypervigilance will be no I don't want you as a matter of fact, I don't pour me on anything until I get that.

1149
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:31.320
Brittany Dingess: And I have been that way for a long time, really. I mean, my grandma always warned me not to let people pour me drinks and stuff. So after the first assault.

1150
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:39.750
Brittany Dingess: You know I never ever told anyone where my medicine was like I would hide everything I would

1151
02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:51.390
Brittany Dingess: Always. You know, for my own drinks like I would, you know, and then I after the second one happen because apparently I mean I consciously took one day.

1152
02:05:52.470 --> 02:06:03.690
Brittany Dingess: Knowing that I had a low tolerance, because I was having a panic attack and it was good. I thought, yeah, well the friends that gave me the Xanax of the first one. We're good friends of mine.

1153
02:06:04.410 --> 02:06:12.720
Brittany Dingess: So I took a Xanax, I live down in their front porch swing and then apparently the friend that assaulted me

1154
02:06:13.770 --> 02:06:16.260
Brittany Dingess: fed me like six or seven more

1155
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:18.870
Brittany Dingess: After the first one had already made me

1156
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.370
Richelle Direny: Out of loopy

1157
02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:22.800
Richelle Direny: That's what you told right hold

1158
02:06:23.010 --> 02:06:30.510
Richelle Direny: So now what ultimately. So when you say, well, it doesn't affect me what it affected is your ability to trust.

1159
02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:40.560
Richelle Direny: Brent so it doesn't just affect your, your ability to trust, maybe a friend, it affected your ability to trust anyone around you.

1160
02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:57.270
Richelle Direny: And so now, because your trust was taken your ability to trust people were taken away from you. So now you're gonna look at everybody sideways down to your very husband, you're going to look at sideways because of what occurred because of what you were told not what you know.

1161
02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:07.470
Richelle Direny: It's what bold. So the reality is this person says, oh, He crushed six or seven Xanax, when in reality he may have just crushed one on top of the one you already told

1162
02:07:07.710 --> 02:07:08.730
Brittany Dingess: And because again.

1163
02:07:09.690 --> 02:07:22.830
Richelle Direny: So now just the mere idea of someone did something to you when you were not aware of it. Now, it's not a matter of so much. Yes, I was told I was assaulted. I don't remember it.

1164
02:07:23.550 --> 02:07:40.200
Richelle Direny: All I know was that someone did this to me. And so now it confirmed. I don't know. It's not that I don't trust, men. I don't trust anyone because this is what they did to me now. I'm not so sure about having plenty friends because these were my friends. And this is what they did to me.

1165
02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:54.420
Richelle Direny: So now you're thinking about, Oh, it didn't affect me. Because what society. What we see publicize on TV. Is that a person who is sexually assaulted either their premise skew is either they hate men.

1166
02:07:55.170 --> 02:07:56.430
Richelle Direny: Either they become this

1167
02:07:56.580 --> 02:08:09.840
Richelle Direny: And they become that. So, because you're not doing any of that you think that it didn't bother you. Okay. Well, at what point did you become an addict. Was it before or after the trauma. Well, that's one way it affected you

1168
02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:17.520
Richelle Direny: Do you not trust people. No, I don't really trust people and I really understand what because of the fact that you went through this trauma.

1169
02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:30.660
Richelle Direny: Do you find yourself that silence bothers you. Yeah, well, could it be because of this. So we, in our minds, we create in our minds, based on what we see in here.

1170
02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:39.150
Richelle Direny: We have these expectations of how things should bother us. And when it doesn't bother us, then we say no it didn't affect me but yes it did.

1171
02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:47.220
Richelle Direny: And these are all the ways that it's affecting you. Well, I don't really like anybody walking up so even thinking about your spouse.

1172
02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:54.930
Richelle Direny: If during intimacy. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HIM TO DO to you during intimacy, it's because of it reminds you

1173
02:08:55.350 --> 02:09:00.510
Richelle Direny: Of maybe what this individual does to you. So now, it affects your, your intimacy.

1174
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:09.600
Richelle Direny: So you have to think about. There is so many other things. If your husband tries to do a certain things and it makes your living skin crawl.

1175
02:09:10.290 --> 02:09:19.890
Richelle Direny: It's because of what happened to you and it's a reminder. So it's kind of like you associate if he comes and he kisses you on your cheek and he whispers in your ear.

1176
02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:28.710
Richelle Direny: And you you're repulsed by it. It's because maybe it reminds you of the trauma of what the person did to you and you're thinking, well, I don't remember it.

1177
02:09:29.010 --> 02:09:36.060
Richelle Direny: Well, if that maybe there was something during that trauma that that person, even though you dissociated at the time.

1178
02:09:36.630 --> 02:09:54.600
Richelle Direny: That it was happening to you. These are the physiological responses to the trauma. And so, now is the time where you have to really kind of peel it back by like a banana and say, how is this. Now, I'm not saying every single thing you go through is related specifically to the trauma.

1179
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:55.170
Brittany Dingess: Right.

1180
02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:57.420
Richelle Direny: But it's a byproduct of it all.

1181
02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:09.000
Brittany Dingess: But it's and it's, I mean I this definitely um it's affected a lot more than I had ever realized until recently, and it's

1182
02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:19.410
Brittany Dingess: The effects from it, have gone on for so long that I mean it's just kind of become I've become like a custom to

1183
02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:25.230
Brittany Dingess: You know, be I you know I just always

1184
02:10:27.450 --> 02:10:32.190
Brittany Dingess: Thought that I was like a person that didn't trust, many, many people

1185
02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:45.510
Brittany Dingess: But as I get older, it's getting. I mean, it's getting worse. It's as I get older I want it to be around less and less less less people were like, I don't really have friends I don't go hang out with anybody.

1186
02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:59.670
Brittany Dingess: You know, I don't really like to go to other people's houses and it's not that I, you know, and it'll, you know, I'll go like two families houses or something like that. But it's just

1187
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:04.890
Brittany Dingess: It's finally gotten, I guess, to the point where

1188
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:06.540
Brittany Dingess: It's

1189
02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:13.350
Brittany Dingess: Changing my life a lot more than I would like it to. And I feel like it's

1190
02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:20.550
Brittany Dingess: Taking more power away from me than I'm comfortable with.

1191
02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:26.970
Brittany Dingess: Exam responding to it in a way that I mean even I feel is extreme and irrational.

1192
02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:29.160
Brittany Dingess: And you know I

1193
02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.510
Brittany Dingess: You know, I know. Like some vigilance is healthy.

1194
02:11:35.550 --> 02:11:37.140
Richelle Direny: Too much of anything. It's not good.

1195
02:11:37.290 --> 02:11:49.800
Brittany Dingess: But right and it's it's getting its getting extreme to the point where it's, you know, isolate a lot isolate at home, you know, I go to work. There might be one or two people that I talked to

1196
02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:59.490
Brittany Dingess: But that's it. You know, I don't talk to people on the phone, other than like my, you know, my mom and my grandma and I'm just

1197
02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:11.760
Brittany Dingess: I'm home all the time because I'm constantly wondering, you know, like feeling like something bad's gonna happen and wondering you know what's gonna happen.

1198
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:22.140
Richelle Direny: And what's gonna so it's it's it's one thing to be aware of everything. It's what it's another to connect it all. Now the question is,

1199
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:36.780
Richelle Direny: Working. How are you working and in through therapy. You can't do it all in one session. It's continuous if you're working through, how can I learn to reach trust again. Now granted, you can't put all your trust in anybody

1200
02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:41.520
Richelle Direny: I run, you can't because humans are humans and they're likely to do things.

1201
02:12:43.410 --> 02:12:51.420
Richelle Direny: But how can you start trusting again and part of how you learn to read trust again it's first of all being

1202
02:12:52.770 --> 02:12:53.460
Richelle Direny: More

1203
02:12:55.290 --> 02:12:57.690
Richelle Direny: Deserving discerning of the people that you befriend

1204
02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:00.930
Richelle Direny: Being more

1205
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:09.060
Richelle Direny: I don't want to say open bought what being more, a little bit more analytical, in what is this person all about

1206
02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:21.870
Richelle Direny: Yet is is is this person befriending me. You know, is there. Now you don't want to overthink it. At the same time, but you also want to be mindful of, you know,

1207
02:13:22.770 --> 02:13:37.080
Richelle Direny: Is there a motive, like what is it like I and I learned to myself not to say that I've ever gone through anything like that, to that extent, or, if any, but I've learned even in in identifying friends.

1208
02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:50.430
Richelle Direny: And even given that title is Frank because everybody interfering. Um, I started recognizing little things that what they would do or how they would reach out

1209
02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:59.370
Richelle Direny: And just kind of the pureness of it. And then I started realizing the people who were really for me are the ones that I really didn't give much attention to

1210
02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:05.310
Richelle Direny: Or the people because maybe they didn't fit a particular description of what I think a friend should look like.

1211
02:14:06.150 --> 02:14:20.070
Richelle Direny: And how they should respond because they didn't fit that bill, it's so I put them off to the side. When the reality is, those were really truly my friends like a nerd is a good friend, a half. I mean, you know, they don't really care about certain things.

1212
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:31.170
Richelle Direny: But it's it's it's really just being a little bit more insightful and just being more aware and more discerning of the people who you're letting in

1213
02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:41.220
Richelle Direny: And what is your idea of what you think a friend should look like and how they should respond to you and how they should talk to you. It's just being more in tuned with that.

1214
02:14:42.690 --> 02:14:51.210
Richelle Direny: And that's in so it's working through identified the things that you struggle with trust. It's learning how to trust again.

1215
02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:54.780
Richelle Direny: It's if it's

1216
02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:10.380
Richelle Direny: The social anxiety. It's learning how to become social again in a healthier way. Now I'm not telling you to go be everybody be all everybody face because we don't need to. But it's learning how to socialize again.

1217
02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:23.580
Richelle Direny: You know, identifying those things that are big struggle for you that are terrifying for you that you fear so much identifying those things and then learning healthier ways of how to

1218
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:32.010
Richelle Direny: Get through it combat it and just so that it's not so crippling and

1219
02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:34.950
Richelle Direny: Ultimately just mean crippling for you.

1220
02:15:36.330 --> 02:15:38.310
Brittany Dingess: And and yeah, absolutely.

1221
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:49.080
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's just learning that, but then I always use the term peeling it back by like a banana. If fear is your number one thing. Okay.

1222
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:59.760
Richelle Direny: Well, let's have a session about just talking about, what are your fears and where are those fears coming from and how do you get through those. It is that fear and anxiety to us.

1223
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:09.720
Richelle Direny: And so once you pick apart and peel it, but like, but like a banana and get to its core. And that's really how you understand

1224
02:16:10.290 --> 02:16:19.560
Richelle Direny: Think about, like, if you study. I'm in in your studies, you may learn about a personal with split personality disorder that dissociate.

1225
02:16:20.250 --> 02:16:31.410
Richelle Direny: Ultimately what the counselor does with a person with split personality disorder. They go through all the different personalities, to get to the core person who they're protecting

1226
02:16:32.610 --> 02:16:42.990
Richelle Direny: And once you get to the core person and understand what happened to that core person, then you start working on that core person. And once you start once you get to that core person.

1227
02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:54.030
Richelle Direny: Then all the other protective factors go away. They slowly die because now I've gotten to the core. And now I am able to work with the core

1228
02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:06.870
Richelle Direny: And that's what you have to do your fear is now you need to get to the core of your fear what what is is what makes you so fearful what occurred that makes you so fearful and then everything else will start falling

1229
02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:08.850
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1230
02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:11.490
Richelle Direny: So,

1231
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.410
Richelle Direny: What

1232
02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:27.540
Richelle Direny: But hopefully you one of the first things that we talked about, is that really look into is it truly addiction counseling. You want to go into or finding something broad

1233
02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:29.520
Richelle Direny: That will help you

1234
02:17:30.390 --> 02:17:44.370
Brittany Dingess: That's, I mean, originally when I first, you know, first enrolled. I had just gotten out of an inpatient rehab. So that was what inspired me was my counselor in that inpatient program.

1235
02:17:44.910 --> 02:18:06.120
Brittany Dingess: Yeah, as I have studied, you know, and work through the coursework and stuff and had a colleague more and more contact with clients and contact with more counselors and different things and I made my at this point I want to open my own to get licensed and open my own practice.

1236
02:18:08.550 --> 02:18:08.850
And

1237
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:13.080
Brittany Dingess: And do something a little more generalized I think

1238
02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:20.700
Brittany Dingess: Most. I mean, you know, help us help. Whether you know drugs and alcohol or involved or

1239
02:18:21.810 --> 02:18:24.990
Brittany Dingess: You know, whatever, whatever the case may be.

1240
02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:34.170
Richelle Direny: Um, let me ask you to is is Fridays. Good for you. Or this Tuesday's

1242
02:18:38.550 --> 02:18:45.120
Brittany Dingess: Tuesday's fine I'm at this at this point with me being laid off and everything, especially, it doesn't really matter.
