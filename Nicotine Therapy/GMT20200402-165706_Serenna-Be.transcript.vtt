Christy Lamkin: Though she don't complain about it.

158
00:11:53.730 --> 00:12:09.570
Serenna Beers: So you think i mean i there. There's definitely a lot of work that we can do around that and basically it's just building your self worth, because it sounds to me. And this is just an observation from just these few words and just, you know,

159
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:20.040
Serenna Beers: Having to have somebody do things for you and feeling like a burden kind of goes hand in hand with the soul wound of

160
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:33.330
Serenna Beers: I am not lovable. I'm not worth loving and I would imagine you being Mom That's pretty much data there right right there. I'm

161
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.860
Christy Lamkin: Like, I can't. She can't have a light. She can't move out.

162
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.190
Christy Lamkin: And really have a family because she takes care be

163
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.970
Christy Lamkin: Her in her fiance live with me because it shows everything

164
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.820
Christy Lamkin: It's like she can't even move out and have a look at us. The only thing I feel bad about

165
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.510
Serenna Beers: Well, I would imagine, and and this is just the thought and maybe you might even ask her that

166
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:20.040
Serenna Beers: If you spend all i'm not saying that that you spend all all of your time feeling bad, and feeling a lot of guilt, but I would imagine you know the best gift that you could give back to her is instead of feeling, feeling bad about it and allowing it to

167
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.170
Serenna Beers: Create this feeling of sadness and guilt.

168
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:38.340
Serenna Beers: Maybe try to flip it and you know just honor her by being by being glad that she and I know that you're glad that that she is there but she'd probably rather see you feeling less guilty.

169
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:49.500
Serenna Beers: She probably rather see you feeling more happy that she's there and just, you know, your appreciation. I would imagine is probably good enough.

170
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.270
Serenna Beers: She understands

171
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.190
Your situation.

172
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.630
Serenna Beers: And I would imagine she's also there because she wants to be there.

173
00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.430
Christy Lamkin: Yeah.

174
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.520
Serenna Beers: Oh, look at the baby.

175
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.610
Hi there.

176
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.750
Christy Lamkin: I just feel guilty.

177
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.300
Christy Lamkin: Joining I feel guilty about

178
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.230
Yeah.

179
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:43.080
Serenna Beers: But you're talking about something, you have no control over. You didn't wake up and say, hey, I think I want to be sick and a cause myself to not be able to do anything and to need help.

180
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.520
Serenna Beers: Constantly. Mm hmm. That's like what I think I'd that I want for the rest of my life. You didn't choose this for yourself. Right.

181
00:14:51.360 --> 00:15:06.060
Serenna Beers: Would be different if you did nothing but it looks like. I'll bet I'll bet you're a help to her to when you take your grandkids and you're holding them and you love them and you play with them. It probably gives her a nice little break. You know,

182
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:12.720
Serenna Beers: Yeah, so you have to kind of look and way all of that out because as much as you feel like you're a burden.

183
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.390
Serenna Beers: I'll bet you're a blessing and a lot of ways.

184
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:16.350
Christy Lamkin: Yeah.

185
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.190
You know,

186
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:40.410
Serenna Beers: So I think where we need to start is working on that guilt and how we can work through that so that you can continue to enjoy your life, you know, you can have life outside of your disability and feeling like you're a burden because. Wouldn't you rather enjoy life being happy happy.

187
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.230
Serenna Beers: Yeah, instead of having this whole

188
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.460
Christy Lamkin: Last

189
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.260
Serenna Beers: Meeting there's anything from eat from eating to

190
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:11.970
Serenna Beers: Depression to anxiety mean all of those things that come when your emotions aren't regulated, you know,

191
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:12.870
Yeah.

192
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:21.420
Serenna Beers: So I think that could be our first thing that we need to start on is building your self worth, so that you feel like you have meaning.

193
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:34.170
Serenna Beers: And purpose because even though you have this diagnosis and you deal with chronic pain. You can sit and have a full cognitive conversation with with me. I'm sure with your daughter.

194
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.580
Serenna Beers: I

195
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:41.970
Serenna Beers: Am sure that you can offer some assistance. You're sitting there with your grand daughter right right now. Right.

196
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:42.540
Yeah.

197
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:49.080
Serenna Beers: So you have that value. We just need to get you to see what that value is

198
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.310
Christy Lamkin: Yeah.

199
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.390
Serenna Beers: You know what I mean.

200
00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:02.010
Serenna Beers: So over the next couple of weeks. And if for some reason you feel like you get in a crisis or you feel like, Gosh, I really need to talk to somebody

201
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:13.350
Serenna Beers: All you got to do is call the virtual clinic and say, I need to get a meeting with my therapist. She said that I could call and schedule and they will let me know and you and I can sit

202
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.310
Serenna Beers: Okay, that's what I am here for

203
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.450
Christy Lamkin: Okay.

204
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:24.120
Christy Lamkin: All right. So in between now and let me see, when two weeks is

205
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:33.720
Serenna Beers: In between now and the 16th. What I want you to do is think about three specific things that you love about yourself.

206
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.250
Serenna Beers: I'll bet you can come up with at least three

207
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:52.800
Serenna Beers: And our goal is going to be by the end of this all of this and we're done. Meeting eventually when this ends. I want you to have 10 things that you love about yourself that may seem impossible.

208
00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:06.090
Serenna Beers: But I can speak from experience. There was a time in my life when I literally felt worthless. I didn't have one thing I loved about myself. I can tell you, probably 20 things I love about myself now. And that came from hard work.

209
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:22.830
Serenna Beers: Okay, okay. So I think the biggest thing for you, you know, because you have your pain management, you're working on that with your physician with me. We are we are going to work on all of those things that create a healthier mind, body and soul. Okay.

210
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:29.250
Serenna Beers: Okay. Okay, so what are you going to work on over the next couple of weeks. What, what have I asked you to do.

211
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.970
Christy Lamkin: You're gonna I'm gonna find three things I love about myself.

212
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:41.190
Serenna Beers: Yep. And then we're going to talk about those things. And we're going to build on those things. And with each time that we meet, we're going to add another to the list. And we want to get to 10

213
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.870
Serenna Beers: Ok ok I saw those eyes get big.

214
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.130
Serenna Beers: But I'm telling you.

215
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.230
Serenna Beers: It is doable. OK.

216
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.060
