00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.160
Giovanni Murray: Yeah.

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.580
John Reinhart: All right, well, if I miss up on anything, let me know. All right.

13
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.260
John Reinhart: I'm going to start off with. First of all, number one question. What brings you into treatment and why now.

14
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.170
Giovanni Murray: Um, well, so I've been like trying to get this. Well, I was like getting addicted to

15
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:21.990
Giovanni Murray: Like heroin and fentanyl and so I wanted like to get away from that already, but I wasn't like super motivated to do it. And then my friend like overdosed and almost died on my floor. And I was like, I should really get so good.

16
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.480
Giovanni Murray: Because I just don't want to have to like be in a situation where, after like resuscitate my friend and I can vouch that

17
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:43.560
Giovanni Murray: It's just sad. So when we went to the hospital. I asked if they had any like resources for like addiction hope and they they recommended you guys and I did the intake over there.

18
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.500
John Reinhart: Okay, cool. How long you been with bright heart.

19
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.920
Giovanni Murray: About like a month or so.

20
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.450
John Reinhart: Okay, how's it going

21
00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.360
Giovanni Murray: It's been pretty good. I mean, there's been a couple issues with like medication stuff they've messed up and

22
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.600
John Reinhart: Takes a little longer, and

23
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.680
John Reinhart: That stuff out of it.

24
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.140
Giovanni Murray: All it's been fine and that stuff gets yeah easier with time, I'm sure.

25
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.390
John Reinhart: Yeah okay let me move on. Next question, tell me your story with substances.

26
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.730
Giovanni Murray: Oh god, it's a long one.

27
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.350
John Reinhart: Well,

28
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.770
Giovanni Murray: I i 19 I've been using us like hard drugs, since I was like 10 my dad gave me coke. When I was 10

29
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:39.840
Giovanni Murray: Will do. So I got into that show pretty early, and I got sent to my first, like rehab. When I was 12 I got expelled from eighth grade ecstasy.

30
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:51.570
Giovanni Murray: And so I just like, I don't know, they kind of fucked up my life but they're pretty young age. I've been doing them for a long time, but I haven't really developed like a bad problem.

31
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.120
Giovanni Murray: With them into like

32
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.770
Giovanni Murray: A lot later on I was like high school I got pretty bad was annex for a while, but then I like quit that

33
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:13.680
Giovanni Murray: And then I was like, just casually using stuff up until I started like playing around with opiates and as soon as I started doing that I got, like, really addicted to those

34
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:27.390
Giovanni Murray: Because I could do before that I drink Coke like occasionally do whatever occasionally like when I went out. I went out, whatever. But when I started doing opiate that instantly became like every day really quickly.

35
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.700
John Reinhart: Well, dude, happy life, man.

36
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.570
John Reinhart: When were you first exposed. I guess 10 years older.

37
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.440
Giovanni Murray: Yeah 10 maybe nine

38
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.270
John Reinhart: Enough.

39
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.940
John Reinhart: While we're doing this. All right. That's just one of the deals, even though we're not in group, but just kind of like, you know, hold off to after we're done. I appreciate it.

40
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.630
Okay.

41
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.250
Giovanni Murray: Go ahead. Yeah, I don't know, like

42
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.400
Giovanni Murray: 10 nine, something like that. If you don't like drinking and we are whatever

43
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:13.320
John Reinhart: Wow. Yeah. So, man. It's good. You're in here you know you're young. So just to get this kind of get a, you know, get to get this corner and and figure it out and taking care of, you know, it's a day to day deal as, you know,

44
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.610
John Reinhart: Yeah, how, how did it progress. I mean,

45
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:26.460
Giovanni Murray: It. I mean, it never really progressed until I started doing opiates like that, that just like went out of control. Real quick.

46
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.260
John Reinhart: How long has that been

47
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.450
Giovanni Murray: That's been like

48
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.020
Giovanni Murray: I started taking them like

49
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.970
Giovanni Murray: Eight months ago something. Yeah.

50
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.170
John Reinhart: So,

51
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.170
John Reinhart: So good. Is it hasn't been for a long, long time.

52
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.780
Giovanni Murray: No. So, but it was like it got pretty bad because I was like doing

53
00:04:50.040 --> 00:05:00.090
Giovanni Murray: I started with offseason and they got too expensive within like a month or two, so I just started like after that I was just doing like heroin and fentanyl for like the

54
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.980
Giovanni Murray: Last six months or whatever. But it didn't go on like super long, but I was just like, Well, I don't really want to do this.

55
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.790
John Reinhart: Yeah. Good thing you're by. I mean, is you're doing better by, by the way.

56
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.220
Giovanni Murray: My body. Yeah, yeah.

57
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:23.190
John Reinhart: Good, good. Yeah, well, you know, we get our wake up calls in different ways. Hopefully we do and it's not too late. When was the worst for you.

58
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.100
Giovanni Murray: The worst of the withdrawals, or what

59
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.950
John Reinhart: You maybe just kind of like doing drugs and kind of knowing. Hey, this is just not going. I mean,

60
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.570
Giovanni Murray: You know you're miserable and

61
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.370
John Reinhart: Everything and you're chasing all that

62
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.690
I think

63
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:56.850
Giovanni Murray: Probably pretty recently I've never really had like negative experiences from drugs, until recently with the opiates women just got really addicted and all my money was going to it and I have like a couple of friends overdose while doing it. And I overdosed was doing it.

64
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.720
Giovanni Murray: And then it's just like, Well, I don't really want to do this.

65
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.600
John Reinhart: Right on. Right on.

66
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.710
John Reinhart: You don't have any chronic pain issues do

67
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.010
Giovanni Murray: Sometimes I have a genetic disease.

68
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.740
John Reinhart: Or really want to elaborate on that a little bit.

69
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.640
Giovanni Murray: It's called mitochondrial disease. I got like chronic headache or like chronic migraines.

70
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:29.550
Giovanni Murray: Or Ryland. I get some called chronic fatigue and I have like showing tissues like arthritic stuff.

71
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.350
John Reinhart: Wow.

72
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.850
John Reinhart: Man, that's

73
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.730
John Reinhart: That's pretty unusual for your age.

74
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.290
Giovanni Murray: Now when you're at, well, I

75
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.970
Giovanni Murray: was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease when I was like 10 years old.

76
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:53.700
Giovanni Murray: And I don't know, it's just a I'd get like migraines that kept me out of school for like a month or two at a time. And I just got like really sick all the time.

77
00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:03.870
John Reinhart: Yeah. Well, I'll tell you there's some great apps that we do that helps me out to with stuff like that that insight timer is really good, I'm sure.

78
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.260
John Reinhart: Your doctors talked about that.

79
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.850
Giovanni Murray: Without what

80
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.940
John Reinhart: That app called insight timer.

81
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.280
John Reinhart: It's, it's for guided meditations, and it's for sleeping anxiety, depression,

82
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:38.700
John Reinhart: It's for over you know overactive mind it's you know it's one of those things. It's, it's like mindfulness. So it kind of helps you kind of calm down. When you're at night and trying to sleep in your mind's just you know you're hurting, and you kind of floating all over the place, you know,

83
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:52.080
Giovanni Murray: Yeah, I don't like personally I don't. I've never had like much luck with that stuff, at least, especially for sleep because it makes me like more anxious, like I get anxious

84
00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:09.540
Giovanni Murray: Like when I think about sleep in general and like doing something actively to try and like make myself sleepy are usually makes myself like more anxious that I'm not going to sleep and actively spend nights not sleeping.

85
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.100
Giovanni Murray: Two nights not sleeping well

86
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.400
John Reinhart: That might be down the road apiece or something you might want to think about that.

87
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.890
John Reinhart: Yeah okay, growing up was your family like

88
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.720

103
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.020
Giovanni Murray: Yeah, when I was five, I can

John Reinhart: We're your parents. Together they always been together.

111
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:53.400
Giovanni Murray: They were together, up until I was like about 10 and but that whole time, my dad didn't have American citizenship. So you only visited for like three to four months out of the year.

112
00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:07.680
Giovanni Murray: From England need come over here after I turned five for like little visits, but he was like trying to get a visa. The whole time, but he has like an extensive felony criminal records. So it's really hard for him to get a visa over here.

113
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.540
Giovanni Murray: So we never ended up getting one. Then they divorced and there is no reason for him to

129
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.940
Giovanni Murray: It's just crazy.

130

152
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.850

153
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:53.280
John Reinhart: And yeah, and I think personally, I mean, sometimes we over medicate. Some kids, you know what I mean muted. They just, they're just being boys, man.

154
00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:06.300
Giovanni Murray: Yeah, I was never I was diagnosed when I was like 14 they medicated me for a while but it like fuck with my appetite. A lot. So I was like, I'd rather just not take the medications and I never did. Since and

155
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.730
John Reinhart: What did they give you Ritalin.

156
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:17.370

157
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:26.910
John Reinhart: Right on, man. I just from what I could see your you go to active mind, you don't need that stimulation. You got plenty of stimulation, as it is, it seems like

158
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.110
Giovanni Murray: Yeah.

159
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.390

Giovanni Murray: That are like the, like, oh,

161
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:53.850
Giovanni Murray: Like part of the ADHD like pick up my like skin or like my buttons on my shirt like chew on them and stuff. And so they were just mainly trying to stop that. But I felt like I've always had appetite issues. They were like, Well, we'd rather have them eating as much as you can.

162
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.790
John Reinhart: Yeah, so you've had trouble not your, your thing is not how much do you weigh
