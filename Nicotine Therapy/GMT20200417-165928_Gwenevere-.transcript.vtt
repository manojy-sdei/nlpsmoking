24
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You have some blinds behind you, are they completely closed. Are they turned as tight as they can. So, okay, are you somewhere where the whole thing could turn

25
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, you could be facing that light. I can't, I don't know where you are just

26
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.870
Nicole Roybal: I get what you're saying. That's why I was facing that way.

32
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I could at least get one side of your face. If you are off on the side of the bed. Then I at least have half your face lit.

33
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole. Take your time. It's okay. We it's worth it.

Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I'm actually on Tuesday as well. You have so many patients and not stress. You remember them. Yeah, I called them and they told me basically that just wait it out that they, it's not really like they don't want me to go there and they don't really have nothing to do for me.

46
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you speak with a nurse. Did you speak with an actual clinical person I spoke with the medical assistant, the front desk. Okay. Huh.

47
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know she spoke with a medical professional

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that your office manager. Good. Let me speak with a typically there's a nurse on call. Is there a nurse on call that I can talk to. Is there one kind of I, I promise I'll only be two minutes It'll save a visit.

53
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But I need to make sure that this isn't a medical emergency, and that I'm not going to be causing hearing loss by my not going in to have this treated

54
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Once they hear that

55
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: They're hearing. Oh my gosh. I don't want to have anything to do with this woman losing her hearing so they're gonna write take some action.

56
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.070

Gwenevere Abriel: Training has has listened to my symptoms and they can tell me whether I need urgent care whether I need emergency department or if it's just maybe an antibiotic or something like that.

59
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Hasn't been helpful to also be hearing from Dr. Aubrey L about her perspective on what she thinks that's going on.

60
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.240
Nicole Roybal: Definitely, yeah.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, just on a weekly basis, you know, being able to check in with her around that.

64
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:35.400

65
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:41.700
Nicole Roybal: I feel okay I think I might have taken too long to get my gabapentin this morning. So I started getting like sweaty.

66
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.420
Nicole Roybal: My cold, same time, I have referrals in but I'm sweating.

67
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:57.510
Nicole Roybal: My weapon to that to that scene down sometimes I'm like I don't feel it, I guess. Other people are perceiving that and I'm like, I don't know, I feel

68
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's go with that because I am suspecting there's a connection. It's, it's fine. So, for example,

69
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You heard that turn that resting blah blah blah face.

70
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.240

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you were so mad at me and grew up and I'm like I was

72
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I don't remember being mad, but maybe my face was, I don't remember feeling, man. But I think when most people are used to me.

73
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Very

74
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.410

75
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right so doesn't mean my internal experiences that but that's how I'm perceived and so I'm for you.

76
00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it like for we'll just start with boyfriend. What is it like for boyfriend to think you're in a download. What happens when he thinks you're in a download

77
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.470
Nicole Roybal: He's asked me, like, what's wrong.

78
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:19.470
Nicole Roybal: Why do I see, I've seen down like I don't like it, like it only started happening like this week, but like the other day was the first time he ever like was like

79
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:27.510
Nicole Roybal: What's wrong with you, are you okay like like why do you think so sad. I'm like, I'm not asking you what's wrong. I'm like nothing's wrong.

80
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

81
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.100
Nicole Roybal: So that's pretty much it.

82
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how many times did he asked you in a day would you say

83
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.350
Nicole Roybal: Well, yeah, he asked me.

84
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:50.070
Nicole Roybal: Five, six times within like an hour, but then after that our ended up taking a job and I

85
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.400
Nicole Roybal: And then he's like, oh, that's what is wrong with you.

86
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.870
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. I don't think it was that I just, I don't know what it was.

87
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:09.330
Nicole Roybal: I think honestly like deep down as I really like to try to think about it like I think it's just everything going on in the world down freaking out. I'm trying not to because

88
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.130
Nicole Roybal: No one ever talks about anymore. And I'm just like, Oh, no.

89
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. I got it.

90
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're gonna I'm gonna pull away from this I'm gonna, I wrote a nice little note here and I can pull back to this conversation a little bit. I'd like to continue the one that we started from before I did.

91
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I pulled up. I didn't enjoy looking at myself. I gotta tell you what to

92
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do to pray, God. Well, I had to look at me. Oh my god.

93
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm sitting there like, you know, eating my salad because this is this is i i wait too long and I did it again today to eat something.

94
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sitting there now now now now.

95
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was, I wrote a little have

96
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Looked at the video I was more paying it, I wrote little like timeframes from the video. Like, I wonder, wonder if we can look at little pieces of it.

97
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to look at it because I know you said, I'm willing to hear. I don't want to see myself. You may change your mind, you may say, Oh, what, what do I look like when I'm doing that.

98
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You may change your mind. But I thought we could

99
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought you could listen, you could observe

100
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Through hearing listen for and see what you notice and get an opinion. Okay. Not Daniels opinion, not my opinion, your own opinion because we often can't

101
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to what we're doing in the minute because we're doing it.

102
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah

103
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So right around point 05 is when you said, Oh, I gotta talk about code first I was like okay

104
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We talked about that one. And then seven. Let's see.

105
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course,

106
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This is life here of course it's not giving me what I want it now spinning

107
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That is life right they're

108
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

109
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.200
Nicole Roybal: Going through therapy. You asked us to write down something that we feel that, and what we could do.

110
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.280
Nicole Roybal: I had actually

111
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Answers.

112
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.700
Nicole Roybal: The first answer was, like,

113
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you failed at life.

114
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.130
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I put like life career.

115
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.720
Will you be careful.

116
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:53.130
Nicole Roybal: I'm sorry, my boyfriend. I put life school career. And then for what you could have done differently. I could have started school earlier and figured out what I want to do with my life sooner. I could have tried harder.

117
00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:03.960
Nicole Roybal: And I just wanted to let you know that that was my first answer and then I heard everyone else's answers. I was like, okay, mine sounds a little too, like, whoa.

118
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.030
Like oh

119
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: No know I didn't think that at all. I think yours is exactly

120
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I heard other people talking about school life or I heard several people. But again, I kind of put everybody all in one group in my head. So what did you hear other people. How are their answers.

121
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.550
Nicole Roybal: Now a lot of people didn't say school

122
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:36.660
Nicole Roybal: I guess I pertaining mind towards like just like my whole life. But I guess it is having to do it schooling and career because I believe that schooling is what leads to a good career.

123
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:46.380
Nicole Roybal: So I think I just failed at not for your not what I want to do sooner and just actually going to school and doing it sooner. Well,

124
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk more about how you define life though that might be the bigger piece I'm coming for you mean I feel that life like tell me more about what that means.

125
00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:05.190
Nicole Roybal: Well as like just bringing back stuff in the past, like how I'm gonna be 20 I'm getting closer to 30 and I feel like I should have everything together by let you know.

126
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:17.730

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And the things that I feel passionate about and I didn't put energy and effort into they don't just magically happen.

136
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: when we're children, teenagers and in our 20s. We don't know that we're not thinking about that we're not thinking about the future. You're knows nothing wrong with what you did. That's a normal teenage young person's brain, the piece that was missing wasn't a piece that was in you call

137
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that was missing was the executive functioning, which is apparent.

138
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:34.200
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

139
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That's when a parent kind of sorta supposed to be there. You get your butt home by 12 o'clock. Get your butt home. No, you're gonna live up under my house.

140
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Get your home. You know I love you get your home and you're going to do your homework. I know you don't want to do it now. But this get this degree. I know you if you can do it will study a little bit together. I'll do these flashcards with you. Come on.

141
00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this and you hate them in your man.

142
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You lose your shit and the parent goes. Huh. Give me that phone.

143
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit down. Can your room. I'm taking that door off. You don't behave, Sam.

144
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

145
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IT UP ON MY, TAKE BACK. I'm going to take your car insurance and you're like,

146
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:21.600
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

147
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I must say

148
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.910
Nicole Roybal: There was really nothing they could take away from me decide hanging out with my friends.

149
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to say, oh, oh ok so now I'ma sit down. Maybe I'll study. So my point was not to critique family. It was for you to hear that your timeline, your brain isn't going to be done. I just read recently and made it even worse.

150
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: First, I was thinking that women's brains are gonna be done it for 2425 done growing, but now I'm hearing

151
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That for people like right around that have any kind of attention deficit, things like that was all the way to 30 so just imagine your brain just finished development at 30

152
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That this whole time that it would have been helpful to have someone in your life kind of saying, think about the future. Think about the future. Think about the future. Think about the future and he because that that part of the brain wasn't done growing yet.

153
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you're able to do it for yourself. And now you're pissed off at yourself. Well, why don't you drop that part that's not your fault. That's just biology.

154
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.550
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

155
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Nicole.

156
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I have yet to see the client.

157
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That grows that goes back to school because they call themselves a loser because they say you're a failure. They simply don't move, they sit there and they dab.

158
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And they get high and they drink and they are stoned, because they don't want to think about. I'm a failure. I'm a loser.

159
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Who would they want to escape. So my invitation to you is knock it off with the self reproach and this the whipping that you're doing. There's another way to discipline yourself okay the Inner Parent that you have inside of you. This is the psychobabble part

160
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You have this negative Inner Parent that's like, you shouldn't you should have died. The first time and you should have done it when you were younger.

161
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. Like, that doesn't work.

162
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work because then you feel like crap and you get stoned and you want to drink. Yeah, but instead

163
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Shut that parent up with a little thought stopping you like. Yeah, that might have worked when I was younger, but now I'm on my way here.

164
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to listen to the kind of things that whens maybe talking about or maybe you've seen somewhere else.

165
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Some kind of healthy parenting, or whatever. And you're like, well, what would win do what we're going to do if I was feeling down and myself, and I call myself a failure. Whoa, whoa, how would I cheerlead myself.

166
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If you read my voice, how we if I was in your head.

167
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were being down on yourself and your you shut that Inner Parent out the one that says when you should have thought about that before that one. You just pushed it out and instead you heard my voice.

168
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was more like you got this. Let's do the next right thing. What's the one thing you could do, like, how is it going to sound in your head that you can get into your life that you can get into school, you can get into.

169
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Your career, what's something. What's a voice you would hear how would it sound in your head.

170
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.530
Nicole Roybal: How would it sound wrote it say

171
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:51.720
Well,

172
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.740
Nicole Roybal: I guess I kind of the way. Like I motivate myself is like

173
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:04.950
Nicole Roybal: Stop being a little bitch something a pussy do this. Yeah. Because if your frickin ancient already if you still have so much time. So stop acting like

174
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

175
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.380
Nicole Roybal: You don't have to be like to get it tomorrow, like you have to give yourself time. Be patient.

176
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

177
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that, what do you then do after that one after that. What do you do

178
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're honest with yourself and cold. What do you actually do

179
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: After that,

180
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.610
Nicole Roybal: Try not to feel sorry for myself, but I usually will do anyway.

181
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many minutes past while you're doing that.

182
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.980
Nicole Roybal: Something I like spend my time thinking about I just kind of try to push it away.

183
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So the best you came up with for your revised Inner Parent

184
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, be patient with yourself. Right. Be patient.

185
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: No one's expecting you to, you know, you took this long to come to this. It's not all going to change overnight. Just be patient with it. So the encouragement is just to be patient.

186
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I did hear what you know you're being irrational. Right. That's irrational. Now, you call yourself. Other names but but what that is is a rational thinking right so be patient use logic and reason.

187
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's still not

188
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: getting you to do anything.

189
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.950
Nicole Roybal: I know I don't know how to dig deeper to get to that point. I'm trying

190
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's just see what happens.

191
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.660
Nicole Roybal: Crazy with like a million dollars at one

192
00:22:54.690 --> 00:23:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens if we do something a little different. One should grab grab a piece of paper and pen and let's get a nice fresh nothing written on a piece of paper.

193
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's draw. Let's draw a line down the middle. And it doesn't matter can either be this vertical or I would say, Let's go landscape and then draw a line down the middle in here.

194
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: On the left side will say now.

195
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: On the right side will say,

196
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Future.

197
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you draw over on the left.

198
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You

199
00:23:54.780 --> 00:24:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone else that you want. These are open ended for a reason you anyone else, some sort of tree some sort of house over on the left.

200
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.570
Nicole Roybal: Me and a house.

201
00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.130
You

202
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Anybody, anybody else.

203
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: A house and a tree.

204
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.180
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

205
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have you some other figures figure figures a house and a tree.

206
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.740
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I wasn't sure what kind of people did you want me to put them with me.

207
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't tell you. I just said some kind of evil.

208
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

209
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So you came up with your own idea and then you did it.

210
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You can add anything else just sort of putting Whatever comes to mind. This is not an art lesson I don't, I wouldn't know how to judge it anyway. I don't have those skills.

211
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This is therapy. So it says a therapeutic intervention. This will call this art therapy.

212
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.780
Nicole Roybal: Every

213
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

214
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's anything else this sort of sort of represents now so you

215
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, just make sure you put maybe some symbols of some sort of representations of sort of a reflection of timestamp of you now on that left side.

216
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this piece of paper free meaning is it ripped out of the

217
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Binder

218
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm a part of me wants it to stay there because like for longevity, like we might visit again. But another part of the economy doesn't want you to be looking at the left side when we do the right one. So maybe kind of

219
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:38.700
covering it up.

220
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.310

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at the images.

273
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Over on the right and tell me about how maybe one or the other looks more or less difficult. Which one looks difficult to to get to, because you're here on the left, maybe look at one of the images and just sort of

274
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about boy, this one looks like it might be hard to get to over on the right.

275
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.670
Nicole Roybal: Well quitting cigarettes, of course.

276
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: quitting cigarettes.

277
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:46.710
Nicole Roybal: Even like quitting like at this moment. It's more just slowing down. So I'm starting to notice how much I smoke, maybe like this morning I woke up, just take a few jobs and go back to sleep like stupid and

278
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.350
Nicole Roybal: I just laying there and click taste in my mouth. I'm just like, Oh, I'm so tired of this.

279
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:58.770
Nicole Roybal: Like, I want to be able to sleep throughout my whole sleep without waking up and creating a cigarette.

280
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:06.750
Nicole Roybal: Them. So that seems like a hard one, of course, to get them and of course diploma career, especially their thing going on right now.

281
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:16.170
Nicole Roybal: But it is just like that one actually seems the hardest because of how I'm already in student debt student loan debt.

282
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying the diploma or the career seems the hardest the deployment, the deployment.

283
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, school, there we go. So that one right in the middle. Smack down that graduation dab in the middle is that that graduation hat. Does that seem like the most difficult

284
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

285
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's interesting. It ended up being right in the middle.

286
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.100
Nicole Roybal: Purpose. So I guess maybe subconsciously, it was

287
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So take a look over at your now picture.

288
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to slow way down.

289
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to catch your first uncensored responses.

290
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can add

291
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Bearing whoops. Yeah. Seems barren, you said

292
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's the invitation.

293
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, try not to censor try to grab that first response and then draw it.

294
00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So just notice and as you did you notice it was barren.

295
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to get school and diploma. What do you need on the now side look at your paper. What do you need on the now side.

296
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So draw, draw some money. So draw some symbols of money.

297
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

298
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: How much money.

299
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.380
Nicole Roybal: A lot my student loans.

300
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how much

301
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.330
Nicole Roybal: $10,000

302
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so put 10 K

303
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You got that one written in there.

304
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now look over to the right.

305
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at that diploma.

306
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You getting a sense that it doesn't seem as difficult once you have that money.

307
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:46.260
Nicole Roybal: On my chest. Because the only thing I'm thinking about is, that's a lot of money. There's no way I'll ever be able to do that all

308
00:40:49.650 --> 00:41:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: At once one. Yeah, so it had the opposite. So what just happened was an actual on that was a negative thought. And that's actually one of the irrational ones so

309
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how did what it was so so borrow it over here, come over to my thinking how do I pay off a half a million dollar house, then

310
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone in America is doing that. Well, not this month this month. They're really struggling but or

311
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That, um, some people still have student loans.

312
00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Like so what you just did was based information on no data.

313
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: $10,000 is not a lot of money to someone else to you because you don't have it, because you're not seeing money coming in, you can't see that that I can get paid off quickly.

314
00:41:54.990 --> 00:42:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Or ever that can get paid off a car payment cars or what 20 $30,000 How dare you buy a car. Then, how dare you get alone.

315
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we make small payments.

316
00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. You don't have to win the lottery. You don't have to do any of those things. The first step is to get into a rational actual mindset and I still think getting on the phone with your lender might be the way to go.

317
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think you're

318
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.670
Nicole Roybal: Nothing makes sense. And then you ask them, What do you mean, what do you mean, and they say it again and

319
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:41.970
Nicole Roybal: If it's off because I don't understand. And it was jargon and lingo that they're using

320
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Nicole. We'll do it together. You'll get on the phone with them and I'll be right here and I'll listen to their they're trying to intimidate and make you confused and we'll do it together.

321
00:42:52.140 --> 00:43:03.360
Nicole Roybal: Well, I mean, like they were kind of intimidated. She was like, like she said I wasn't be on different man. I have to re up every year. And I don't know, look, it just didn't make sense. And if I do reopen every year than

322
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.620
Nicole Roybal: 10 years or something like that, it'll just go away.

323
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.770
Nicole Roybal: Which didn't make sense. So I was like,

324
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:17.520
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I get a difference though it's not on my credit and it made my credit score go lower, but I don't know.

325
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this the second. Is this the call after we talked a month ago, or whenever. Is this a follow up call. This was the original one.

326
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:27.330
Nicole Roybal: Original one in January.

327
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.930
Okay.

328
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What you don't know yet is the compounded interest rate that this $10,000 could turn into 20

329
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.780
Yeah.

330
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.410
Nicole Roybal: If I don't read the different thing every year.

331
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:52.230
Nicole Roybal: So I don't know. She says, I'm saying is, I don't know if I even understand what I'm saying, I don't know if I'm right. Because what she said, I don't even know. I don't know.

332
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole. That's right. So notice now look at your page. Look at the now.

333
00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What else is needed.

334
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard money, but what else

335
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:06.960
Nicole Roybal: Intelligence

336
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So it isn't so intelligence member that's a neat thing you just did this isn't we are born knowing what the word different windows.

337
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.880
Nicole Roybal: Oh yeah, gaining intelligence on

338
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's information that's information that's knowledge draw that.

339
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can get that on this now side let's get that knowledge, information data.

340
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can get

341
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's dipping into that growth mindset. All I need to do is I just I ran into someone who's not able to to teach me exactly initiative. Why would she wants to she wants it to stand firm and she doesn't, you know, the

342
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, I hope I'm wrong. But anyway, I think that what's needed is information.

343
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:01.020
Nicole Roybal: And then

344
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Have an informed decision.

345
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.210
Nicole Roybal: I think what she said I wouldn't have to pay anything that's the only thing I heard from there on, you know,

346
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I just, it's so cool. You just did that. I just ran across this this information that

347
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Some research saying on motivation or something like that. And we got we hear things like this love know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

348
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You look good.

349
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: God, God, God, God, God, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

350
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You're smart and you have to have now. Now you're going to have money right that we hear the part we that makes us feel good. So

351
00:45:47.640 --> 00:46:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have tuned in to the part that was appealing which felt good, which was, oh, I won't have to think about this money in 10 years been goodness. Right. You might have tuned into that part. Possibly. I don't know.

352
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but, but it's not a fly. It's not a flying you we all do it every single one of us you we all do it.

353
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So all that's needed all this needed is to go back in in a clear Mind not high

354
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Not high. Okay, you've got pruning going on in your brain, your it decreases the ability for you to

355
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to motivate. That's the part of the brain, the doc was probably talking about and group it inhibits motivation to to want to change you want to do anything.

356
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And it prunes memory. So you might be thinking, oh, I'm learning new things you're going to be learning things in here that won't stick because you're still

357
00:46:49.140 --> 00:47:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Smoking dabbing whatever so it's it's going to get in the way. I'm going to put that aside. My point is, make a call if you can, and just get data and I can either be there. I can be there with you or someone else that you trust that will

358
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of support you through your confusion over a word you have what's called intelligence. You just need that growth mindset that I don't know when I haven't learned

359
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you how can any of us know, but we haven't learned

360
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:23.820
Yet

361
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, please do.

362
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.410
Nicole Roybal: Everything.

363
00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: No way.

364
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but you've had a pressure on you as you are coming up to, to be responsible to be your own parent and a lot of ways, but

365
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that that's not a typical healthy development, it's

366
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:52.410
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, also being my little sister's parent as well, you know,

367
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:58.050
Nicole Roybal: I've always felt like the boss, I guess, like I needed to be the boss or the one in charge.

368
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well now it's your time to be the student

369
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

370
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and

371
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.560
Nicole Roybal: There was something else I wanted to talk to you about

372
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:16.320
Nicole Roybal: This personality quiz thing, whatever with the right heart health. Okay, now they want me to do this rap session on Monday.

373
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know.

374
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:28.350
Nicole Roybal: Like talk about my life. And when I could change my everyday faces. I'm like why why I don't. I got into my therapist about this. I don't want to talk to you. I don't even know you.

375
00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:33.600
Nicole Roybal: Yeah I know why, like, you know, like I'm trying not to have an attitude about it for some reason I feel like

376
00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.540
Nicole Roybal: I don't want to open up to this person. I don't even know.

377
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand. I do. And it's, it's, um,

378
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This sounds too good to be true, it probably is. So what's the deal. How do you benefit from my differing my 10 K, yo.

379
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that's how it's going to sound. I'm going to be like them big 14 letter words.

380
00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:58.560
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

381
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:03.930
Nicole Roybal: I just wanted to see em, I guess your opinion on that and I see

382
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you sure you sure got it.

383
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, and, and it's it's a struggle because I'm conflicted. I mean, I have, you know, I mean, I'm enjoying this job. I think that the bright hearts got some really cool things going on with it. Um, and I enjoy the independence, so I don't have anybody kind of

384
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this is this is confusing for me what what you just brought up is it I'm in it with you going, huh, huh, huh. Now if you want to, you could do it if you wanted to go check it out. See if you like it, and then you could really complain about it.

385
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, then you could say, well, but you also might come back and say, You know what, when I was wrong. We're really interesting because it's the first time I've been able to really look

386
00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: At this stuff like on the left hand side of your page this gal made me really itemize the different tasks that it might take for me to get my degree you might end up liking it, you might like that someone that just sort of first these these tasks.

387
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And really objectively had it measurable and timeframe that might be the outcome. I'm open. It could be awesome.

388
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:30.600
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I hope, I hope I end up liking it. I'm not looking forward to it. It's good to have this today. And then after that, on Monday and on Tuesday, I have to do therapy positive turn into an everyday thing.

389
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:31.590
Right.

390
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget about you. Um, it matters. You didn't lose your right

391
00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you signed up for this program, you still have right you still yes these are the expectations and maybe that will be a consequence. But if you want to know what they are. I don't happen. I'm not going to do anything to you. I can tell you right now, I ain't going to do anything.

392
00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So if someone you could ask her and say, well, what's the consequence if I don't do it because, you know, I mean, that could be a route you take you could email someone you could send it to me and I could forward it on to it. So yeah.

393
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:19.920
Nicole Roybal: Good. I can't go a group. If I don't do it. Same with my Pika. I gotta deliver this week and I haven't been to my mom's house. But if you don't call in and do it for truth and you can't do group.

394
00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:27.870
Nicole Roybal: So same with the rap session and the peak of their time you that and they tell me that every single time with the PICO voice comes in late

395
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

396
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:37.440
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, no, no, there's nothing you can do. I'm just saying that's what they tell me so

397
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:38.280
Right.

398
