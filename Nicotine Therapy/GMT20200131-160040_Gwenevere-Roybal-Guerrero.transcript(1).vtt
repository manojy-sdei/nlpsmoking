Okay.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.510
Nicole Roybal: Um, well, I was talking to my boyfriend. This week, a little bit more. And we hung out the past couple days so honest and formed a lot better.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.590
Nicole Roybal: With that it's been being a lot nicer, just like the space honestly really helped us with we've been away from each other like two weeks now, maybe a little bit longer.

13
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.870
Nicole Roybal: So I feel like the space really helped because like I don't only one guy yesterday.

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.560
Nicole Roybal: And it just seems like our relationship is a lot better like he's being a lot nicer. It's like being more respectable and he's like,

15
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.290
Nicole Roybal: I understand, like, now you're clean, I gotta stop like thinking my old ways and like thinking that you're always junk. It's like whenever you're answering ways like he's like, I'm sorry that I've been that way. I know.

16
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.140
Nicole Roybal: You just basically explained to me like that business apologize and just said, I started. He's been like so stressed out lately and like just, I don't know.

17
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
Nicole Roybal: I don't want those excuses, but I still took it as I love you.

18
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.480
Nicole Roybal: Know, really good at something, I thought, last night, but he dropped me off this morning to you have to go to work. Okay.

19
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice that

20
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: When your relationship with him is going better

21
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Than your feelings throughout the day or improved.

22
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.010
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. It helped a lot like the cravings, like knowing he believes in me. I guess like just help because

23
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:21.210
Nicole Roybal: I mean, it's not like I'm doing it for him for me but like I just feel like knowing that he's behind me just really like the support means a lot. It means a lot, a lot, knowing that you finally accepted like show. Okay, maybe I should suction her like shit she actually did it, you know.

24
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.540
Nicole Roybal: So I think hopefully he opened his eyes, but I'm still gonna stay at my monster of a little bit longer, just so that way.

25
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

26
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.760
Nicole Roybal: Sure. Everything's good. You know, right.

27
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.920
Nicole Roybal: Before I was hanging out with him. I was doing better working out. And I'm just going to see the baby. A lot of stuff like that.

28
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you getting along with your sisters

29
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.540
Nicole Roybal: Really good actually.

30
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.340
Nicole Roybal: My family at all since I've been here, which is really good because usually every single time. I'm here. I always fight with them. I haven't been fighting with them so that

31
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.200
Nicole Roybal: Is

32
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.480
Nicole Roybal: I'm drinking

33
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, maybe that's making a difference.

34
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.760
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, definitely.

35
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.840
Nicole Roybal: Go to Facebook. So why

36
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, I'm sorry about that eating thing I'm okay.

37
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.330
Nicole Roybal: Lot later over there this year.

38
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, just want to kind of see where we where we left off last time.

39
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.500
Nicole Roybal: We were doing.

40
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.740
Nicole Roybal: Like inside the brain exercises and stuff, huh, yeah.

41
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing.

42
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We were working on

43
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We working on the anchor room.

44
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.230
Nicole Roybal: It's our fault. A room.

45
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we get I

46
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Get um

47
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you were sort of acknowledging this sort of younger self at age 17

48
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.490
Huh, yeah.

49
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.280
Nicole Roybal: It's weird because after that I was having weird dreams about like how my excess talking about scenario.

50
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.970
Nicole Roybal: was weird because I jumped about him and I was just like, no, I don't want

51
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.170
Nicole Roybal: He's not the same person.

52
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a moment and reflect

53
00:04:50.610 --> 00:05:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, close your eyes and do it. Just so that she doesn't have this added feature of of nervousness or anxiousness about having to say it in a particular way with me.

54
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying try and see

55
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What, meaning it has for you.

56
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That your recovery goes up and down or you have good or bad days, based on the functioning of a relationship with your boyfriend, try and sit with that a little bit and see what comes up for you.

57
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:34.530
Nicole Roybal: I know that's like issues to support really matter because I should be able to do it without anyone's for, I guess, is what I know.

58
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:51.870
Nicole Roybal: Hmm. Um, but for some reason. And I do have a support it just makes me feel all the much better and my cravings aren't as bad amount of suppressed. Finally, eat better, it wasn't even like once a day. Now I'm finally able to eat a little bit more

59
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.250
Nicole Roybal: But I just, I don't know, I feel like

60
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.030
Nicole Roybal: I don't know why I mean so much to me to have people supporting especially him. His Word is what matters the most. And I don't know why.

61
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long have you been with them.

62
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.760
Nicole Roybal: Every five years and me.

63
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:33.510
Nicole Roybal: Says it's a long time to have been with someone and I've never been with somebody that long constant. The whole time together. So it's just like, it's weird. I guess I don't know how to

64
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.120
Nicole Roybal: Not depend on this. I guess because we we've been

65
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.060
Nicole Roybal: Leaning on each other for so long, you know,

66
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: How does he lean on you.

67
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.110
Nicole Roybal: Will just like ever like we are both working. I'm not saying right now in the past.

68
00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:05.460
Nicole Roybal: Like seven months. I haven't been working so that's why it's been so but before that every time we are both working like we both help each other out. Like, we will pay the bills we both

69
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:18.450
Nicole Roybal: Lean on each other and we just like you know we need each other. The ocean only financially and like that, like, you know, we have each other, but lately. I haven't had any actually if I feel like it's caused a big Rift.

70
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.040
Nicole Roybal: And our Iman is such a big deal. Well, it is when you're paying all the bills.

71
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So Nicole, what would it be like for you.

72
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to take this this recovery process.

73
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Seriously, in the sense that I already know you are. But I guess what I'm trying to say is

74
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people in early recovery, don't start new relationships. Now you are already in one but it went through a significant change because your behaviors are not going to be the same.

75
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.570
Nicole Roybal: Because you're not

76
00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Drinking it's impacted your ability to kind of work. It was already impacting it but

77
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Big things are happening.

78
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like for you. Do you think to

79
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you ended up staying at your mother's for an extended period of time, but that you actually worked on. You know how you said, I'm not sure if I'm getting even like myself and it find out who I am. You've had a real stilted development of this identity and

80
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how when you weren't with him. There was a lot of craving, and I'm just wondering if he's a part of an identity somehow for you.

81
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a possibility.

82
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.530
Nicole Roybal: Hmm.

83
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:53.250
Nicole Roybal: I guess I feel like I'm more myself when I'm with him like get sure like just finally, and to be happy and just

84
00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:05.040
Nicole Roybal: I just felt like more just finally, like myself, honestly, I don't, I guess maybe that's identity thing I have like you're saying, I don't know. I felt like I was more of myself, my bill is I don't

85
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what did you like about yourself when you're with them.

86
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:19.380
Nicole Roybal: Just finally, like I said, Just happy not depressed anymore, not craving at all, just like happy just finally just having a conversation without

87
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:29.610
Nicole Roybal: With him without it being like one sided without him judging me just having a normal, normal conversation. And honestly, it was just

88
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.030
Nicole Roybal: Being able to just talk and no one's timey where I should do or shouldn't do.

89
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.000
Nicole Roybal: This and that. It's just, I don't know, just I can't explain really like I

90
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just don't rush it that that's why you're here.

91
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.960
Nicole Roybal: It's just like, I don't really know. Like, okay, like it's just like, just like cuz I will you said, we've been at it for five years. So we just have

92
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:59.580
Nicole Roybal: Stuff that we would have to talk about. I haven't seen each other for a couple weeks. So it's just nice to have new things to talk about, I guess.

93
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.090
Nicole Roybal: Catch up, I guess, I don't know. I don't know what it was.

94
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.010
Nicole Roybal: I know

95
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this

96
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of a lot. Oh, you're saying a lot

97
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um,

98
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember what my question was,

99
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.670
Nicole Roybal: You said what about it made me feel more like me.

100
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope.

101
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When I

102
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.550
Nicole Roybal: Was definitely

103
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. Um, but that's why I'm saying, Go slow let these answers come from reflection, not the first that first step that pops up. Just sit, sit a little bit longer with it because this is this is a really specific question. What did you like about yourself when you were with him.

104
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.940
Nicole Roybal: Like that I was happy. Okay.

105
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:04.830
Nicole Roybal: As I said to. I like that. I wasn't being judged for once in the conversation that we're having. Okay, hold on a second.

106
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just you just went to his behavior. It took only one thing

107
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.560
Nicole Roybal: Because his behavior, have to do with the way I was feeling

108
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, you gotta go really slow on this because real quick. What you do is you start talking about his behavior. So

109
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: In the absence. This is

110
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Really hard to get to this stuff sounds like an easy question, but they're hard to get to

111
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.470
Nicole Roybal: This behavior has to do with what I'm feeling. So how do I not talk about his behavior.

112
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.040
Nicole Roybal: That's my point. Like, I don't get it.

113
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, sit within a little longer. You'll find it.

114
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.630
Nicole Roybal: I'm

115
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow down, slow down, just do some breathing for a second. Let's try some trying to, you know, grab these answers for me and really just, just be with the fact that this is a different kind of question. And there's some challenge and trying to get get at it.

116
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

117
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes you can sort of

118
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: tightrope right maybe between different people. So we might take, let's picture yourself sitting next to your boyfriend.

119
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And then picture yourself sitting maybe next to your mother.

120
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And just go back and forth. Nice and easy just picturing almost like a split screen. You've got this image of sitting with boyfriend very recently, and you've got this picture of sitting with mother.

121
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And see

122
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: See, as if there was this way to videotape your internal experience and also maybe on the outside to

123
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you notice how you think.

124
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: feel and behave differently in the screen.

125
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just take with your mother. What are you thinking

126
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Over there on that screen.

127
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:03.960
Nicole Roybal: Alcohol.

128
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so alcohol is one word craving is one word. What's the actual thought

129
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.380
Nicole Roybal: I shouldn't be here.

130
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I shouldn't be here.

131
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is that

132
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.260
Nicole Roybal: Because it's making the cravings harder. Okay.

133
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you like or not like about yourself in those moments.

134
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:43.200
Nicole Roybal: I can't get over these things and I should have never started drinking to begin on extroverted

135
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does it say about your belief about yourself. So probably be in an I am statement.

136
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you saying about who you are and what you believe about yourself.

137
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:09.390
Nicole Roybal: And want to believe I'm strong, but I feel like sometimes if I'm still craving and obviously I'm not strong enough.

138
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you

Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to keep working at this question that I asked, we're not quite there. But we're getting a lot closer, such as sort of sit with that presence of feeling safe relaxed and a sense of belonging.

164
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the belief about yourself in this image with boyfriend.

168
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.730

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.820
You know, some big

171
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Not nothing. No, it's definitely not good.

172
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So just just linger a little longer with it.

173
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to get to know that confidence, a little bit more

174
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know that to be true, what evidence was there. I am more confident. How do you know that to be true.

175
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.890
Nicole Roybal: Um, I don't know, I guess just like

176
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.040
Nicole Roybal: Again, I'm seeing him like filling his support behind me like just I'm

177
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.700
Nicole Roybal: feeling loved. Okay, so be one person actually want it from

178
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you actually could feel his love and support and this is who you want it from

179
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And with that you feel confident. Do you like that.

180
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: With his love and support.

181
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are confident. Do you like that about yourself.

182
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.790
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, definitely. I want to be confident

183
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So go back over to the other image and sort of sit with being in this this other screen where you're sitting with your mother and tell me a little bit about confidence, what you like or don't like about yourself there and that image.

184
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:59.520
Nicole Roybal: Well, I don't like that the cravings are so severe, because I thought I could be strong enough to be around it and

185
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:11.280
Nicole Roybal: want it so badly. But then it makes me proud that I am pregnant so bad. And I'm not drinking it. So I'm around and I'm still not drinking it. So at least there's that. But I just like

186
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.560
Nicole Roybal: I shouldn't even want it, it's already been a month. Like, I shouldn't even want it.

187
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:25.020
Nicole Roybal: But I guess I just, I feel like it's like all gonna happen overnight. And I know it's not as if told me millions of times, it's not. It's gonna take a while, and I

188
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.200
Nicole Roybal: Like it was just like, you know,

189
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.930
Nicole Roybal: To norm. Some normality.

190
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you didn't like about yourself was

191
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of noticing.

192
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: An impatience right around wanting the cravings to be gone. But you did also like about yourself around your mom, you notice that you're proud of yourself.

193
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.840
Yeah.

194
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:06.870
Nicole Roybal: It comes down to it, and but I just feel like all the other bad feelings cloud it because, like, I'm like already blocking out that like

195
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:18.840
Nicole Roybal: A globalist so then instead of that voice I'm hearing all these bad doc places like, Oh, well, you're not there, half we can even they cannot. I mean, you're not enough to silver any

196
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.550
Nicole Roybal: Right, I know I am. So I started more

197
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.200
Nicole Roybal: friggin disturbing sessions always make me credit crazy

198
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I know we got to where the waterproof mascara on these days.

199
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's move over to this other image and and just kind of sense of being near

200
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: This sense of

201
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling loved and supported

202
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And I also heard also

203
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of needing that to be there and then your confidence when call

204
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.480
Nicole Roybal: I know that's what gets me max to shoot me that I should

205
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.040
Nicole Roybal: Just do it without needing that

206
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So both sides have a should

207
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Both sides. Do I should this or I should that on both of these screens.

208
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And

209
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's all take I'm going to pick that up a little later I'll address that later. I really want to stay in here.

210
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to

211
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What else you noticed that you liked about yourself when you were with your boyfriend.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:15.480
Nicole Roybal: I like that. I don't know, it's, it's hard to like, like I like that. We're like actually sitting together because usually, we always be sitting on different couches.

227
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Is that kind of new for you to feel romantically

228
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.800
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, just because the past few months have been just

229
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:45.000
Nicole Roybal: It was like, kind of like it felt like he was like, I love with me. So it felt good to know that he does still love me, and he does so miss me again his feelings. I know, but

230
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So because you got

231
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.590
Nicole Roybal: To feel that. Okay.

232
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's the feeling, but I want you to look at what you liked about you see you're making you're noticing.

233
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All that's given away, which means you're spending all this energy notice you caught yourself doing it right. This is what he's doing. He's the cause of my joy.

234
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't want to reinforce that.

235
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:30.330
Nicole Roybal: Right now, like yeah cuz like I mean I've been really depressed about just like us being apart and we've been together for five years, like, of course. Yeah, right now, that is my main focus of my joy because I'm sad about it. So I've been said about him so

236
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So just this just takes a little extra effort.

237
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.440
Nicole Roybal: Sorry, I don't know if you can hear me getting a little defensive. My bad.

238
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.740
Nicole Roybal: That's right. I don't mean to

239
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I know how important he is. I know how important it is, you've made that very clear.

240
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:48.960
Nicole Roybal: You really

241
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I also hear yourself.

242
00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Should on yourself, which is I shouldn't say I'm hearing both you keep I can hear it on this side and I can hear it. I shouldn't have cravings. I shouldn't need

243
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.460
Nicole Roybal: Always wait this

244
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is love and support. So, you know, like I said, I want to get to that that

245
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a rigid thought the should. It's a troublemaker in there. Yeah, but I'm before we go there, just notice. Notice how easy or how difficult it is to identify things you like about yourself.

246
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how looking so say again.

247
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:52.290
Nicole Roybal: There's not very many things I was actually watching this lead to something and they said, easier to love yourself externally. That is internally and I thought that's is my problem is I love myself more on the outside, looks at times but internally about

248
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.640
Nicole Roybal: Right.

249
00:25:54.030 --> 00:26:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to get there. And so what you're seeing as an activity where it's coming up that deficit in a sense is in sharp focus right now. Each time I say keep going there. Keep going there. You keep going.

250
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see him. I can see him. I can feel him.

251
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.660
Nicole Roybal: And now I don't know where to go. What I'm trying to go there, like, I don't know where to go. I've never

252
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:26.550
Nicole Roybal: I know maybe my brain is scared to go there. I don't know what it is but for some reason I can't like blocks and I just turned the other way.

253
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you get do some things. So take take pride in it. What you did notice is

254
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You did catch yourself and the vision with with the mother you caught yourself having pride.

255
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I didn't drink, even though there's beer cans.

256
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's people drinking and all this childhood stuff just everything from sights, smells sounds. It's all right there and you were proud.

257
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.590
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

258
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:02.790
Okay.

259
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice on the other side with boyfriend you noticed, I had an honest.

260
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Happy and it showed on your face.

261
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, honest one the southern one over here. Maybe on on the mother's side has there been some phony pretending to be happy.

262
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:37.500
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, because like I said over the past couple weeks. So since I've been here. Yeah, it's just basically been just like me trying to pretend he happy because I'm not going to be all doom and gloom make everyone else all spring down their moods, you know. So just, I guess.

263
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.990
Nicole Roybal: Oh, is it catering to their feelings, in a way, not really caring about mine.

264
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so hold on to that one. So now go over to the vision with boyfriend go over to that screen.

265
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture yourself sitting on the couch guys are sitting closer and there's a genuine honest.

266
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.000
Nicole Roybal: Happy

267
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not fake. So focus on the affirmative, which is what is there. I'm happy and my smile is real.

268
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know what that is.

269
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What about honest, do you, when you look at that image do you like about yourself that you are honest.

270
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.570
Nicole Roybal: Do I like it. I said,

271
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah look at that vision. Stay on either side with boyfriend.

272
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now look at it with that words sort of floating through the air, because I just said it, you look at yourself. Do you like that you are honest.

273
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.490
Nicole Roybal: Yes.

274
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we just got one.

275
00:28:46.890 --> 00:29:02.520
Nicole Roybal: In the main problem of my relationship is lying about alcohol. So yes, being honest. To be able to like hang out and not have to be like trying to go and shop or like just be able to not worry about anything stealing hang out and

276
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:21.180
Nicole Roybal: Not hide anything not live. I didn't think just finally, I feel like that's why we along so much better. Why I felt so much better about myself because I'm like, wow, I actually be honest and be okay. And when I'm honest, everything is fine and I stupid.

277
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.230

279
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That can feel amazing when you've been hiding the self, and if you've been kind of a bit of a right having to pretend you're happier because you're putting the feelings of your family above yours. Don't want to be gloom and doom. You have a choice about that you could decide

280
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: To be honest, at your house you're deciding

281
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right to have this this kind of fake thing. Go on, but it is a decision. It's not an imperative that you have to be Miss chipper

339
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:18.330

Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a little bit more about nice what that looks like. So I

344
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.100
Nicole Roybal: Know,

345
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Really on purpose. And this is still in the zone of honest though. You weren't doing something that was dishonest and manipulative, it was still from the heart. Nice. Right.

346
00:34:50.040 --> 00:35:00.240
Nicole Roybal: So I guess in the past. I was like the buzz not really listening to what you're saying and like, stuff like that, and this time I'm actually tentative and listening and like

347
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:14.760
Nicole Roybal: He could tell them listening, he's like really happy. It's like, Damn, I could finally back to her and she's listening. She's not going to forget what I said tomorrow. I mean, you know, I felt like that in that way. I was being more nice so I was being more

348
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Attentive

349
00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.230
Nicole Roybal: To his feelings and what you're saying.

350
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a good friend to your really

351
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Near for him. Now that that action of being available to someone what do we want to call that, what's the kind of in your world, what would that be called when you're available.

352
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: For someone

353
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.170
Nicole Roybal: Would you said a friend.

354
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.050
Nicole Roybal: Honestly,

355
00:35:48.480 --> 00:36:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So try this on now picture you're looking at yourself on the couch. You're sitting close by. You see the smile. You see, you're being honest. Do you like her. Is she a good friend.

356
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.230
She

357
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:06.510
Nicole Roybal: Wants to be

358
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:09.540
Nicole Roybal: The person I want to be.

359
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you see a

360
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: glimpse of it.

361
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.280
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, it felt more like person that used to be, I guess just

362
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:24.660
Nicole Roybal: Because I did you see a really good friend. And now I don't have any friends and that's not because I'm background is just because I just don't talk to anybody.

363
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we'll get into that we're friends.

364
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:39.090
Nicole Roybal: But like, Yeah, but like, so I feel like I'm always emotional emotionally available for people. And when it comes to him. I haven't been and so it felt good to finally be there for something like that.

365
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So emotionally available. Do you like that about you that you were emotionally available to someone you care about.

366
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.120
Yeah.

367
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.330
Nicole Roybal: I was actually listening. Yes.

368
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's how it

369
00:36:53.160 --> 00:37:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It gets verb. Right. That's how we like when I say verb meaning you could be emotionally available on sitting here and they don't know

370
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can show active listening by looking at them and saying, oh, you know, we can use these compassionate words. And we can even echo back way that's hard. And yeah, that'd be difficult or, you know, instead of making it about us.

371
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.320
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

372
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we can hold emotionally what people are going through. And that's a good friend.

373
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.260
Nicole Roybal: That I think you said that

374
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.920
Nicole Roybal: About

375
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.640
Nicole Roybal: My brain went blank. As soon as I said,

376
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.550
Nicole Roybal: You said about

377
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotionally available.

378
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:45.540
Nicole Roybal: Being emotional available for others. And yes, it's like every time in the past like I've been, like, kind of like fake or like

379
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:55.650
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, like I was acting like I was listening but really I was in or just like kind of there was something you said right and my mind go blank. It's like it doesn't want to remember

380
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But wasn't manipulative right

381
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:07.290
Nicole Roybal: really clicked. No, never manipulative never trying to like get my own way. I can remember. Thank you, said

382
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Making it about you. Was it that one.

383
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:25.290
Nicole Roybal: Oh, yes, yes. I'm very always very bad about that. Like, I'll be there'll be talking about them and then I'll somehow. Oh, I went through that change and she's like my own story. And, like, make it about me and I'm just like, Why do you always do that let them talk like you know

384
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.930
Nicole Roybal: So nine

385
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

386
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.920
Nicole Roybal: And it's been called selfish. Because of that, so

387
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That that doesn't have to be the case. I'm

388
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Too bad. That's sad. Goodness gracious.

389
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:46.350
Um,

390
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, you know, even though you just layered that that it's bad. It

391
00:38:53.460 --> 00:39:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If we don't know how to talk to someone like just now. I said, we can say, oh my gosh, that's so difficult. Oh, what a hard day wasn't

392
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: A communication skill that you learned as you were growing up, then what can be listening, like if your family history was let's say mom always said, Oh my gosh, you can't believe what I've been doing. Let's say that was the norm.

393
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what listening look like someone matches a story that doesn't mean it's bad. It just means maybe that's what became normalized. Okay.

394
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:34.800
Nicole Roybal: But

395
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Now right program and you're getting to watch me a little bit too you know in group. And you might hear me saying, oh my goodness, that would be difficult or or I'm reframing and saying, I'm wondering if this is what's going on for you. Or maybe I'm just mirroring or validating there's

396
00:39:54.870 --> 00:40:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that you're getting exposed to a new way to hold the space for someone's distress. Right. And I don't make it about me.

397
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.860
Nicole Roybal: You're really

398
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: A big waste of your time, right, because

399
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but I could right if I wanted

400
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention right if I wanted to feel important.

401
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Special part of your club and group. If I had an unmet need, if I wasn't getting my needs met. I couldn't hold that space.

402
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go with this one on to this. This is a really important one.

403
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Close your eyes. Let's really get into this one.

405
00:40:51.600 --> 00:41:01.440

406
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:08.430
Nicole Roybal: What attribute

407
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be a resource. It might be a truce.

408
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What what sense of

409
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Self efficacy identity can be somewhere in there.

410
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.180
Like

411
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.140
Nicole Roybal: Comes to if people like come to me for advice to like whatever boyfriend, whatever. I feel like I am.

413
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:45.810
Nicole Roybal: That they're being stupid or if they're wrong. Like, I'll let them know. Like, I'm not gonna be like, Oh, no, it's okay to do that, like, no, I'm like, I'm pretty honest about it, you know.

414
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.660
Nicole Roybal: Is it good. Sometimes it could be a bad thing. Sometimes it's a good thing because it's just sometimes they got a year.

415
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's use the one with boyfriend. You went a little bit to other people, just take

416
00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:55.830
Them.

417
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Boyfriend on the couch. Just take it out. He scenting

418
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: For you.

419
00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:04.170
Nicole Roybal: Um,

420
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Health space for him and not have matched it or what else did with what you're going through. You had to have some resources inside of you to have been able to hold space for him. What do you know about you to be true that made that possible.

421
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:27.750
Nicole Roybal: I'm

422
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:42.780
Nicole Roybal: Being able to listen and I was able to listen and actually here without my thoughts clouding air me China like it like we were saying, think of myself.

423
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.810
Nicole Roybal: I was able to

424
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.260
Nicole Roybal: Be more, I guess.

425
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:56.280
Nicole Roybal: This word more like delicate with his emotions and like my words with what I said.

426
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:11.100
Nicole Roybal: Sir, because the, I guess, in the past, like I say, I have been really fun. Sometimes rude about it. And this time, I guess I was able to think more of my words and think more how to say certain things that would sound.

427
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.560
Nicole Roybal: Something wrong.

428
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.170
Someone who's nice

429
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what were you feeling at the time that made it possible for you to be

430
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.670
Nicole Roybal: Delicate

431
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:39.180
Nicole Roybal: Just like I said, I felt like more calm, I felt more loved and accepted.

432
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:46.950
Nicole Roybal: So that helped a lot with just being able to do that, but also that I, the main, main, main, main thing is being sober.

433
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.770
Nicole Roybal: That really helps.

434
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.340
Nicole Roybal: Open my eyes, my ears. My mind but everything

435
00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.500
Nicole Roybal: Like that is like the main, main, main thing I can. It's hard for me not to like

436
00:43:59.130 --> 00:43:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you.

437
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:01.830
Nicole Roybal: And everything you know

438
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm clean and sober. I'm loved and accepted, let's just think about how important that is. And definitely not minimizing that look where you've come. You've come from.

439
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: All these other places. And now we've come to what you liked about yourself.

440
00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A clear headed right you weren't impaired just a real awareness of that.

441
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You were emotionally available to someone and maybe you liked about yourself that you are nice and I would say maybe cared about someone else's emotions and showed it

442
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: By the way, you spoke

443
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.080
Nicole Roybal: You've

444
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.280
Got about

445
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:48.270
That you did that. Oh.

446
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.660
Nicole Roybal: Sorry, I'm a little bit

447
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:06.000
Nicole Roybal: But yeah, I guess. I don't know how to use the word care if that's the way I don't know housing so many bigger words in this most simplest one

448
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But I, I saw this word you said the word nice and it made me think, in order to be nice, right, we're we're caring enough right we care. We're going to be delicate about our words.

449
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.250
Nicole Roybal: Because Mike empathetic. That's the word I was looking for.

450
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And you liked it. You are empathetic.

451
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Look how far you've come

452
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.330
Nicole Roybal: Oh, maybe just saw him.

453
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.050
Kiki.

454
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You worked very hard and basically took the whole session.

455
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.280
Nicole Roybal: Right.

456
00:45:48.090 --> 00:46:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's worth it, Nicole. And so when you are with other people spend time developing that skill of noticing what do I like about myself. So I'll do some out here. I'll kind of role play a little bit. So let's say you're going to the community center and you run across someone who's impatient.

457
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.440
Nicole Roybal: Front desk or something. Yeah, sure. This is

458
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This could be anything.

459
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's whatever. So here, this person's impatient.

460
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And you catch yourself first year.

461
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you catch yourself being a phony just use another word, but you catch yourself.

462
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And decide, you know what I want to be honest.

463
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you like that about yourself. Right.

464
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.020
You let that genuine peace.

465
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say, what's going on. You having a rough day what's going on.

466
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that happened right

467
00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's different. That's doing you different that's being awake being conscious not doing this automatic way of being not apologizing. There's nothing to apologize for

468
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But you were just you, which is empathetic to someone who looks like they're kind of having a hard time with something

469
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could listen

470
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And not make it about you. And then there's nothing to apologize for

471
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a random out of the blue, kind of thing.

472
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point.

473
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Your homework, if you will, if you want to have a homework and attention to what do I like about myself right now. So in that example I just gave you, it would be, oh, I noticed I didn't apologize for nothing.

474
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticed about myself. Well, wait. Like, I noticed about myself that I didn't get mad at this dumb ass right for being patient with me. I noticed I didn't have to be anything other than me and I'm a sweet pea.

475
00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:05.010
Nicole Roybal: That's what I was thinking of that, like, instead of saying it like I probably honestly just be rude back and be like, well,

476
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to catch them. And the trick is the homework is to catch it is to say, oh my gosh.

477
00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I like this calm body. I like that. I'm okay. I know I'm loved and supported this follows me wherever I go.

478
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: This guy's got some kind of story going and got nothing to do with me was here before I walked in, is going to be your after I leave, but maybe I can show a little care because that feels good.

479
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:38.460
Nicole Roybal: You can somehow so that people need that too.

480
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you have an okay day. That's a rough one was

481
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Honest.

482
00:48:48.060 --> 00:49:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Point is catch yourself liking yourself catch yourself in moments. Oh, I like, look how we see these beer cans. Look at me, I'm a badass. Look at how I'm I'm sitting here and there's this distance between me and this craving.

483
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's just a beer. Can I see it's white. I see it's red lettering. I see the circle of the, can I see it is made of aluminum.

484
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It has a different meaning. Now,

485
00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish it wasn't a recycling bin. That's all it means now.

486
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that. I did that so right. I made that up but catch yourself.

487
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's cultivate that self efficacy self esteem.

488
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not natural for you. You have been raised to focus on others, and to focus on relationship you already have that skill down pat.

489
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're applying it using that same skill all over the place. When really, there are times definitely in your recovery right now is to reinforce, who am I, who am I that I love.

490
00:49:53.610 --> 00:50:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what I'm this good person. I've been there all along. I just forgot, I need to spend time cultivating it nourishing and nurturing

491
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back to group come back to individual therapy and tell me I caught myself really thinking I'm kind of cool. Look what I did, I did this thing kind of everybody can do this thing. This is neat about me. Okay.

492
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Find them.

493
00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And report on it. Write them down and brag about them.

494
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

495
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:31.410
Nicole Roybal: And I was just writing down a lot of stuff you're saying, so I'll just looking at this and remind myself to think of us.

496
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:32.820
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

497
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So you saw one you saw one that I did so for a therapist type, it would be. I have the capacity to never you'll you may never know, do I have foster children do I have four cats.

498
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I go here or there. Do you know anything about what's going on in my life. No.

499
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I like that that's an attribute see

500
00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That took work that that's something that's something that's mine. And nothing this my whole environment could be a mess, or someone could call me selfish someone outside of me could do something and I would still no no that's mine. I know I've got that.

501
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

502
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about. It's the a movable identity. The who you are.

503
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.490
Nicole Roybal: Then was mine who you are, until it. No one that's

504
00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. If the, the, the, the lever. The, the line doesn't move when circumstance changes when boyfriend, with no boyfriend mama mess sister sick sister mean cat ran away. Still, you go through emotions we feel sad, we get upset, but who you are, doesn't change.

505
00:51:51.420 --> 00:52:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, those are the things I want. We want to keep honing in on that. Alright, so I'm going to see you on Tuesday. Do I need to send a message to the doc now about medicine.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.300
Yeah, that's amazing.

559
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:08.280
Daniel Guerrero: Very cool.

560
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes quite a bit of confidence to be mucking around with the car.

561
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:13.950
That's nice.

562
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. Okay, well,

563
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring me up to speed on how you're doing with your physical how the body's feeling on the Suboxone. How you doing,

564
00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:38.580
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know. You know, what's that

565
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.760
Daniel Guerrero: I've been

566
00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:51.030
Daniel Guerrero: I've always had them, you know, but I've been noticing. They're here. Lately it's been more often. I'm getting

567
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:54.030
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if it's from the medicine.

568
00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:07.950
Daniel Guerrero: Challenges right now it's just like mainly that I'm trying to get my joints back into being old you know I stay active.

569
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.200
Daniel Guerrero: Because, you know,

570
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:19.920
Daniel Guerrero: Going to an opiate especially paint deals you know sometimes I like literally drag myself out of bed, you know, and

571
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:30.510
Daniel Guerrero: It would take me anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to get my joints going, especially if I didn't have nothing that first thing in the morning. And so today, it's

572
00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:33.120
Daniel Guerrero: Nice to know

573
00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:42.240
Daniel Guerrero: What, not a whole lot of pain, but I get what the expectations of having it because I had it so long.

574
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:45.720
Daniel Guerrero: It's uncomfortable.

575
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.210
Daniel Guerrero: And so it's

576
00:57:50.160 --> 00:58:02.970
Daniel Guerrero: It's been a help. You know, I can see myself, you know, becoming more energetic myself being, you know, like I'm saying more flexible. Do you know just little projects, you know, getting out of the car, or, you know,

577
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.600
Daniel Guerrero: PLAYING OUTSIDE THE KIDS. So that's helping

578
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, you and I talked a little bit about some imagery we we dipped into sort of imagery around a protective figure and nurturing fear and a wise figure did that linger with you at all.

579
00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:33.840
Daniel Guerrero: Did you

580
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Reflect on it later on throughout the week, or was it kind of once you and I stopped talking and we shut down the zoom you went on with your day and didn't think about it again.

581
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:59.490
Daniel Guerrero: I did not want to be honest. You know what I have been doing, you know, for that reflection is, you know, I've been. I've been taking more time, you know, to pray. I've been taking more time to

582
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:01.590
Daniel Guerrero: You know, focus on

583
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:09.120
Daniel Guerrero: What I think is important to me is like trying to teach my kids, but I can't teach them if I don't know.

584
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:15.090
Daniel Guerrero: And so that's that's something that I've been trying to do is I've been trying to learn, you know,

585
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:19.530
Daniel Guerrero: Because I think it's important for us.

586
00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:30.810
Daniel Guerrero: To be that leadership and he can't be a leader, you're still a follower. So check it out of that, you know, being a follower thing started being more of a leader.

587
00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:43.020
Daniel Guerrero: And so for for myself, I just, I've been reflecting more of the word. And because I believe in Christ, and I believe what you know. I believe in his message, and I believe what he what he has done for me.

588
00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:52.860
Daniel Guerrero: So I lean on his words. You know, so she helped me build myself so that I can do more of that since we last spoke

589
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.450
Daniel Guerrero: So I think it's, it's been helping a lot, you know,

590
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And because I'm

591
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: from Miami. Again, the people, places and things. How, how much is still left on your phone. How much exposure to people that might be a negative influence on you and suck you back in

592
01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you may have known him for 20 years like how close by. Are those those people kind of bring you back to that.

593
01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:38.610
Daniel Guerrero: Okay. So last time we spoke, you know, it was like a no, because the door, don't leave it open.

594
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.340
Daniel Guerrero: So that's, that's what we are doing.

595
01:00:46.650 --> 01:01:03.690
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and I'm not talking about about anyone but you know my neighbors are, you know, they're still in that, you know, in stage of life or, you know, there's still on the whatever would be, you know, and so what we're doing is we're moving

596
01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:07.080
Daniel Guerrero: Away from over

597
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go big one.

598
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:17.010
Daniel Guerrero: Right. So what we're doing is we're changing our environment completely we're moving into a new partner town.

599
01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:28.140
Daniel Guerrero: And basically, we're just no kid away, you know, the only people that don't know where I'm living will be founded know

600
01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for now, Dan. You're just our connections, kind of a stinker. Can you turn your video off and just go on audio for a little bit. I want to hear everything you're saying

601
01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn your video off for a little bit, let me just go on.

602
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Audio

603
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, what about what do you see and actually moving. What's the plan.

604
01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.470
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, so we're moving into a new house this weekend. Okay.

605
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:21.180
Daniel Guerrero: So,

606
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:26.670
Daniel Guerrero: That's a big step for us. Do you want me to be off the video.

607
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:27.330
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

608
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It was because the sound is let's expand the bandwidth by

609
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing the video off. So, and I'll just hear you. So just turn video off. You want to hit the button. Stop video on your device.

610
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:46.350
Okay, excellent.

611
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This weekend about this idea of shutting the door on people that you've had in your life for a while. Maybe connects

612
01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Either on the street or people that you know from prisoners anything where you kind

613
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Of like

614
01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's a difficult thing to do, maybe putting some distance with those people what what some ideas you have around there.

615
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.500
Daniel Guerrero: The ideas I have there is like

616
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:26.640
Daniel Guerrero: I'm trying not to associate at all with anybody, especially those. They're like, I know where to get pills or they know that I used to take them or they know I was, you know, strung out before

617
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.080
Daniel Guerrero: I was going to be honest man I

618
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:43.080
Daniel Guerrero: I don't I don't try to engage in those conversations I don't try to, you know, for an example. I seen a guy yesterday. It also we have also stores here in New Mexico.

619
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:53.220
Daniel Guerrero: It's just like a basic gas convenience store. You know, I went in and didn't even act like I knew him went straight to the calendar paid for my gas and left. You know, I didn't even

620
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.540
Daniel Guerrero: Say anything to him.

621
01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:10.740
Daniel Guerrero: And, you know, it might have been like a stuck up. You could have probably took me as being stuck up or you think you're better than me, you kind of, but I don't know because I didn't stick around to find out, you know, I just went paid for my gas got my soda and I left you know so

622
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.790
Daniel Guerrero: And, you know, it was something I was telling my wife. I said, oh,

623
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:22.440
Daniel Guerrero: I said, Man, I hope, homeboy. Don't think I was just, you know, being stuck up a router and she goes, No, I'm sure he knows that you're trying to change your life, baby. And I was like,

624
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:31.350
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I hope so. You know what I mean, because I'm not going to sit there and engage. He goes, let's just go and quit talking about it. So, so. All right, so we just left. Left alone.

625
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:34.500
Daniel Guerrero: So, yeah.

626
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.660
Daniel Guerrero: I'm doing more of that.

627
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:39.330
Daniel Guerrero: Stay away from it.

628
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But just to add one piece to that.

629
01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You were concerned about an opinion of you a label will go with stuck up. Don't get too hung up on that. It could be any label and a hoe or something. So just we got that one. Notice how you were concerned about that.

630
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that for a moment. You were concerned about this guy.

631
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Does this guy.

632
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Show concern about your recovery, so that you can provide for your family so that you have a healthy body, you can work through trauma history, you can work through the triggers you can protect your life, this guy, this guy. It also does he really care about you and your family.

633
01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.010
Daniel Guerrero: No, I'm sure he doesn't

634
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: See it. Notice how automatic we people right we worry about these opinions and when we take a second we think

635
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what he may only worried about is that you look like him talk like him and behave just like him, meaning you don't point out any flaws in him. It would be convenient for him. If you weren't working a recovery program because then he might have to look at himself.

636
01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you do that, we move outside and you think, Oh, I don't want this guy to be thinking check yourself for a minute and be like this guy really care about my welfare. I mean, really the core you

637
01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think he does, then those are the people that we don't mind putting some distance between doing

638
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Things like love you and want your health and care about the fact that, you know, addiction could mess your life up right can you land your back in prison. I mean, it could really spiral down the drain. If this guy really cared about you, he would want you to put distance

639
01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.540
Daniel Guerrero: Right him.

640
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.860
Daniel Guerrero: Right. Because knowing

641
01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: He's still a supplier. He'd be like, Yo, man. I get it. You need to step back for me because I know you know i'm still slinging or I'm still something I'm up in that world still

642
01:06:52.980 --> 01:07:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It would make sense. And that would be a kind gesture. So if anybody catches an attitude that story is about them. That's not a good friend.

643
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:04.140
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

644
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.160
Try that.

645
01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.730
Daniel Guerrero: I've come I've come to learn that, you know,

646
01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:22.020
Daniel Guerrero: Because you know people that you know I've told that you know i'm not mess around. I'm worried that you know I'm just trying to focus on my job, my family and you know my relationship, you know, with my higher power.

647
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.370
Daniel Guerrero: You know you don't you don't hear from them anymore.

648
01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.730
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, and so

649
01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:40.860
Daniel Guerrero: And something that's important to me tues, you know, I try not to get on social media. And you know, I try to stay off of Facebook and all that other crap you know

650
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:47.520
Daniel Guerrero: Because I don't, I don't want anybody to see me on there and there'd be like hitting me up, you know, whatever the case may be. So you know I

651
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:55.260
Daniel Guerrero: I make sure I don't stay on social media, because I'm it is what it is. It's social media, you know, if you're on it, somebody's going to talk to you there.

652
01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:08.970
Daniel Guerrero: So that's something that I practiced. I don't you know mess around with Facebook and it like that, because I don't want, like you said, I don't want those doors open anymore. And if taking myself away from that is what I helped me, then that's something that I'm going to do.

653
01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Think for a moment and we won't linger much longer on this topic, but I just wanted to check in a little bit. Is there anyone either family or someone you've known for a long time that would benefit from a heads up.

654
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't know your work in a recovery program.

655
01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:29.790
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

656
01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:38.520
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I'm sure there's I'm sure there's somebody out there that you know would benefit from it, you know, just letting them know

657
01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:42.240
Daniel Guerrero: You know if I can do it, you can do it, maybe

658
01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Not quite. It's not for their benefit.

659
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Me try

660
01:08:47.280 --> 01:09:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me say it more directly. Is there a friend that you love your tight with that. If you don't tell them proactively Hey Joe

661
01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm working in recovery program, you might see a little bit of distance or I can't hang anymore. In other words, a direct conversation about the fact that you're you're in a recovery program and you can't hang out anymore.

662
01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something where you have to assertively not passively. The guy and also was passive

663
01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Which means you just

664
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of walked in, you pay and you left assertive is where we say directly. Hey, cousin.

665
01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you, man. But, you know, you're still in that life and I can't be. I can't be around it for a while, you try and understand working this recovery program don't need your personally but I gotta kinda

666
01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of pull back a little bit. Is there anyone in your life that that would be the smart play because they're still in your life and they might still be coming at you with opportunities to us. Yeah.

667
01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:56.100
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

668
01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:04.470
Daniel Guerrero: My, my brother in law, you know, is still in that, you know, and every, every now and again he does knock on my door, you know,

669
01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.120
Daniel Guerrero: And

670
01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:12.030
Daniel Guerrero: But, you know, my wife is my wife and I, I don't know if I've made it plain

671
01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.490
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, I hope I have because like I don't engage in conversations, you know,

672
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.550
Daniel Guerrero: You know, he comes over and as soon as he does. I

673
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:25.530
Daniel Guerrero: Purposely

674
01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:35.010
Daniel Guerrero: Make myself busy to do something else. You know, on purpose. Oh, I'll come to the kitchen and you know maybe sweep the floor or something or

675
01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:48.480
Daniel Guerrero: You know, go to the laundry room to put in a load of laundry on purpose. You know, so that away whatever he's talking about, you know, with my wife or, you know, just seeing what he needs. I'm not around it. I'm not around him.

676
01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand, though, just to really hone in on the difference that behavior. This one is the same one. And also, this is passive

677
01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:00.630
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

678
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is watch the guy that sees my back. Basically, while I'm busy in the in the garage.

679
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Could make up a story like this, man. He doesn't want it. You don't like talking about the rounds, right, his wife, his wife.

680
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: He could be making a any kind of nonsense to justify the fact that he's going to keep coming at you.

681
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say, notice how hard it is to be a to assertively say I'm in a program. How hard would it be to say, I got, I've got, I've got a

682
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Kid section and I'm taking an antibiotic.

683
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right harder because there's this bias because a lot of our culture says your week, um,

684
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes on this whole other shape.

685
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:03.960
Daniel Guerrero: Something just happened in my house. Sorry. Yeah, I can hear, Oh yeah, I lost focus there.

686
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:05.310
Daniel Guerrero: And was was yelling at

687
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody okay

688
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:14.790
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I think my dog just took off running up to somebody. I'm closing my door so I can hear you. I apologize. Okay, so, so sit with this.

689
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel. A lot of people

690
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now struggle with this very moment and and and don't get me wrong. For some people it's months and years. So I'm saying it like that. I'm saying it.

691
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this idea of being assertive, but I'm not minimizing how hard it is. I'm trying to honor and respect that being direct is hard.

692
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice in yourself. What kind of a, a bias, you may have around the fact that you've got this chemical dependence.

693
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a moral decision. You didn't become chemically dependent like one day you're like yeah, man. I want to, I want to be hooked on this. It happened because tolerance developed got more

694
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Neurotransmitters opiate receptors rather developed. Soon as you kept having to need more and more and more. That wasn't a moral decision you understand

695
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:09.900
Daniel Guerrero: You smell.

696
01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not your fault that you became chemically dependent. What you do today right around being honest with people. That's a moral issue, but the chemical dependence, the part that's biological

697
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's not you saying I want this. Okay, so just sit with it. What is it like to even imagine telling your brother in law. Hey man, if you don't mind. Don't even bring up the topic of pills or anything, because I'm

698
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not using anymore.

699
01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And it makes me kind of think about it, not only think about it, trying to stay on point with that.

700
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like just for him in here. We're not doing it just with me. You know, like, would it be like to actually

701
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Be assertive and direct with your brother in law. Like, what are the things that come up in your head as soon as you imagine doing it.

702
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:07.920
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

703
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:09.870
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

704
01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.880
Daniel Guerrero: I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest, I just I just feel like maybe

705
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:20.460
Daniel Guerrero: Rejection, you know, nobody likes rejection, you know. Yeah, and

706
01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm brother in law might feel rejected.

707
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.310
Daniel Guerrero: Um, no. I think you would just

708
01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:29.580
Daniel Guerrero: It'll be the opposite, you know,

709
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:37.350
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and I'm not saying that I'm not afraid to lose anybody's friendship. I'm not afraid to lose. You know, you know, things like that, but

710
01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:39.630
Daniel Guerrero: Then it's going to be like

711
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:53.130
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's going to look like make me look like I'm a coward, or something or because because of the lifestyle that they're living today if you're not in it, then you don't. I'm saying you're basically

712
01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:57.690
Daniel Guerrero: You know nothing, nothing to them. And I'm not saying

713
01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.130
Daniel Guerrero: I'm word

714
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.120
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, but

715
01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.460
Daniel Guerrero: I can be. I want to be it for me, it's going to, it's hard. You know, because

716
01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:13.770
Daniel Guerrero: Being raised in that lifestyle or not obviously be raised. I'll be putting myself in that lifestyle for so long.

717
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:17.070
Daniel Guerrero: And and worried about what's

718
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.810
Daniel Guerrero: Not and I say a word about because I don't know why I say like that, but because at that time, you know, that's the way I felt, you know,

719
01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:41.520
Daniel Guerrero: And am I producing the most, am I doing the most of my the most consistent, you know, because I lived that lifestyle of of selling and an avenue possessing it and worried about you know who's doing more than me or you know i know it doesn't make sense, but

720
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Does I

721
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:44.100
Daniel Guerrero: Mean

722
01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it. That's why I'm bringing up the way I'm bringing it up. I'm trying to let you know I'm saying it easy breezy.

723
01:15:53.190 --> 01:16:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But this may take a long time before you reconcile. Wait a minute. I'm the badass because I'm actually living like this is hard. This is hard. This is harder.

724
01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Than going to easy money. This is harder to feel my own feelings, than to numb out. This is actually harder. I mean, right. Think about it.

725
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.790
Daniel Guerrero: You smell it. For me, it's hard because

726
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:32.940
Daniel Guerrero: Like being clean, you know, and I'm not going to say that the being clean ZZ, you know, you know, I went to prison and you know without while I was in prison, you know,

727
01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:38.280
Daniel Guerrero: I was clean. I was a cleaner prison. There's more drugs in prison in prison, the streets.

728
01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you, how did you manage to do that in there.

729
01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know I

730
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.870
Work out

731
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:56.400
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I worked out all the time, but also you can, it's the same out here, you know you you see the you see the circles. You know who's running with who

732
01:16:57.030 --> 01:17:05.190
Daniel Guerrero: You know who's doing what. Who's selling what who has what and then you just find that circle of guys that are just like, I just want to do my time you go home.

733
01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

734
01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.360
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and so

735
01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:21.360
Daniel Guerrero: You know I I put myself in their shoes to, you know, do I want to be in that circle and losing good time and you know getting writeups because that does happen, you do get writeups you do lose good time in prison.

736
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:35.610
Daniel Guerrero: And know if you do certain things. I mean, it'll hinder you from coming out on what they cause a PR D, you know, predict the release date and if and if you don't make your PR d, then they just extend your time.

737
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:37.320
Daniel Guerrero: And so

738
01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.260
Daniel Guerrero: That's something that I did. I did. I went in there and I made sure that I was going to get out on time.

739
01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.210
Daniel Guerrero: And so

740
01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:50.160
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I did it. I did it in prison. I was staying clean and

741
01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.720
Daniel Guerrero: You know when I hit the streets when I hit the streets. I just like

742
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:58.440
Daniel Guerrero: I was doing good, and doing good, and then

743
01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.640
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just the enemy's always prepared, you know, to destroy and devour somebody you know and

744
01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's let's do that one. Notice how you were you are owning I picked a different circle you were on in it. You took responsibility.

745
01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I chose the circle just going to do my time. I can see the potential consequence. Yeah, there's a

746
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then now you're out on the street and all of a sudden you went, you went outside yourself and you went to the devil or right, there's always this sort of wicked kind of coming action. What did you

747
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Become triggered by in the environment. What, what, what was the trigger for this relapse for you. Was it. I didn't have the job I needed too much pressure over here. What was the trigger for the relapse happen.

748
01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:49.920
Daniel Guerrero: It would be honest, I just think I had too much time on my hands when I got out because I didn't have a job.

749
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:57.510
Daniel Guerrero: You know I'm, I'm gonna I'm gonna say I I honestly think I just got bored and because

750
01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:06.540
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because I didn't have a job, you know, I was put in an application and nobody was calling. No, but you know it's going home. You know, it's like

751
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:13.920
Daniel Guerrero: Anybody call because I didn't have a phone at the time anybody call your phone, you know, I'm looking, I'm trying to get this job anybody call. The phone

752
01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:25.830
Daniel Guerrero: No, no, no, no. And, you know, I'm going to be honest got frustrating, though, because while I was in prison. Again, I had a job. I had, I had a routine know

753
01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:35.040
Daniel Guerrero: And hitting the streets, you know, is like I took that routine that I hadn't brought it to the streets and when I didn't have a job and you know

754
01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:42.210
Daniel Guerrero: You know, prisons, not very big. You know, so like it's its own community. You can walk down the hallway around the corner and go the library.

755
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:58.440
Daniel Guerrero: Here you have to walk miles to get to the library or blocks to get to the library, you know, and it's just like, I don't want to walk away. The heck over there, you know, to go to the library and I'm just being honest. Now, and so I got bored. You know, I lost my focus, you know, and

756
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.040
Daniel Guerrero: And here we are talking about, you know,

757
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:16.920
Daniel Guerrero: This and honestly as we're talking about it kind of discusses me a little bit because you know I was focused. I was on top of my game and and here we are. I got depending on on the crap again.

758
01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:27.750
Daniel Guerrero: And just want to be done with it, you know, and every day. Every day I feel myself coming back. I feel myself, you know, and

759
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:35.550
Daniel Guerrero: So if I have anything to be proud of its that that you know I'm getting my, my focus back you know

760
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:46.020
Daniel Guerrero: I have my job, you know, getting my family into new home, we're changing our environment we're changing the people that were hanging around with. And so, you know, getting that back and it's starting to feel good.

761
01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just applaud your honesty. This is going to serve you. Very well. The fact that you're you're able to sit with me and

762
01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And identify. Oh my gosh, it was boredom. It was I'm having to lean on people for a phone kind of Pester people, you know, like a I get this call.

763
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Because yeah, you're used to real tight schedule everybody you know resources, whatever. There are resources are really close by, you had a huge change in environment. And the reason why this is useful and I took some of what we just said, and I'm putting it what I call a relapse prevention.

764
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Outline which I'll give to you. You know when you're when you're done with us here, and you've kind of tapered off when you've decided, I don't want to, you know,

765
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Take time and you've taper down, but you're going to have this. And one of the things that I added to it just now was and I can show it to you so you can see what I'm talking about.

766
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm always adding stuff as I'm talking to my clients. See this blue in here, see the blue.

767
01:21:52.050 --> 01:22:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Well, so this is a relapse prevention plan. And one of the things I'm adding is frustration. And what about boredom. These are really important to know. You want to know why.

768
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you get bored. Again, guess what I'm going to say, hey,

769
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to step up your hobbies you better get it, you better get playing ball with somebody, you better start making plans with your friends hanging with kids. You need to get in your life because look at the warning sign. These are warning signs when you're left with your own mind.

770
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a red flag. It's not for everyone. Some people really need this extended quiet time and they don't have this experience of boredom.

771
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why these are unique to everyone. This years doesn't look the same as everybody else's. Okay, another trigger seeing a pill can be a trigger.

772
01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Nobody hiring you having to call on people to use their, you know, lean on them, lean on them. What's it like to rely on someone else does that bring up insecurity and like, why can't take it.

773
01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, yeah, it just kind of

774
01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:12.930
Go.

775
01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And you lost focus

776
01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If these are important. You're informing me in here and I can put them in this relapse prevention plan and then months from now, let's say something happens and I hear this little whisper.

777
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I start to hear, Oh, I was kind of bored. This week I ended up I might say, you know what

778
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take pay close attention to this. Look, because a relapse doesn't typically happen like this, a relapse can take months.

779
01:23:49.140 --> 01:24:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Or years, believe it or not, slowly, people can start to isolate slowly they stop what you might write praying and connecting with Jesus Christ slowly.

780
01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'd be like, oh, it's nothing. I'm busy. I'm just doing my thing over here, but it's a sign that you're pulling away and you're isolating it's making it easier and easier for the voice of addiction to come in and say, yeah, nobody's watching

781
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not holding yourself accountable to write to a higher power of let's go do it. You see it sneaks up slow.

782
01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no you see that it can happen. It takes look it's slow and so it helps to have people in your life and your wife is a good one to be a being able to say, listen.

783
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: These are my signs that I'm heading in that direction. If you see me I'm sleeping in till noon and

784
01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm starting to, you know, not pray i'm not i'm not engaging with the kids, I'm starting to have these signs, you could be heading down that road again. Do you see how that could be a possibility.

785
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.690
Daniel Guerrero: Oh yes, ma'am.

786
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.560
Yeah.

787
01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:00.750
Daniel Guerrero: You know, one thing that I've

788
01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:05.430
Daniel Guerrero: A simple word. You know, I learned

789
01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.960
Daniel Guerrero: Here, of late was, you know, integrity, you know,

790
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.360
Daniel Guerrero: You know it.

791
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:15.990
Daniel Guerrero: Was doing the right thing when nobody is watching.

792
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

793
01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:19.710
Daniel Guerrero: And so

794
01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:23.460
Daniel Guerrero: I've been trying. I've been trying to

795
01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:34.620
Daniel Guerrero: You know, to put that affirmation in my life, you know, you know, are you doing the right thing. Okay, nobody's watching, I'm by myself. I'm alone.

796
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:43.260
Daniel Guerrero: What am I going to do with my time. Yeah. Okay. The kids need laundry clothes done I'll fold clothes and do laundry.

797
01:25:45.330 --> 01:25:50.910
Daniel Guerrero: And so, you know, I have I have six kids at home and they all go to school.

798
01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.340
Daniel Guerrero: And so

799
01:25:54.570 --> 01:26:04.110
Daniel Guerrero: By late nights or my early mornings, you know, when I come when I go to work I come home. I stay up late because I'm I'm hardly at home.

800
01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:15.990
Daniel Guerrero: And so I do stay up late in my house, you know, kickback watch TV, and I go to bed, and soon as I go to bed. I'm getting up that alarm clocks popping off. You know, it's time to start taking kids to school. It's time you know my day begins.

801
01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:21.690
Daniel Guerrero: Where you know before it didn't, you know, my

802
01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:31.980
Daniel Guerrero: My kids were were in the state system because I have went to prison. Okay. And, and so, you know, for

803
01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:35.820
Daniel Guerrero: For the four, five months of that time.

804
01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:44.310
Daniel Guerrero: You know they were in the system. As I was working this program, you know, to get them home you know

805
01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:45.900
Daniel Guerrero: And

806
01:26:47.010 --> 01:27:00.750
Daniel Guerrero: And now that they're home you know my hands have been full of late you know and and that's what my wife is like, it's time for you to make a change, you need to start looking into something else.

807
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:13.350
Daniel Guerrero: Because we can't have you in the room. We can have you isolating yourself away from our kids. We haven't had our kids, you know, you have to come out of this show that you're in.

808
01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:26.700
Daniel Guerrero: And so, you know, I thought about and that's when I started asking around that's where I started, you know, seeing, you know, the Suboxone you know and and what you know.

809
01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:33.150
Daniel Guerrero: When I didn't have the pills. I was taking the Suboxone and, you know, and it was helping and helping me get through like a

810
01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.950
Daniel Guerrero: What do you call it the urges, you know, and

811
01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.350
Daniel Guerrero: Stuff like that. So,

812
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:53.490
Daniel Guerrero: And that's when I really started getting serious about getting into a program, you know, to help me come out, you know, and so I've been in a program for what, three weeks now, or something like that, almost a month.

813
01:27:54.510 --> 01:28:00.780
Daniel Guerrero: And I could see the change already, you know, it helped me so I'm really enjoying that.

814
01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:12.870
Daniel Guerrero: You know, in this in this more than just enjoying it. Because Microsoft I'm focusing on that that integrity and, you know, finding more time.

815
01:28:14.190 --> 01:28:25.230
Daniel Guerrero: You know, to be that Father that you know that I wasn't know doing more things with my kids, instead of i can't my back hurts. My legs hurt my knees hurt my feet hurt.

816
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:37.140
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I can barely move my hands because of the opiates that was in my body. You can't live without it you can't do shit without excuse my language, but can you barely want to get out of bed with it.

817
01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.410
Daniel Guerrero: So, I'm sorry, I'm just venting a little bit, you know, but you know that's

818
01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.830
Daniel Guerrero: That's exactly, you know what was going on and

819
01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:52.380
Daniel Guerrero: I don't want to do that anymore. You know what, I just want to be able to, you know,

820
01:28:53.460 --> 01:29:05.610
Daniel Guerrero: Keep working the program and, you know, eventually, you know, start cutting back coming back over to you know I am 100% Daniel again 100% you know who I who I am.

821
01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So there is this effect.

822
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe it's called hyper analgesia. And what happens. Ironically, this is like mind boggling, but that

823
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have a for an extended period of using opiates, you can have this effect where let's say we had an injury. Let's say my back was injured.

824
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've been taking opiates for a long time, what can happen is the brain can have this sort of closed loop. It doesn't the signal. The longer comes from the back.

825
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain just sort of remembers pain on its own. It doesn't need a new injury, it just registers pain now and

826
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the injury can be healed but it's going to have this

827
01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Recollection right of pain. It's really bizarre and terribly unfortunate for people that are struggling with, with the opiates.

828
01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the first thing you can have this closed loop response, there's no actual like signal from the back. Let's say I'm making up the back to me by wrist or something.

829
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one one piece of this, this phenomenon that happens. The other piece is that other parts of your body, like everything becomes more painful just a regular bump on the arm what normally would be like nothing feels more painful.

830
01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that something that you know a cut a bruise a bump. Was that ever something that you went through at any point

831
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.700
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

832
01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.510
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I'm trying to remember, you know,

833
01:30:56.850 --> 01:31:07.620
Daniel Guerrero: There might have been one incident you know where I I fell on my knees, you know, at work, and you know that bothered me for days and days, you know, I even had to go and buy a brace for it.

834
01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:22.560
Daniel Guerrero: And even today, as we speak, you know, sometimes it, you know. But I mean, I've always had a problem with with my right knee, but it was just seemed like while I was on the open it bothered me even more now.

835
01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: phenomenon that was going on, it's it's bizarre because it's supposed to be. It's an analgesia analgesic which is supposed to remove the pain right but after time it has this hyper analgesic effect.

836
01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's the exact opposite of what you're needing of what you're seeking. I mean, you're supposed to have pain relief and it does doesn't come anymore.

837
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you keep getting more and more and more. And it doesn't come that pain. Just keep cycling there and things become more sensitive. So maybe you didn't experience it, but some people do.

838
01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, I just thought I would mention that. So there are some real positive pieces or benefits of long term coming off of it. Because think about if let's say you get in

839
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: An urgent care situation, let's say, a car accident or something, you're kind of want to have access to what pain medicine.

840
01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to want it to work. You're going to want to be able to just like anybody else right to go into the emergency department or transported there and they put down morphing

841
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. We want you to be able to be at a safe enough dose down the line. Not saying today down the line, so that a doctor or physician can treat you.

842
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:44.370
With pain medicine.

843
01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. We want you to be able to do that.

844
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:51.420
Daniel Guerrero: Excuse me.

845
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the goal.

846
01:32:55.710 --> 01:32:58.920
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you know, as we talk about these things, you know,

847
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:04.830
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I give this information, sometimes to my mom to, you know, say. Sometimes I see other time.

848
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:11.640
Daniel Guerrero: Because her doctor right now has her on on on opiates and

849
01:33:13.170 --> 01:33:27.720
Daniel Guerrero: She's always complaining about, you know, should I take a pill sign my, my knees hurt or my wrist hurt you know my mom's always worked her whole life and and I told her, say, Mom, these, these pills are not good for you, mom. I said, it's just going to hurt you.

850
01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.270
Daniel Guerrero: And and

851
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:34.800
Daniel Guerrero: I said, trust me, Mom. I know. She goes, I know you know I was like, well,

852
01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:42.870
Daniel Guerrero: I need you to understand it, you know, you have to. She goes, I only take them the way the doctor asked me to take them.

853
01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't make it any better those doctors. They don't care about long term side effects of it.

854
01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.750
Daniel Guerrero: They don't know

855
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:55.290
Daniel Guerrero: They really don't. I know that they don't

856
01:33:57.270 --> 01:34:06.330
Daniel Guerrero: And and I could kind of testify for this because my father in law, you know, and I'm going to be honest, this is how I kind of got started with them before you know

857
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:10.350
Daniel Guerrero: His doctor was given him.

858
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:17.910
Daniel Guerrero: 30 milligrams of oxy cotton a day.

859
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Prescribed

860
01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:29.220
Daniel Guerrero: She was prescribing him 290 oxy cotton 30 milligrams a month.

861
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That person still have license.

862
01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.940
Daniel Guerrero: Well, they moved now.

863
01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:41.310
Daniel Guerrero: I guess she is. She used to be a kind of practitioner. I'm not too sure what

864
01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:50.280
Daniel Guerrero: But now she lives in Oklahoma and she's no longer allowed to write those prescriptions or something. Yeah. But anyways,

865
01:34:51.450 --> 01:35:03.510
Daniel Guerrero: And so I would see my father in law go into these things with it too. And that's how I understand and and now I see my mom, you know, going through that and and what I've been through, and

866
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:19.080
Daniel Guerrero: I was starting to change me and starting to help me. You know, I tried to say introduce that to my mom, but I'm trying to get her you know to understand, you know, just side effects and that's in it. And I take this information. I just don't leave it for myself you know i i believe that

867
01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:29.430
Daniel Guerrero: We're learning every day. You know, so we're learning a little bit, then we should teach a little bit, you know. So I take this information that you and I talked about, you know, not kind of share it with my family, you know,

868
01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:34.800
Daniel Guerrero: I share it with my wife. I don't keep it to myself, you know, she's like, Well, how was your visit. You know, and

869
01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:36.690
Daniel Guerrero: What did you guys talk about, you know,

870
01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.280
Daniel Guerrero: Other things you know and and it's positive things, you know, and so

871
01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:46.350
Daniel Guerrero: That's really good for me. I really, I really liked these sessions, you know, yes.

872
01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, next time. What I'd like to do and it's typically what I do right away. But you and I kind of zeroed in on on some different conversations but the next couple sessions.

873
01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:58.320
Daniel Guerrero: Focus on with you it's

874
01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: About emotional regulation skills. I want to teach two of them to you.

875
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.950
Daniel Guerrero: Emotion.

876
01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I want to teach two of them to I'll be teaching you. I call it box breathing, but really what it is is diet for matic breathing.

877
01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll teach you the science behind it. I'll talk to you about the poly Vegas theory. I'll talk to you about the Vegas nerve. I'll talk to you about how the diaphragm pressing down on the organs activates the Vegas nerve.

878
01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll talk to you about that and I'll teach you the practice of it. And then I'm also want to going to want to show you

879
01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: grounding in the five senses. So these are going to be techniques for example when you

880
01:36:42.810 --> 01:36:43.350
Daniel Guerrero: Use them.

881
01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: under stressful situations when they don't want to get pissed off.

882
01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't want to have a panic attack. They don't want to be angry.

883
01:36:54.390 --> 01:37:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they just let's say you know how you incorporate prayer throughout your day, you may start to do this box breathing along the way.

884
01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll teach that to you next time. And then I'll also be teaching the grounding and the five senses.

885
01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: In general, do you ever find yourself. Like, do you have a go to emotion that you kind of want to work on that you don't like so much

886
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:27.870
Daniel Guerrero: I'm sorry.

887
01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

888
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:37.950
Daniel Guerrero: A go to emotion that I really don't like so much um

889
01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:46.110
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I do have, you know, some emotions. I don't like you know to go, you know, to

890
01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:51.000
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know. I don't know if one of them is I don't

891
01:37:53.310 --> 01:37:54.420
Daniel Guerrero: Know being like

892
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:59.760
Daniel Guerrero: A penguins like being emotion. I don't know if that's right or not. Yeah.

893
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:00.690
It is

894
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Their anger. Most people find

895
01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's too high, it doesn't fit. Sometimes it's like so high it messes with their relationship with their sweetheart, or their kids or their employer like it. It's like, man I run so hot. Why am I so why am I get so mad that tends to be one. Is that ever the case for you.

896
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:24.510
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know,

897
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:40.890
Daniel Guerrero: You know, for myself, you know, that's why I've said, you know, I've been, you know, you know, trying to rely more on Christ, you know, and what he's teaching. And that's something he teaches us, you know, and His Word is, you know, not to be angry, you know, not to hold grudges.

898
01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:50.280
Daniel Guerrero: And because sometimes in our anger. We bring up the past. No. Will you said this and you said that, kind of, you know,

899
01:38:50.910 --> 01:39:07.770
Daniel Guerrero: And even if that's not what the arguments about that, that time you know those emotions come back up in the anger in while you're angry and and they come out and that and that could have nothing to do with what's going on at that time, but because it's still there.

900
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.950
Daniel Guerrero: You know, still pissed off about it.

901
01:39:13.290 --> 01:39:14.460
Daniel Guerrero: So for me, you know, I

902
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:17.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I've been trying to like

903
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.930
Daniel Guerrero: You know, for an example. You know, I got some kids you know they're

904
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:26.460
Daniel Guerrero: You know 15 and 1620

905
01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:30.390
Daniel Guerrero: And they swear they got the world figured out

906
01:39:33.210 --> 01:39:44.160
Daniel Guerrero: And so, you know, they come off the wall saying some off the wall crap you know and and trust me you know I I try not to let it you know

907
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:50.610
Daniel Guerrero: I felt like, you know, in a sense that they're disrespecting me or disrespecting my wife and

908
01:39:51.690 --> 01:39:58.740
Daniel Guerrero: And it pisses me off you know pisses me off bad that where I'll go outside. Before I say anything.

909
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.810
Daniel Guerrero: I go outside.

910
01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:12.000
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm just like, that's something that I have been learning know to do. But before I pop off right with them. So you want you want to argue. Let's go.

911
01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:16.890
Daniel Guerrero: And and I promise I'm going to win. I promise I'm going to win because

912
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:26.100
Daniel Guerrero: You know, but that's something I try to stay away from, you know, I tried to I tried to be as humble as I can but know sometimes

913
01:40:28.410 --> 01:40:29.640
Daniel Guerrero: It's hard. It's difficult.

914
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It's difficult, so

915
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Next time is and we can tie that in. So now when you think, well, what is this box breathing for it can be for let's say when you walk outside

916
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This could be something, it could be doing while you're outside okay to what it'll do is it'll bring down that activation, it'll bring down the anger.

917
01:40:53.640 --> 01:41:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it'll allow you to have your brain working better, faster, stronger. You ever noticed. Sometimes when you really angry almost to the rage that you can't think of all the cool things. Maybe you learn along the way. Like all you feel is the feeling like you're so lost it. It's so intense.

918
01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever get that sense like it's it's you're lost in that emotion.

919
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:23.550
Daniel Guerrero: I could take you know

920
01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:26.550
Daniel Guerrero: It does take over. Um,

921
01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.050
Daniel Guerrero: You know I never really been like

922
01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:39.900
Daniel Guerrero: You know the type of guy that you know they get angry and start hitting or something like that on somebody. No, I never been that type of guy but

923
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:53.940
Daniel Guerrero: I have gotten so pissed off that you know I raised my voice. You know, I got a pretty deep voice I raised my voice. You know, I want to be. I want to be heard and there's nothing that you're going to tell me because I am a little stubborn, too, you know. So

924
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:57.510
Daniel Guerrero: I raised my voice. You know, like

925
01:41:59.190 --> 01:42:06.600
Daniel Guerrero: I just don't want that part of me no more, you know I want I want that to change in me. I don't want to be, you know, because that's the kind of. That's the kind of relationship.

926
01:42:07.290 --> 01:42:17.190
Daniel Guerrero: That my stepfather had with us, you know, he raised his voice sloppiness around, you know, kick us around whatever he wanted to do with us. And then when he calmed down.

927
01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:24.900
Daniel Guerrero: You'd be like, I think overreacted. I apologize. Well, why do you mean, why did you think about that, then right

928
01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, so what this will allow you to do, is it brings down. So when we have a fight.

929
01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: A fight or flight response.

930
01:42:37.290 --> 01:42:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: On all of our blood goes to our large muscle groups, it goes to our legs. It goes to our biceps, triceps, because we're ready to throw gloves. Even though it's our kids. It still happens, it's just our reptilian brain making the decision here.

931
01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And what this breathing can do is it sends a message to the brain.

932
01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no problem. There's nothing to really be that upset about. There is no threat, now I get it. It's your kids. And I'll talk more because we're at the end of the session talk more about that later. But my point is the blood will go back to your brain.

933
01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be able to you know how your, your, your father in law couldn't couldn't think of couldn't reflect about consequence about how it impacted you that he was so so mean.

934
01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be able to have access to your brain, and we want that. We want the blood in your brain, the frontal cortex were logic, reason lips. We want that.

935
01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what that walked us for you when you go outside and you don't decide to keep yelling or to push your kids or something when that walk when you walk away.

936
01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Gives you that time and this technique that I'm going to teach you next time is going to help with that. Okay, so let's set up another time to meet
