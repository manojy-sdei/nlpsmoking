Rochelle Martinez: Positive

16
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.450

Rochelle Martinez: With her last year with your last weekend.

22
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.140
Rochelle Martinez: Because you as you know we switch off on that with the baby on the weekends.

23
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.210
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, so

24
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.960
Rochelle Martinez: And I guess just because they hadn't had any positives. We were still doing it. You know what I mean.

25
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.710
I go

26
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:29.370
Rochelle Martinez: And to find out that was testing is taking almost 10 to 14 days to get back so sake, where we shouldn't have met last weekend and

27
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:48.870
Rochelle Martinez: The babies know is low immune system being born premature she catches everything all the medication. I'm on makes my immune system. So, you know, it just, it just stress for me. No matter how much I clean and do what I need to do here.

28
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.730
Rochelle Martinez: I really began my drama naked practically outside the clothes will shave in the washer. She goes straight to the shower.

29
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:08.850
Rochelle Martinez: They're monitoring. Both of them were temperature is that they can even get tested, even though they've been exposed, they will get tested until they start showing symptoms of their board.

30
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.740
Rochelle Martinez: And sister. You know what I mean, people don't get symptoms and it could also be carrying it just, it just created right now.

31
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.230
Rochelle Martinez: It is a little, just a little hard.

32
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you are visiting group. Now you're not visiting mine so I don't know what's going on in there. What is the information that's getting shared with you guys around sort of balancing concept I think Dr. Every L talks about the

33
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The infection pressure or what I'm calling the viral load, um,

34
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.000
What

35
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: About what those mean

36
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.130
Rochelle Martinez: Because I tend to only once a month, last time he attended

37
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.840
Rochelle Martinez: He talked

38
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.420
Rochelle Martinez: To Steve, let me know much it was

39
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.540
Rochelle Martinez: It was more I'm

40
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.610
Rochelle Martinez: Dr.

41
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.270
Rochelle Martinez: With some vacation.

42
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.150
Rochelle Martinez: It was just more

43
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I take some time to talk about it.

44
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it sounds like it's a very relevant thing for you right now.

45
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: For most people, it's, it's the front end of what we're doing a group and then if I get to these other behavioral health pieces I'm getting to it. But otherwise, I really want to make available this platform to be able to talk

46
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.370
Rochelle Martinez: To exchange.

47
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: To cross check facts.

48
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Of

49
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.420
Course

50
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's, here's what the

51
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Basically what I've been doing is my computer shut down a couple times. I'm not sure what all is up. But basically, what I'm saying is, all right let's have a credible source. Let's use the CDC. Let's see.

52
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.640
Rochelle Martinez: Dr.

53
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.090
Rochelle Martinez: T do funky.

54
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a girl.

55
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.790
Rochelle Martinez: That's it. So let's use

56
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Him. He's a credible person.

57
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: He has any secondary agendas and motivations for political gain. So we're not distracted by a second game he could, he wants us all to be saved.

58
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you already have that. And then the pieces that I really kind of been focusing on

59
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is so I heard you say just now. I don't want to repeat things you're already doing. So I heard you say a couple of things for shell. I heard you say

60
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I could have kicked into gear with

61
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A week earlier.

62
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That awareness is there. So there's a heightened awareness and you're saying, okay, so whatever comes to the front door, maybe as much as possible stays outside won't make its way in. Right.

63
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.020
Rochelle Martinez: Sorry, my nephew's

64
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: First

65
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody you know we got to take care of our family first. So if he needs a little toy or something, then we can get it.

66
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So the shoes are the shoes that were on the outside. How are they staying outside

67
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.500
Rochelle Martinez: The shoes. She's, she's wearing the

68
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.400
Rochelle Martinez: The political those have adopted slip on them.

69
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:36.630
Rochelle Martinez: While she's at work. Yeah, she's yeah she's wearing those machines that were and the Shoes come in and they don't wash everything goes straight to the washer.

70
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.400
Rochelle Martinez: Should she go straight to the shower.

71
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's great. So then, right there. So who's the data designated sort of shopper that does the food shopping. Are you the one that goes out.

72
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Why were you elected sort of that person to

73
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.920
Rochelle Martinez: Do because my grandma's

74
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.080
Rochelle Martinez: Me, My grandma, my nephew and

75
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's you. All right. Um, when you're out. Are you wearing a mask. Are you wearing gloves. What are you doing out there.

76
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:34.500
Rochelle Martinez: No. Actually, I'm just carrying sanitizer and keeping six feet away from everybody in after touching stuff I put sanitizer, I get in the car and I have Clara swipes I'm waving my hands down and coming in putting this washing, washing my hands change my clothes and

77
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.110
Rochelle Martinez: Shoes. Shoes, we

78
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Were to the shoes day they were out

79
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.090
Rochelle Martinez: At the door.

80
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.410
Outside

81
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.780
Rochelle Martinez: They want to stay outside

82
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, what Dr. Aubrey L is saying. And I think most people are saying this at this point. So if you can create even a makeshift

83
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a barrier just even to get what would be a large droplet. So let's say we have a sneeze. We have a cough.

84
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in the air, most of it gravity's just going to pull down to the floor, it'll pull down to the next horizontal surface on depending on the surface.

85
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: We talked about that in a second. But if you have a little bit of a mask or a bandana even or something. They were talking about yesterday in a group, see if I can find what it was from Home Depot. There is

86
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A particle barrier. You can make your own master.

87
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Painters coveralls I thought that was kind of funny. Some maybe we have them around. There's a barrier that's in there, take it out and we can put it over our mouth because the weave is really dense, which means those those particles from, let's say, a virus may not get through because

88
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a few things for me, this is kind of complicated, but there's a few things that go on around the maps. Let's just take the one that has to do with

89
00:08:53.310 --> 00:09:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This concept of viral load or with it. I call it viral load because it makes more sense to me. Infection pressure. Just sounds so weird. Like, I can't wrap my head around those words.

90
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just call it a viral meeting virus load, meaning how much of it. So this is what I think about it. I think about it like this. If someone was over here and they sneezing, coughing, and they didn't have a mask on and most of it.

91
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Landed down on the ground and it wasn't floating around in in the air. Still, because it sits on them. Those moisture droplets of water droplets in the air, whether it's in the air. Now, right now there's water in the air.

92
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say that a tiny, itty bitty bit of it made its way over here to my lip.

93
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, is that enough of a viral load for me to catch an infection and what Dr. Phil was saying is, no, we need this much when we only got that much. So that man.

94
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.040
Rochelle Martinez: Me mentally so

95
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.870
Rochelle Martinez: Help me.

96
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Relax hearing that you see my mom. Yes. Yeah.

97
00:09:53.910 --> 00:10:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Balances out sort of this over alert, a little bit of that. Okay, let's be realistic. Okay, we're going to be careful and cautious. OK. So now, realistically, we're not going to get it with just sort of a tiny little molecule of it. We need to have it sort of reach that threshold.

98
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The viral code or infection pressure. She calls it, there has to be enough of it to have a significant difference when I say to myself, I happen to have a mask in my garage where I was doing some drywall work. So I'm reusing it's really gross.

99
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But so what i don't care anymore. You don't have been some out there with that mask and

100
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about the psychology of what that does for me will start with me. I think I'm doing everything I can.

101
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:38.880
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

102
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I think to myself, I'm okay. I'm out here shopping for me. My family on the best candidate to be doing this. I'm going to be conscious. Maybe I'll pay more attention than someone else will. So it's smart that it's me. I'm going to be careful.

103
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm wearing this. I'm doing everything I can. And now when I think about what this does for other people.

104
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I wear a mask and someone who's like, This is stupid. This is like the flu. This ain't nothing. Why y'all making a big deal. A bunch of babies are the people there are people out there like that will get close.

105
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll do stupid things. I don't get on. I don't watch TV or social media, but I'm hearing from actually from you guys, what's happening on terror that people are are like purposely, you know, violating people's safe and boundaries.

106
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, with the mass says says to the people around me. It says, I take this seriously my safety is important. And we're passing along normalization of it aren't we

107
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

108
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So I saw when I first went to Costco. I only saw two people. And now, now that now there's all kinds of people wearing I'm wearing a Publix, and there's we're still saying hi

109
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

110
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't feel so weird. They don't feel so weird. It's becoming more acceptable to be cautious.

111
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That I like we're in this together.

112
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: not discriminate on race on religious perspective. Nada. It doesn't don't care. I don't care. It just wants to get opinion.

113
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's what I like about this, it sends a message to my own psychology. I'm doing everything I can send a message to my family, I take this very seriously says it to my community. We need to get on board with this now.

114
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What else about the mouth so picture that

115
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead.

116
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:34.110
Rochelle Martinez: So I'm hearing is the masters and pretend to us and protect other people. It's, um,

117
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but look at my little example.

118
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.240
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah yeah I know exactly what you mean. But that

119
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the wrong.

120
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.490
Rochelle Martinez: Exactly.

121
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:58.980
Rochelle Martinez: No, there's no I'm doing everything I can. I haven't been to the to the grocery store and about it's going to be a month. And it's almost time for me to go. So that's why I'm taking all this in because I go once a month.

122
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:16.590
Rochelle Martinez: Grocery store we every everyone to buy the exact same being the hygiene. So we were stuck on tissue have shampoo, we have, we're not going to run out. I'm going to talk to you a little bit more. Yeah, that's like this.

123
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Part, all out. Now here's what

124
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.280
Rochelle Martinez: I do with it what you want.

125
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have a whole separate watch what I have, I have a purse. That's it happened to have a garage and very fortunate have a garage. I haven't Ziploc bags driver's license credit cards that sit in a bag. That's the bag that I take out

126
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I walk out with shoes. The shoes at the front, I get shoes on and I'm going to wear out in the community. I grabbed that purse.

127
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing that's going to be kind of coming back funky is the stuff I bring back. I'll talk about that in a minute.

128
00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If I could remember to keep those shoes out there I spray them down and stay out there nobody touches them and I'm paying attention to where I walked through that garage to and I alert my family, listen.

129
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Walking y'all just to walk there for two days or something like that. Just don't go right here.

130
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now I have a separate BAG. BAG those credit cards, all that I laid out and I kind of scram down, let it sit there

131
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The food to packaging that's made in plastic. So here's what CDC said I had it up at it. This is the source that I got it from, by the way.

132
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This information about how long things stay on a surface was important to me. I want to know how long did they stay on plastic. Let me just see.

133
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll try and track down where it was. But here's what I remember.

134
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: On cardboard 24 hours plastic like stainless. Also, I just figured steel.

135
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I just figured, well, I'm just going to go metal because I don't, I don't really know what something's NATO, so I'm just going to say any metal something about my key.

136
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking about the ring and my key. I'm thinking about, like, there's a piece on my gear shift. I'm thinking about little things like the door, knock things like that. It may stay there happily four days go on me day. So if I go shopping today.

137
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I do that a little sticky. I put the date on the bag of chips because I didn't say what kind of plastic. I don't know whether it's my dear Reno, bang, you know, or it's my butter. I don't know.

138
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what I can wait three days.

139
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't wait till you're blue out of food. So anyway,

140
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Since over the little sticky and it says the date that I can go bring it in.

141
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: If I can't wait. And I need to prepare food right away I meet with someone in the kitchen. I'm the clean hands or dirty hands they get it out of the packaging, I take my little clean hands. I get that food and I get it in a Ziploc so now that packaging is out of the house.

142
00:15:51.660 --> 00:16:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's just clean food in a Ziploc bag that I, anybody can touch that there's no worries there. So that's my mentality is anything that's from the outside. I don't want coming in because what if they come back and tell me. Oh.

143
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoops.

144
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Y'all and

145
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What is

146
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It, you know, in your hair because I use a lot of hairspray would have it's sticking on at hairspray. And what if

147
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's sitting up on my shoe. So I was coming out with this weeks and weeks ago and saying, look,

148
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: My shoe thing. I don't want you been in my shoes. Don't be walking where I walked with I'm checking in from the supermarket from Costco. I'm

149
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then my credibility comes in and I'm hearing from someone. Oh, the doctors are saying that it can be tracked and on the shoes. Well, looky here, I'm going to do what I can. With my

150
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Care what y'all.

151
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.850
Rochelle Martinez: One more pieces.

152
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.650
Rochelle Martinez: If I'm waiting.

153
00:16:53.970 --> 00:17:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If I wait until another week. Another month if I can stave off, which means wait to get this virus. I figured out my get it eventually. That's the truth. I do. I think that like, you know what I mean, eventually I'm gonna get it if I can wait a month.

154
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be more respirators in my hospital.

155
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That much closer to write a treatment. Yes, it's going to be more mass and be better protocol, there'll be better research, they'll be evidence practice evidence based practices. So the longer that I can protect

156
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Locally me my family, my neighborhood. My city my planet. The longer we have for our really bright scientists to come up with what the heck we're supposed to do with this thing.

157
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.980
Rochelle Martinez: Okay, I think.

158
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I've said everything but about that mass just picture that if it was a big droplet right, it wouldn't get through just a basic bandana or two bandanas

159
00:17:44.880 --> 00:18:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't get through a tiny little one might, but honestly it that viral load number the viral load might be so low, right, unless you got that sneeze right here, or you're drinking, maybe you know that little coffee cup. Okay, so I think I've covered all the

160
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Concepts. I've got here. What are your thoughts.

161
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:18.600
Rochelle Martinez: Just the she's just a baby. I still on the floor. So that's always been my biggest concern are the shoes.

162
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:28.410
Rochelle Martinez: The other than that, I think I've reviewed everything that you have with the CDC and

163
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:41.610
Rochelle Martinez: Eventually, where we're going to get it. No matter if there's four cases here. And really there's two pieces, you know, where's my family's on the front lines mentally excuse

164
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.820
Rochelle Martinez: Me. We just got to be prepared.

165
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What about the inner personal. So what's a challenge for people right now is this. So, for example, it's assertiveness is coming out now you have a strong personality, but once it gets into

166
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Interpersonal

167
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It shifts a little bit for you. And so I want to check in on assertiveness and being proactive and the comfort level where you stand for your values. This is where

168
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That stuff that we've been practicing for years is really coming into play. Will you stand in your truth around safety. So let's just say outside in the front of your house.

169
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You say to the people you love even, even the ones that are minimizing if we're young. We don't have that prefrontal cortex. Now it's about until age 30 if you complete it. So moving even further into our age and so they're not going to care. They're going to care like you'd be stupid.

170
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:32.400
Rochelle Martinez: Stupid.

171
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no, we're not being stupid. But what if in your house, you have

172
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Out there.

173
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

174
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you text them hey bring a pair of flip flops.

175
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or I have some HERE YOU CAN WEAR some that are completely clean a pick him up from the dollar store you can wear some slides in here.

176
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But you get to decide that this is your value system in your home. You get to decide about safety. Now your confidence about nothing on this floor.

177
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Has anything that has been touched by the outside world for a month. Now you can let baby walk around doesnt sit. I don't believe on fabric right or cardboard. I'm thinking for more than 20 way.

178
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It was right at that front door. That's where you stand for what a great sort of metaphor for our boundary and saying, You know what, in here. We're taking it. This is what we're doing.

179
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to come in those shoes go in that bag. You can wear them out. But in here. Sorry. Here's some socks for a year, some slides I picked up from the dollar store. Aren't they cute.

180
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.050
Rochelle Martinez: The good thing is is that, um,

181
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:41.910
Rochelle Martinez: It's just as for me, visitors. Do you know what I mean, like, I don't, I don't have to worry about anybody coming

182
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.550
Rochelle Martinez: Just through the fact that

183
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:57.990
Rochelle Martinez: They finished tools within the last 10 days. And we've been around them. My nephew hasn't gone home he stayed here because we don't want it going to my brother's house. Do you know what I mean. So right now.

184
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.980
Rochelle Martinez: It's just us, and we have center boundaries.

185
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.980
Rochelle Martinez: We don't leave me, my brother me my nephew and Brooklyn don't mean

186
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.110
Rochelle Martinez: To me, she's here five and refining everything we can.

187
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.180
Rochelle Martinez: What about us.

188
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you, coming up.

189
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:28.920
Rochelle Martinez: We spoken of course it was emotional when she told me that she's been exposed. She was the one in the room. They had no masks at the time. Do you know what I mean.

190
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:30.840
Rochelle Martinez: And

191
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.040
Rochelle Martinez: It was cleaning people see in a complete

192
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.560
Rochelle Martinez: Brooklyn it

193
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.710
Rochelle Martinez: I know you want to take Brooklyn, but you know we got to protect each other and

194
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.590
Rochelle Martinez: We have, we have we have anything to say hello.

195
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.070
Rochelle Martinez: To me, until then stay safe.

196
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.180
Rochelle Martinez: Me.

197
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Over then it's come in, take shower and even maybe, I don't know, what if I don't know. I mean, if I was holding a baby. I would put a mask on, I would be that concerned personally

198
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.940
Rochelle Martinez: Is

199
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That. What if we're wrong. Oh, it sits in there for 25 days, you know like what if it wasn't

200
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

201
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Much a me wanting to protect them. Also in and so be careful. So it sounds like you're doing you're being really, really smart about it.

202
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: There's another topic that I've been raising that I want to throw out here. Notice how you just said, oh, I see you and I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Mom, you know what you guys aren't remembering

203
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Zoom.

204
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You. So here's what I'm doing. I'm having a girls night in tonight.

205
00:22:52.260 --> 00:23:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Why can't we have Sunday dinners together all y'all get on. We're gonna have Sunday dinner, and we're going to talk. Don't lose your connection with these people to love.

206
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:03.630
Your family.

207
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:05.190
Rochelle Martinez: Yes.

208
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.700
Rochelle Martinez: Okay, sweetie. Even my nephew Jude every day when my grandma gets home I

209
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:27.900
Rochelle Martinez: Complete the disavow vector for like the cover goes straight into Clorox and their am with the alcohol and wiping it out and about 45 minutes to an hour later, he picks it up in here.

210
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:43.320
Rochelle Martinez: He gets on messenger and he he gets on it with my mom and he talks, because he, he said, do you not want him to where he says he doesn't know about it going to be exposed to. Do you know what I mean. He knows that there's a virus going around, but he doesn't

211
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.780
He doesn't he

212
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:53.760
Rochelle Martinez: Doesn't even know me and he's he's he's been MVP. So I don't want him worried about this.

213
00:23:55.230 --> 00:24:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And we don't have to. If we're if we're keeping all the bugs outside the door them. They don't have to. They get to just play and be kids. But we can

214
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: take very seriously that they can't run outside. Wash hands. Wash hands. Wash hands, the more we get in routine with that, then it will be easier later on. Wash hands. Wash hands Washington's so but

215
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just now.

216
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Did it make you think about maybe setting something up and having Sunday brunches together or something.

217
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.600
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, and Saturdays. Maybe we we live in.

218
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.190
Rochelle Martinez: A room.

219
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:47.790
Rochelle Martinez: There's what else is around us and we live down the road for their skills. So the afternoons me and him are walking the deals. There's maybe four cars that pass up and down this road, baby. Do you know what I mean. And it's people that live here.

220
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.520
Rochelle Martinez: I aunt is aware that we've been exposed. So she knows we can

221
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.480
Rochelle Martinez: You can wave at each other, but that's about it. I mean, when

222
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone

223
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone brought up a movie. I'm not

224
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't watch much but someone was cracking a joke yesterday about Demolition Man, I've never seen it, but he was saying they they don't touch or something, and that they have this weird little they go like this.

225
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.050
Rochelle Martinez: Maybe seem to be me.

226
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I gotta want to my what I bet that's going to be popular, you can go check it out. But like, it's like everything's like

227
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Totally like you're

228
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Free somehow. I don't know how they pull it off, but maybe we can get some good ideas from the book.

229
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So anyway, I'm trying to get some giggles because right I'm

230
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna keep our mental health.

231
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: In a cabin fever in here we go, stir crazy

232
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:59.910
Rochelle Martinez: And that's the good thing is that I'm used to be home. So I'm not getting that built up things idea of being home isn't affecting me

233
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:10.650
Rochelle Martinez: I'm used to, like I say, when I go grocery shopping once a month, they get everything that we need. And if I have to go into town. It's to get something to eat with were

234
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:28.650
Rochelle Martinez: Fast food or something. But it's not often that I'm out and about. So I have, you know, maybe five friends that I keep in contact, whether that's through over the phone. I've even had lunch or anything with them in six months. So I, I feel like

235
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.020
Rochelle Martinez: We're gonna do anything.

236
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.640
Rochelle Martinez: It's just trying to Stay positive, dream. Well, this is

237
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.370
Rochelle Martinez: The tricky part.

238
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How many hours a day. Are you watching the news or you can you

239
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:58.950
Rochelle Martinez: In the afternoon at five o'clock when I try not to even go there. I, I listened to what the governor has to say if she's on and if not, then

240
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:10.980
Rochelle Martinez: We're good. You know what I mean it's we're staying away from that i'm i'm reading about the CDC and for me, the CDC CC and

241
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.700
Rochelle Martinez: That's about it. I'm trying to stay away from

242
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.050
Rochelle Martinez: All that negativity right now and I

243
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:32.730
Rochelle Martinez: Just listening to the important things. Do you really mean, and I'm looking up on now that the CDC website about the groceries and all that, too, and

244
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:50.520
Rochelle Martinez: I think staying away from other. And if I do have questions, like I say I text my mom or asked her this or whatever. The question is do you remain. How do we prevent this are what are, what do we need to do next.

245
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.570
Rochelle Martinez: What's the best cleaning supply to us right now and just little things like that even mean like

246
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:08.280
Rochelle Martinez: Right now we have couple containers of Oxy Clean because she said no that's better than the Clorox because it has the peroxide and baking soda in it. So, it kills a lot of the germs.

247
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.510
Rochelle Martinez: All the, all the launches leading national

248
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:13.980
Rochelle Martinez: Team clean

249
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:28.560
Rochelle Martinez: The floors twice a day just just even though I know that nobody's coming in, until five o'clock that my brother gets full and feel

250
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.060
Rochelle Martinez: Like

251
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.060
Rochelle Martinez: This they think it's just

252
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.410
Rochelle Martinez: That anxiety dinner. I mean, trying to keep it as much as I can.

253
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:41.820
Rochelle Martinez: But

254
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:49.980
Rochelle Martinez: It's just a little shaky, knowing that I have them out there with no hardly any protective gear and

255
00:28:50.670 --> 00:29:04.350
Rochelle Martinez: I should ask those questions, but I need to do. I mean, because she's the one who orders of stuff. She's the one who's on the phone has to be begging for some cake right now they're told that they have choose the same as for one week and

256
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:13.170
Rochelle Martinez: It just crazy that they don't have the stuff that they need to protect themselves from these dude. I mean, since yeah but

257
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how that cleaning. Remember I was talking about how the mask and help psychologically so personally me

258
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It helps me psychologically feel like I'm doing everything here cleaning is helping you. That's a lot of times, so we won't don't want to get it to the point you know how people do that and they identify as a compulsive disorder.

259
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. We don't want to get that point. But now you see why people do it, it creates psychological relief to know we're doing everything we can.

260
00:29:49.320 --> 00:30:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, it's okay, I'm going to do this. This is how we're going to have some control over my life this very uncertain moment. So I say minimum of twice a day. There we go. I'll watch the news at five o'clock.

261
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.470
Rochelle Martinez: Those little things are your nails. I was picking at it so

262
00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you also hear me kind of

263
00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: touching on that this might be an opportunity to engage socially, which is already something you and I work on sort of in our treatment planning that this might be an opportunity for you to socialize in a kind of different way. You don't have to go out and see them, but um

264
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.070
Rochelle Martinez: We show you something. I use chat on dual

265
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:21.960
Rochelle Martinez: Bu

266
00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.770
Rochelle Martinez: And in the nighttime.

267
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:37.770
Rochelle Martinez: I talked to Heather and she's home to show to the state. So she's been working from home. So we just sit there and bullshit right after the baby's asleep.

268
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.190
Rochelle Martinez: That's about the only only socializing again really

269
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I've been doing in group has kind of talking about just what we were talking about. And then also coming up with creative ideas to

270
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you were normally we were starting to think about going out in the community.

271
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to just remind that we have the internet. The internet is amazing resource be going to

272
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: 12 step meetings, you can be going to

273
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a 12 step model. They have videos they have chats, they have

274
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Video

275
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Meetings.

276
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be getting

277
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.920
Rochelle Martinez: More support here.

278
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.000
Rochelle Martinez: You can read this through your

279
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Name as

280
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

281
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you want.

282
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Bugs Bunny.

283
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You can kind of have your confidentiality in there. Um,

284
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let

285
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.110
Rochelle Martinez: Me see what this one is.

286
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This if you typed in 12 step notes, no space looks like.

287
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To step forward.

288
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.390
www.org

289
00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've got another one to show you, too.

290
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So this one, of course, as you know, has that sort of use of higher power God and a spiritual element to it.

291
00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We, you know, we admitted. We were powerless, those, those pieces.

292
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everyone is amenable they can't take in information when it's packaged with that philosophy. So I've been talking a lot about how to sort of put aside the packaging of really good information.

293
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get distracted distracted by the cover of the book. Don't get distracted by the packaging, you can get really good information. If you can get past the cover. And so if you think about this, this framework, if you don't really have a lot of buy in with that spiritual part

294
00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:42.240
Just

295
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't get past it. There's also this concept here, this is almost parallels the 12 STEP program, but it's called smart recovery and you could find smart.

296
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:06.210
Rochelle Martinez: I've worked at Boston program before in previous years. So, I, I'm kind of familiar with it.

297
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:13.170
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I'm actually familiar with it. I didn't. When I was in rehab and I found it.

298
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.870
Rochelle Martinez: Interesting. I mean it was just more shifting and

299
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:20.910
So this

300
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I mean by packaging, there can be good information. But it doesn't mean that we take everything. Someone says or does we don't take it all in.

301
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: All at once. We can take pieces of something. So, for example, you've probably been in either one of my groups or someone else's groups and maybe you didn't like or resonate with all of it, but you got something you like. Oh.

302
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.200
Rochelle Martinez: I just heard.

303
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that one felt right for me that one felt true for me. So we don't want cut ourselves off from the whole opportunity.

304
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We could say, all right, I'll take in what is true for me. What works for me and I'll let the rest go just a breath of comfort. Just let the rest go. Don't get distracted by the packaging.

305
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right 12 step. Oh there's so rigid. Well, I'm not going to get distracted by the rules and expectations of it. I want to hear the message.

306
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.990
Rochelle Martinez: Machine.

307
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's kind of been my focus last couple weeks is don't rob yourself from getting the contents of the packaging.

308
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because you don't like the cover of it. You know, it's like, oh, they're going to be judging of me or whatever because I don't really want to. I'm it. Step four. And I didn't do. Step two.

309
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.070
Rochelle Martinez: You know, they're going to

310
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I'm on you for nursing and they're going to think that's a drug, and they're going to judge me. Well, you know what, it's online, you don't have to say what you don't want to say, and you can benefit from listening and sharing

311
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Your stories of hope and strength. But this is an environment here and smart recovery that does not have the 12 step model.

312
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.500
Okay.

313
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, ww smart recovery.org looks like.

314
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, it was really cute. I wish I could find the one that was really really really cute.

315
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: They had I don't have it up here because my my computer crashed recently. Anyway, it was, um, listen to the the zoom meeting that they were going to have one of the zoom meetings they were going to have was called can't quarantine my spirit.

316
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Was like, Oh, I love that so much. I thought that was hysterical.

317
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So give some think to write that this is an opportunity for you to have a girls night in you can meet with your girls, kind of, hey, in this kind of platform we see each other, crack some jokes.

318
00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And also with your family have some routine put together so that y'all are still feeling connected. We're not really not spiritually quarantine.

319
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:08.730
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

320
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So how long have you felt, let's just get right to it. Has there been some loneliness.

321
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.670
Rochelle Martinez: It hasn't met yet. It hasn't been any luminous

322
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:28.680
Rochelle Martinez: I think I'm just so busy with the kids and stuff like that that loneliness. I don't have time to be

323
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.660
Rochelle Martinez: You know the meaning

324
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.300
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah. So, and, and, you know, I've never needed

325
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:48.990
Rochelle Martinez: Friendship to keep me going, I have his kids to just consume my day. I do reach out and talk to my friends and we checked in on each other and stuffs been

326
00:37:53.730 --> 00:38:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just been putting a little note here around the Na na that you took a note of some of these online opportunities. Okay.

329
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just curious, remind me why you're not coming to any of my groups like I can't remember why

330
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.640
Rochelle Martinez: Well, it's because in the evening when

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:38.700
Rochelle Martinez: I have somebody to watch Brooklyn without her being on my lap, like right now as to the seven o'clock in the morning. One while she's asleep. Because if not, she's right here destruction and

332

Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I mean, she's too it differently. And then that group is all an organized that I attend. It's a there's never the same people in it on a weekly or monthly basis. Every time I go in. Maybe there's one, there's one near your face that I was their previous month. Dinner mean so it's it's

349
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:29.550
