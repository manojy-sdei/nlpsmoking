25
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.770
Jay: Yeah, I was mad because I didn't get to go

26
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.180
Jay: I would rather

27
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.130
Jay: I would rather go to Florida than Vegas.

28
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Florida. Do you like

29
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.790
Jay: I don't even care. I want to go to go to a club. I want to get drunk.

30
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: On here.

31
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't, I can't have any kind of support recorded on that, that I can't do. And I get. I get what it's like to cut loose and to just be a kid. I get that. It's

32
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.480
Jay: Just on my bucket list. I just want to go for the half moon, see the

33
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Ocean. Oh.

34
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

35
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.050
Jay: I think the west coast.

36
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you something. I've been to both and I lived in LA, I live in California and that water in the Pacific Ocean.

37
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Warmed up enough. It's so cold you come out here for. It can be the winner. You can still get in the water. It's amazing.

38
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.070
Jay: It blows my mind.

39
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be in that water. It's no biggie. If you can't get in the Pacific Ocean and don't need a wetsuit on the other coast over here to walk in that water anytime you want to.

40
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.690
Jay: Do. That's what I want to do.

41
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.180
Jay: Is one go have fun.

42
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so I didn't think to myself, I was a little bit like

43
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How to court go like I couldn't remember if it was yesterday. And I was like, Oh, is it today. I don't know how to go. What's up,

44
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.090
Jay: She reinstated my probation.

45
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, for how long.

46
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.400
Jay: Well, that's what we're arguing the DEA is still saying I have four years, eight months.

47
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.100
Jay: I don't check it out. I got out of prison in June 28 of 2017

48
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

49
00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:00.060
Jay: With five years probation, you tell me how the hell I only have four years and eight months left. That means I've only done what five months, six months.

50
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.470
Jay: Yeah, that's what I said. And he's like, well, I've only had this case since December of what doesn't matter when you have

51
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

52
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay but but you're happy you're not in jail. Hello.

53
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.340
Jay: I don't even have to go to rehab.

54
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. So what went well. What worked the attorney, ask the right question. What was the what worked

55
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.150
Jay: No, I still have to go to court for those checks that still

56
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.420
Jay: This one just the probation violation for my duty, you wait

57
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's when you first got out so

58
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm still, I was thinking that we're done.

59
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: With the whole check thing. Okay.

60
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.130
Jay: I'm still facing a lot of time.

61
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.050
Jay: But

62
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.930
Jay: It would have been worse if I was in jail or my probation violation. Whenever I went to trial.

63
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Please. Okay.

64
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.130
Jay: So that's why I was stressing this

65
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.750
Jay: I mean, I have a feeling I'm going to go back to prison.

66
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh geez.

67
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.030
Jay: Pic is going to be from the a couple years. I don't think they're going to give you the max. But I do think they're going to give you some time.

68
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

69
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.570
Jay: If I didn't have a record like I have

70
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.990
Jay: Then yeah, I would say there's the shelter probation, but

71
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.390
Jay: My record is two pages long on the Internet.

72
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And so they want to teach you a lesson.

73
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.980
Jay: Yeah, I'm, I'm always the guy.

74
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.860
Jay: That they make an example out of

75
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Check something I want to see if

76
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I sent

77
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.640
Your

78
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your

79
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.440
Jay: Western peace loving

80
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: He

81
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.550
Jay: He brought up the fact that I was in this program and stuff. Yeah. Actually, you have my back. Okay.

82
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it looks like something happen march 12. Let me see. What's that

83
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah it looks like I sent it. On March 13

84
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.300
Jay: Okay.

85
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: March 13 so he did have your back. He is

86
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.620
Jay: He's fighting for me.

87
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. That's a good sign.

88
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And what did you hear him say

89
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.200
Jay: He said that I've been going above and beyond. I've done everything he's asked me to. And then some

90
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.070
Okay.

91
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.260
Jay: I'm making my appointments. I'm staying in contact with him. Um, I let him know about that fight right away.

92
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.400
Jay: I'm just everything you know from day one. Whenever I first met him. I told him, don't be

93
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.800
Jay: Our problem. You know what I mean.

94
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.000
Jay: He's still fairly new, but

95
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: He is I wish she had an old dog in there that can be like I've seen a bunch of guys and this one just as a good day.

96
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's, that's basically what he said because

97
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:41.790
Jay: And this is where he told the judge all my pills in the past I've gone to court and said no we want him back in prison. He's not a good candidate for probation.

98
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:55.080
Jay: And then look guys see here saying that I've been doing everything he asked, and then I am a good candidate. So the judges are like I see you've made some changes just in the past year, because a year ago, people didn't want me out.

99
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.070
Okay.

100
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.070
Jay: Now, and doing good. So

101
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's another thing that

102
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Number. Did you give any thought to that that concept that I mentioned last time about having as many eyes on the case as possible, remember thinking, dude you given that any thought

103
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I'm going to church. I have a minister of a sponsor. Do you see what I'm trying to get out. You're going to have more people witnessing firsthand you're consistent

104
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: moral imperatives you're showing up doing what you say you are you're not full of shit I EYES. EYES. EYES. EYES. You see it.

105
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.040
Jay: We're called character witnesses. I got about 12 or 13

106
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Okay. And those people. Those character witnesses. What is their credibility.

107
00:08:48.720 --> 00:09:08.340
Jay: Well, I got my sister, my brother in law, my brother, my brother in law was a military police for two years in the Air Force. Okay, now he's an air airplane mechanic, um, my little sister. She's I mean she works sometimes. Sometimes you don't. She's a full time mom.

108
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:20.460
Jay: My mom. She's a business owner, she knows everybody in town. We got my step dad, he's a business owner knows everybody in town.

109
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:31.140
Jay: And that's why my mom wants my step dad there because he knows everybody. He knows who's in, who's pocket book you knows who's getting paid for movie. He knows everything about it.

110
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.990
Jay: So, him being there will

111
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, these people speak to

112
00:09:38.250 --> 00:10:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Jay, he used to look at the law like this and now he looks at the law like this and this is how I know it's true. He's doing this, this, this, and this, because it's not enough to say he's a good guy. We want to fill the judges head with evidence to make it easy for the judge to say yes.

113
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.960
Jay: It's the jury.

114
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The jury to. It's the same thing. It's, you want to make it easy. They need to have pieces that when they go chat, they're like, Yeah, but we all screw up he screwed up. Look how young he was. This is a young man who

115
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Was in and out of the juvenile system like you know they can put the dots together making it easy for them to say that, and is there no way that you could read a letter of a just something where you actually write something

116
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.180
Jay: I think I'll be able to take the stand.

117
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you say

118
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Not with a popsicle, obviously. But I mean, what would you say if you are for real.

119
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.820
Jay: I would just Explain my situation and what was going through my mind at the time.

120
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:58.200
Jay: You know, this wasn't an intentional. Oh I stole your check will come in a drain your bank account. You know I'm saying

121
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.780
Jay: I bought a little jack right

122
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:09.090
Jay: It's, it's not uncommon for me to go into one of their checkbooks my mom's checkbooks and

123
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:09.990
Purchase

124
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.400
Jay: Yeah.

125
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But when they they need to be able to see something that is not that rap sheet.

126
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If you already put it in their head on what to do with that in their head. What do they do with it. The he was just using criminal logic again right he didn't think

127
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So how do you, how do you, I mean, because you might as well. Isn't that the worst part of it is, what do I do

128
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: They have because that's what the other attorney is right, talking about. Look what a mess. What a messy is. Look what he did. He's just as another one of those he's playing you

129
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can think of a way to address that and shift that what that means in a judge, jury whoever the listening audiences. I didn't quite hear from you yet. I haven't heard it yet.

130
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that I've only heard, hey, this is my logic, you're only talking about the jack. You're not talking about what am I supposed to do with this rap sheet in my head. What do I do with it. I'm looking at you and now you got hey listen we're more likely to do what we always did.

131
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do I do with that. How can you change my thinking.

132
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.280
Jay: I don't know. Yeah.

133
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what the letter I just brought up is, that's this saying goodbye to heroin.

134
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That saying goodbye to being slick that same goodbye and the liar to the cutting the baffling disease that's saying goodbye to it. That's the kind of letter.

135
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you really can show I've had it. I've had it without life I get I was still holding on hope against hope that I'm going to, I'm going to bypass the system. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'll do one more. I'm gonna I'm gonna, I'm going to

136
00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I got away with it this time in this time in this time and this one time I wasn't even up to no good. It got me.

137
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that the way life is.

138
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Drive and I had turned my life around

139
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's when it kicks me in the ass.

140
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Being able to explain so that we, as we're listening to really see that you understand the value

141
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the legal system. And I don't know if you do. I don't know if in a really heartfelt way or do you still think

142
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I just want to party. Again, I really just want to, this is just an inconvenience and y'all are full of shit. And I just want to party.

143
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't how do we know that. Do you know what I'm trying to say because they've never met you. They don't know

144
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we gotta put it in there like yeah look like that. Remember how I was talking about that.

145
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Fixed mindset thing. And now growth mindset finding your own little like switcheroo like how did I used to view the law. My relationship with other with my community.

146
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I don't I'm now accountable in this way in this way. My connection is deep and it's here and I see it here and I see it here so that when I'm sitting here listening. I'm like,

147
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: He's no threat to me. I wouldn't mind if he hung out with my kids at the park or they're going to be left like you're SCARY ASS, MAN. I'M. No, no, I believe you.

148
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what I'm trying to get at. This is a hard thing to get to. But that's why writing if you hadn't written that kind of letter yet.

149
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you'd be ready to do. You're still really young, so I don't even know if you're ready to say goodbye.

150
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To the street life to the hustle. I don't know.

151
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.690
Jay: I'm done with it.

152
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna I'm gonna pop quiz. You ready for this.

153
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:49.080
Good.

154
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jay

155
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think, so I'm the I'm the judge and I say, you know what, Jay.

156
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If someone had come at me.

157
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: They were jumping out of a truck and they were going to jump me. What do you think I would have done versus you if they were going to jump me

158
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.280
Jay: Call the cops probably

159
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: WHAT DID YOU DO WHAT DON'T HAVE TO ME, I'M A judge

160
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what did you do

161
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.180
You

162
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You you saw john problem, then you someone's coming at you, you recognize him because he's an X right you find him, got a black guy.

163
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But he has to really shift thinking

164
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What else could you have done if you were so sure you have to protect your probation right violations and can't can't be hanging with anybody if you back it way up, go back even further.

165
00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing girlfriend who is her ex. See if you can pull it way back, but look what could you have done to even prevent it from happening. We pulled it even further back. You want to go back to the earliest piece.

166
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Of control or effort that you could have made to prevented that from happening. And this may sound ridiculous, but what it shows is for thought that you're thinking and analyzing how did I contribute to this happening.

167
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I might not have dated someone like that.

168
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.060
Jay: You didn't think I didn't think you're gonna be like that.

169
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know who this. Well, let's be honest, did you kind of know what kind of people. She hung with. Did you know her ex she was kind of like

170
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What

171
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.780
Jay: You wouldn't find her ex, and any of the circle. She runs around

172
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.190
Jay: He's a straight tweak or drug addict. She don't do drugs, she's

173
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:56.490
She's

174
00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a straight to weaker. I'm gonna tell you right now, if I know, make it. I have to make some stuff up. I got track my own thought here.

175
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm dating someone and his ex is straight to weaker. Let me tell you the conversation. I'm going to have with with friend, my, my, my friend boyfriend right here.

176
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And stay away from me. I gotta keep I can't even have it three three levels back. I can't even have a four levels back. I gotta protect my probation. I can't even I can't even. You're adorable. I'll catch you in this provisions done

177
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.740
Jay: Well, now that I know now that I know that there's a problem. Done.

178
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But you see what I'm getting at. Right, it's it's asking the questions it's protecting we do it the same way, not only with probation. That's that really fragile space in there, but it's also your recovery to

179
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Your homies. Uh huh. Yeah, I love you. You had my back. All those years. But, uh,

180
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still hanging with some people that are going to get is to close it, you know, and I don't know how you say it to them.

181
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I'm saying right now is tracking it back to things that you can hold yourself accountable for we authority types we lack that up like a kitten.

182
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: We love it because you're like, oh, he knows he knows what he did. He can see can track the.dot.he can see where he can intervene and he can change the direction. He's not blaming us he's not blaming everybody else do you get where I'm going.

183
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We love that stuff.

184
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So what a judge. So when a jury you own it and you say, I know where I could have done something differently. And it's so amazing how right when I was really coming online to that, um,

185
00:18:51.840 --> 00:19:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It was. And then it was this, I was normalized. And again, all that but I I now know what I have to do I have to protect this as if it was an infant. I can't let anybody around it.

186
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they'll mess with it. They won't know they're messing with it, but this is my freedom.

187
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody's going to protect it, like me, and I wasn't taking it seriously before. Now I am

188
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you see the difference. Like, I, I, I feel it like

189
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I wasn't taking it seriously before laws, rules. What are the abbey checking with my appeal. I'll be talking asking questions. Well, can I go over here. I know someone lives near there. What is they come up to me.

190
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That my pod able to say, well, she always calling me and asking me what the rules are. Make sure he doesn't violate he's on it. He doesn't want to screw up. Okay, so I've been doing a lot of blah blah blah over here.

191
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think about

192
00:19:51.090 --> 00:20:02.280
Jay: Nothing. I mean, I don't I don't associate with nobody whenever I was with my girlfriend. I would hang out with her and her friends. That's it. Now that I'm not with her. I don't I'm by myself again.

193
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:14.850
Jay: That's the only way that I have been able to stay clean. That's the only way that I've been able to stay out of trouble is to be by myself. And look, whenever I got with her. The one thing that got me in trouble happen.

194
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.840
Jay: So I learned my lesson.

195
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

196
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If I say to you, what

197
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to prevent you from another one of those missteps another violation of probation, what's going to keep you from doing that from getting in a fight or

198
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Accidentally taking something that's not yours or from slipping on a drug. And then, of course, now you're gonna break the law what just really simply put, what's going to keep you from doing that.

199
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

200
00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:00.390
Jay: Just the simple fact that I've able to been able to keep myself clean and sober is a motivating factor for me, you know, labels.

201
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.930
Jay: What's going to keep me from doing it. I can't say that there's anything that's going to keep me from doing it.

202
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:20.040
Jay: I mean, if, if I want to do it. I'm going to do it. You know, it's going to be an access for me, that's exactly what my mom said they're not going to change anything just because I'm giving you

203
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:27.510
Jay: The total I'm not on drugs. So, I mean, I'm not, I think, I think, a little more clearly when I'm not on the drugs.

204
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the part I would be focusing on. I want to, I would want to understand how you're thinking more clearly it's not enough to say because on a whim. You could not be thinking like, we need to understand what's changed meaningfully about you.

205
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:50.190
Jay: It doesn't speak my my responsibilities and all my things that I've been accomplishing by myself. When that

206
00:21:51.510 --> 00:22:04.260
Jay: Is that what the character witnesses before I got a couple counselors, I got a judge that will read for me. I got a couple pills at the appeals office that violated me last year and are willing to write letters from an issue.

207
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:10.230
Jay: It speaks volumes, just that I've gotten off the drugs and I did it by myself.

208
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:17.790
Jay: I didn't have to go to jail to get off. I stopped cold turkey and I made it work. Okay.

209
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're talking about this episode of care that you're in with right heart health. Now,

210
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

211
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:41.190
Jay: That was hard. That was probably the hardest thing I ever did is taking them strip them and hoping and praying that I'm not going to get super withdraws and shake up in body aches in the

212
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.560
Jay: Blistering heading. You know what I mean.

213
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.270
Jay: But it worked. I trust in me I trusted you guys will help you

214
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Get there. Good, good, good, good.

215
00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So something else that you're doing is

216
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I will tell you that it is difficult for you to say it is like, you know what I was posing like what's different about your thought process.

217
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It is small, not to minimize the importance of it, but you're relying on other people's description of you versus you having written the kind of letter that I'm talking about.

218
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You get me up on this, you get me up on the stand and talking about the reason why I'm not going to do, why I'm not going to accept outside the law, you're going to hear a really long list. You're going to hear me go up, up, up, up, up, up. But that's me.

219
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I was trying to see if you already had it readily available. I didn't, I didn't hear much

220
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it might not be a bad idea for you to do a little journaling, just in case you get asked that question.

221
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do I give a shit about sobriety. Why do I give a shit about my community. Let me think about that. Do I see

222
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.960
Jay: If I'm being honest though they're not gonna like my my answers.

223
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's just me. Maybe you're not there yet. Maybe the truth is you don't trust yourself.

224
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:11.550
Jay: I don't

225
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.060
Jay: I mean,

226
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:12.690
The

227
00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:22.830
Jay: Only reason I stopped using drugs is because I seen how was doing my family, my mom, I could care less about me and I got nothing. Do you know what I mean.

228
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok ok ok now we're getting somewhere.

229
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting to the heart of it. That right there that I don't give a shit about me.

230
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want that to change. I want that to change, not only are you wanting to do, right, because you can see the damage that it has done to the people that you love how that it has hurt your mother.

231
00:24:48.240 --> 00:25:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Over time, I want you to be able to see that you have robbed yourself of an opportunity and I want you to really know what those are. But it means having to sit with regret the discomfort of guilt not shame. I'm not a fan of that one, that one wipes out the person I'm talking about just

232
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I can repair that and I am. It's different than I'm a bad person. It's I did something that's outside my moral code.

233
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't do it again. I take ownership of that I don't avoid feeling it. So if I avoid feeling it. I may do it again. But I gotta hold on to that I got to own it, but I am concerned. Jay, that you you don't see the value in you. I'm concerned.

234
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that really true, you really

235
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't

236
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.850
Jay: I could spend the rest of my life in prison and be okay with you.

237
00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So is there anyone in your life. I mean, okay. So you've got judges. You've got all these character witnesses, do you actually believe what they're saying.

238
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really.

239
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.390
Jay: I know I could be a good person. I just don't think it

240
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that because you let your mom down is that the central feature.

241
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.100
Jay: Know,

242
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it then.

243
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.250
Jay: It's a combination of everything. Everything I've been through.

244
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you, have you told anyone or maybe a clump of people all these wrongs that you think you've done and you let it all out and seen you have

245
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.810
Jay: To do the steps I've done a lot

246
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And did your sponsor say you're still lovable.

247
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but

248
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that sponsor.

249
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.570
Jay: No, no.

250
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the difference. It's still

251
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good enough. It's still in there. It's, it's got to be believed in a real way that you have value and you're lovable. You were born that way, regardless of how people treat you. Because plenty of

252
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Bodies are treated just terrible. They're just treated terrible that's. Those are the people that I work with, right. You guys are just the the mind right you're physically and emotionally abused. Those are my peeps.

253
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

254
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And the confusion comes in, well then that's about as good as I am, then, is how I'm treated and it sticks there stays there. No amount of accolade and someone saying you're a good person. I see your potential

255
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It gets washed out away for for. Yeah, but you don't know the real meat. I'm a piece of shit.

256
00:27:49.230 --> 00:28:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that just sits there, because if I was a better person, wouldn't I have done this. Listen, listen, this. Yeah. What is it, what's one of the ones that you just you just want to say, Yeah, but you don't know. You don't know this. I'm like, what is that shame, say, what's its voice.

257
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.120
Jay: I don't even know.

258
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see what we got here.

259
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got time.

260
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To come up here.

261
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.750
Jay: Ladies restroom quick

262
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:31.560
Course

263
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Do you have

264
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the two objects. I'd like to do some positive

265
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Installing

266
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Cmdr.

267
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. So take yeah so what you want to do is take those two objects, if I'm, if my face is the phone. You want to have those two objects about shoulder width apart right next to the phone so that when I can't see him.

268
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah and yeah but and they're about. I would say from wrist to shoulder distance

269
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: From from your eyes shoulder distance about risk not hand. But as I've noticed people need a little bit closer so them out there and it's about shoulder. It's about shoulder width apart.

270
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me take a look at your move in the right in the thing, right. So, let me see you look at the top of those structures left and right. Let me see, look in the top of them.

271
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a little close scoot back just an inch with your body.

272
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now look at the top of the structures.

273
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to blink. Just look left and right, left, right, left, right. Does that hurt your eye at all.

274
00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. If it does, Jake, I don't want your eyes to hurt. So you want to scoot back even see how I just moved back a little bit. Here's me moving forward. You're going to want to adjust it.

275
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Even so, slightly it'll make a difference on the ability of comfort to move back and forth.

276
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to see the rate at which I'm sending it out of the corner. Yes, it will be at this speed. I'll be setting the speed with my

277
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: With my hand. So now I want you to look at the top of them at the rate of the periphery of your vision, you don't really have to look at me, but I'll be setting the rate of speed. Very nice. And is it causing an eye strain.

278
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.610
Jay: Maybe

279
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, scoot back just a touch. Yeah, there we go.

280
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I am noticing that they're lower than you, which might cause that ideally you'd be I level these objects would be I level would be better if they were don't know if they can be stacked up on a, what would that be in books or

281
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Salad. What do you call Tupperware container stacked up. So there's a high level instead of looking down

282
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Book will cover that and

283
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A half per inch.

284
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That we need, what else

285
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Around

286
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Box.

287
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: macaroni box maybe

288
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nice little thin or macaroni box right or cereal box.

289
00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be off by that will make too much of a difference.

290
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.330
Jay: Can you see me.

291
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so I cannot. I can't see them. So it's a good thing. But I want to be able to. You want to be able to see them an eye level. Does it feel more like you're looking across to them instead of down. That's nice. Yeah, okay, good. Um,

292
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just going to be

293
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.330
Jay: Using

294
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So today I'd like to do. I know I have an incomplete anchor room and I think I'll come back to that.

295
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But today with the little bit of time that we have. I'd like to do some what I call again those robotic words installing I want to do some of the positive imagery, just to introduce you to this attachment focus end or

296
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The em dr is just sort of this bilateral stimulation. Which one theory says it's a distraction while you are integrating information. Okay, so

297
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to know the science for it to work. It's not only will we, it'll either work or it won't work. Okay. You don't have to believe in it. So let's go over to

298
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: For a minute. Jay, I want to just take a nice breath.

299
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And just lean into this idea that I'm going to do all the guiding you don't have to know ahead of time. What's next, I will guide you. You don't have to know ahead of time. Okay.

300
00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything I say would just respond your natural response uncensored whatever feeling you have if it's in the body that shows up as that first response. I'm going to want to know.

301
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's a thought. I want to know if it's an emotion, if it's if it's like this image. I'm going to want to know.

302
00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The answers are probably going to be really small. And then I'm going to say something like, okay, go with that. And then I'll do another iteration iteration means

303
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 seconds or so of this and then I'll say what's coming up for you. And then you'll share a nice brief response I may say go with that. And I'll go back and forth. That's basically what we're about to do.

304
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But this morning, I would like to do something positive. And once you do take a breath, kind of get into that flow of breathing that belly breathing.

305
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to add some imagery

306
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: First, I'd like you to have your eyes closed, you can really get into it. I'm not staring at you. I'm actually looking at your notes or my notes around the protective figure

307
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm breathing into myself, I'm thinking about Tony Stark.

308
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell one of my kids to STOP GIGGLING

309
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Boys your normal. What can you do it out there.

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's give yourself some some time for some refueling here and the objective today is really, it's to feel good. Okay, I'm not going to invite you to go somewhere and uncomfortable with the see if they can go somewhere that feels good. So bring up the imagery of Tony Stark.

315
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: He's your favorite Avenger brings a little smile on your face right yeah he follows his heart to the fullest.

316
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: He'll straight up persist and won't quit.

317
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Field at, where do you know that truth.

318
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Even when adversity and challenge comes, you mean forward to it and you move into what your heart knows is right.

319
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You focuses and you can to now on the bigger picture immediately even feel that heart pounding.

325
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:35.730

326
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to hold it in your imagery and at the pace that I'm sending look at the objects. The top of those objects left and right. You don't want to move your head just the objects left and right. I'm doing it pretty slowly.

340
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing figure

341
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing interactions, how the body's feeling if anything changes anything else coming up. Just pay attention to subtle.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:26.880
Jay: Entire

343

346
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel more or less tired with the slow speed.

347
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.280
More

348
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.790

350
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let the mind go blank for even one beat

351
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And after that quiet space, see what comes up.

352
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

Gwenevere Abriel: You got the dragons.

366
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh.

Gwenevere Abriel: Doing great.

368
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now what are you thinking about

369
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:53.730
Jay: Trying not to laugh.

370
00:41:54.870 --> 00:42:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What were you doing. Now what was coming. What was some. How did you try not to laugh. See if you can grab that quick. Are we doing that.

371
00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:09.360
Jay: I was just seeing the dragons fly in the show, I'll think about watching the show again.

372
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing them. Okay.

373
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And

374
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So did the rest of the figures fall away are they still there, the protective and nurturing

375
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.810
Jay: Belly to bring it up. Yeah.

376
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But no, they weren't there.

377
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But they weren't. Okay.

378
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about those dragons flying

379
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Sees the dragons know what happened to the nurturing and the protective figure unsolicited first response that comes up, or they go, or they

380
00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.340
Jay: Ran away.

381
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: They ran away.

382
00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And Tony and your mom.

383
00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.080
Jay: Yeah, they took off and left me.

384
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.330
Jay: With the Dragon

385
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and how does it feel to be left alone with the Dragon

386
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.440
Jay: Right, it

387
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You can ride it.

388
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, check in and see, see if there's something about this dragon that brings check in and see if there's a sense of protection that comes from this dragon check in and see

389
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

390
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Ooh.

391
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Fire three is fire, and it's also getting you the heck out if you wanted to fly away to right

392
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

393
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it have that sense of nurturing flying for you to reach your potential. Does it have that piece.

394
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom not trust the dragon. I wonder what she did not know the dragon.

395
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.570
Jay: Doesn't speak slow, if you

396
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you guys see her running

397
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let your imagination go we're trying to really understand these protective resources being very present with them.

398
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: As it changes.

399
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know.

400
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.770
Jay: I don't know what you mean by that.

401
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, notice how the rest weren't there and it was the dragons and now you're flying. And so then you just let me know if it's changing again.

402
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying you flying

403
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay, how does your body feel

404
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:53.310
Jay: Tense

405
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Where

406
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.840
Jay: My back my shoulders.

407
00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:58.920
Back and

408
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if not trying and could do something to give some relief to those shoulders. Do you think

409
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.740
Jay: No need to sort of

410
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Start over.

411
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

412
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.460
Jay: Let's relax. No, no.

413
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you remember when. So come back.

414
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to look

415
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Quick. Do you know when the tension came back. Do you know. Was it something I said

416
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:39.300
Jay: No, we were starting to talk about flying. I'm scared of heights. Okay.

417
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.590
Jay: Definitely afraid of heights, but

418
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.360
Jay: I had a job when I was

419
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.480
Jay: 10 stories in the machine.

420
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.370
Jay: scary as hell every day, but I do

421
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You have done dangerous scary things and you have survived. J.

422
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: We talked a little bit about what you notice about this. This was very well, I won't say what this was because I already introduced it to tell me what you noticed doing this little, little bit of bilateral stimulation. What did you notice

423
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.100
Jay: How it could affect my body.

424
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:00.900
Jay: Just crazy how it

425
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:04.860
Jay: Can cause your body to

426
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.950
Jay: Relax.

427
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.750
Jay: There was a moment where my honor to slip off because it was so relaxed.

428
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh really,

429
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.540
Jay: Yeah. And then he going real tight and can feel it on my back my back at that

430
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:19.530
Yeah.

431
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else you noticed it's important to you.

432
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: About all of our session today. See if we can trackback see if anything else you're leaving with that's important to you.

433
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Look,

434
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:43.590
Jay: I'm gonna write a letter to the judge. I'm gonna try to figure out. I talked to my way of Pharaoh best way to

435
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:46.530
Jay: Present, myself included.

436
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That was something else that came up. Yeah, okay.

437
00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you noticed

438
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The connection between the mind and the body just

439
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing up a thought can be a trigger to the body. Hey, this is this is a you're bringing up a thought flying even remember we had to do something that we didn't want to do. We were terrified. We had to do it anyway and then the muscles tensed.

440
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

441
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:22.920
Jay: That's crazy.

442
00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:23.670
Isn't it

443
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Every members you

444
00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You may not even know what's going on, but the body remembers it keeps the score and if we don't pay attention to it you know included in the conversation we're missing out on important part

445
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another appointment and this time we're getting closer and closer. We just did a little bit. I got to learn a little bit about how flow. I got to see there was a little bit of a little getting tired. There was a little bit of

446
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it was effective. I got to see but I needed to see what would go on with you around it and you were very able to follow my guidance. If I said do this, you would you would stay within that neural network. You didn't go outside of it.

447
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be times when you might hear me say, Oh, let's stay here. Let's stay on this piece of information, not the whole neural not everything that you can ever remember about something. So you were able to really sort of let me guide.

448
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this will be effective. So let's schedule another appointment here.

449
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this. What a good

450
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we can do this again at 11 on April 21 and you're going to check out some groups tomorrow too. Right.

451
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.160

453
00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.720

454
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:03.960
Jay: In a text. I thought I wrote down

455

Jay: This one to one with only me

465
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's 7:30pm and what you'll probably get with Dominic very different therapeutic style she focuses very much on meditation and mindfulness. So that might be a neat way to end your day like

466
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like she'll probably do some some meditative grounding things that might be a neat way to kind of bring the close of a day.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:08.430
Jay: Okay, so that one's at 730

468

474
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to make sure you got enough time to check in cases a bunch of people for April 21 I haven't. I'm having my very first group that day so I will have to end right on time or even a couple minutes like two, three minutes beforehand. I'll be

475
00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: My first when Tuesday 12pm group so

476
00:51:50.940 --> 00:52:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have to jump out alright so whatever's left whatever negative feelings, whatever negative images anything leftover picture it either going inside that container that you developed. I don't know if you're remembering what that is. You remember your container.

477
00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.880
Jay: Yeah, the ship black and yellow ship.

478
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. X you're putting it on there and having it sail away.

479
00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, and in fact, you can even have this distancing metaphor have that ship sail slowly into the sunset. Okay. And then you are on the shore and you're with Tony or maybe it's just the dragon and you. I don't know.

480
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But you say you stay grounded on the side. Okay, and it goes off.
