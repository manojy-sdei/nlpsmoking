Richelle Direny: Me outside like it's about to rain.

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.440
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes, here it will look like it's about to rain and it doesn't

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.550
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.930
Richelle Direny: Kind of the setup right now. So, um, it's just one of those

13
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.560
Richelle Direny: It's, it's that type of weather, where the setup, it's like, Okay, it's time to go back and curl up in bed.

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.000
Donita McClintic: Yeah. Yes.

15
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.010
Donita McClintic: I agree.

16
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.860
Donita McClintic: Yeah, it's kind of chilly here and rainy looks like it's going to rain again.

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.200
Richelle Direny: Um, well, you know,

18
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:21.150
Richelle Direny: With the with the with the brain is good. So like for us it's, you don't necessarily want so much rain only because it gives you, um,

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.080
Richelle Direny: You, you can't really do a whole lot. When it's raining.

20
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.430
Richelle Direny: Right, yeah.

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.340
Richelle Direny: But then the grass likes it. The trees likes it.

22
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.630
Donita McClintic: Yeah, right. Well, right now I don't because it's kind of flooded.

23
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.700
Donita McClintic: I mean it's kind of like saturated in it.

24
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.020
Donita McClintic: But yeah

25
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.800
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I took a walk in the rain last night, I walked up to my sister's house with my little cousin Kayla, we walked up the road for dinner.

26
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.430
Richelle Direny: Hopefully, don't get sick.

27
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.720
Now,

28
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.240
Richelle Direny: Okay, let me pull up your

29
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.430
Donita McClintic: Your, your, your first meeting for today.

30
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.620
Richelle Direny: You're my young

31
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.470
Donita McClintic: Well, good.

32
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.580
Yeah.

33
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.230
Richelle Direny: Actually, you're going to be here this morning.

34
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.730
Yeah.

35
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.110
Donita McClintic: You guys still in the on the stay in place the order down there.

36
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.780
Richelle Direny: Um, so, yes. And apparently no so the state of Florida. There are places where they're

37
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.050
Richelle Direny: They're removed. They've lifted it but then the

38
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.180
Richelle Direny: Apparently,

39
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.530
Richelle Direny: The

40
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.050
Richelle Direny: There are other like with the county that I'm in. So like I'm in South Florida.

41
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.310
Richelle Direny: You look at the map, you have length of North Central and South. So I'm in the south part and here in the counties that I'm in like the

42
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:18.780
Richelle Direny: Three Southern most counties, I would say, maybe. Yeah. No, but I'm apparently we're still on what now because we still have a high number of cases and deaths.

43
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.760
Donita McClintic: And all of that. So,

44
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:29.580
Richelle Direny: But then the other piece of it is, it's like when you think about it, the other pieces in Florida is what are those States when they call it the sunshine, say for a reason.

45
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.680
Richelle Direny: They call it the sunshine state, because a lot of you get a lot of

46
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:50.760
Richelle Direny: Seasonal travelers. Yeah, especially the senior population comes to Florida in the winter so they don't have to deal with a cold. So with that being said, you also have a lot of nursing homes. You have a lot of, you know, back

47
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.600
Donita McClintic: Yeah yeah

48
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.160
Richelle Direny: And you remember in the beginning of it. You heard of

49
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.010
Richelle Direny: A lot of people were dying or your senior population in nursing homes and what have you. So

50
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.760
Richelle Direny: Now,

51
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.270
Richelle Direny: You find that, like, especially in these counties.

52
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.840
Richelle Direny: Especially in the county that I'm in in Palm Beach County. You do have a lot of nursing homes.

53
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.260
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and in Miami and and

54
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, so that well that's at least what my husband said that these three counties, at least, is still on that stay at home. Warner.

55
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.080
Yeah.

56
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:39.810
Donita McClintic: Yeah I know the Ohio. My sister's that cuz she's a nurse and she said yesterday, we went from 700 to 900 like in a day like 900 and something so

57
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.340
Richelle Direny: Here you are.

58
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.910
Donita McClintic: Yeah, yeah. And one day we went from we gained like 200 people that has died in the whole state.

59
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.380
Richelle Direny: Now, where I live, we only in my county, there was

60
00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:01.260
Donita McClintic: Two cases. But one of them already. They didn't die, but they they got through it. But so we still have one case here in our county

61
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.770
Donita McClintic: But yeah, it's scary.

62
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.840
Richelle Direny: Then so

63
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.690
Donita McClintic: The other part of it is that

64
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.180
Richelle Direny: It, which, in my opinion, to some degrees, a little bit disturbing because only because

65
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.000
Richelle Direny: You know all of the cases.

66
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.040
Richelle Direny: So there's the one thing and like I've seen this a lot like going around, is that you have people who are

67
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.760
Richelle Direny: You know, like, there's the ones that only focus on the number of deaths.

68
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:46.110
Richelle Direny: And then you have people who they are recognizing that knowledge, the number of deaths, but then they don't allow that fear to consume them when you compare it to the number which is

69
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.860
Richelle Direny: Right, a higher number of people who have recovered.

70
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.330
Donita McClintic: Right, so

71
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.680
Richelle Direny: It's a vast difference in the recovered it to the deaths.

72
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.050
Donita McClintic: Right, yeah. The news is depressing, because that's all they focus on is the desk. Yeah.

73
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.160
Richelle Direny: It's the debt and then it

74
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.960
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so it's kind of like I say to you,

75
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.720
Richelle Direny: Don Ina well don't worry about the fact that you are, you know, separated out from your husband, but then I'm all about

76
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.480
Donita McClintic: Right.

77
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.110
Richelle Direny: So like

78
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.470
Richelle Direny: I'll be fearful because it's not that bad. What

79
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.790
Richelle Direny: You know, another yeah people died again like six states.

80
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.480
Richelle Direny: Yeah, how are you going to tell me not to be fearful. But then the next thing out of your mouth is telling me how many more people die.

81
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.100
Donita McClintic: Like yeah yeah

82
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:41.970
Donita McClintic: So I would, I'm afraid of is when they start opening stuff back up is people, they think that wouldn't

83
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.780
Donita McClintic: Some people was thinking that it's over it's like it's not over. It's not ever going to be over.

84
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.980
Donita McClintic: You still have to. Yeah, so that's scary too because

85
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.710
Richelle Direny: You're gonna have to watch. But then remember now you have all these other illnesses that has

86
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.480
Richelle Direny: This

87
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.470
Richelle Direny: World is with

88
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.010
Richelle Direny: It's not without any type of any form of

89
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:18.300
Richelle Direny: Right, all of the different you have a one in one, this around, you have a bowl of ethical around Corona has also been a part of that path of building has always been around.

90
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.390
Richelle Direny: I'm sure the Spanish influence is still around.

91
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:33.060
Richelle Direny: You have the regular flu, that's still around maybe why they highlighted so much more. It's because they really don't have the treatment or the cure for it. So they don't understand it.

92
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.690
Richelle Direny: But Ryan it that they come up with vaccines and everything else. Guess what is going right into that pile of

93
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.790
Richelle Direny: illnesses that so

94
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.950
Richelle Direny: Are we without the flu know are we without a bola

95
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.950
Richelle Direny: Know, are we without Zico

96
00:07:51.450 --> 00:08:04.140
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean, we have all of its still around and we, we, and even like with the Zico with this, the whole mosquito thing and like when that came about, I don't know how it was there but like here, they really encourage women don't get pregnant. Don't get

97
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.870
Donita McClintic: Yes, yes, it was like that here too. Yeah.

98
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.850
Richelle Direny: Like don't get pregnant. Don't get pregnant because like if you get pregnant. This is just kind of how your maybe kick them out.

99
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:20.460
Richelle Direny: And I'm like okay well I just went to the grocery store the other day, and that guy looked at the exact description of what you said that person, baby. So that means that mosquito has been around.

100
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.690
Richelle Direny: For years ago.

101
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.740
Right.

102
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.070
Donita McClintic: Mosquitoes around it is cold.

103
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.140
Richelle Direny: So now.

104
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.380
Richelle Direny: You have, um, did the mosquitoes go away.

105
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.530
Richelle Direny: No, they're still here, but are we

106
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.540
Richelle Direny: In a panic over the mosquito.

107
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.550
Richelle Direny: Right, so

108
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:50.040
Richelle Direny: Yeah, especially I think you like in the summer. I know here especially I think here in the summer, like when it gets hot, and the humidity is high and all of that.

109
00:08:50.430 --> 00:09:00.540
Richelle Direny: That's especially when you get to see a lot of the mosquitoes and we're not looking at them as adults, like they over here chillin out it. So there's just so many different things. But again,

110
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:09.330
Donita McClintic: You know they were talking about the mosquitoes, like, you know, for this year. Can they if they bite. Somebody can they come and give you the corona from, you know,

111
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.340
Richelle Direny: They were

112
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:21.810
Donita McClintic: Yeah, they were talking about that on the news. One day here about, you know, could people get that from whatever. Yeah, it's been, I don't watch the news. I know.

113
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:41.160
Richelle Direny: But then again, it goes back to you have to really truly think about, like, what is it that you're because let's be honest, if a mosquito can bite me who have Corona, and then turn around and bite you. Now what if I had a Chevy

114
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.240
Richelle Direny: And if it right

115
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.820
Richelle Direny: Because remember, when they do, they suck your blood.

116
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.350
Richelle Direny: And that they came to you.

117
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.660
Richelle Direny: Right. It's the same concept.

118
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.920
Donita McClintic: Same thing. Yep.

119
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.910
Richelle Direny: It's the same car mosquito go around biting their body.

120
00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:10.710
Richelle Direny: And they might. Yeah. And then they come around and they aren't you yeah and and it's funny because they have all of these movies that they that describes like all of like when you think about Ant Man Not Ant Man like the walk. There is this one the fly. You remember that.

121
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.450
Donita McClintic: Lie. Yeah, I get help.

122
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.200
Richelle Direny: It gives you like a description of what a flight does

123
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.520
Donita McClintic: When yes

124
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:23.640
Richelle Direny: But then hey you know what a flight just pitched on my stuff. He did his business and I turned it

125
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:32.400
Richelle Direny: Now you think about if he came and he did that he, it must have that he came and regurgitated or your food, but you still turn right.

126
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:34.530
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

127
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.120
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so

128
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.390
Richelle Direny: It's like when you think that's the thing, like when you think about

129
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.610
Richelle Direny: Fear, you have to think about how fear confuses you ultimately

130
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.540
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

131
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:54.000
Richelle Direny: It confuses the crap out of you and you're so now confused that you're not really truly making rational decisions.

132
00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:07.380
Richelle Direny: Right now you're operating out of fear, which now turns into confusion. Now you're making all of these things. And if you were only supposed to stop and you're like, what

133
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.290
Richelle Direny: Is true with. It doesn't mean

134
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.230
Donita McClintic: Anything. Right. Yeah.

135
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.020
Richelle Direny: And that's just how you have to look at it because yeah

136
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:29.640
Donita McClintic: Well, my mom was talking about because she raises dogs and whatever. And she said, the dogs get a Corona shot like when you give your dog like before she would sell puppies. They get a shot for the coronavirus it might not be the same.

137
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:38.520
Donita McClintic: Like how this is like coven 19 or something, but they do get a shot for coronavirus a house come it's taking them so long and there has

138
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.390
Donita McClintic: Been some dogs.

139
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:47.610
Donita McClintic: Yeah, there has been some dogs that have it now. Like there's a family. I think in Kentucky that like to the kids have it and their dog has it.

140
00:11:48.510 --> 00:12:04.920
Richelle Direny: But then I thought that human illnesses does necessarily, I mean, I do know that get certain, but it just displays a little bit different in that, but then think about it, to think about it, when you read a lot of these things that we use a lot of it does say animal testing.

141
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.020
Donita McClintic: Yeah. Yep.

142
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:14.010
Richelle Direny: So then, remember we're using a lot of these products that says it's been animal wasn't human tested.

143
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.090
Donita McClintic: Right. I know they do a lot of monkeys. I love monkeys.

144
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.880
Donita McClintic: I said I was going to come to Florida. So I could get a monkey.

145
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.080
Richelle Direny: And you think about. That's why you have so much animal activists because of what we

146
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:36.660
Richelle Direny: Have animals we test it, but then animals and in in humans, their DNA and everything. They're just their genetic makeup is not exactly sure, there may be some similarities

147
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.920
Richelle Direny: Because I've been doing it for years, but I am sure it's not 100%

148
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.060
Donita McClintic: Right, yeah.

149
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:42.720
Yep.

150
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.590
Richelle Direny: But it just comes down to, you have to

151
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.920
Richelle Direny: It really just comes down to you having to

152
00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:02.280
Richelle Direny: Be mindful of the information that you feed yourself and how much of it you feed yourself.

153
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:02.910
Donita McClintic: Because

154
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.850
Richelle Direny: The more I feed it to you.

155
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:13.170
Richelle Direny: The more you start it takes you all always the one in the minute you get it here, like, okay. But the more I key.

156
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

157
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.040
Richelle Direny: Then you get so confused and you don't know what to believe.

158
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:23.880
Richelle Direny: Is like this. SOUND So true. That sounds so true. This sound so true. So what exactly am I listening to

159
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.180
Richelle Direny: So you guys have to for your own personal mentor.

160
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:27.750
Donita McClintic: Right.

161
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.460
Richelle Direny: Yeah, just try don't watch the

162
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:40.500
Donita McClintic: News yeah I quit watching it like a couple weeks ago is depression is yeah I know I gotta wash my hands. Don't touch my face when I'm in town, stuff like that. Like, I got it.

163
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.990
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I got that far. Yeah, exactly that. That is the truth.

164
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.650
Richelle Direny: And so it's it's it's the funniest thing because like the other night.

165
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:58.530
Richelle Direny: I finished working. I said to myself, oh. Let's, um, you know, it was really late and I'm like, I'm not about like it's not happening.

166
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.540
Richelle Direny: Like I did this whole. Well, everybody's eating cereal for dinner tonight and

167
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:10.410
Richelle Direny: I said that I said, you know, so then you know my husband said, oh, let's you know, we'll just go Wendy's and get something

168
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.370
Richelle Direny: All right, no problem with the school Wendy's and buy something off of the little $4 menu or whatever.

169
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:17.790
Yeah.

170
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:19.950
Richelle Direny: But think about it.

171
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:27.030
Richelle Direny: You only become fearful when you are knowledgeable about some things right. Yeah.

172
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.820
Richelle Direny: You're not fearful. Otherwise, you only become fearful when you're knowledgeable about something.

173
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:41.100
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but then we go on Wednesdays and the people had on the mask. Literally, this is how it was.

174
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.520
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I did. What's the point

175
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.460
Richelle Direny: Or they have it under here and

176
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.590
Richelle Direny: Then they then then they only had gloves on one hand

177
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.800
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So I'm sitting in. I'm looking at this whole transaction and I'm saying

178
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:09.030
Richelle Direny: Then they say, okay, well, the dining part is closed. So you can't come in the dining, but regardless of the fact is, you're not very protected.

179
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.100
Richelle Direny: You don't have the mask over

180
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.540
Richelle Direny: You don't have the gloves on both hands and you're not changing the gloves.

181
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.340
Donita McClintic: Right, that's the thing, changing them. Yeah. So you probably still ate cereal.

182
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.280
Richelle Direny: Because then I still went. I was there I bought this stuff and everything. So then

183
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.680
Richelle Direny: The reality of it is if you're ordering food or no matter what it is.

184
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:44.040
Richelle Direny: You say, protect yourself. But the reality is, are you truly protecting yourself. And I mean, I've heard medical professional says you know when it's when it's all said and done, the gloves has a whole lot more bacteria on it.

185
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.680
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so you're better off just washing

186
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.360
Donita McClintic: Washing your hands. Yeah.

187
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.160
Richelle Direny: Just what just wash your hands.

188
00:15:50.520 --> 00:16:00.360
Richelle Direny: Yep. And that's it. So, but, again, fear, it's like the word fear if you stop and you think about it, it's think about, you know, like I said, You're only

189
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.700
Richelle Direny: Um, you become more fearful when you get knowledge about certain

190
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.560
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Think about a baby. I learned this when I was younger. My grandmother

191
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:19.830
Richelle Direny: If a if a baby falls, the baby doesn't immediately cry when they fall it's your they look at you.

192
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.690
Richelle Direny: Yes. And you're like,

193
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.920
Richelle Direny: That one. And as soon as they see your reaction. What did they do.

194
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.080
Donita McClintic: They start crying. Yeah.

195
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:35.730
Richelle Direny: And why is it because now they got the knowledge that oh I'm supposed to be fearful. So now I'm going to start squealing

196
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:48.420
Richelle Direny: And then so, and I remember that. And I remembered it from a child, where I was something where the baby had fell on the side of the bed or something like that. And I remind remember my grandmother, she said.

197
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.110
Richelle Direny: And she's like, she starts smiling and laughing and pre that traffic, get out of the funnel that nature.

198
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.510
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I'm looking at it like I'm sure to hurt.

199
00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.040
Richelle Direny: Hurt.

200
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.880
Donita McClintic: Yeah, but that makes sense.

201
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.140
Richelle Direny: You understand

202
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:23.400
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's because of our knowledge of something we become fearful and then we act upon that fear and when we become knowledgeable of this fear we lose all sensibility to everything because I'm just thinking about whatever I'm being fed

203
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.590
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and

204
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:36.960
Donita McClintic: Well, nobody. I mean, the only yesterday in our group that one woman said that she heard her husband had had a had it like that was scary.

205
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:49.320
Donita McClintic: Like I've got not known anybody to like have been in the girl in the group. Yesterday I forget her name because that's, I mean, that's a new group for me, but she said her and her husband had it.

206
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.540
Richelle Direny: Wasn't it was talking about.

207
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.690
Donita McClintic: Our the group, we had yesterday with Dr. Jamison

208
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.160
Donita McClintic: The group.

209
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.300
Richelle Direny: The group.

210
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.550
Donita McClintic: Yeah, yeah, I was in there.

211
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.310
Richelle Direny: Thinking like you're with a group or to him I another day.

212
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.210
Richelle Direny: What did

213
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.330
Donita McClintic: We had to change it because I knew other people

214
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.500
Richelle Direny: So she changed you to the

215
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.850
Donita McClintic: Tennessee group. Yeah.

216
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.220
Richelle Direny: Okay. And somebody said that

217
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.630
Richelle Direny: Ya know, I think she

218
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.010
Richelle Direny: I thought she said that she heard her husband, they were sick. They didn't say that they had the

219
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.340
Donita McClintic: She said that she had it. That's what I thought. She said,

220
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.390
Richelle Direny: Oh, I think she

221
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.200
Donita McClintic: Was okay.

222
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.530
Richelle Direny: I think you're you're talking about you, Angela. I think

223
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.820
Donita McClintic: Maybe, yeah.

224
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.520
Donita McClintic: Yeah, one that was talking about. She watches, um,

225
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:41.160
Donita McClintic: Oh, the people on YouTube to help her get through day you guys was talking about him yesterday.

226
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.660
Donita McClintic: Yes, he was. Oh, OK. OK. OK. Yeah.

227
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.790
Richelle Direny: No, they said that they were sick, they were

228
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:51.870
Richelle Direny: Okay, we're

229
00:18:51.960 --> 00:19:01.200
Richelle Direny: Okay, I hadn't really had anyone in any group, since this started that specifically said that they've had the Chrome or they've been

230
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:09.060
Richelle Direny: So corona. I've had people say that they're really sick and they thought they had it. But when they got tested.

231
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:18.900
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it was just regular like and that's how I even learned about that they have this new flu virus that's out call influence a beat. I'm like, wow.

232
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.970
Donita McClintic: I didn't know that either.

233
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.450
Richelle Direny: What is that, so I'm

234
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:33.420
Richelle Direny: Old, but I haven't had anybody, but they've just said that they've been really sick. And that's why I said she had been really sick and she hasn't had

235
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:41.940
Richelle Direny: That's why she hasn't been in her. She said she was really sick. But either way, I mean, you know, again, I think it's just

236
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:53.940
Richelle Direny: And that's part of the reason like even in group and and everything else, like I check in with people, not so much more about, like, do you get it or not, it's more about the mental health aspect of it.

237
00:19:54.210 --> 00:20:02.970
Richelle Direny: Right. Where are you feeding yourself with don't if that is watching the news is putting stress on you. Then stop.

238
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:03.840
Richelle Direny: Right.

239
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.700
Richelle Direny: I'm not saying don't watch it at all.

240
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.040
Richelle Direny: I'm just saying. Right. And that was when I

241
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.240
Richelle Direny: See somebody else.

242
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.400
Donita McClintic: Limit and that's how I do it that. Yeah, that's exactly how I do it because

243
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:25.770
Donita McClintic: I will get consumed in it and I can't like I worry about things that I can have no control over it and I can't do it. So I I limit myself. Yep. That's exactly what I do.

244
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:39.420
Richelle Direny: And the word that she uses is absolutely important. It makes you get so consumed with things you have no control over yeah and and this is the thing and and what this has proven to all of us.

245
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:51.060
Richelle Direny: Is that we have very, very limited control. We think we have full control, but we don't because here it is that they're saying like, we don't really understand this virus.

246
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:58.680
Richelle Direny: And what do you mean you when you say that you don't really understand as far as. Think about it. You're saying to me that

247
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.940
Richelle Direny: First you're saying it was contact precautions.

248
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:19.950
Richelle Direny: Now you're saying it's airborne. So where are the mask wear gloves were all these protective devices, but now you're saying, well, we don't really know how much that's really protecting you. Because all these people that are using all of these protective gears. They're still contracting

249
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:28.200
Richelle Direny: And so now you're saying this. So now you got me on the roller coaster. Like, I don't know what, what am I really supposed to really truly do

250
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, then it comes down to what do we all know about corona.

251
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:40.590
Richelle Direny: We have very limited control, really, truly. Don't you understand

252
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:40.950
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

253
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.110
Richelle Direny: So when it's all said and done,

254
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.110
Richelle Direny: You know, for me it's trusting. It's having faith.

255
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.750
Richelle Direny: Right, that's and that's what it comes down to.

256
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.310
Richelle Direny: Having faith.

257
00:21:53.850 --> 00:22:03.540
Richelle Direny: Being positive and applying that whole word being positive in the right way, you're being you're not speaking death to anything you're speak.

258
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.290
Richelle Direny: Life life.

259
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.400
Donita McClintic: Life. Right.

260
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:11.340
Richelle Direny: You're speaking life and you're just saying you're not going to be careless.

261
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:22.950
Richelle Direny: You're going to be, you're not going to be going to wash your hands are going to practice for hygiene, you're going to do all of that, by all means you're going to do all of that, you're not going to walk around here thinking that you want touchable.

262
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.030
Right.

263
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.400
Donita McClintic: Right.

264
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.610
Richelle Direny: You know, you, you may not get grown up, but you may get something else.

265
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.740
Donita McClintic: Right, right, for sure. Yeah.

266
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:44.130
Donita McClintic: So, same thing with people with cancer. Like, wouldn't I think with people that get cancer. Like if you gotta gotta fight to. I'm not going to say to

267
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:52.140
Donita McClintic: Because there is no cure for cancer, but to like get through it like I think people that stay positive and whatever. I think they live longer.

268
00:22:52.950 --> 00:23:00.120
Donita McClintic: But wait, if you hear the word cancer, you know, a lot of people automatically give up and then it's you know my grandma died in like

269
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:15.300
Donita McClintic: Three months to the day we told her she had cancer and she was gone, but I just, yeah, I just think like I watched it thing on Patrick Swayze, the other day, and they said he had stage four pancreatic cancer. And he lived two years after he was diagnosed with that.

270
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:16.980
Donita McClintic: That's

271
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:23.250
Donita McClintic: that's unheard of. But he stayed away thought he was going to beat it. You know, he thought he was the one exception, but

272
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.540
Richelle Direny: He did so that

273
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.410
Richelle Direny: Alex Trebek.

274
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.860
Richelle Direny: So this Alex Yeah. That's right, I forgot about that. Yeah, it's

275
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:35.940
Richelle Direny: Like I'm here. And if you think that's good. Yeah, I'm you're being positive you're speaking right

276
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:43.410
Richelle Direny: Right. But you know we we do know that when I was. That's one of the most aggressive, for sure.

277
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:49.800
Richelle Direny: You may beat it. Yes. Because I've heard of people beating it but then I've also heard if it comes back.

278
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.930
Richelle Direny: Right. No, there is no

279
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.670
Richelle Direny: The hope is very limited and I've seen that where it came back in the person died.

280
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.440
Donita McClintic: Yeah yeah

281
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.590
Richelle Direny: But again, you have to

282
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.070
Richelle Direny: Hear what a person saying

283
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.530
Richelle Direny: And process it.

284
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:11.640
Richelle Direny: Because yeah, I've learned that people don't tell you the full details.

285
00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:12.870
Donita McClintic: No, they don't.

286
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:23.970
Richelle Direny: They don't listen. Think about it. I'm your child and we go to the doctor's office you step out and I stepped in. I only tell you what I want you to know. Yeah.

287
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.440
Richelle Direny: I'm not telling you everything

288
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.760
Donita McClintic: Right, yeah.

289
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:35.430
Richelle Direny: You understand and the part that I'm not telling you, maybe was key information for you to know. But you don't know that you're only going to repeat what I told you.

290
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.110
Richelle Direny: So that you're going to think oh

291
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:46.290
Richelle Direny: You know, but then hey, maybe the doctor told me I had stage four cancer and that if I had come in six months ago when I was feeling X y&z

292
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.490
Richelle Direny: I should have. But I'm not going to tell you that because then I don't want to tell. I don't want to

293
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.930
Richelle Direny: Show you my weakness, and I don't want to hear. You tell me. I told you so.

294
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.730
Donita McClintic: Yeah. Yep.

295
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:11.040
Richelle Direny: So there's so many different factors that's involved in it. So you I've learned along the way to, like, okay, you know, that's like I've had someone who's passed away of cancer, but that was their second bout of cancer.

296
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.670
Yeah.

297
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:21.150
Richelle Direny: I also know that when they were diagnosed, um, they were told we can try, but there's not a whole lot

298
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.490
Richelle Direny: That can be out. Yeah.

299
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:32.340
Richelle Direny: And so if you know if I don't say all of those key pieces you just think oh wow there is no but then hey, they've went through it before.

300
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:43.980
Richelle Direny: Right. And there's in because of the fact that they went through it before and they went through everything. Their body can't with the second about their body cannot sustain the degree of treatment.

301
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:55.470
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that was once given because of whatever the situation and so therefore the second time around. They were not able to beat it because they weren't able to get the degree of treatment or the

302
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.570
Richelle Direny: Level of treat and they got the first time.

303
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.640
Donita McClintic: Yeah. Cuz that's those tears, your body down

304
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.180
Richelle Direny: Yes. Here's your body gambling down so your body can't handle it again.

305
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:09.750
Richelle Direny: Right. So now this person passed the when you're think little see up there that proves to me that you can't be cancer. No.

306
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.950
Richelle Direny: That's right.

307
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.180
Richelle Direny: They couldn't beat it. It's that they've had it before and their body can't

308
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.470
Richelle Direny: Sustain the same treatment that it did the first time and

309
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.160
Richelle Direny: So,

310
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.950
Richelle Direny: You know, so those are key things. So that's why you learn

311
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.030
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

312
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.700
Richelle Direny: You just have to learn

313
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:35.310
Richelle Direny: You learn you remember I tell you in life. You're learning so much. You're always learning you're learning from different people. But in your learning

314
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:47.190
Richelle Direny: It stopping and really process when a person is saying and just start applying that God given ability to really try to make sense out of things like you know

315
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:55.740
Richelle Direny: Yeah, even make sense. And how do you know if something makes sense. There's that inner man. That same to some don't seem right about when she just said.

316
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:10.470
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you know, I mean something right there's that internal person is saying, Donna. You know, I'm not. I'm old. I want to drink. Everything that person says, you know, because there's something doesn't seem listen to that because if you listen to that.

317
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.900
Richelle Direny: inner man is going to take you down the path for you to find the truth. If you're willing

318
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.920
Richelle Direny: To learn it.

319
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:28.230
Donita McClintic: Yeah. Yep. I believe that with everything like my stomach. My gut tells me everything I need to know. Yeah, I learned that a long time ago, this to the guy.

320
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.180
Donita McClintic: Cuz it's telling. Yeah, yeah.

321
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.500
Richelle Direny: You're right that would they say that it's a mother's intuition we gotta you know you don't worry

322
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.300
Donita McClintic: Yeah. Yep.

323
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.170
Richelle Direny: Don't worry, I got

324
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.210
Donita McClintic: That too. Yeah, yeah.

325
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:43.620
Donita McClintic: I have that also

326
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.160
Richelle Direny: So it's, um,

327
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.760
Donita McClintic: You know, if I try to say yesterday, I just tried to see the good in everything, because I've

328
00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:06.870
Donita McClintic: Focused on the negative and the bad for so long. I just, I don't want to do that anymore because it doesn't get you anywhere. It doesn't get you anywhere so I will try to find the good in something and focus on that.

329
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:20.880
Donita McClintic: And that's how I've been doing since well here since I left my husband. Anyway, I've been doing a whole lot better. I mean, I feel great. It's just, I love it. It's a totally different. I feel like I'm a different person.

330
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:29.520
Richelle Direny: That so that definitely sounds like it's it's your how it's helping you to build your self confidence and one of your goals.

331
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:30.840
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

332
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:39.750
Richelle Direny: So let's talk a little bit about I know yesterday. Like, even in group now that you said that I remember when you were about to share, we just tried to look at the good in everything.

333
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:46.440
Richelle Direny: To me it seemed like your spirit was just a down a little bit, as if you had like a challenging day yesterday.

334
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.690
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I did.

335
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.640
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so

336
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.590
Richelle Direny: A little bit more about that.

337
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.370
Donita McClintic: Just my okay my son's dad.

338
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:08.010
Donita McClintic: He got into an argument with his other son, and he's kind of like came out here and stayed at my mom's for a few days or whatever. And he just getting on my nerves. So

339
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.960
Donita McClintic: I just get aggravated with it so

340
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:17.820
Richelle Direny: Just that this is not sure this is not, this is not my husband. No.

341
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:34.200
Donita McClintic: No, it's not my husband, but we were together for 10 years or something like that. And he's still like my best friend them. We are. I could tell him anything, but I think that since he thinks I'm not with my husband anymore that he

342
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.170
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I'm like, no.

343
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.470
Donita McClintic: No, that didn't work.

344
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.330
Donita McClintic: That many years ago, we're not doing that now.

345
00:29:44.460 --> 00:30:00.720
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so just that kind of stuff was gone. I mean, just trying to figure all that out. And, you know, wanting to help him but he's he's trying to get an apartment. But there's a process and where you can't get. I don't know. So that was what was yesterday, but

346
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.200
Richelle Direny: Seemed like there was a little

347
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:10.590
Richelle Direny: Damn financier I was also I was also new in the group. So I was kinda try a little bit

348
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.220
Yeah.

349
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.850
Donita McClintic: Shy because I was new to the group.

350
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.320
Donita McClintic: Okay, yeah.

351
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.930
Richelle Direny: And so what about um

352
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:33.090
Richelle Direny: Now I know you said like, even though you guys are friends because one of the things that you that you on that you said that I highlighted I recommended that you put what was saying that I told you to put down as your own daily reminder

353
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.730
Donita McClintic: That I want I choose life and I want to live.

354
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.660
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

355
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.040
Donita McClintic: And I got it.

356
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.590
Richelle Direny: And that's

357
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:50.850
Richelle Direny: When you really think about your situation in your circumstance. That's a loaded statement because every decision and everything that you do.

358
00:30:51.450 --> 00:31:06.090
Richelle Direny: has to come from what that line means to you not to everybody else but to you, Donny, because you know what your yesterday, looks like you know what your storm was when you were in it.

359
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:17.700
Richelle Direny: And now that you're seeing the path, a little bit clear, you're saying in this path that you can see I'm choosing life, which means that I'm choosing me

360
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.760
Donita McClintic: Yeah yeah

361
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:26.220
Richelle Direny: And that's simply what that first part of it. I'm choosing life means that I'm choosing me

362
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:39.660
Richelle Direny: I want to live means that I want to experience life. I want to see what life has to offer. The ups and the downs, whatever it is. I want to see that. And I want to invoice it

363
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:40.710
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

364
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:51.630
Richelle Direny: And so anyone that comes in my path if they're not helping me choose me and to lift me up. You don't really belong here.

365
00:31:52.170 --> 00:32:04.590
Donita McClintic: Right. Yeah. And he kind of brings me down because I know how he feels and whatever. And I don't feel that way. And then I seemed like sitting over there side and whatever. And I'm like, I can't do that like

366
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:16.710
Donita McClintic: You're bringing me down you go out to do. Yeah, so I'm kind of like in a spot there. But other than that, I mean I've talked to him about it but

367
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:18.870
Donita McClintic: I just can't.

368
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:31.140
Richelle Direny: But if you're a we're that he is for where you are and what you're working on, because what are the your, your other goals. You did say was working on the relationship with your parents.

369
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.800
Donita McClintic: Parents

370
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:54.540
Richelle Direny: Yeah we building that relationship. So that also comes along with that statement of I am choosing life because choosing life choosing repairing that relationship with your parents. And so you're aware that, you know, we're friends. We have a child. Together we have history together.

371
00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.630
Richelle Direny: But at the same time right now in this place that I am in repairing me

372
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:16.710
Richelle Direny: Um, I find that you and whatever is going on with you is making me sad and depressed or whatever. So then therefore I've accepted that walking away is okay.

373
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.760
Yeah.

374
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.100
Donita McClintic: Yeah, that's good.

375
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.540
Donita McClintic: Yeah, that's what I need to do. I lost my pin.

376
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.800
Donita McClintic: And I got it right.

377
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.120
Donita McClintic: I'm a writer. I take notes.

378
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:41.010
Donita McClintic: I got back through these notes. I will. I'll go. It's like, because we see each other every two weeks. Yeah, why don't have another moment I go back through my notes and it. Yeah.

379
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:51.660
Richelle Direny: It literally is being aware of how something or someone is making you feel being aware of the emotions is what you're becoming aware of

380
00:33:52.350 --> 00:34:12.720
Richelle Direny: I'm having this emotion, what is causing me to have this emotion, being aware of it and accepting and being okay with the decision that you made if it means walking away from a person if it means saying that I cannot be a part of this situation, it's being okay with that.

381
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:17.700
Richelle Direny: Exciting you being okay with it. Because what are you choosing

382
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.740
Donita McClintic: Life. I'm choosing me

383
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.930
Donita McClintic: That's it, yeah. Now,

384
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.250
Richelle Direny: Does it make you a very, it doesn't make you selfish or self centered or mean

385
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:27.300
Donita McClintic: Know,

386
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.100
Richelle Direny: Who says that choosing a

387
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.320
Donita McClintic: Night. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care if it does, because I'm yeah I'm allowed to

388
00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:40.110
Donita McClintic: To feel that way about myself and ultimately this is what choosing me says

389
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.810
Richelle Direny: I want to learn how to love me.

390
00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:44.160
Right.

391
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:45.750
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

392
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.800
Donita McClintic: That was I've done that for a long time there. Yeah.

393
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.180
Richelle Direny: Into motion.

394
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:51.900
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

395
00:34:52.380 --> 00:35:04.170
Donita McClintic: A long time. Right, I'm starting to yeah but it's been a long time. I've been hard on myself for a long time and I haven't. You're the first person that I've opened up to about it and

396
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:20.010
Donita McClintic: And I feel so much better. It's like I could breathe. Like, that's how I feel like it just, yeah. When I first told you about like the overdose and stuff. I've not talked to know what about that. And for years and you're the first one and it made me feel so much better.

397
00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:21.960
Like, like you said,

398
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:34.830
Donita McClintic: Yeah, yeah. That's how I feel. And I've talked to my mom about it. The artist. I do we being honest and open with people is so much better. Like, yeah.

399
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.990
Richelle Direny: It's like a little came off your back. Right.

400
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:48.060
Donita McClintic: Yes, yes. And it's so I mean, it's so much easier. Being honest than it is to try to keep things from people. Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking before. But yeah, it is so much better.

401
00:35:49.110 --> 00:36:04.770
Richelle Direny: Think about what we do is we have, you have this book bag on your back. That's kind of the analogy that I think about you have this book bag on your end, you have all these heavy books in your. I don't know if you were when you were a kid, they had, they would give you all this crap.

402
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:05.730
Donita McClintic: In your book bag and

403
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.170
Richelle Direny: Pork is walking like

404
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:07.830
Okay, yeah.

405
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:10.890
Richelle Direny: Sure, yeah.

406
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.640
Richelle Direny: Break your back.

407
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.330
Richelle Direny: And so as you take out all the stuff what happens

408
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.580
Richelle Direny: You go from this to

409
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:39.270
Richelle Direny: And it's just, yeah. Oh my God, I feel so much better. And that's, like, as you're unloading, all of these things that you've had stored up in this bag, like you said, I'm now being honest, I'm sharing my truth and even though somebody may react to my truth but it's my truth.

410
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.470
Donita McClintic: And my day is

411
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:51.630
Richelle Direny: Setting me free. And that's what's important, because it's my truth and I want to be set free because ultimately what your truth does it builds your self confidence.

412
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:53.340
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

413
00:36:53.370 --> 00:37:06.090
Richelle Direny: It decreases. A lot of that social anxiety that you have your start working on repairing those very meaningful relationships for you, your parents, your children, and whoever else that you find to be important in life.

414
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:14.130
Richelle Direny: But, you know, ultimately, it teaches you how to love you and then loving you is ultimately saying I'm choosing me

415
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:15.240
Yeah.

416
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.260
Donita McClintic: Yeah. And then that's good for everybody around me.

417
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.920
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's good for everybody around you.

418
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.370
Yeah.

419
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.300
Richelle Direny: And look at you, loving you says

420
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.510
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like

421
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:32.640
Richelle Direny: You want

422
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.730
Richelle Direny: Me to love you but then how can I love you when you don't even know how to love you.

423
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:39.840
Donita McClintic: Though right

424
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.780
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you understand

425
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:53.460
Richelle Direny: Yeah. You want me to love you. This way, but then when I do it, you have an issue with it. Well then love me this way, but when I do you have any. So that's the second says don't need to do your love you.

426
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:54.720
Yeah.

427
00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.090
Richelle Direny: You're like, Well, no, with it, how you expect me to meet your needs. When you don't even know how to do it.

428
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.500
Richelle Direny: You're either so

429
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.110
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and that's honestly

430
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.880
Richelle Direny: So you

431
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.780
Richelle Direny: I saw like on your headline.

432
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.610
Richelle Direny: I choose me bash. I love me.

433
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.800
Donita McClintic: All right.

434
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:21.990
Richelle Direny: Every day danita. I love you. So, therefore, our choose you.

435
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:33.450
Richelle Direny: I want to live. And that means that I want to experience what loving me feels like

436
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:45.270
Richelle Direny: What loving me looks like because when you do that, it's going to help you to get through each of your goals with an understand

437
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:59.940
Richelle Direny: The true meaning of each of your goals building yourself confidence working on that relationship is meaningful relationships in life. And once you start doing all of that you'll find that your dependency on anything.

438
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:14.850
Richelle Direny: will dissipate. It's not going to just like all jump up and just walk away. No, you're going to slowly not have the desire and the taste for all of these things that you were once addicted to

439
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:20.730
Donita McClintic: Right, yeah, I can see it's getting gloomier behind you. Yeah, okay.

440
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.710
Richelle Direny: Got a real dorky

441
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.260
Donita McClintic: Yeah, your sunshine went away.

442
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.180

445
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:51.240

446
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.040
Donita McClintic: Yep, yep.

447
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.690
Richelle Direny: So,

448
00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:02.100
Donita McClintic: I know I was early signing and then I went, let the dog out well by accident. He kind of ran out the door.

449
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:05.490
Donita McClintic: Yeah, but

450
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.870
Richelle Direny: I was getting

451
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.580
Richelle Direny: Out how is it good enough now.

452
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:16.530
Donita McClintic: You know what here everybody. It's like, there is no I mean I can. You mean, like, how do I feel

453
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:33.540
Donita McClintic: I feel better. It doesn't like if I think about it. Then I like you know I hold back. I don't want to go or whatever. But if I just do it down. All right, I'm okay. Like, I don't get. I don't have the anxiety and whatever, like I did have in the beginning.

454
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.220
Donita McClintic: Like I just go

455
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:43.410
Donita McClintic: Yeah, like if I think about it. Then I kinda, you know, and I'm not gonna go. But if I just do it then.

456
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:44.730
Richelle Direny: You're okay.

457
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.210
Richelle Direny: And we think about it, what do you think happens when you think about it.

458
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:58.110
Donita McClintic: I just I make my worry myself over stuff that I don't even know if it's going to be yeah over, I don't know, over the dumbest stuff like

459
00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.520
Donita McClintic: There's gonna be too many people

460
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:13.080
Donita McClintic: Just start. I don't know why I do it. But that's why I try to tell my son. I'm like, Austin. I just like I have the social anxiety also not as bad as he does, but I was like, you have to just do wait

461
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:22.260
Donita McClintic: You mean, if you don't start somewhere. You're going to be here forever. So that's what I do. I just, I try not to think about it. And I just go like

462
00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:27.060
Donita McClintic: This has to be done. So I have to do it. So that's how I've been

463
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:44.610
Donita McClintic: I trick my mind like I tell myself things a lot like when I used to get high. If I didn't have anything that day I would tell myself. I'm one day closer to getting something instead of focusing on. I didn't have anything today. I looked at on one day closer to getting something now.

464
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:52.980
Richelle Direny: RIGHT HERE. WHAT SO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT JUST TELLS ME. It tells me you have the ability to speak life you have

465
00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:53.730
Richelle Direny: The ability

466
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.690
To

467
00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:12.780
Richelle Direny: What does that say use reverse psychology on yourself to adjust the way you think you have the a bit you have that natural ability to do that. Somewhere along the line you it kind of like, you know, those cartoons. Back in the day, the little evil.

468
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.120
Donita McClintic: You and the little good yeah yeah

469
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:28.470
Richelle Direny: And just think we all have. We all have that. Just think about that we all have it. So then you, you have to, it means that we have the we do the self talks so like that little good you is that positive speaking positive

470
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:39.000
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and wife, and then that other one is speaking negativity and often times the negativity speaks much louder than the positivity.

471
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.360
Richelle Direny: Whether the positive. He's just saying, hey, Donnie Yen, like, you know,

472
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:50.790
Richelle Direny: Think about it for right now, you have to go to the store for your mom and then with the social anxiety. You're like, oh, there's going to be too much people

473
00:42:51.420 --> 00:43:04.620
Richelle Direny: That's what the negative thinking is going to say there's going to be two people. And remember this, and it's going to give you all, you know, positive use gonna say, I'm gonna, you know, Corona out there. So, ain't nobody store.

474
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.110
Donita McClintic: Right, right.

475
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:13.380
Richelle Direny: Positivity is like corona is out there ain't nobody at the store.

476
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.820
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so just go

477
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:15.930
Donita McClintic: Back.

478
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:29.760
Richelle Direny: And but that's it. That's all the same. But then this other part is just giving you all of these different reasons why you shouldn't be and how you can get sick and you remember on the news. It said so many people died and blah, blah, blah. This that any other

479
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.980
Richelle Direny: But then the positive view is saying.

480
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.170
Richelle Direny: It's just milk.

481
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:35.790
Richelle Direny: The milk.

482
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.680
Richelle Direny: Right, come back home and abroad.

483
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.820
Richelle Direny: Yes verified. It's seven o'clock in the morning and nobody out there, right.

484
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.170
Richelle Direny: You understand

485
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:59.490
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and so you have those natural ability to do it. It's just allowing elevate that elevate your ability to think positively elevate your ability to speak life to yourself, because ultimately

486
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:11.580
Richelle Direny: You're going back to your I choose me and I choose life and in choosing life. I will not allow negative thinking to bring me down.

487
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:13.110
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

488
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:19.500
Donita McClintic: Yep, that's how I mean that's another. That's crazy. I used to think that that way.

489
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:35.370
Donita McClintic: When I quit methadone I you know I quit cold turkey after 18 months I just quit and I was fine. But then I mean I had to move away because I knew if I, you know, if I felt sick. I could go somewhere and get something in fi, but

490
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:43.860
Donita McClintic: I just would tell myself, you know, I'm not sick. I don't feel bad, you know, in 10 minutes something different.

491
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:52.350
Donita McClintic: But that's how I I mean a lot of its physical, but most of its mental and that's, yeah. Yeah.

492
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:53.820
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

493
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.010
Richelle Direny: And the physical because the physical

494
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.200
Donita McClintic: Brings about the physical, yes.

495
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.020
Donita McClintic: Yep. Yeah, and

496
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.760
Richelle Direny: And I think it's just one of those, yes, you want to change your, your

497
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.570
Richelle Direny: The people you're hanging out with you want to change a lot

498
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.130
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but I think ultimately the person who really needs changing is the individual

499
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:23.640
Richelle Direny: Right. Because, yeah. Hey, you might say, you know, I need to move out of Ohio and I'm going to come to Florida, because there's a lot of drugs in Ohio. So what you think you could why why

500
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.680
Richelle Direny: Hey, George is not in Florida.

501
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.630
Donita McClintic: Right, yeah.

502
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.600
Richelle Direny: And the West Palm because ain't nothing

503
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.350
Richelle Direny: It is the capital of work which I talked them out.

504
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:35.790
Donita McClintic: Right, yeah.

505
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:46.320
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So yeah, so so you find we find ourselves running away from ourselves, but the very thing that you're running away from you know it's right, which you all the

506
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.550
Donita McClintic: Time. Yes. Yeah.

507
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.790
Richelle Direny: Wakes up with you. It goes to sleep with you. It gets in the shower with you, it goes

508
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:58.440
Richelle Direny: Everywhere with you so that the person that needs. The thing that needs to change the individual that needs to change is the person you're looking at

509
00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.820
Donita McClintic: Right now. Yep.

510
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:10.410
Richelle Direny: Because you're always gonna, I remember I used to work in a treatment center. And I remember a lot of people would say, like when they're coming like say you're in Hawaii or you're coming to Florida for treatment.

511
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:22.080
Richelle Direny: And they will say, you know, as soon as I got off the plane, somebody came up to me and they try to offer me and I'm like, Well, how did they and they said it's just something like it's almost like they know

512
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.400
Donita McClintic: They know yeah

513
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:37.050
Richelle Direny: They know how is it like I hate they like, I don't know what just they know. So here it is, you left, Ohio, because it's the best thing for you to get away from the people and from the area and this that and what did you do

514
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.160
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

515
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:43.320
Richelle Direny: Hand delivered yourself into something so it has nothing to do all the time.

516
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:51.390
Richelle Direny: With where you are. It's about you. And are you willing to face those demons are you willing to change here.

517
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:52.830
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

518
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:58.740
Richelle Direny: Because the minute you do that the minute you build your self confidence. The minute you decide to choose you.

519
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:14.700
Richelle Direny: The minute you choose to love yourself, it means that I love myself enough that this outer garment. I need to love this outer garment and if I love this outer garment. I don't like how this article arm. It looks because of the things that I'm putting in this outer garment.

520
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:19.620
Richelle Direny: Right, and therefore I'm going to start working on how I treat this outer garment.

521
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:21.270
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

522
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:26.070
