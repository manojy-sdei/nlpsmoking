00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Wayne Dalton

2
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

3
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me get a note for us keep track of what we're doing.

4
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything sort of significant sort of right on your mind right now that sort of leads our attention.

5
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.950
Wayne Dal: No, just like stuff I was talking about yesterday.

6
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it seems like you are feeling pretty strongly

7
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I was noticing.

8
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.800
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

9
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.370
Wayne Dal: It was, it was nice to be in a new group.

10
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.160
Wayne Dal: New faces like I knew a teak

11
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

12
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.920
Wayne Dal: It was nice just to

13
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.590
Wayne Dal: See some new faces.

14
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
Wayne Dal: But yeah, it was just some stuff I had to get off my chest yesterday.

15
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's more to it than that. You guys don't get much time what's been going on.

16
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.430
Wayne Dal: Really just the same old stuff. It just been really hard.

17
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.360
Wayne Dal: Like, you know, just being here, most of the time.

18
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.890
Wayne Dal: And I think the smoking the veins really getting to me.

19
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.730
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

20
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.830
Wayne Dal: Lack of VPN cuz I really thought about what you said yesterday and

21
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.150
Wayne Dal: You know, I don't have that getting it ready and in doing what I have to do.

22
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.010
Wayne Dal: To be and get a good flavor and you know it was always in my hand, you know, or close by.

23
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.960
Wayne Dal: And it just, I don't get the satisfaction. I used to, you know, with the patches.

24
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.470
Wayne Dal: So I think that's

25
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.040
Wayne Dal: Kind of been a big issue.

26
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so too. And, and are you seeing the connection between that and

27
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't want to continue the tapering and it's connected or yes well well now I don't want to do this other thing too. You know, it was moving along fine.

28
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.270
Wayne Dal: Yeah I after yesterday I do, I really didn't think about it till after yesterday.

29
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.380
Wayne Dal: When it's not like God. You know, I want to continue to taper. But it's, it seems like it's getting harder.

30
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.210
Wayne Dal: You know,

31
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.650
Wayne Dal: Understand the connection. There's because I'm missing something else.

32
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll leave it. We're not gonna, we're not going to pull that away and right away. We're not even going to pull it down, we'll just stay there. What if we just stay there for a month. Even and we start adding things that meet the underlying need

33
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

34
00:03:46.080 --> 00:04:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so hopefully that helps with some of the NX but let's look at some of the things that, um, let's just start with that. That feeling part your home. Are you home. How many hours a day.

35
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.420
Wayne Dal: Well, last week, part time. So every other day. So really Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

36
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.050
Wayne Dal: I'm trying to get back into the office.

37
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.260
Wayne Dal: for probably about three or four hours.

38
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.830
Wayne Dal: You know, I don't have very much work to do at the office.

39
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.090
Wayne Dal: Right, so, you know, I try to stretch it out as much as I can.

40
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're at the office of. Let me just ask this question when you're out the office. How many times are you distracted by

41
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I wish I was the thing I don't have a vapor in my hand. Does it happen for those three hours.

42
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.410
Wayne Dal: No, no.

43
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.540
Wayne Dal: No occasion, it will, but it's not something I think about constantly because my mind is occupied.

44
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.830
That's right.

45
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.520
Wayne Dal: So let's not forget what I really want. I really miss it is when

46
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.480
Wayne Dal: I finished something that's when I used to go outside and take a little break.

47
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.460
Wayne Dal: Yep, so you know that that's when I think about it like when I finished a project or or something. I'm supposed to finish.

48
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.220
Wayne Dal: That's when I think about it.

49
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.850
That's

50
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.260
I know

51
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I say, some say we're over overlapping a little bit. Um, you want you set up is a dope mean reinforcement. Oh, I'll work hard and then I'll get my reward after my task you set it up in your brain.

52
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it will take. I think some effort, but I think you're going to be able to change that. So let's, we need to think of things that maybe not automatically won't come to mind that can be something that can feel rewarding after a task.

53
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

54
00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.720
Wayne Dal: One thing. One thing I've done a couple 10 just go for a walk around the block. Okay.

55
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Even at work you've been able to. Okay, great. So round them up.

56
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well can you raining or a bad weather instead of the walk. What can we do

57
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.070
Wayne Dal: It's kind of difficult there if it would be raining or something at work.

58
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you have your own us with a closed door.

59
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.400
Wayne Dal: No, no, to an open area. Me and another girl in the back.

60
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a favorite YouTube of comedian.

61
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.220
Wayne Dal: No, but I like getting on.

62
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.690
Wayne Dal: YouTube and looking at

63
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.930
Wayne Dal: Stuff like hot wheels and stuff like that.

64
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:54.450
Wayne Dal: Or like the NFL page or an MBA page just to read up on on the teams that I support.

65
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do your tasks. Exactly. And at the same time. So here's my thinking. So you were corrected. I'm going to say something and you have to sort of see if you can make this fit.

66
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So I worked for three hours a day I go in at noon. So at 3pm my alarm goes off and it says, Go check NFL silly videos. My alarm goes off, it's labeled that way. And I do it. In fact, I do it 10 minutes before three

67
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's already in place. I'm already doing it so that I'm getting ahead of that end of the day thing I'm already because you have a little bit of a self managed day yours isn't exactly right. You get some say on your day don't

68
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:40.680
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

69
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:55.800
Wayne Dal: And it's not like you know my tasks. Don't get finished at a certain time every day. It all depends on what I'm working on. So, you know, I could go in the task that I'm working on takes me the whole entire time work, you know,

70
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's. Well, think about it. So what you started today with this does take some real concentration

71
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You at the end of the task will go

72
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there something that you do at the end of the task. Does it always 99% of the time and with an email to someone that you're done, does someone else know that you're done with your tasks.

73
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.530
Wayne Dal: Yeah, my wife.

74
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there we found something so you're going do you do that before you go smoke or did you use to

75
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.400
Wayne Dal: Oh yeah, I'll tell her that I'm done with whatever

76
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We just found one. So we actually have something that's in place right before the the previous ritual of smoking, which is that which is that email. So I'm next to

77
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The computer somewhere, you're going to have

78
00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Email wife, and you can even tell your wife when I email. I'm going to go watch a funny video to replace my ritual of a thing.

79
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we're going to come up with something else to do, too, but it wouldn't hurt to tell her. Hey sweetheart. Could you remind me to go do my

80
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: My replacement cast myself Sue's cast so that I don't smoke because you're going to need to get all the troops self in here if she's into it. If she's if this isn't really another relationship works and then don't ask.

81
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.970
Wayne Dal: Yeah, sure.

82
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure honey. Okay, so when you get my email at the end of the day for the task. That's my. Oh, hey, you know, could you say, Hey, sweetie. Go, go.

83
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a quick yoga stretch and then you and I will play with what that task might be one of them might be the NFL of videos, etc. But I want to get a little bit into things that you do with your hands.

84
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

85
00:09:53.490 --> 00:10:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know we're going to get creative. Okay, what what what's so normalized about making

86
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is killing you. So that's not cute. Um, so let's talk about other things that could replace it next to my desk. I will make sure all my nails are filed. I'm going to list them out. You just keep keep coming up with ideas.

87
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: On mindfulness. I'm going to make sure that my fingers are clipped I'll make sure I lotion my fingers. I'll check my cuticles.

88
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What else could we be doing with hands.

89
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.580
Wayne Dal: I have actual couple of fidget spinners at work.

90
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: fidget spinner. I have dental floss I'll run through every teeth on hands. You've got teeth.

91
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have. Is it a snack time to, by any chance, right at that time.

92
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's an excellent work. Let's see, what else can people do. Um, I wish you kind of had like some sort of

93
00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a coffee or some sort of special juice concoction tea that you would make that you could be doing

94
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. You could, like, why, yeah.

95
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.780
Wayne Dal: I could make, you know, a

96
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.180
Wayne Dal: Tea or something like that, because we do have a

97
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.710
Wayne Dal: Kitchen at work.

98
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.830
Wayne Dal: So it could be something like that.

99
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have the tea bag you have everything you're going to need to get that in there.

100
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like to just fit on one of the reasons why I like things like an emery board things that will be in your hand.

101
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: My concern is, you have to walk all the way over to the tea. I guess what I'm looking for something that's right here in your hand so I kind of like fidget spinner. I like that. But I also want something where, like, I almost wish you had a tiny little

102
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I say

103
00:11:50.430 --> 00:12:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish you had a little model box car that you can put together. I wish you had a little thing that you could busy your hands if you putting together. It doesn't take long only takes a couple minutes, but you put it together, kind of like how you know Rubik's cubes are

104
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.360
Wayne Dal: Your have a Rubik's Cube can take to work.

105
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, some either

106
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.260
Uh huh.

107
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What else can people do right there in front of them.

108
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do a quick internet search and see if I mean this has to be something everybody's doing like all the time. Let's just say

109
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.990
Wayne Dal: I like the idea

110
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.130
Yep.

111
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh tips to keep your hands and melt busy. That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

112
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, okay, let me see what they say in here.

113
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.410
Wayne Dal: Is that what you do.

114
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

115
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's what they

116
00:12:52.680 --> 00:13:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: snacking pretzel sticks carrot sticks sticks hummus salsa. Alright, so what do they have they have those are food things. What about

117
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wow, little thing. Oh, what about a little game a super brainless game like cut the rope on your phone. What about that.

118
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.360
Wayne Dal: Because yeah yeah I can get

119
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.200
Wayne Dal: I can do that.

120
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But the rope is look at the finger, you're actually using your finger just swoosh swoosh and you're concentrating

121
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.260
Wayne Dal: Cut the Rope on my phone, but I can get it.

122
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, it's so cute.

123
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And it gets harder and harder because you have to get the angle like once you cut the rope. It's really adorable. So, you know,

124
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So, this thing's going like this. There's a swinging growth and it depends on where you cut it then gravity will either pop, it'll drop down over here. But if you cut it too soon for that it won't work. So you got to know just when to cut this rope. It's

125
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:53.580
It's cute.

126
00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't take that much like concentration mean for me. It does. I'm not so great in geometry, but my kids do well on it.

127
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But I like that one. That one's a nice one. When I just want to like space out

128
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, toothpicks having cinnamon stick having a making some go online make cinnamon sticks have them nearby and that sits in your mouth when young, young, young, young because it's a real sharp taste.

129
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously, uh, let's

130
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: See what about what we talked about

131
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously,

132
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: No way to interchange a nicotine gum like that to have a ritual.

133
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.910
Wayne Dal: I could

134
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.100
Wayne Dal: I actually have some pouches.

135
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.380
Wayne Dal: That I bought two, but I think would would work a little better.

136
00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.450
Wayne Dal: As far as what we're talking about, I think, to keep my mouth busy.

137
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.300
Wayne Dal: Working

138
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: At the squishy ball, you know, the stressful fidget spinner. You already have that a yo yo Fidget Cube. He wants something a bit more adult bit less than a Fidget spinner, yo. Yo, you can buy specifically diet designed Fidget Cube, you can actually get one.

139
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was my first little query and we got pencil stressful through yo yo fishing toy.

140
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have, I would say, having at your side, something like like the carrot something because straws environmentally friendly anymore. So we really can't have those for animals but celery, a carrot handy I'm even getting um

141
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I don't know if you're doing the one where you say,

142
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do this for 90 seconds. I just have 90 seconds. I'm just going to go 90 seconds and that I would have like all over the place. And that's the piece of it also send your wife. So it would be something like this.

143
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll have something printed you'll have an alarm set and it'll be

144
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So 90 seconds and you can go, go do a routine go do routine routine is going to be, what, what do you think your first routine, even for a week might be

145
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.710
Wayne Dal: Well, I like, I like to walking Gil.

146
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

147
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.980
Wayne Dal: That's my first choice is to just get up and

148
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it email then walk or walk then email.

149
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.500
Wayne Dal: It would be emailed him walk

150
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: On it. So, but that's specifically want to write that down. You want to have that up there, email, walk

151
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:59.700
Wayne Dal: Up to us like finishing whatever I'm finished and telling me why from finished and went for a walk you back in a few

152
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then you come back, and then what happens

153
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.500
Wayne Dal: And then I started my next my next task.

154
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about these other things that we're talking about.

155
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.300
Wayne Dal: Could do

156
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:23.340
Wayne Dal: Either or, you know, I could make some tea or just mess around my fidget spinner or any of these

157
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.030
Wayne Dal: Ideas that we came up with.

158
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

159
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.120
Wayne Dal: But then usually what usually when I'm

160
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:30.930
You know,

161
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:36.180
Wayne Dal: Usually when I'm done. And I would take my walk I be ready to come back in and

162
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Write

163
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.510
Wayne Dal: it some more. So

164
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What's important. This may seem over simplified, but having this list written down, having it so that it's ready at home to

165
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to need these things because you're not remembering them, you're just thinking

166
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what I used to do. So I'm thinking about thinking about it, thinking about now think about now instead of

167
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: These other you just got to go that 90 seconds at home, for example, it's a little easier for you at work, but at home. It's I've got to go. I only have to get through this 90 seconds. But in that 90 seconds you go look at your list. So if you could write a list make tea fidget spinner.

168
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Make cinnamon a tooth parents

169
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Cut the Rope you get

170
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: YouTube be what's going to happen is you're going to need to see these things in writing, you're going to see them.

171
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to go do them and then time will have passed and you will have made it through that craving. Yeah. Because really it truly happens after we get past those 90 seconds in an hour has passed, and then we're like, oh, now I'm immersed in something else, then you could say.

172
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, the higher order ones are learning something new that's going to be, you know, getting on one of those brain.

173
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Brain Games are you really are using having to really, really use your brain. I don't know. Do you have any of those on your on your phone.

174
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Once a challenge.

175
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:16.320
Wayne Dal: I know, but I really got I really love this game called 3D sniper

176
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

177
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.620
Wayne Dal: I really like and man I could spend like an hour, an hour and a half on it easy.

178
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I have listed, you're going to need this on a sticky. A couple stickies email.

179
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Entity then fidget spinner make cinnamon sticks. Cut the Rope

180
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.330

Gwenevere Abriel: Video 3D sniper

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You could also, I don't know what you can do on your phone around like, pick up, pick a video and edit it like turned it in like a cute little kid video. You could edit the video and send it to someone cute.

183
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What's neat about that is you're using your fingers.

184
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.090
Wayne Dal: You have

185
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.140
Wayne Dal: One of those apps or I can edit the picture and put all kinds of stuff in there.

186
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me get back in your notes here.

187
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Group that you were sharing some emotional things around.

188
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, regret was I was an alcoholic. That's something I would have done differently. I mean, you went deep, you know, how is that coming up for you in your life these days.

189
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:53.520
Wayne Dal: I don't know, it's just, it's something I think about, you know, sometimes

190
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.650
Wayne Dal: You just, if I could have done differently and

191
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.610
Wayne Dal: Like if I could have been in the place I am now back, you know, then

192
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:17.040
Wayne Dal: Things might have turned out a little bit better with my kids, not that. My kids are bad kids or anything, but, you know, kind of had all his issues and problems and

193
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.420
Wayne Dal: Sometimes I think I pushed them away. And maybe that they had to get away from me.

194
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:32.250
Wayne Dal: If that makes sense. You know, I mean, like, they all they all moved out God team and

195
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.150
Wayne Dal: Sometimes I think maybe they got it. They had to do it to get away from me.

196
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, I've never heard you say that

197
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Sudden

198
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.690
Wayne Dal: I just, this is something that I've been thinking about, you know, here and there.

199
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:59.490
Wayne Dal: Because you do hear people say sometimes the kid had to move out to get away from his mom or get away from the dad.

200
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.500
Wayne Dal: I just sometimes, I think, was that me, you know,

201
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:06.480
But

202
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.990
Wayne Dal: I can't dwell in it, you know.

203
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:20.610
Wayne Dal: It's just something I think about it, can't change you know the past. All I can do is change that now in the future. That's what I'm trying to do.

204
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.050
Wayne Dal: You know, but it's, it's something I do think about

205
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:36.420
Wayne Dal: It. There's nothing that I get depressed about or anything, but it's something that yeah I think that was a big mistake that I made in my life. I

206
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.040
Wayne Dal: You know,

207
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.160
Wayne Dal: But I did my best, and I did what I knew how and and

208
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.030
Wayne Dal: You know, I was definitely better than my parents.

209
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.550
Wayne Dal: You know, I mean,

210
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.170
Wayne Dal: And that's, that's

211
00:22:54.150 --> 00:23:01.140
Wayne Dal: I always told that to myself that I wasn't going to be my father and I, you know, my kids would have more than I did. And

212
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.100
Wayne Dal: You know, I feel like I did that.

213
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.420
Wayne Dal: You know, but there's still some

214
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.420
Wayne Dal: I guess it it's regret.

215
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.600
Wayne Dal: And I do. Like I said, it just, it just comes up sometimes

216
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, why don't we do

217
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You a little different technique. Today we've got enough time. Why don't we do some of that I'm movement are the EM Dr today. Do you do have two containers.

218
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.570
Wayne Dal: Have them ready

219
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. So let's let's go into I already have your protective figures that I can we then already have all these sort of metaphors work with. So why don't we talk a little bit about

220
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That feeling you were talking about just now of regret.

221
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever had that before.

222
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were younger. Did you ever have this sense of

223
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Regret before the concept of this regret around children. Is there any of that earlier in your life.

224
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.930
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I think.

225
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.240
Wayne Dal: School was a big one. I didn't finish school

226
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.990
Wayne Dal: You know, I dropped out and got my GED.

227
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.350
Wayne Dal: playing sports was a big is a big regret.

228
00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.730
Wayne Dal: I didn't play sports, because I was too busy, you know,

229
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.970
Wayne Dal: Hanging out with friends and partying.

230
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Had this

231
00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing.

232
00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.960
Wayne Dal: Probably. That's my biggest secret is not enjoying my youth.

233
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.910
Wayne Dal: But in a way, I didn't have a chance because I had to grow up so fast.

234
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

235
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right there, that one.

236
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Had to grow up so fast.

237
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can go further back on that one. See if you can bridge it to that earliest sense of, I've got to take responsibility. I've got a girl fast.

238
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Check all the way back in time moving back 10 years, five years go all the way back and see if you can catch the earliest stage where you really have this sense of

239
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't play I I've gotta fix this dinner. I've got to take care of this sibling, I've gotta like to know how how how far back that goes

240
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.830
Wayne Dal: It goes back is pretty much

241
00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:00.270
Wayne Dal: As long as I can remember. I was never allowed to play. I always had to, you know, work.

242
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:11.580
Wayne Dal: Because my dad you know i i was i felt like i didn't have enough time to be a kid around him, because I always had to have stuff done.

243
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.500
Wayne Dal: I'll say I'd get it, you know, so

244
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.340
Wayne Dal: I was so constantly worried about that.

245
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.730
Wayne Dal: And wasn't able to have fun.

246
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What age. How far back can you go

247
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.140
Wayne Dal: I would say probably

248
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:43.080
Wayne Dal: Probably really about nine or 10 I would think. Okay.

249
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So it goes back as long as I can remember. So you have a sense of of

250
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe third grade. There was, there was some playing maybe in second and third grade, you think you might have been

251
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.630
Wayne Dal: A little

252
00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.950
Wayne Dal: Kid. Yeah.

253
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But then as fourth grade came in and certainly in fifth grade when you're 10 right now. Now you're, you can't you can't really afford to play.

254
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to be focused on not getting in trouble.

255
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. All right.

256
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So this one right here. This one we're talking about at age nine, let's say,

257
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing. Is this because I'm putting it on the subjective unit of distress and trying to see how distressing. It is for you just even talking about it now on zero to 100 Todd distressing is that

258
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.940
Wayne Dal: It's up there.

259
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.990
Wayne Dal: It's distressing. It's just

260
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.980
Wayne Dal: When I think about it is it's up there. It's probably in the 80s or 90s.

261
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I had an 80 I'm gonna let me put it like 85 cents.

262
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so yeah just stress that that word is a vague one and it captures a lot of emotions. I let you guys decide what that is. That's why it's called a subjective unit of distress. I don't know how we label it, but it certainly isn't calm.

263
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's

264
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's distressing. Yes. Okay. So we're I put it at

265
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: A five

266
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And where do you notice in your body that that is true.

267
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it activated.

268
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.270
Wayne Dal: Everything like is when I think about all this stuff. It's all in my

269
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:45.750
Chest.

270
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. What's up, just doing

271
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.780
Wayne Dal: It like it's

272
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.930
Wayne Dal: Like Hardy.

273
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's interesting, call it, you call it heartache, because that's the way you sounded in group to like your heart was breaking somehow you sounded heartbroken. You know, it's interesting that today that that's that's where you're at in the chest.

274
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to get in a little bit to

275
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief about the self, be patient with this one. Wayne. These are hard to get to. Okay, so don't don't censor I'll help guide, I'll say, okay, well maybe try this or this or this. Okay. These are hard to get to. So, be gentle on yourself. You want to try and capture. So if you

276
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were nine going back in time.

277
00:29:49.650 --> 00:30:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And i right I'm sort of doing it with him and thinking, I don't want to get in trouble. I don't want to get hurt, right, and only thing to happen. I think you mentioned things about your mom, kind of, she had to. You were stepping in. So what what was

278
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the we'll just take it as far away and then we'll work our way forward, what were the thoughts and beliefs you had at age nine,

279
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this just see what you were thinking to kind of remember

280
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You had fear.

281
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.040
Wayne Dal: Scared.

282
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scared.

283
00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:39.540
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

284
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so that might be it right there.

285
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief. I'm scared.

286
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So typically, I would use that as as an emotion, but I'm I'm noticing.

287
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You said fear you said scared.

288
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was asking you about thoughts.

289
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember thinking anything about yourself.

290
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I am like if you had to finish the sentence, I am, what would it be

291
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Back then,

292
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: belief about the self. These are hard to get to just let it flow, just see what comes up.

293
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:39.870
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

294
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.190
Yeah.

295
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.980
Wayne Dal: I remember thinking about all the time.

296
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.090
Okay.

297
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would you like to have been thinking

298
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what would you like to have been thinking at age nine,

299
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.760
Wayne Dal: Older like to been thinking about nothing.

300
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.040
Wayne Dal: Just being carefree and being a kid.

301
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.880
Wayne Dal: I was just

302
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:26.370
Wayne Dal: I would just like to been thinking that just being happy.

303
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: carefree kid. So that's the results of some things wanted to be carefree want to just be a kid. If you were carefree and just to kid. What would the belief about the selfie. I look around and carefree just Kim doing what I want to do on plane.

304
00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.760
Wayne Dal: What do I do when I'm being loved, and wanted

305
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's it.

306
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I am loved and wanted

307
00:32:54.030 --> 00:33:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And very big shift. I want you to think right now true right now. This is a scale from one to seven. How true is I'm loved and wanted How true is it today.

308
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.040
Wayne Dal: Today, it's a 10

309
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh.

310
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.530
Wayne Dal: Because I know I am loved and I

311
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:14.310
Wayne Dal: Am wanting

312
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.620
Wayne Dal: The good feelings you have

313
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it

314
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.820
Wayne Dal: Yeah, after years and years of not feeling that

315
00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And how true is it this one, watch this one closely.

316
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This is on a different scale. This is actually, you know what I was what I said one to seven on true on that other one. I'm just going to put seven. So this one's the one to 10

317
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how true is it that you're feeling right now.

318
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay close attention. I'm a slave.

319
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: One to 10 How true is

320
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.050
Wayne Dal: It better to because I do kind of feel like I'm a buck around here sometimes

321
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear a little bit of that here and there.

322
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:11.790
Oh, yeah.

323
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.500
Wayne Dal: Would you say one to 10

324
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's one to 10 yeah

325
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.910
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I think it's probably better for actually

326
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.970
Wayne Dal: That that does come across my mind a lot

327
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.100
Wayne Dal: Butler like

328
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.090
Wayne Dal: What the hell.

329
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.580
I'm picking up after the kids.

330
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.810
Wayne Dal: Yogi, no.

331
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.860
Oh,

332
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let me see.

333
00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.230
Wayne Dal: He's getting a big boy.

334
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.930
Wayne Dal: He chose everything

335
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Like the horn, the little antler horn. So you can really

336
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.900
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

337
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, oh yeah.

338
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi. Oh, does it smell like a puppy.

339
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I know.

340
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now be funny if he was barking at

341
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: 730 Oh my gosh, thank you for that. So,

342
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me see where we are.

343
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just check in. We had a little moment with Yogi. And so let's check in on what your subjective unit of distress is right now. Give me a number from zero to 100. How are you feeling

344
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.290
Wayne Dal: I'm feeling good.

345
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:02.310
What number

346
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.550
Wayne Dal: With what

347
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.380
Wayne Dal: Is being the lowest

348
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Distressed

349
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.670
Wayne Dal: Yes, actually 020 200 I'm not feeling distressed at all today.

350
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, as I as I check it. Because earlier we were up it right at five. I'm starting to feel those things. And now you're down at. What number would you say

351
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:29.430
Wayne Dal: For me to find, I would say down to these let's give it a 20

352
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so at 20. Oh, right.

353
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to sort of install and interweave some positive imagery, so sit back a little bit. You want to be about arm's length away so your eyes aren't strained.

354
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to see your eyes looking. First I want to check and make sure they're all shoulder width apart. So you're going to be looking at those two things left and right.

355
00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, that's fine. So I'll be setting the pace with my finger. Do you see me setting the pace, you won't be looking at my finger, you'd be looking at the objects.

356
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're getting a sense out of the peripheral vision that I'm setting the pace. Does that make sense. Yeah. So I'm trying to see

357
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Your eyes are actually not going across. So let me just check out something

358
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: My concern is that they are more can you actually reach it.

359
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it can you reach one of those objects. If you were to reach out really I don't see your eyes moving all the way over. That's interesting. Why don't you move in an inch closer to the screen just an inch

360
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see you go back and forth, not looking at me. Don't worry about me. Look at the chops of the objects.

361
00:37:50.160 --> 00:38:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: They're just that strain your eyes, is that hurt. No. Okay, that's the distance. Now, how far away from the screen feel with your arm, how far you are because we want to mark that that's how far we want you

362
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.870
Wayne Dal: Almost an arms link.

363
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. That's what I'm almost arms like so try to remember that. That's our distance. So kind of are you comfortable right there.

364
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, fantastic. That's what we want. So now let's have a nice inhale and let's sort of bring our tuned awareness inward.

365
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. Keep your eyes close and I'm going to remind you to bring up this imagery of of your grandpa.

366
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This sense of feeling safe with him. He is a protective figure that you can summon up to your awareness in your working mind.

367
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just from the get a sense of what it's like to be around him.

368
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And bringing in your nurturing figure of grandma.

369
00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And your grandpa together loving and they never hurt you.

370
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: See around them. See how your chest feels. Notice how your back, your stomach, your legs how the shoulders, indeed, respond to being in their presence.

371
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

372
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to gravity is it pulls you post those feet down to the center of the earth and pulls your bottom, your back, your shoulders and close it all down to the center of the Earth, consistently, it is there.

373
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding you tethering you

374
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: To the planet.

375
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to be with an interacting

376
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: In an exchange of connection with grandma and grandpa and

377
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: With your wise figure of God.

378
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone interacting together.

379
00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to how you feel physically, emotionally

380
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: See if your body settles in further

381
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If muscles decide to relax.

382
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If they do.

383
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you notice it.

384
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you to hold that imagery in your mind, and I'm going to do a slow iteration for about 30 seconds here. I'm going to just focus on you and those resources. When you're ready, open your eyes.

385
00:40:47.220 --> 00:41:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be looking at the top. So these figures and you're going to be thinking about your protective figure, hold on to it in your working mind nurturing figures and you're wise figure

386
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're interacting with them.

387
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget to breathe.

388
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Mind starts to wander pay attention to it. But know that you're working very hard to keep these figures present in your working mind.

389
00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's inhale into the belly. Inhale, with me.

390
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: An exhale all the air out nice and slow.

391
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What the mind go blank for even a beat.

392
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice what comes up and share that with me.

393
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.500
Wayne Dal: Sense of

394
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:17.670
Wayne Dal: Safety

395
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. I'd like to do a little desensitization. Okay, which means that we I'll be inviting you to pull up because desensitization sort of means exposure, we're exposing ourselves to something. So it means pulling up a memory your memory. You don't have to tell me what it is.

396
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll be inviting you to think about the worst piece about about when you were nine. The worst image of it. You don't have to tell me that you just pull it up in your awareness.

397
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'd like you to pull up the negative thought

398
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a slave and you're going to open your eyes. And we're going to be doing a little faster iteration. So you're going to be holding on to two things worse image of that at nine and the negative thought, I'm a slave. Open your eyes hold them in your working awareness.

399
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be faster.

400
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving

401
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Left and right left right

402
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst piece of it and then negative cognition.

403
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Short iteration. Breathe in.

404
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, it all out.

405
00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The mind go blank for just a moment.

406
00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:00.780
Just

407
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: See what's coming up just a short little statement and then I'll take it from there. What did you notice

408
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.330
Wayne Dal: Tense tense.

409
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Tense where where

410
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.720
Wayne Dal: My shoulders.

411
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we're going to go with that. Open your eyes.

412
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And a hold that thought worst image. THE WORST piece of it. Pay attention to the shoulders.

413
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative cognition. I'm a slave tension in the shoulders.

414
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about right now.

415
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tell me what you're thinking about

416
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.800
Wayne Dal: Dog was just thinking about being a slave.

417
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.230
