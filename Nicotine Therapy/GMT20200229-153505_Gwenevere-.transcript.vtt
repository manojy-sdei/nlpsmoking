Gwenevere Abriel: Did you guys ever have any

88
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:13.950

Amanda Davis: Yeah, good.

90
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.770
Amanda Davis: Family Therapy. Okay.

91
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're like in your 20s or something.

92
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.970
Amanda Davis: When I had heard

93
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All I was asking if you had family therapy when you were in your 20s.

94
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.570
Amanda Davis: When I had breast cancer. I did family therapy.

95
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.320
Okay.

96
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Did some interesting things come out from that therapeutic work that surprised you

97
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.300
Know,

98
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, why do you think she's being mean what's actually

99
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.790
Amanda Davis: She's battling her own mental health stuff and thirsty blazing her own limits so

100
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Fish. Does she have a mood disorder that says she's been diagnosed well

101
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.320
Amanda Davis: Yeah, okay.

102
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it like a bipolar disorder, possibly, I

103
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.780
Amanda Davis: Don't feel comfortable giving her diagnosis.

104
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's just just

105
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.070
Amanda Davis: And

106
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I completely understand

107
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But just to review that because that that definitely can be a concern for people. Everything that you say in here stays right in here, it doesn't

108
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't go in, even into group.

109
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning, let's say you decide to discuss something in here.

110
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I would probably say, hey, is this something you want to talk about in group. And if you said no, like to keep it in here or if you say, Yes, I do. You know, it's good for me to kind of share this and move past some shame.

111
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, even then I would still protect that information and say, Listen, Amanda, you mentioned earlier, you wanted to talk about something and it kind of be good if you brought it up. They're very separate for me.

112
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Not going to bring anything in there because you guys would feel uncertain about wanting to share in here. If you thought that

113
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: He brought out so I'm glad you brought that topic up to

114
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.850
Amanda Davis: Oh, good.

115
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're you're sounding pretty optimistic that as medication comes online for your daughter or whatever the treatment is that whatever that meanness is will be resolved.

116
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:19.890
Amanda Davis: That it's, yeah.

117
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Definitely sightings. Oh, good, good, good, good.

118
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and

119
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So still some symptoms and does it seem like your doctor is understanding what you're going through.

120
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Regarding the continued symptoms that are present.

121
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:53.910
Amanda Davis: Um, yeah, they were going to wean me down and keep me on the bills and it's like I'm never going to get off if I do it the way they want to they want to prescribe me all my pills again tell him.

122
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.140
Amanda Davis: I told them.

123
00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:10.770
Amanda Davis: My pain management. Oh, and I told him I can't do this, you know, I'm I'm nodding off in the middle of the day eg me I don't feel good, you know it's it's at the point where I

124
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.660
Amanda Davis: The pain management, like the Suboxone helps with pain to

125
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a very strong analgesic opiate actually it is quite a strong one.

126
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're also seeing what's

127
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.220
Amanda Davis: going on underneath me feel high like the pain pills.

128
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's so cool, isn't it.

129
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah so

130
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The pain management doctor that you're seeing what's the name of the pain management doctor that you're seeing

131
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.610
Amanda Davis: I no longer school. Yeah, he's in a different state.

132
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you said something about they wanted to put you back on something.

133
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:56.220
Amanda Davis: Yeah. The last time I talked to him about a month ago. I told him no, then that's when I found your program. Okay. Okay.

134
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so a couple of neat things about buprenorphine.

135
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, like you said, I mean, you, you may notice when it you know about 20 minutes after you put it on your, your tongue, you're going to notice you know when it's in your bloodstream, but it's not the same euphoria that all of those short acting Opiates are going to give you. Yeah.

136
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. The other really neat thing about it is that you don't you know how you had to keep taking more and more and more.

137
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To get the same effect that doesn't happen. You don't build tolerance.

138
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: For yeah so you're you're in here. You're not going to go up.

139
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. Yeah, so that's, those are two really great things about it.

140
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.710
Amanda Davis: Good. Right.

141
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Let me come take a look at kind of how you identified and we only met that very brief time

142
00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: For that assessment and some of the things you identified that you wanted to work on where I want to be clean and sober off of everything that was something sort of a really big long term goal right

143
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.710
Amanda Davis: Mm hmm.

144
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then another one was, I want to get a job and then it was, I want to lose some weight. I want to be. Okay, so we're around. Are you feeling stable enough to even begin to think about job at this point.

145
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:22.860
Amanda Davis: Though

146
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't think so. It was like why she's not feeling good yet.

147
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.430
Amanda Davis: Later, and I figured, after I been clean for some time.

148
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:41.400
Amanda Davis: You know, I'll feel better. And, you know, because I used to just sleep a lot and know I have to get my stamina backup.

149
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.720
Amanda Davis: It's like

150
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.140
Amanda Davis: You know, that's a big part of the reason I wanted to clean is so I could live again.

151
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And just so that just around this topic of job.

152
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that the only issue was around the substance use, like you were too busy maybe looking for it or you were nodding off or something like what was the problem area around jobs.

153
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.060
Amanda Davis: I couldn't even drive as medicated as I was

154
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

155
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.130
Amanda Davis: That makes sense.

156
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got you.

157
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.410
Okay.

158
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And

159
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what were some of the fields of interest that you kind of enjoy it, though.

160
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.490
Amanda Davis: Um, I

161
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.560
Amanda Davis: Work in home health care.

162
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:48.780
Amanda Davis: Nursing homes, stuff like that, or in home health care where you go in and take care of the patient. Give them medication, take them to the doctors, Steve, you know, just stable home health care. Yeah.

163
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And

164
00:14:50.250 --> 00:15:02.070
Amanda Davis: And then I worked at Wells Fargo. I really enjoyed that works at the bank for like two years and at AMP T call center was very much alike with the bank. Okay.

165
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you looking for next time. Do you think and

166
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.250
Amanda Davis: Probably start with like customer service as the easiest

167
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:25.830
Amanda Davis: Like, just go work for a bank customer service with a call in and they've got a complaint or a question about their statement I can answer alone, a small loan right up with that, you know, things like that.

168
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:27.480
Okay.

169
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:39.780
Amanda Davis: Good. I stayed in bed, yesterday I was pale and then I got up out of bed like I stayed in bed tall like probably one o'clock in the afternoon.

170
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.240
Amanda Davis: I can come down with something the grandkids are sick. And I think I'm catching it.

171
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I have those kids their little Petri dishes as cute as they are, though.

172
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.220
Yeah.

173
00:15:52.740 --> 00:16:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Excellent. So first it's really about getting getting some physiological stability getting that sleep sort of managed

174
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's going out and any other barriers as far as for some people what they end up saying when they meet with me as you know what, when I really look at it. I've let my driver's license. Go. I need to go get my license. Is there any other

175
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.900
Amanda Davis: Things like that. No, I got my license.

176
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. And, and, and then you mentioned this other thing you said I want to lose some weight.

177
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that

178
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that more about, I need to shift to eating healthier to feel the body or is there some sort of

179
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:46.200
Amanda Davis: Cause I had a heart attack and didn't even know it. So I know I need to lose some weight. I see.

180
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your doctor telling you about that.

181
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.900
Amanda Davis: They're trying to get me into a heart specialist

182
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Around

183
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:54.690
Amanda Davis: Oh,

184
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.530
Amanda Davis: And all that

185
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When you met when you had the the heart incident. Did someone say something about weight to you or you came to that on your own.

186
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:07.860
Amanda Davis: Game to that on my own.

187
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see. Okay.

188
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you're not any any medication or anything for the

189
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.860
Amanda Davis: Event. No, I need to huh

190
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when was it this incident happened.

191
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.790
Amanda Davis: It happened like a year ago and I was battered and follow up on it because those on those pills and

192
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:34.380
Amanda Davis: I didn't take good care of myself. I'm just getting everything back in order. Okay.

193
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So really it's not about weight so much as really making sure that you're eating well, making sure that you know what if there's an exercise regimen that it's right on board with whatever's appropriate following that heart incident.

194
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.030
Amanda Davis: Right, okay.

195
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it. So you first. It's kind of like I need to schedule an appointment with a specialist

196
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.700
Amanda Davis: Mm hmm. Okay.

197
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes a lot of sense.

198
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

199
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.970
Amanda Davis: And how long is this meeting an hour or half an hour.

200
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, they're always going to be an hour at a minimum, but it'll be 45 minutes

201
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do this right now. We're very sort of starting way on the outside, you are developing your poor. You don't know me. Right. So this that has to take a little bit of time.

202
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:27.840
Amanda Davis: To

203
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's Glenn.

204
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.110
Amanda Davis: You can call in real

205
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.090
Amanda Davis: Yeah. Yes. Your name.

206
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. You can call me when

207
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.200
Amanda Davis: Okay, when

208
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. So let's do this because sometimes when

209
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of emotion going on. I'll start to get a little nauseous. We'll see if we can find a place to prop up that phone so that you and I can kind of sort of have some sort of face to face.

210
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe prop me up on some books or something.

211
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.910
Amanda Davis: You see my face there.

212
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, okay. Take your time, no rush.

213
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, we're almost there. I would say that right now. I can't see you, only because you have some sort of rack in the way. So maybe I'll

214
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.830
Amanda Davis: Hold up on

215
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Ya know, I think that part's fine, you might just want to scoot a little closer is all that worked fine. It was just moving

216
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.660
Amanda Davis: You don't have a bookshelf. I don't have anything

217
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.290
Amanda Davis: might fall down, but that's

218
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

219
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.110
That's great.

220
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were able to find someplace just now. That's wonderful. Whoo.

221
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And so just kind of bring me up to speed on

222
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe some things that you've already learned maybe through something you've read or maybe online or maybe from a friend when it comes to regulating emotions do you do already. I don't want to teach you something or talk about something you already know about

223
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you already incorporated

224
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.270
Amanda Davis: What I've had therapy and stuff when I was dealing with my PTSD.

225
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.110
Amanda Davis: And I learned a lot in there.

226
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let me hear a little bit about what you learned. So I don't repeat things you already have sort of

227
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.670
Amanda Davis: Identify with the triggers was the big thing.

228
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:21.780
Amanda Davis: I would be willing to take on any information you have for me. Okay. Okay.

229
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:23.220
So,

230
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When it comes to the symptoms of PTSD diagnosis. I will tell you, I do things a little differently than a lot of people I don't ask that people read tell their story if they don't want to, which is kind of nice when people don't feel like

231
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.290
Amanda Davis: Sharing that time.

232
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.490
Yeah.

233
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That comes in time, if people feel like sharing little pieces of it, that's fine, but the interventions that we might do once you start to feel safe in here. It doesn't require that. So that's kind of a reassurance. I think for a lot of people

234
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's, why don't we start today with

235
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll start with two, which I like to teach right away, and one of them.

236
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Even years later, it is the one thing that seems to make the most difference. And it's the belly breathing.

237
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And a lot of people

238
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Think that it's about breathing through the nose or they might say, oh, it's about the four counts or something, but it's not. It's about activating the Vegas nerve. And has anybody talked to you about that.

239
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll go a little science. If I lose you, and you forget. Just know that you don't have to believe in it for it to work its scientific. So that's kind of nice.

240
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a psychological trick.

241
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's kind of reassuring if you kind of have that science mind.

242
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I liked it for that reason.

243
00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, I'll go over it quite a few times. Right now I'm just going to kind of talk about it kind of talk about the science and then I will show it to you or talk about it. And then we can do some together. Okay.

244
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so the science.

245
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a nerve called the Vegas nerve and it's also called a wandering nerve because it wanders around it's connected to brain our even our face larynx bearings heart long spleen kidney, it's, it's like wanders around it just connects to all kinds of organs throughout our body.

246
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's amazing about this particular breathing that we're going to do. Technically, it'd be like diet for medic breathing but belly breathing my clients can remember that they have to expand the belly. So I use the word belly in the name of it.

247
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So what ends up happening is when you breathe in the lower part

248
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Of of the lung. Most of us breathe, breathe up here and we can see our shoulders move

249
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: We've gotten used to breathing the short the short shallow breaths, but it doesn't get the air down pushing the diaphragm down and expanding the belly. So what's different about this is when we breathe and our stomach comes out like this, as if blowing up a balloon.

250
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It actually pushes the visceral, those are our organs down below the diaphragm and watch what happens.

251
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Remember that Vegas nerve that's wrapped around those organs. It's really cool it at it sends a signal up that Vegas nerve right to our brain. And it says, oh, look at us. Breathing deeply, we must not be in danger.

252
00:24:45.060 --> 00:25:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha. It's really cool because in our head. We're going, Oh my gosh, this is so awful. Right. We're triggered by a memory. We're triggered by a smell or a cent or we don't even know what just happened. It went. It was an unconscious trigger something got activated on us, we perceived a threat.

253
00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's happening up here up in our brain.

254
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, what's amazing is this signal that's coming up the Vegas nerve guess but it contradicts that thought.

255
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It down regulates

256
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The oxygen demand in the heart.

257
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It sends the message we don't need to be having Rapid. Rapid fast short breaths. It says, Oh, we're okay.

258
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.980
Amanda Davis: It contradicts the OH.

259
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: My gosh, I'm in danger thought because the body is saying we're okay.

260
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's the parasympathetic nervous system being activated the sympathetic one that was that scared activated terrified thought that was sympathetic

261
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And the Vegas nerve. I also call it the Vegas break is is the parasympathetic nervous system.

262
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We love it because the breath, we, we always have access access to it could be standing in line at the grocery store, we could be, you know, you know, just about to, maybe, you know, yell at a kid or yell at someone and we say, wait a minute.

263
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wait, something's going on with me. I don't want to do this thing I'm going to do this, this belly breathing and you can do it wherever nobody even needs to know you're doing it so

264
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.250
Amanda Davis: Great.

265
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.510
And we can come

266
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.290
Amanda Davis: Over interesting I just tried it. Oh.

267
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great. We'll do some more together to

268
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the science behind it. And after we do it. There's a second mechanism of change also happening. And that has to do more with a cognitive thing that's going on because I'm going to teach it as

269
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be a four count. Inhale, a four count holding of the breath. It'll be a four count. Exhale, and it'll be a four count holding of the breath. It's not a natural breath. It's, it's, it takes, actually a lot of concentration to do

270
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Which has the benefit cognitively of distracted attention and really focused attention, which gets us off the what if I get hurt, what if what if I'm in danger thought. So that's kind of nice.

271
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So that is the science behind it. So remember I was saying you

272
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.750
Amanda Davis: Don't know.

273
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was saying you don't actually have to believe it for it to work. I mean, it's not like you have to believe that your heart is really a, you know, it's going to do it unconsciously. Like, you don't have to believe that your heart's going to keep pumping. If you've been up say stop.

274
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to keep pumping

275
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.510
Amanda Davis: Yeah yeah

276
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's kind of reassuring that this will work, even when your mind is, I do. It's no no it's not. No, it's not. Yes it well.

277
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That's me.

278
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.040
Amanda Davis: Right.

279
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that's why I want people to have that first. So now I'm going to show you what I'm talking about.

280
00:27:49.890 --> 00:28:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so another piece of it if you want to do it with what I call fidelity, which means really concentrating and do it the way I'm instructing

281
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If you decide to do it that way. It has the added benefit of the added like difficulty of it. It's hard to actually do it exactly the way I'm going to instruct it which means it's going to distract you.

282
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be ruminating you won't be sort of that. Oh, no, it will focus your brain somewhere else. So this is the instruction. So the instruction is to include some of the sort of mindfulness practices. Maybe you've picked up along the way through this other psychotherapy right and now

283
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to the tactile experience of the air coming in through your nose because it will be an inhale that's coming in through the nose.

284
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to take four seconds. So you'll be paying attention to the sensation. If you do it. I'm just going to teach, which obviously you can do with me if you like right now just teaching. So it's inhaling through for four seconds so

285
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.250
And you hold it for four which is really difficult.

286
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhaling, it'll be a deliberate exhale right yep out of the mouth. We you feel you actually pay attention to how that air fields as it's being XML from the mouth.

287
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: As that long as flattening and of course that stomach comes in a little bit too, as you're exhaling all that air out and then yeah and then you hold that breath out for four seconds. So it looks like this. I'm just teaching. So it's an inhale.

288
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.380
Hold 321 exhale

289
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.190
Hold 321 inhale.

290
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.250
Hold 321 exhale

291
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.730
321

292
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold. So now the key member I was saying, with a very

293
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS belly breathing is

294
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that the air.

295
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Not stay up here. So we're normally we do this.

296
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to push as if expanding a balloon. Each time we enhance so

297
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference.

298
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you're having a hard time I have this funny.

299
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Funny label for, you know, a lazy boy chair. You know how lazy boy we put our hands like this. So if we do the lazy boy pose our, our, our chest opens up a little bit. We have a little bit of room in there to kind of get some air even

300
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's uncomfortable as a couple other options. You go, so do what I call the Superman or Wonder Woman pose. We've kind of put your hands on your hips back and open it up.

301
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's uncomfortable you let's say you were seated on a desk chair or something and your legs were hanging down, you might want to tuck your hands underneath those size. So, but the point is, look what happens when I do that.

302
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: My chest opens up because I need

303
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.800
Amanda Davis: Air

304
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: My knees if I'm doing this. I'm not going to be able to do the belly breathing right that yeah I'm not gonna be able to get an error in there.

305
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to do that. So we're going to do it together. Do you feel like you're you've got an expanded sort of

306
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Rib cage. I think so too. It doesn't have to be too too much as. So once you to feel comfortable, like we got to be reasonable, because we want you to be doing it up, you know, a few times a day. Okay.

307
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this together. Do you feel the most important part is that that air get down to the bottom of the long. Can you feel the difference between like go back and forth. One of them is just a short upper breath.

308
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Where it's only at the top and now feel one word your shoulders don't move, but just the belly gets puffed out. Can you feel the difference

309
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You can just

310
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like does it feel like not as much air gets in there. When you do in the belly. Does it feel

311
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that.

312
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: No. No. Okay.

313
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:18.750
Amanda Davis: Same

314
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: feels the same.

315
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.960
Amanda Davis: Yeah. Oh.

316
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

317
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine. So really,

318
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.060
Amanda Davis: quite uncomfortable. I think I'm going to do the ones worse it

319
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, me too. I'm going to spend on mine too.

320
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:36.390
Amanda Davis: Yeah.

321
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And of course you can also not worry about the hands because remember the most important part, not even the nose, not even the four count, not even the holding. It's about that that air make it down to the bottom of that long.

322
00:32:51.990 --> 00:33:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll rob yourself of the opportunity of that Vegas nerve being activated and at the parasympathetic nervous system is going to send the message up to the brain. Oh, if we're not breathing. Breathing fast. Well, we're probably pretty safe and we don't need to fight anybody or run away.

323
00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:11.250
Amanda Davis: Okay.

324
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.300
Right, because that's what

325
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what the sympathetic nervous system is saying it's like oh my gosh, we're in danger, danger. Okay, so we're going to do it together. Remember, the most important is the belly breath.

326
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this together. So we're gonna

327
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So do your exhale all the way out. So I can kind of see where you're at, with it. There we go. And let's inhale into the nose.

328
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale

329
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 in health, the nose, big belly.

330
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale out.

331
00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.550
Hold 321 inhale.

332
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale

333
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.710
Hold 321 in health

334
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.980
And hold 321 exhale

335
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: going all out and hold 321 inhale.

336
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:34.170
And hold 321 exhale

337
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's do one on your own way, you're counting for yourself.

338
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:40.770
Okay.

339
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:49.680
Nice.

340
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can keep the shoulders down on the next inhale just extend the belly. That's hard to do.

341
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.610
Amanda Davis: I couldn't even suck in for four seconds.

342
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember on the inhale. This is why this is so difficult for people, the inhale the belly goes point like a balloon look

343
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to do that. We stopped doing that. Think about it. When your grandbabies where we're tiny right you can picture their little bellies when they're breathing. They go poof, poof, both have

344
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We stopped doing that, you know, we did it when we were babies. We can do it again. But it's actually difficult to do. And it might be because of the way you're seated so you can practice it another time. And I'm happy to go over it again if you

345
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.570
Amanda Davis: Okay, thank you. Maybe we'll do it each each group or something.

346
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, so this is individual therapy.

347
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.820
Amanda Davis: And that's what I mean. Individual therapy.

348
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. When and don't be surprised. Don't be hard on yourself. If you find it difficult because

349
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's like we forgot to breathe deeply down in that long, but it can have a profound impact on down regulating or otherwise really activated moment for really angry or really impatient and really irritable.

350
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It can bring us down quite quickly to a sense of a relaxed body and feeling calm.

351
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's neat is that once the body is relaxed were before all of our blood was in our large muscle groups like our thighs because we needed to run

352
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or fight when we're feeling anxious. Now guess what, it's in our fingers. It's in our toes and it's up in our prefrontal cortex where we can actually go oh yeah

353
00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this isn't that big of a deal really care about this this manager. What a Bozo. Am I going to worry about him. I'm just going to keep doing my thing, right, we can use that logic and reason. But when we're activated. It's really hard to remember that stuff.

354
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.330
Right, yeah.

355
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, for you. What's one of the emotions that you kind of find the most distressing in your life.

356
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:24.210
Amanda Davis: What do you mean

357
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.010
Amanda Davis: Well,

358
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say the word emotion. You've been in therapy before you know what an emotion is right.

359
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:32.250
Amanda Davis: Yeah.

360
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Which emotion. Do you have the most difficulty around

361
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.670
Amanda Davis: The scene. My kids they live out in Ohio. So missing them.

362
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how often you get to see him.

363
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.180
Amanda Davis: In the summer in the summer.

364
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:58.170
Amanda Davis: I'm here with my oldest daughter, she's 21 my youngest is 14 and my middle is 15

365
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And and who are they staying with

366
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.240
Amanda Davis: Their father

367
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.230
Amanda Davis: How's the relationship with him. It's okay.

368
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he do anything to sort of keep them away from you. Sometimes I pulled under you. Oh.

369
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:22.530
Amanda Davis: Yeah, but he is pretty good about if I come up with the money for the summer. He's pretty good about letting me have them.

370
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe this summer. They could even stay with you.

371
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:34.650
Amanda Davis: That's the I'm probably gonna have to take him to court family court for that. Okay. Yeah.

372
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So all right, and this we haven't quite said what the emotion is so when you are missing them. How do you feel emotionally when

373
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.980
Amanda Davis: Yeah, yeah, that

374
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How much of the day. Does that kind of consume your are kind of take up

375
00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:01.860
Amanda Davis: I've gotten better used to take up more the day but now it's I can't control it just comes when it runs

376
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It used to be more but now it's maybe an hour a day 20 minutes sort of pops in and you can

377
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.530
Amanda Davis: Yeah.

378
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you tell yourself that helps alleviate the sadness.

379
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:22.770
Amanda Davis: I get a call every Sunday, have a video call. So we do a video chat.

380
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like this.

381
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

382
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.460
Amanda Davis: Nuts every Sunday, you

383
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.320
Amanda Davis: Know,

384
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, something you really look forward to huh

385
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:34.980
Yeah.

386
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: How long has it been like this where they've been away from you.

387
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:47.940
Amanda Davis: It's been about three years and I had them since they were born.

388
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:56.760
Amanda Davis: I had some health problems, the mental problems. I'd go get in treatment and they went to their dads and never came back.

389
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're ready to have no I'm just curious was, was there ever a

390
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.150
Amanda Davis: work to do on myself.

391
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, I got you, I got you.

392
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And

393
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We're starting that process, right. We're starting it

394
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Can it can I check in a little bit with

395
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Did anything negative happen with another therapist or did someone betraying you or

396
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Something anything negative happened with a with a past therapist.

397
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:44.460
Amanda Davis: And I got really close with their best. And then I went to go see them and I got thrown out of the office and arrested, he he later lost his license.

398
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:58.410
Amanda Davis: He was doing crazy things giving people medications they should have bring people out not giving them explanations. I don't know why he did that, you know, I went in handcuffs. They let me go, but

399
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Why were you, why would you get handcuffed, what would happen.

400
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.330
Amanda Davis: That's what I want to know. I never got that.

401
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know why you arrested know

402
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.160
Amanda Davis: They let me go.

403
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see. Okay. Okay.

404
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you trusted him.

405
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.000
Amanda Davis: Huh oh my goodness, how

406
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: long have you been seeing him.

407
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:20.850
Amanda Davis: For about a year.

408
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then turns out something

409
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.010
Amanda Davis: He got shut down a loss of life. And I was like, well, I guess it's karma.

410
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't even know right what what happened.

411
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it is it kind of like that. Now, like you wonder, is the trust possible here and is your intuition or your reading of what to trust and not trust.

412
00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, can. Can you believe what you're feeling and here it might happen again. Like, what if there's something

413
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.470
Amanda Davis: Nefarious boy, girl, safer because I can't get caught in thrown out.

414
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good.

415
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can we can look at what what did work.

416
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.160
Amanda Davis: Let's look at what didn't work.

417
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it about this gentleman that helped you feel safe.

418
00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.880
Amanda Davis: You're just always open and honest. I like you a lot will get closer.

419
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So he was

420
00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.580
Open

421
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So he was open. So tell me, tell me what you mean by he was open.

422
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:34.800
Amanda Davis: It was always open with information for me to me helping me along the way. You know, like a therapist should okay

423
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And the prior to

424
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Prior prior to that one. And was he treating the symptoms of the PTSD.

425
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.400
Yes. Okay.

426
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you remember what He taught you.

427
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.760
Amanda Davis: Kind of spaced it out.

428
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard for that stuff to stay. Sometimes, isn't it.

429
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This piece that I just gave you today.

430
00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you hold on to it tight.

431
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.480
Amanda Davis: The breathing.

432
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and and it's okay if you end up saying, oh, I forgot one, but you're going to probably come back to it as one of the most important pieces.

433
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's biological it's it's a self healing thing. Your body knows how to repair itself. And that's beautiful.

434
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.660
Amanda Davis: Isn't it

435
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it is. Yeah.

436
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And I like to capitalize on those things, things that what it's already sort of in us.

437
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it says right yeah so already know how to breathe. It's just remembering how to do it, bringing that air all the way down into the

438
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.510
Right.

439
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What about maybe something that he taught you.

440
00:43:53.100 --> 00:44:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: About cognitive. So those are our thoughts. Do you remember anything having to do with maybe

441
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.030
Amanda Davis: That about that you're better than he is.

442
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's, there's a whole philosophy and and and psychology around

443
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: How we believe we are capable of handling a particular situation.

444
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Yeah, so a big piece of it will be in in taking a look at what your beliefs are about yourself. We'll look at that and we'll see if we can loosen it up a little bit and and bring in some positive thoughts about you to see what's yeah yeah

445
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.180
Amanda Davis: That would be nice. Uh huh.

446
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And did they ever do any did this gentleman or another therapist ever do any would you recognize em, Dr. As an intervention. Did anybody ever do that.

447
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

448
00:44:54.270 --> 00:45:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll be something probably quite a bit down the line. That'd be some preparation before that, but it's it's a bilateral stimulation. So there'd be there'd be a light in here together, you'd be looking at a light while I

449
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: invited you to pull up maybe a piece of either worry about the future and a negative thought and there's a lot of preparation that goes into it.

450
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

451
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.530
Amanda Davis: But I'm interested in that. That would be neat. Yeah.

452
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It has been effective especially. It's actually the evidence based treatment for PTSD. It's actually an

453
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: X Ray Yeah.

454
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.560
Amanda Davis: Well, I don't know why they do that.

455
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, he you need some specialized training in it that might not be something that that he offered man, I've only been doing it here in Braveheart in the tele health for about two months.

456
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I didn't, I didn't think it would work. But it's working. Because usually yeah people typically have these little vibrating pads in their hands and obviously you can have that. But I've been able to

457
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have an iPad or something larger I've been able to have this blue light. And if you guys only have your phone, then we set up.

458
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little clunky, but as long as you have a sense of humor, we do it. We take a little more preparation than today, but you can set your phone up and we would have two objects so that you could be looking left and right. And you know what, it works.

459
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So right i'm not hung up on it looking looking cute. I wanted to just work.

460
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.900
Right.

461
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:26.640
Amanda Davis: Okay.

462
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.590
All right.

463
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, this is this is new for you.

464
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.220
Amanda Davis: All right, and I

465
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's going to take some time. I do send some some anxiousness is do you have any questions for me as we're just getting to know each other. Do you have some questions that would help.

466
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:51.480
Amanda Davis: No, okay. No, I'm just a little uncomfortable. It'll break

467
00:46:52.650 --> 00:47:02.160
Amanda Davis: I like you a lot and I, I'm excited about looking forward to therapy with you and I think it'll help my healing and my girls, then I'm really excited.

468
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're noticing that in group different topics come up. Right.

469
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:08.310
Amanda Davis: We cover.

470
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: We cover different things. Some of them you'll relate to some of them, man.

471
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:14.760
Right.

472
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: More days than not. Well, may I kind of like this one, or I have no idea what she's talking about.

473
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: If you ever do kind of wonder why does she say you are more than welcome to say, oh, could you explain that word or give you an example. If you could or

474
00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You might, you know, if, let's say some you can relate to someone in the group and you want to share your own story about something, feel free to do that as well. Okay.

475
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.150
Amanda Davis: Okay.

476
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so let's schedule. Our next appointment. You did fantastic you learned

477
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:44.670
Amanda Davis: Very oh

478
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You just learned belly breathing and if all the things that makes the difference for people in emotional regulation, it's that one.

479
00:47:53.340 --> 00:48:00.840
Amanda Davis: Okay, emerald practice that today we can see my head and the posture and the positions and all that.

480
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Most important part is that

481
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:05.520
Amanda Davis: That's right.

482
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that you see. And you can even watch her own hands that probably helped the most is watching on the inhale that it goes pushing out

483
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:17.250
Amanda Davis: Yeah.

484
00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.680
Amanda Davis: I need more medicine.

485
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. I appreciate your reminding. Let me just go over to the database and do that right now.

486
00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:32.580
Amanda Davis: Okay, so

487
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what time let's schedule something during the week next week.

488
00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.210
Amanda Davis: Friday. Is that a good day that I have that day off.

489
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

490
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We already have something. This is great. You and I already have something

491
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we, yes, we're so smart. We looked ahead. And because we knew Friday, you had off, you know, we have we have 9am on March six, with just Friday.

492
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, perfect. Yeah.

493
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:11.160
Amanda Davis: Thank you.

494
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. That's right.

495
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.380
Amanda Davis: We want to

496
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.420
Amanda Davis: 930 or nine

497
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Nine on the nose am

498
00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.010
Amanda Davis: OK, OK. I don't

499
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go anywhere. I'm going to message.

500
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.880
Amanda Davis: Your message like you did last time.

501
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pretty good at actually I'm not bad.

502
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.830
Amanda Davis: I mean, you remember

503
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So make sure you write it down, though, because that's just sort of a courtesy thing.

504
00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, put it in your phone. So hold on just a second. I'm going to message her doctor. Okay.

505
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:40.710
Amanda Davis: Okay.

506
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's Dr. Dr. Aubrey L. Correct.

507
00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gray haired lady.

508
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.060
Yeah.

509
00:49:52.590 --> 00:50:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Amanda t is here for her individual counseling and you attend which which group.

510
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:02.370
Amanda Davis: Monday that at

511
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.450
Amanda Davis: One o'clock. Okay.

512
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. So she's going to probably get you covered to then and then we'll see you

513
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Monday at one. Okay.

514
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:23.160
Amanda Davis: Well, she's got to get me back on getting the medicine for a week straight because I can't go to the pharmacy, three, four times a week.

515
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.940
Amanda Davis: She was giving me a week's medics than every, every group.

516
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.410
Amanda Davis: She going to do that they give me my week's worth on

517
00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. You'll have to talk with her.

518
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.700
Amanda Davis: It's just been a weird getting two strips or something.

519
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can tell you the reasoning for that, though, when people first start

520
00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not going to show up for therapy, nine out of 10 times because medications not attached to it.

521
00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: In the early phase of treatment medication is the motivator for most people to show up later on. Once people

522
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Really get, oh my gosh, my relationships are getting better. I'm not as irritable. I'm not as sad. I'm not as anxious, people start on their own showing up for individual therapy on their own and it doesn't take that motivator.

523
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:21.120
Amanda Davis: Does that make sense.

524
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to change. That's the reason

525
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.300
Amanda Davis: Why beyond the week and I was there.

526
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard you. So now you have an undersea have an understanding of what was going on.

527
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So like the is here for yourself.

528
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, we got next. I see is, and we are already set for when are we meeting next you and I

529
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.430
Amanda Davis: Friday at 9am

530
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it, girl. I'll see you on Monday. Enjoy your brand based

531
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.950
Amanda Davis: All right, thank you. Have a good one.

532
00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You too.

533
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:51.900
Amanda Davis: Bye, baby.
