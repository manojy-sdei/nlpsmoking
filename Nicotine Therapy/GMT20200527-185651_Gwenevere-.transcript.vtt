00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Destiny.

2
00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.080
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, it's been taking me like

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.549
Bethany Shadid: I've had to login early quite but you know make sure because it takes forever now so

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.039
Bethany Shadid: Oh well.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm good. I'm in. I'm actually in New Mexico. I flew out here on the 25th. So I'm here.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, gonna hang out here for a while. I got past a lot of fear around like

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Over contagiousness but

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I brought my Clorox wipes and my son wore gloves and I wiped all the seats and tables and corners and seat belts and turn knobs and

10
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.110
And I said,

11
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep your fingers out of your mouth.

12
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.200
Bethany Shadid: Very

13
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: He's so used to me being a pain in the butt that he was just great. He just did great. So we're here hanging out for a bit.

14
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you, my dear, how are you

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.780
Bethany Shadid: I'm all right. I'm all right i since so

16
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:26.580
Bethany Shadid: I've had the personality testing and I don't know what this is all about. So maybe you can give me a little bit more info because

17
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.810
Bethany Shadid: I I did the personality testing and afterwards was like

18
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.910
Bethany Shadid: I don't know that my results are accurate at all because there was no

19
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.700
Bethany Shadid: Explanation at the front like of what it

20
00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:02.880
Bethany Shadid: Is I don't know. I think I got like that. It was at work or something. Like what, like, so it was really hard for me to like answer the questions, um,

21
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:21.210
Bethany Shadid: I think you know the criteria was kind of fluid, so I didn't know it was this like an idealistic version of myself. Is this how it actually is, is this, you know, so I don't know. I don't know.

22
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't be able to offer much, but I will tell you what I know.

23
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know that the owner is interested in having everyone do it. I know he's starting with a doctor or brielle and my caseload. I know I haven't taken it.

24
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know one thing that was mentioned was his good intentions are to use the information to align the therapists with a client.

25
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And

26
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know much more than that. I'm not gonna lie I don't know much more than it

27
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

28
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:20.550
Bethany Shadid: It's a very interesting like for I've taken a lot of personality communication style whatever types of, you know, surveys and this one. Um,

29
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:36.240
Bethany Shadid: It was okay but it had you rate it from you know your top choice to your lowest. And so, even ones that you felt like don't apply at all. We're still in there.

30
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

31
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:47.700
Bethany Shadid: So, um, but, yeah, I think honestly feedback was, I would say the girl that does it probably needs to

32
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:59.070
Bethany Shadid: preface it a little bit with instead of like, okay, I'm going to ask you all these questions and you rate them and that's what we're doing. It's like

33
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Finding purpose.

34
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.920
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I got scheduled for

35
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.750
Bethany Shadid: Another meeting with her and I didn't know what it was about at all. And we started

36
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.780
Bethany Shadid: Talking about

37
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Like your

38
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
Bethany Shadid: Day, your schedule and um

39
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:33.690
Bethany Shadid: I i really have mixed feelings about that because I'm

40
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:46.350
Bethany Shadid: I have a tendency to crash and burn when my efforts are evaluated by somebody else.

41
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.340
Bethany Shadid: And she's very sweet and there's no no, nothing like that. But, um,

42
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.640
Bethany Shadid: I've just I've done really good the past like month

43
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.560
Bethany Shadid: I'm

44
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:17.490
Bethany Shadid: Putting error or starting new habits that are good and healthy for me and I would. I'm really proud of myself and then it's hard to go in and

45
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to

46
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:33.510
Bethany Shadid: explain these things and then kind of feel accountable, you know, cuz we're gonna follow up and see how you're doing. And I mean, I'm sure it's good for some people but um

47
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.810
Bethany Shadid: For me it was like

48
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.080
Bethany Shadid: Talking to my dad.

49
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.090
Bethany Shadid: Like

50
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.710
Bethany Shadid: I failed many times in the past.

51
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.270
Bethany Shadid: When I've had to talk to my dad about

52
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:06.840
Bethany Shadid: I guess the example I can give is I got a trainer, way back in the day, and was doing like really good and my dad found out

53
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:19.290
Bethany Shadid: Because he's like, Hey, you know, you're looking good. You know, they never say that. He's like, What are you doing, you know, it's like, well, I'm working with a trainer.

54
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:31.710
Bethany Shadid: And then he asks you know all. What are you, what exactly are you doing, like, what is the routine and you should be doing this and you should eat this way and

55
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:41.940
Bethany Shadid: And better. And I don't know about you know he throws his opinion and and i ended up giving up because I felt like I was working really, really hard.

56
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.900
Bethany Shadid: And because I wasn't seeing the results that I want and and

57
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.970
Bethany Shadid: Part of that was my dad. You know, it's already hard enough, I think.

58
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.550
Bethany Shadid: To start, something like that.

59
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.360
Bethany Shadid: And the discouragement doesn't

60
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.840
Bethany Shadid: So anyway.

61
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's think about this.

62
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, get this example. And I think it's called a rap rap appointment. I'm not sure what the acronym stands for, but

63
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, I have not taken it. It's not my baby but

64
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

65
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take something. This is a woman that I'm assuming it's this woman Jocelyn is my guess.

66
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got the name right so let's just say no love on the line for Jocelyn, you have your rights.

67
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To do and not do what you want to do. You have a right because you're you're you're using an insurance, you have a right to have it build and not build, you have a right to refuse services.

68
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you forget you have this right

69
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.460
Bethany Shadid: Um,

70
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.380
Bethany Shadid: No, it was

71
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.970
Bethany Shadid: Something both sessions I felt fine during

72
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.770
Bethany Shadid: Okay. Afterwards, I was like, wait a minute.

73
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:23.640
Bethany Shadid: And yes feelings were coming up. And so I knew that I needed to bring it up today and tell you about it. Um, I don't know, like when

74
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:43.500
Bethany Shadid: Talking about, you know, I have the right not to. I don't really want to follow up with this activities of daily living. I will. We're talking about like how often you shower and clean and do chores and I told her, I said, I get

75
00:08:44.100 --> 00:09:08.280
Bethany Shadid: Way overwhelmed when I my daily schedule is so timed out. I said, I have to. And I showed her my list after I made like my top five that I want to get done in a day. And if it doesn't happen in the morning when I do it at night or, you know, vice versa.

76
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.380
Bethany Shadid: And

77
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.680
Bethany Shadid: It was interesting because I

78
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.660
Bethany Shadid: treated her

79
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.900
Bethany Shadid: Like you in the beginning.

80
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.570
Bethany Shadid: I gave her that trust.

81
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.820
Bethany Shadid: And

82
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:37.890
Bethany Shadid: quickly realized in the second session, you know that she doesn't know me like you do, and she doesn't know that history and everything I'm

83
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:46.740
Bethany Shadid: And so, and I didn't have to give her content that I didn't feel comfortable giving her

84
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.960
Bethany Shadid: So I do remember that. But, um,

85
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.130
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

86
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's

87
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: A sense of in the moment.

88
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had it to do over again.

89
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Which, of course, we can't, we can't completely redo that moment.

90
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Where if you if you had remembered something that you ended up remembering afterwards. How might these have gone differently.

91
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.540
Bethany Shadid: You know, I think my way of

92
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.560
Bethany Shadid: Protecting myself in the past.

93
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.850
In a situation

94
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.540
Bethany Shadid: When I have mustered any sort of, you know,

95
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.500
Bethany Shadid: Has been to just grin and bear it.

96
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.690
Bethany Shadid: And

97
00:10:49.770 --> 00:11:03.690
Bethany Shadid: Maybe not give that much. I know that lying comes into play. You know, especially like with my dad. I just either omit the truth that I don't want to talk about or I

98
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:20.100
Bethany Shadid: Sam doing something. I'm not whatever it is to protect myself. I have the thought of stopping something or saying this isn't working for me is so foreign in the moment.

99
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:20.910
Bethany Shadid: But

100
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.170
Looking back,

101
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.890
Bethany Shadid: I think

102
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:37.470
Bethany Shadid: It had a you know occurred to me. You know that I didn't have to do that.

103
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.600
Bethany Shadid: I would have

104
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:52.950
Bethany Shadid: Probably along the lines, something like, you know, this really isn't something that

105
00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:01.770
Bethany Shadid: Is benefiting me and I'd like to talk to Gwen about it or something before

106
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We go.

107
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:04.800
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

108
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's that. So what happened was,

109
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What often happens, and

110
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You did what you do the patterned behavior which is someone asked something of you and you just did it.

111
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Later on,

112
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That people pleasing hangover.

113
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that it, yeah. Yeah.

114
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:34.290
Yeah.

115
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.310
Bethany Shadid: And then it was like, you know,

116
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:52.230
Bethany Shadid: Evaluating myself that internal shame thing afterwards. It's like, why are you talking to this woman is this been so negative, you know,

117
00:12:53.010 --> 00:13:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I will say my one point that I need this is months and months ago I said I said a lot of things.

118
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to do it.

119
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I said,

120
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Look there's clinical impact for my clients and I don't know what it is because it hasn't started yet. I said, but every single thing we do, or fail to do is clinical once a client is my client.

121
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything's clinical everything a missed call on answered a miss text, the fact that I have no Wi Fi right now is huge.

122
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of you are like what just happened. I can't get ahold of you and you're freaking out. And I'm like, I texted you. And I look and then it says not delivered or it's green, and it looks like it was delivered

123
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am like, I've got to shift and adjust everything is clinical but it has an impact. I made a change, and it has an impact and so

124
00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't push the issue, but you just showed me in real time, you're not the only one that is saying this to me.

125
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am going to invite him to maybe take a peek.

126
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know, I might say, hey, if you want to Bethany, you're more than welcome to reach out to him, or you can just decline. You can just say, no, I'm going to discuss these issues with my therapist because she understands why those particular questions.

127
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Are clinically not activating for me and you don't even have to do that. You can just say,

128
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I talked with going about it maybe talk with her about why this isn't working for me and just put it back onto my shoulders or something like that because

129
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't lose your rights. Just because someone asks you to do something.

130
00:14:45.750 --> 00:15:03.900
Bethany Shadid: And you know, I think, to he probably needs to understand, whoever this is that initiated this two points is that being that its associated I was never

131
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:19.080
Bethany Shadid: Told that it was optional or anything like that. I thought it was mandatory you have all these people here trying to do the program and you know like

132
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.830
Be

133
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.800
Bethany Shadid: A good patient or whatever. And so

134
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:44.280
Bethany Shadid: You know that mentality of just GRINNING AND BEARING it because I have to do this for the program kicks in and the other parts is that I don't know her professional background.

135
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:55.050
Bethany Shadid: Right, but a lot of things came up that were very questionable to me. Um, as far as suggestions.

136
00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:16.560
Bethany Shadid: That she was giving me I she asked me about hobbies and I was telling her about my crafty stuff and she wanted more and more and more. And I was giving her more and more confidence. Um, but she compared it to like what she does.

137
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.260
Bethany Shadid: And

138
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.960
Bethany Shadid: I talked about

139
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:33.630
Bethany Shadid: She said something about, oh, well everybody these days is baking and gardening. Are you doing that knows like

140
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:45.780
Bethany Shadid: Well, I'm well you know I'm single. I like baking. I said, I used to do cakes and stuff like that and told her a little bit about that background.

141
00:16:46.590 --> 00:17:06.480
Bethany Shadid: I'm like, oh yeah, you could sell it, we got into this conversation about selling my crafts, or artwork or something and I kind of was like a kind of alluded to, like, I'm not really into that idea like

142
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:17.850
Bethany Shadid: Crafts are therapeutic and enjoyable to me once it goes to like money and having to do it for somebody else's not enjoyable. So I shared

143
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:28.950
Bethany Shadid: A situation with my mom when I was used to do wedding cakes and my mom would volunteer me to do them for everybody. And I had to say no, you know,

144
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:45.420
Bethany Shadid: Um, so it really she's very, very nice. But it does make me wonder like she definitely wasn't getting my like resistance to like some of the suggestions.

145
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: wasn't picking up on the cues from you. Exactly.

146
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:58.770
Bethany Shadid: And then I was told at the beginning of the section there was going to be like an hour in ended up being like an hour and a half.

147
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:18.630
Bethany Shadid: And at the end, I was like trying to go and she was like, well, we have to, I have to go over and it was all stuff we talked about, but it was like she was actually charting or something. At that time, I don't know. But yeah, I think as far as feedback goes

148
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.250
Bethany Shadid: That's, that's how it went. And it really did.

149
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:42.030
Bethany Shadid: Bring up a lot of stuff for me and I had she asked me to one point about and how do I deal with anxiety and stuff like that. There were a few times I had to say. Or I said things like, well, one and I are working on.

150
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.310
Bethany Shadid: There we go, things

151
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.320
Bethany Shadid: So, Bethany breathing.

152
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a check in. You have now given this 26 minutes. Do you want to keep giving it

153
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.450
More of your

154
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep. Let's just you decide, because this is

155
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:11.070
Bethany Shadid: Me being helpful trying to help. So other people to deal anyway. No, not necessarily want to spend tons of time.

156
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Be the taker right now take

157
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A turn in turn inward. I'm going to do my very best to pick up on cues.

158
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I care and i can i can imagine how triggering that was and forcing you to answer to a barrage of questions is just not not clinically indicated, it's it's traumatizing for you. So, yeah.

159
00:19:49.020 --> 00:20:01.830
Bethany Shadid: And it was so I think that's why spending all this time on it was that since then. That's all I've been thinking about when I get distressed right I'm working my way down the number

160
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

161
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:10.290
Bethany Shadid: Changing and I'm like okay I don't completely understand, but I'm going to talk to when you know

162
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.790
Bethany Shadid: Next morning,

163
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.120
Bethany Shadid: It was two days ago just two days ago.

164
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.410
Bethany Shadid: And it totally activated my

165
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.320
Bethany Shadid: Response to

166
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.770
Bethany Shadid: Just completely

167
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.780
Bethany Shadid: Check out

168
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no.

169
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:30.960
Yeah.

170
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:32.670
Bethany Shadid: Sorry.

171
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No, there's nothing to be sorry for, that's what we're here to do is talk about what's going on so

172
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.150
Bethany Shadid: So maybe this is something

173
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.710
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. Oh.

174
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.630
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

175
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So these will happen in the future. So it could have been this, it could be something else. So it's grist for the mill. So we can take it and we can turn it in to something to discuss

176
00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now again, what I noticed Bethany, no matter how many times I say I'm here. I don't see you reaching out and this would have been a time for an email to me and

177
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I am confused.

178
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm all these things.

179
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And

180
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm activated with all that having to answer questions and you would have just sent that little bit I I would know exactly that. It's your dad having to answer to explain yourself.

181
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you already have this inner critic that you, you think you're not getting enough done

182
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know those negative why. Yeah, I get it, and you couldn't felt seen known and understood even from an email if you just sent a little something.

183
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't write too much back because I've got this clinical approach. I take with writing, but I could have written something like this.

184
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, Bethany. I'm so glad you reached out. I understand why that kind of assessment would be activating for you.

185
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry. It happened and I want to talk more in session, it would probably be short, like that.

186
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we would do this and then we would talk, but at least she would not feel helpless to a force coming at you.

187
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.390
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. And as we're talking about it. I'm thinking of

188
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:46.830
Bethany Shadid: Things I DON'T KNOW WHY IS IT'S NOT YOU ALWAYS BEEN AVAILABLE. But I think like the schedule like it's like, that's it. And I have to wait, you know, patient Oriental time but I I do. Do you know like the jar either or, like my

189
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.970
Bethany Shadid: Like, let's put it aside until

190
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: House no tiny house, you, you, you did the thing where you you got out you escaped out and you did some dissociation stuff.

191
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.750
Bethany Shadid: You know, ever since we kind of stumbled upon my

192
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.770
Bethany Shadid: Check out like

193
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.460
Yeah.

194
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.750
Bethany Shadid: Right. I've been leaning that way more so.

195
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.690
Bethany Shadid: Than my other

196
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.850
Bethany Shadid: More therapeutic ways of doing things.

197
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now what if it's just a particular recipe of what's going on, you're not at work, you don't have all these demands on your attention to focus. Stay alert. Okay.

198
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's not look at it quite like, oh, you know, this is this is we're going in the wrong direction. I'm my hypothesis is the timing might be right, you're not working.

199
00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The timing might be right right now to sit with that. Look at me without distraction. Where do I go to leave distress. How do I get out of it. I go to the checkout.

200
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And and we get to see it in a in a context, we might never have had before so I find it a useful and informing piece.

201
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:24.090
Bethany Shadid: It is actually right because normally I have distraction and I do

202
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And also noticing. Now, I don't know, maybe you did reach out for other resources. Did you connect with church friends.

203
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you also know that

204
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:46.230
Bethany Shadid: I haven't reached out to church, but I've been listening to my church.

205
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:54.210
Bethany Shadid: Services and stuff every day, which has been incredibly helpful.

206
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:03.600
Bethany Shadid: It gets my head in the right space, you know, I find I do a lot better.

207
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.700
Bethany Shadid: And so that's been good.

208
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.970
Bethany Shadid: But no, I didn't and not do anything else.

209
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's my question.

210
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.540
Bethany Shadid: We have a little bit

211
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to do some

212
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Am Dr around just that piece of that piece of

213
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you are actually get that for you guys trying to sit. I was standing room so

214
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We could do the EMT are around this one. The, the target could be

215
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The checking out

216
00:25:48.840 --> 00:26:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know that the original memory. You know what that is. You and I both know what that is. And I don't even know the stories, but we both know that it's that that damage done. Okay.

217
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's about about him and you and your sister.

218
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But the events that happened. Currently, the current ones like Jocelyn.

219
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.120
Yeah.

220
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any connection to what happened with her.

221
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How you felt

222
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: A day after you did.

223
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The rap.

224
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the feeling you had

225
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.240
Bethany Shadid: You know,

226
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:59.130
Bethany Shadid: I caught myself a few times going to those dark places of feeling like

227
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.970
Bethany Shadid: Whatever, how should I say, I don't think I really

228
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.130
Bethany Shadid: Caught

229
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:18.960
Bethany Shadid: Or could verbalize the thoughts, but I, I, when I was in the moment. I remember telling myself.

230
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:32.220
Bethany Shadid: Okay, this isn't that like suffering can be temporary. You know the pain doesn't isn't content doesn't have to be constant.

231
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.070
Bethany Shadid: I had some pseudo pains.

232
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.870
Bethany Shadid: Kidney stone like pains.

233
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.450
Bethany Shadid: I

234
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:54.840
Bethany Shadid: felt an overwhelming sense of isolation.

235
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.610
Bethany Shadid: Um,

236
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.580
Bethany Shadid: And

237
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:14.040
Bethany Shadid: When I thought about my lifestyle because I think that's the whole thing. We're talking about

238
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.840
Bethany Shadid: caught myself like having to reassure myself that

239
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.720
Bethany Shadid: I've gotten so much better.

240
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:36.810
Bethany Shadid: I guess. A good example would be like I was. There's a lot of people that jog around my house and I was looking at these three girls, probably about my age or younger.

241
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.230
Bethany Shadid: jogging and

242
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.180
Bethany Shadid: You know this sense of always not being

243
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.290
Bethany Shadid: Like them or how do you say like

244
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.460
Bethany Shadid: People or active people like

245
00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.460
Bethany Shadid: Feeling

246
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:14.010
Bethany Shadid: Not Included or that's a lot or I can't be that even though I felt previously really proud of myself for walking every day and

247
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.420
Bethany Shadid: You know, stretching and doing all this stuff and and how good I

248
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:18.870
Feel

249
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.490
Bethany Shadid: You know, looking at that and and we're

250
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.910
Bethany Shadid: Kind of catching that negative

251
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.540
Bethany Shadid: Thought process of

252
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.300
Bethany Shadid: Well, you're just

253
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.410
Bethany Shadid: Trying you're never really going to be there.

254
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.030
Bethany Shadid: You know, kind of a

255
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.980
Bethany Shadid: Thing. So it was tough. It was like a, you know, this

256
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.700
Random

257
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.090
Bethany Shadid: But that's all I can tell you as far as

258
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.960
Bethany Shadid: What was coming up.

259
00:29:53.820 --> 00:30:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just see what the core emotion is you gave me a really thorough explanation of it. There was an awareness of this

260
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: My lifestyle a reassuring of yourself, you are getting better. But then this opposite of

261
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I'm never going to be included in this fit tribe in this clan in this group. Click whatever

262
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll never get it.

263
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: On a

264
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of isolation.

265
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The feeling is what, what's the one word.

266
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Lonely

267
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:46.200
Bethany Shadid: Let me know. I'm more lonely because quarantine stuff.

268
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But so here's my question I was asking if

269
00:30:49.800 --> 00:31:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we just did a little target mapping just now. So I wanted to see if you wanted to do some am Dr. And if you don't, we can do stew analysis regular old stuff that we do. That's fine.

270
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine with it. We can do whatever you want.

271
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But while we have this timing while you're not pressured with these other demands the timing might be kind of good.

272
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:17.790
Bethany Shadid: That's fine.

273
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's get our to our two oh you're on.

274
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: A big enough device right that there's about a foot.

275
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.720
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I

276
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.770
Bethany Shadid: Had okay

277
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Great, so

278
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Check your eyes, make sure we're seeing some good bilateral movement left and right. Let me just see if I do this.

279
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Go left and right because right now.

280
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm having trouble seeing because I'm not Center. I won't be able to see your eyes moving left and right. Can I, yeah, I know it seems picky, but I need to be dead center to see if your eyes are moving left or right, good. So here, let's do it again. So here we go.

281
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember you don't watch my finger, you're only looking to left right at the computer top the

282
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is correct. Oh, yeah. So let's do it again. But you're not looking at my finger just just I'm setting the pace. That's all. And I don't tend to set the pace. I don't tend to change it. And if I do, I tend to announce it

283
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So I will say, Oh, I'm going to go faster.

284
00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now. Are your eyes hurting from that movement.

285
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:44.070
Yeah.

286
00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

287
00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we're okay on that.

288
00:32:53.040 --> 00:33:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got, we've got this emotion of lonely and what is the belief about yourself with the feeling of only. What do you believe about yourself at that moment that negative thought

289
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.190
Bethany Shadid: No matter what I do.

290
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.820
Bethany Shadid: Right, that's what achievable.

291
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's the I Am.

292
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.240
Bethany Shadid: I'm

293
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.650
Bethany Shadid: Lazy

294
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.750
Bethany Shadid: Week.

295
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:30.990
Bethany Shadid: Damage

296
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.810
Bethany Shadid: Broken

297
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.730
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

298
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and the emotion is we've got lonely.

299
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And what the, the current activating event which is seeing these gals running out there can be any number of things, but that's that's which one of them and

300
00:33:53.610 --> 00:34:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So what would be positive. Let's go to a positive cognition, what would be a positive one. What would be great if you saw those those little joggers out there going, and

301
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.810
Bethany Shadid: Like, I can't wait till I running like that.

302
00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

303
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's a great thought now the I Am.

304
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I am capable. Okay, thank you. Beautiful.

305
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

306
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A bridge to the earliest memory of lonely.

307
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Really kind of feeling like

308
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Lonely the same kind of lonely.

309
00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.050
Bethany Shadid: My mom.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.090
Bethany Shadid: Had a picture will

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.810
Bethany Shadid: Pre puberty picture.

312
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.070
Bethany Shadid: When I was skinny.

313
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:14.580
Bethany Shadid: And

314
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.560
Bethany Shadid: She would talk to people.

315
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:29.610
Bethany Shadid: Even if she knew I was there about things about me. And I remember she was talking to my family, my close

316
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.340
Bethany Shadid: Extended family.

317
00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.760
Bethany Shadid: Martha at the cottage. I was in a

318
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.190
Bethany Shadid: swimsuit.

319
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:49.170
Bethany Shadid: And she pulled out this picture and I was telling my aunts and uncles. Look at her.

320
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.680
Bethany Shadid: Wasn't she so beautiful.

321
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.410

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.370
Bethany Shadid: And I'm not ever going to be able to

324
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go with that. Let's do it. I got you want you to hold the worst is that if maybe it's even a sound of hearing her say that whatever that WORST piece of that memory is that negative cognition.

325
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Lazy weak and damaged and here we go. These are going to be fastest as desensitisation. These are faster hold them in your working awareness, the worst image.

326
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, you don't have to look at me just left and right.

327
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:53.940

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:46.080
Bethany Shadid: My mom used to talk to other people about me. I used to

333
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.910
Bethany Shadid: Before I hit puberty. She used to brag about.

334
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.110
Bethany Shadid: How it looked and stuff and then

335
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.880

363
00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.270
Bethany Shadid: Standing within the family.

364
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:08.910
Bethany Shadid: And

Bethany Shadid: And

383
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:04.290
Bethany Shadid: I thought of specific instances where my sister and brother were also

384
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.650
Bethany Shadid: Or put in, put in similar situations with her.

385
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that. It happened to your siblings to Holy Trinity be with it. You can see the images that

386
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Were suffering alone or others going through that.

Bethany Shadid: I started

392
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.470
Bethany Shadid: What came up was

393
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.310
Bethany Shadid: How I used to

394
00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.820
Bethany Shadid: binge eat.

395
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.320
Bethany Shadid: Almost as a rebellious thing.

396
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.590
Bethany Shadid: In my teenage years.

397
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That hold that you've got something there. Hold that. And I

398
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you do that.

399
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lazy week damage, but for that. I did that as rebellion.

400
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This one will be a little faster just the top of your iPad.

401
00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Already got my pace. I'm not going to change it unless I announce it

402
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing, you're doing amazing

403
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We're frozen now.

404
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly.

405
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: A few more seconds.

406
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

407
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: In health

408
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And give that mind a beat of quiet.

409
00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: No chatter just face.

410
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What you got going on in that noggin.

411
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.050
Bethany Shadid: I think for getting

412
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.600
Bethany Shadid: That I

413
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.580
Bethany Shadid: I did it.

414
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:23.220
Bethany Shadid: The binge maintenance stuff in an active rebellion, or like not

415
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:27.870
Bethany Shadid: being active like the rest of my family.

416
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:38.790
Bethany Shadid: I think it played into like I did it myself.

417
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:48.000
Bethany Shadid: Or it plays into that feeling, because that's what my, my family took from it, I think.

418
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a positive experience. I did it to myself or is that a negative one.

419
00:46:54.900 --> 00:47:03.300
Bethany Shadid: Negative. Negative like all my health problems and everything you've always been blamed on me. There's nothing minutes

420
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:20.940
Bethany Shadid: Is. Oh, I'm so sorry. You have a genetic condition that you can't control. It's well you you didn't take care of yourself, you too much stress you don't eat right you don't you know

421
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And can we try something else with that just time we have, what if you go to a different place. This is totally from your therapist, but I just want to see what happens with this right one play with remember I've talked with you about that quiet rebellion.

422
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That one. Yeah. Anger resides. Like, I won't like making this cake at two in the morning for you because you made a commitment you made a sucky cake.

423
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't make me be happy about it. I'll do it make me sprite that one.

424
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to Benji as a rebellion thing.

425
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.530
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. I forgot. Go.

426
00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Go go there for just a second. And now try this on.

427
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure that

428
00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And then pull up

429
00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I am capable, the positive cognition and bring in the Holy Trinity, just as a sense of just, it's all over. I am capable and I used to binge eat as a rebellion thing.

430
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

431
00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And keep breathing into it.

432
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Has a lot to do all at once. I know.

433
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're amazing. Now you're doing outstanding.

434
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Just great. Few more seconds.

Bethany Shadid: It's wow it's

440
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:49.170
Bethany Shadid: Realizing I didn't have many ways to rebel or

441
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:56.190
Bethany Shadid: voice my opinion. It was like a silent rebellion and

442
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.180
Bethany Shadid: How

443
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:02.490

Bethany Shadid: body image issues.

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.300
Bethany Shadid: And I

448
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.250
Bethany Shadid: Put a lot of it on myself. She

449
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.410
Bethany Shadid: She put a lot of it on me but

450
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:20.670
Bethany Shadid: being okay with myself is actually

451
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.310
Bethany Shadid: Its own form of rebellion.

452
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.670
Bethany Shadid: You know, loving myself.

453
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:29.220
Bethany Shadid: Despite

454
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.650
Bethany Shadid: What she thinks

455
00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't it be something right, I'm gonna go eat knowing that this is not what she wants.

456
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.020
Bethany Shadid: I see that I see that possibility of being

457
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.350
Bethany Shadid: And I've been there.

458
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:23.160
Bethany Shadid: At different points in my life, accepting you know in my body and what I look

459
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:23.550
Like

460
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:25.890
Bethany Shadid: And it feels really good.

461
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:33.180
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. I forgot.

462
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Me said it. I did not have many ways to voice my opinion.

463
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You had no other ways you had no other ways.

464
00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What other ways did you have

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't heard from you yet.

466
00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:57.900

467
00:51:58.650 --> 00:51:59.280
Crazy.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, or I've got a I've got to have a way to pay attention to me. I've gotta have a way to feel myself in this world.

469
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it makes a lot of sense.

470
00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:34.800

477
00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I am capable. So typically, I'll ask a number. Let me just see how true it is today, right now.

Gwenevere Abriel: Lazy week damaged broken

493
00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: One to 10. Sorry. That's the difference. Yeah, one to 1010 is absolutely true.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:11.970
Bethany Shadid: That's

496
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:17.370
Bethany Shadid: Because if I'm being honest, I believe that

497
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.020
Bethany Shadid: More than I

498
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.190

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I'm not kidding. I think it can happen.

555
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.770
Bethany Shadid: You know that activating anger.

556
00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:34.980
Bethany Shadid: It's

557
00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.470
Bethany Shadid: I don't look at it. I don't, I'm not seeing

558
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:38.430
Bethany Shadid: It as a negative

559
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.350
Bethany Shadid: I'm seeing it as a

560
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:48.150
Bethany Shadid: You know, a form of, you know, me saying I'm not okay with this.

561

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:09.990
Bethany Shadid: How sad.

567
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.760
Bethany Shadid: It was to be her to be so worried about all that stuff.

568
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:18.150
Bethany Shadid: And fitting in, and looking a certain way.

569
00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:25.440

576
00:59:50.550 --> 01:00:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: See how you didn't have psychology, you didn't have an ally in this. But intuitively you knew you were going to have to cope

577
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: With this mixed message environment you live in, you're going to deal and you did the best you could you found a way to say I will not accept this miss truth. I will not

590
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:23.610

591
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And

592
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want

593
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.450
