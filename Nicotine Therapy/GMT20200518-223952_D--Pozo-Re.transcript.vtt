iPhone: Yeah, and I don't want to be going through that and then was her up in my face and know who I am, you know, I can't tolerate somebody talking to me that way. I usually normally would pop them in the face, especially if they're right up in my face.

26
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:43.770
iPhone: Is the way I am who I am, you know. Don't talk to me like that. But no matter what I say to her, she won't let me get one word in

31
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.230
Dominique Pozo: I'm concerned that you're going to leave for New Mexico and nothing's going to be addressed in a in a healthy way between you two and you're going to carry the pain of that.

32

35
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:52.620

36
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.070

75
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.020

81
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.440
Dominique Pozo: Well, it's abuse. It sounds like abuse, so

82
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.030
iPhone: Alex Oh, where I'm coming from. She has no

83
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.940

84
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.210
iPhone: even recognize that I'm walking better

85
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:48.000
iPhone: You know, everything is well yeah the money put yourself in that, you know, because I did try to kill myself. You know what I mean, just all this history stuff she's just using against me and

86
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.770
iPhone: So she could validate where what she

87
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.390
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

88
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.990

89
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.930

iPhone: Car

91
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.870
iPhone: To where we probably would have gotten to craxton

92
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:19.380
iPhone: Recognize that all the anger is coming from, is because I'm not the mother, she wished I could have been

93
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.430
Great.

94
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:31.020
iPhone: You know, and so therefore, I'm not good enough for her race. She is way because not because of me.

95
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.600
iPhone: You understand what I'm saying.

96
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:44.040
Dominique Pozo: She's well I hear that there's a very hurt wounded young person young part of her that still hasn't done any work to heal, especially if she's doing

97
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.350
Dominique Pozo: She's, she's really you know numbing out from

98
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.570
Dominique Pozo: From the pain of

99
00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:05.730
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think I wonder if you're willing to approach her and just say, you know, my therapist is willing to talk to the two of us. And I want to have some, some, you know,

100
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:17.190
Dominique Pozo: Healing conversation together. Are you open it. Let's just, you know, it's worth a try, and more for you than her. I mean, for sure. For her, but more for your

Dominique Pozo: Your price of mind and your heart because your in your recovery process to Patricia. And I'm wondering how is your drinking been

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:32.160
iPhone: It's been I just drink. Maybe I've been drinking, maybe a half a day.

103
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:38.700
iPhone: Uh huh. You know, yea, though I'm not drinking like getting drunk.

106
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.010
Dominique Pozo: Oh, totally. I mean, that's my concern is that it's not helping you.

107
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.210
iPhone: Skate because they don't have friends here.

108
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:05.400
iPhone: Can't really go anywhere. Cuz I can't really walk that well and I had my granddaughter, the whole time.

109
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:25.650
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm gonna bring up that I've heard you talk about as a great healthy place to put that energy and I'm going to encourage and invite you to make your art. It's the best therapy. I mean I I trained as an art therapist. I really believe in it.

110
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.090
Dominique Pozo: And you know that

111
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:36.090
iPhone: I do try to go to that. But it's been so heavy on me and then I I can't even think about like

112
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.810
iPhone: My inner you know it's I've taken him out her around my granddaughter.

113
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:51.660
iPhone: My future, you know, all these different things have been popping up and i i had no place to put it. You know,

114
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.200
Dominique Pozo: Patty, put it in your own and

115
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.350
Dominique Pozo: And use that. That's that is what makes the deepest

116
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:16.320
Dominique Pozo: pieces of work that touch other people because you're not alone. How many people have strained relations with their family members. How many people deal with alcohol abuse. How many people are have torn families that have so many heartbreaks in

117
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.940
iPhone: Our people

118
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:18.870
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

119
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:26.370
iPhone: Right, she's she tells I guess it's what she tells me when you need to do because I made the mistake of talking with

120
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.500
iPhone: my granddaughter's other grandmother, the baby daddy.

121
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:41.250
iPhone: And basically telling her while yeah I'm kind of depressed because she just up I come up here, you know, to get

122
00:12:41.760 --> 00:13:04.170
iPhone: You know in our, in our show me as just up in in these in these me with Mariah. You know, what am I think, how am I supposed to fill parent needs. She's been taught other other I could tell just by what she's saying, and then now the other grandma doesn't even really talked

123
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.100

iPhone: I get it, and I made the mistake by Chinese Chester. Yeah.

126
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:27.840
Dominique Pozo: I'm hearing a couple of things I'm hearing this, you don't have your community of support there you're reaching out and it's just you don't have your community.

127
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:37.320
Dominique Pozo: And I think as long as you remain there. I think about art is a big support for you and it's

128
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.510
Dominique Pozo: It's there you have it. It's something that's so natural for you.

129
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.210
iPhone: I'm really gonna focus on trying to leave on Thursday.

130
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.850
iPhone: I mean, that's pretty much the only good I could do

131
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.420
iPhone: And

132
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.080
iPhone: To me that she wants me to leave anyway.

133
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.880
iPhone: You know she she can't stand me she really can

134
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.070
iPhone: Just

135
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.020
iPhone: I can say one thing, and she squashes it

136
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:18.660
iPhone: You know, I mean, it's pain fun. Yeah. I understand it yet. I'm like, wait a minute, you know,

137
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.850
iPhone: And then she had the nerve to be, why did I come up here.

138
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.300
iPhone: Asking me to come up here.

139
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:45.390
iPhone: Now, and this is all you wanted was for me to watch your daughter for three weeks. Will you go on our mess bench wasting all your emails check income tax return.

140
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.840
iPhone: And your baby daddies money.

141
00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:08.340
iPhone: Only person on the journey I've been really words like talk with like is my dad and I can't be putting out my dad. He told me I said just leave. Call the police and leave.

142
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.370
iPhone: You know, but I don't want to make a job. I like that. I don't want to go out that way.

143
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:25.710
