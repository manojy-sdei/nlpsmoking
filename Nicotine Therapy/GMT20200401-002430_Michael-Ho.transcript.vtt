7
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:19.500
Michael Hoefer: And I'm going to be doing your intake today. So we have about 3040 minutes where we're going to talk, I'm going to ask you a little bit about your opiate use but also about your medical and psychiatric history, and then we'll come up with a plan together afterwards.

8
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.910
Vincent Chopyk: Alright, sounds good.

9
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
Michael Hoefer: Great, so I can just start off by asking you how you heard about bright heart health.

10
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.920
Vincent Chopyk: My actually I saw Dr. To me, the tele doc service and he let me know about you guys, I went through that.

11
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.620
Michael Hoefer: Oh, cool. All right. And what's bringing you into treatment today and how can we be helpful.

12
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.480
Vincent Chopyk: So I'm just, I'm when I stopped using the opiates, about a month ago and

13
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.310
Vincent Chopyk: I'm just like, I was looking for some I was trying to get into a couple of different rehab facilities.

14
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.880
Vincent Chopyk: But they were not taking new patients because the whole coronavirus thing. And so then when I heard that there was an online one. I was like, Oh, perfect. So

15
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:24.120
Vincent Chopyk: I came here and I was just looking for some like therapy and help with because I've already made it through the withdrawal and everything and I haven't really been having much cravings, but just looking for, like, I don't know, help with like coping mechanisms and things like that.

16
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.800
Michael Hoefer: Some support and coping.

17
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.030
Vincent Chopyk: Skills and okay

18
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.830
Michael Hoefer: Excellent. So

19
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.210
Michael Hoefer: Can you tell me about, you know, the, you know, the first time you ever used opiates and what that experience was like.

20
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.800
Vincent Chopyk: The first time was in Vegas.

21
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:53.490
Vincent Chopyk: I went to Vegas with my friends and my girlfriend and my girlfriend had some she had had she's had some health issues in the past. And so she had a surgery and

22
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:05.010
Vincent Chopyk: They gave her pain pills and she didn't like them and made her stomach hurts. She just had him sitting around and one day I just was like, hey, I'm you know we're in Vegas. I might as well try

23
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.320
Vincent Chopyk: And I took that and

24
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:17.880
Vincent Chopyk: It just made me like I've always had kind of like some social anxiety and just kind of anxiety in general and

25
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:31.440
Vincent Chopyk: Like confidence issues and it just kind of like made me not care so much about like what other people think and kind of gave me so like a confidence that I've never felt before. So I liked him that it

26
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:41.520
Vincent Chopyk: Happened like just like not very often. I started like once a month, maybe, and then it just got more and more until the turn into an issue.

27
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.210
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. And that first time was how long ago was that

28
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.970
Vincent Chopyk: That was probably like two and a half or three years ago. Okay.

29
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.940
Michael Hoefer: And so then, from that you started taking it.

30
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.470
Michael Hoefer: You know, every once awhile to more and more regularly and what type of opiates. Were you mostly taking

31
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:12.840
Vincent Chopyk: At first it was hydrocodone like North goes and then it went to then when I burn through the supply that she had had just sitting around, I started buying them on the street and it was more often oxy Kota

32
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.030
Vincent Chopyk: Sure. Okay.

33
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.130
Michael Hoefer: And have you ever used heroin or fentanyl or anything like that.

34
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.180
Vincent Chopyk: No, just the hydro and oxycodone

35
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.750
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And how would you use them usually

36
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.300
Vincent Chopyk: I would just take them orally.

37
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.510
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Did you ever chew them so that they would break up faster or dissolve them and liquid so that they would

38
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.990
Vincent Chopyk: Hit, you know, nothing like that. I was really just taking them. Yeah, I didn't. Yeah, okay.

39
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.310
Michael Hoefer: And did you ever snort them or inject them or anything like that. I

40
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.610
Vincent Chopyk: One time I tried snorting, some of it, but I didn't like

41
00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:08.910
Vincent Chopyk: I didn't really it was hydrocodone and it was very low like five milligram pill or something and I had just heard that that was something you could do. So I tried it, like maybe once and I didn't really like feel anything. So I just continue to take it orally.

42
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.630
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. And what type of doses of when you started, especially when you started buying the oxy code on what type of dosing where you take you

43
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:30.300
Vincent Chopyk: In the beginning it was like just five milligrams of oxy or maybe 10 at a time, then as it went on, it started to get like to 20 milligrams. Each time I would take it and it was

44
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:41.430
Vincent Chopyk: Like twice to three times a day. I would do it like when I got off work. And then a few hours later, and then a few hours later at like 11 or something. Gotcha.

45
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.310
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. So kind of escalating doses.

46
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.460
Michael Hoefer: escalating tolerance and and how much were you spending because oxy cotton could be expensive.

47
00:05:50.820 --> 00:06:01.470
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, it was a lot. I was burning through a lot of my money. It was like like honey, like a least a couple hundred a week or so. Yeah.

48
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.690
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, run out of money and I I worked at a pharmacy for a long time and

49
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:29.040
Vincent Chopyk: ended up going back and I didn't have the intention of doing it, but it ended up. I ended up taking pills from work and I got caught doing that and was charged with embezzlement a misdemeanor. So now I've been dealing with that kind of that's kind of what gave me the wake up call.

50
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.790
Vincent Chopyk: To stop and get some help.

51
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.630
Michael Hoefer: So that experience was a was a clear kind of wake up call, and I

52
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.290
Michael Hoefer: Clearly not in a good direction and

53
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.410
Michael Hoefer: I'm doing things that I didn't think I would do, you know,

54
00:06:43.470 --> 00:07:00.240
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, like I've just never been that type, and I loved that job to like I worked there for so long. And then I left for a little while and then I came back because I hated the job that I got. And yeah like I love the job. I loved all the people there and I just screwed everything up.

55
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:11.790
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah, that's a, that's a tough spot. And, um, you know, other things. Like, have you ever had like an overdose to where you need to, nor can

56
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.620
Michael Hoefer: That

57
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.010
Vincent Chopyk: My dad's a pharmacist as well.

58
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:28.260
Vincent Chopyk: Like, and so I've always kind of felt like in control of like using drugs recreationally just because I knew about them like more than the average person because my dad's a pharmacist.

59
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:38.970
Vincent Chopyk: And so I never really had issues like that. It was more the like I wasn't in it for like, like a peak high like trying to get a bunch at one time it was more like longevity.

60
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:49.680
Vincent Chopyk: I wanted to like keep them and take just the same amount like and trying to keep them as long as I could, like, keep going. There wasn't like a really like a binge type of thing.

61
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.720
Michael Hoefer: Is more time to like maintain that level of

62
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.350
Vincent Chopyk: Content.

63
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.900
Michael Hoefer: Or good feeling or just stress reduction.

64
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.300
Vincent Chopyk: Over. Yeah, definitely. Okay.

65
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:04.290
Michael Hoefer: And does your to your parents at all our family know about your use. And what's been going on.

66
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.270
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, now that I wasn't that I had to call my mom to bail me out of jail.

67
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.470
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, that was, that was pretty tough. That was kind of

68
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.720
Michael Hoefer: A hard phone call. Yeah, I was.

69
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:27.030
Vincent Chopyk: I had kind of mentioned to them before like nobody had any idea how much I was doing it. Mm hmm. But I kind of mentioned that I was like taking them once in a while.

70
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:38.940
Vincent Chopyk: Just because I liked how it made me feel and but yeah. Nobody really knew how much to the extent. But then once I once I had to have them bail me out. Like I told them everything

71
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.580
Michael Hoefer: And are they are they supportive of you kind of getting treatment and

72
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.680
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, they are. They've actually been really good about it like they've

73
00:08:50.790 --> 00:09:00.960
Vincent Chopyk: They've approached this time DIFFERENT THAN THEY'VE approached things before, which is nice. Like, usually they kind of come down on me hard, but this time they've been like being a little more

74
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.130
Vincent Chopyk: Just yeah like supportive rather than angry.

75
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:22.590
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Great. So, so some of the, you know, issues or problems, the obese is causing your life is, you know, issues at work legal issues, issues with family financial issues. Any other things that that that the problems that you're open uses cause you

76
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:33.000
Vincent Chopyk: My relationship. I've been with my girlfriend Diana for like almost six years and, like, once I started doing that.

77
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:43.020
Vincent Chopyk: Taking them a lot than our relationship started to get pretty rocky and right now she's back home and Colombia. She's from Colombia and

78
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:57.450
Vincent Chopyk: She might be stuck there for a while and right now I don't know if when she comes back. I don't know if we're still going to be in a relationship, but we'll see. We'll see what happens there. But yeah, I kind of messed up my relationship to

79
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:12.360
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and was. That was the tension in the relationship about you just kind of being intoxicated not available or was it about you kind of not being truthful or was it about like, you know, sexual effects of opiates, or a combination of them or what

80
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:29.790
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, it was kind of like, yeah, it was emotionally less available like just having the pills was like the only thing I like cared about, like, really. And yeah, just being less like helpful and supportive around the apartment and like

81
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:43.080
Vincent Chopyk: With the sexual stuff it, it kind of helped actually with that because like my sexual appetite is like a lot higher than hers. She's had

82
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:53.070
Vincent Chopyk: She had a hysterectomy pretty young. And so she's gone through menopause and so like her sex drive isn't always

83
00:10:53.550 --> 00:11:13.950
Vincent Chopyk: You know as high as mine is. And so that kind of caused some friction before in our relationship. But then like with the pills. I had kind of a lower sex drive, like I wasn't as, like, yeah, just wasn't as high. So, but all the other things just send it up. Yeah, like kind of ruin it.

84
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.410
Michael Hoefer: And are you guys about the same age or she, a little bit older, are you a little bit older.

85
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:26.550
Vincent Chopyk: She's a little bit older, she's I'm 26 and she is 30 yeah 30 about to be 31

86
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.670
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. So not that big of a difference, but

87
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.870
Yeah, okay.

88
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:46.320
Michael Hoefer: And did you, you know, how was it for you. It sounds like you've stopped now for a month, but had you had had previously like attempts to quit and you know how to then they weren't successful or weren't successful, how did that go

89
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:57.090
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I had tried a couple times and there was a few times where I just ran out and couldn't get more where I would kind of experience that withdraw and

90
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:10.170
Vincent Chopyk: Then there was a few times where I just wanted to stop because I nobody else really knew because I didn't really tell tell anyone about it, but I can tell that it was becoming an issue, and like I just wanted

91
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:22.650
Vincent Chopyk: To stop and then it would be I would stop and make it through the withdrawals and would be feeling okay and then like a week or two later on a Friday I would

92
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:34.560
Vincent Chopyk: Just get more and then just say go back from the start, start over. And that happened, maybe like three or four times like where I tried and then just went back to it.

93
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.530
Michael Hoefer: And when you went back to it. Did you ever did you feel

94
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:44.220
Michael Hoefer: Like it was ever because you like stress or boredom, or was it just kind of like a craving and it just would just hit you and you kind of

95
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.940
Michael Hoefer: triggers for you going back

96
00:12:48.300 --> 00:13:07.950
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I think it was more like stress and boredom, like it was just like on Friday, like I wanted to do something to make me. Yeah, kind of a stress relief and make me feel like I don't know. I was doing something like other than just sitting around my apartment. So I would take those

97
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.570
Vincent Chopyk: Okay.

98
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:17.760
Michael Hoefer: And have you ever taken either methadone in a tablet or liquid form. I mean, take

99
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:30.450
Vincent Chopyk: One time I only once, I found a methadone on the ground at work. And I took that because I knew that it was used to kind of help like people get through.

100
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:38.940
Vincent Chopyk: Like I wasn't exactly sure how it works. But I took that just to see like if it would help me like stop taking it. And one of the times and then

101
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:50.220
Vincent Chopyk: I don't really remember like I remember taking it and then not taking anything else for a couple days, but then like once it kind of wore off. I was just right back.

102
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.600
Michael Hoefer: And have you ever taken buprenorphine or Suboxone before

103
00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:00.930
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, there was a couple. I like. Again, I found because there's always pills falling around everywhere at work.

104
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:14.190
Vincent Chopyk: And like I found a couple of buprenorphine on the ground is the only ones. I actually like took out of prescription bottles. When I got caught for that was the, those were only

105
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.540
Vincent Chopyk: hydrocodone oxycodone, but like if I have found any sort of opiate on the ground or anything. I would just take it.

106
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:35.760
Vincent Chopyk: And the buprenorphine i i took like twice, I think, and that like I mean for a couple days. I didn't have any you know like craving or anything. I didn't like it made me feel

107
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:47.730
Vincent Chopyk: Like even doubt and but the at once, it would wear off after a couple days and I would just go back to it like I wasn't really taking the buprenorphine to. It was really just to

108
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:53.100
Vincent Chopyk: See Cambodia, just the longevity, just like because I knew it would last couple days.

109
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.100
Vincent Chopyk: So just so I wouldn't run out as fast

110
00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:03.210
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. Okay. And have you ever taken now trek zone or the vivid trial injection

111
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.800
Vincent Chopyk: No, no, no.

112
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:15.120
Michael Hoefer: Okay, and how about other substance use. Do you have you ever felt like, well, I guess, I guess, most importantly, currently are using any other substances right now.

113
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.370
Vincent Chopyk: No, I mean I am taking

114
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.160
Vincent Chopyk: What's it called sertraline is Zoloft, I'm taking that now.

115
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:31.980
Vincent Chopyk: I my doctor started me at 25 and then we moved up to 50 and then I just recently saw a

116
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:42.330
Vincent Chopyk: Doctor through the tele doc, the one that let me know about you guys, and he moved me up to 100 because he said that it helps the anxiety at higher doses.

117
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:55.350
Vincent Chopyk: And other than that I use. I had been taking Adderall. For years, like since high school. There was a couple times when I took a break, like a year off of taking Adderall.

118
00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:06.990
Vincent Chopyk: And that I never really like had a problem with like I always took what I was prescribed and never like turned into like I didn't feel like I was abusing the Adderall, but

119
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:19.650
Vincent Chopyk: Once I started to take the pain pills, it kind of like my tolerance for the Adderall went up a lot. I'm not sure if that's but then I

120
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:40.740
Vincent Chopyk: Like it started to be like, I don't know it. So then I stopped taking the Adderall as well. Once I just because I never didn't want to take it forever. So once I quit the pain pills and this whole thing happened. I just decided that might as well get them all in one swoop there.

121
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.120
Michael Hoefer: That's so it sounds like you were diagnosed ADHD.

122
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.950
Michael Hoefer: Like as a child, or as a teenager.

123
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.570
Vincent Chopyk: As a teenager.

124
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.830
Michael Hoefer: Okay, and the Adderall. You're taking was immediate release or extended release.

125
00:16:53.730 --> 00:17:00.390
Vincent Chopyk: I, at first it was concert, which I think is Ritalin extended release and then

126
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:12.840
Vincent Chopyk: That was in high school and then in college, I took a year off my first year college. I wasn't taking any and then I was having trouble in school. So I started taking the instant release Admiral

127
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:29.400
Vincent Chopyk: And then it was that I took another break for about a year, like two years after that and then continued and then it had been just until about a month ago. So for like a good for four years. I was taking it. Okay, gotcha.

128
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.620
Michael Hoefer: And as far as the sertraline you've been on that, for how long now.

129
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.780
Vincent Chopyk: That's been maybe like three months. So I started taking it.

130
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:47.940
Vincent Chopyk: Before I stopped while I was still taking the pain pills and everything. So it's been the end, maybe three or four months.

131
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:53.400
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And do you notice anything from the sertraline especially now that you've been off opiates for a month.

132
00:17:53.910 --> 00:18:08.160
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah. Now I've just recently started to feel a little bit better, like just less like that for a while there. I just had no energy at all like I was also taking Clonidine because they said it would help with the withdrawal.

133
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:21.090
Vincent Chopyk: And then once I I ran out of those and I stopped taking them for a couple days and then I felt like a lot better, like a little like more energy and just less like depressed overall like

134
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:32.040
Vincent Chopyk: It was getting really bad there for like a couple weeks, like, a week ago or so, like where I was just like laying on the couch all day like I wasn't showering or anything, and

135
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:51.270
Vincent Chopyk: Like not brushing my teeth and like it was just bad. And then once I stopped taking the Clonidine, now I have a little bit more energy, but I still like don't feel back to normal completely. I still feel like yeah just lack of like motivation to do anything and stuff like that.

136
00:18:52.140 --> 00:19:03.270
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, I mean, it sounds like you know a couple things could be going on. One is like you've gone through the acute withdrawal of opiates, but there's still can be like protracted abstinence symptoms which can last weeks to months, you know,

137
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.580
Michael Hoefer: That's often like depression, anxiety, just for a day or two ability, things like that.

138
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.670
Michael Hoefer: And then the other thing is, you know, I don't know, but it sounds like you could have

139
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.880
Michael Hoefer: Also been, you know, struggling with depression as well.

140
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.310
Vincent Chopyk: So yeah, I think I was. Yeah, yeah.

141
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.240
Michael Hoefer: And did it, did it ever get so bad, where you're feeling suicidal.

142
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:38.520
Vincent Chopyk: Not like maybe passively like once I got like I never had any real intention of doing it, but like when I got busted and I was sitting in the jail cell like I kind of like was just like, and I lost my job and just like feeling kind of hopeless and

143
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:47.340
Vincent Chopyk: So I kind of had some passive thoughts but like nothing like serious like I never had any real like intention to do anything.

144
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.570
Michael Hoefer: And have you ever had a suicide attempt or tried to harm yourself in the past.

145
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.220
Vincent Chopyk: No. Okay.

146
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:53.850
Good.

147
00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:04.440
Michael Hoefer: And have you, you know, as far as these days do you do you smoke cigarettes to use cannabis. Do you drink. Do you do any of those things.

148
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.240
Vincent Chopyk: I don't drink very much

149
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:22.290
Vincent Chopyk: Like maybe like I'll have one drink at my grandmother's house when we go there for dinner. Like, it's not nothing like nothing much. And then I do smoke tobacco and I do use like smoke marijuana

150
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:33.480
Vincent Chopyk: And like the tobacco. I use this. It's not cigarettes. It's called. It's like pipe tobacco and I smoke it out of my bomb that I use for my the weed.

151
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.000
Vincent Chopyk: It's called Dhaka

152
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:53.790
Vincent Chopyk: Kind of not very popular. But, and it's just like I just take one bowl of Dhaka and I do them separately. So I haven't been smoking as much we because the anxieties been given me a lot like paranoia and stuff.

153
00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:02.760
Vincent Chopyk: So I've been kind of laying off that like if I can't fall asleep at night, I might take one but then that kind of doesn't help because then I get all

154
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:14.400
Vincent Chopyk: In my head and anxious and that makes me stay up and and I've been staying up to like four in the morning and sleeping so like noon or one in the afternoon, like

155
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.990
Michael Hoefer: That's not ideal but that's like going back to teenage sleep cycle.

156
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.280
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, it's driving me

157
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.270
Vincent Chopyk: Crazy. Yeah.

158
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:28.110
Michael Hoefer: And the other thing that it sounds like you're experiencing, which is, you know, actually quite common is as people get older.

159
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:40.470
Michael Hoefer: And as they have other drug experiences or other mental health experiences that cannabis. Can the way it affects you can really change. You know when you're a teenager, it can be quite fun and laughing and eating hanging out with friends and then

160
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:46.590
Michael Hoefer: As you get older can sometimes switch to where it can be quite angiogenic for make you very self conscious or make you paranoid.

161
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:57.750
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and it's, it's just, it can be very different. And it's a learning process to kind of learn about that and also kind of be like okay, it's not like it used to be. And even though my mind tells me it's going to do this for me.

162
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.090
Michael Hoefer: And actually, isn't that it's actually this really

163
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.470
Michael Hoefer: A verse of experience.

164
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.540
Michael Hoefer: Yeah yeah

165
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.330
Michael Hoefer: So that's a learning process and certainly something we can you know help you with and work on

166
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:20.550
Michael Hoefer: Because definitely you know in your position with, you know, not only that potentially the cognitive stuff from ADHD, but also some of the anxiety stuff usually cannabis makes both of those worse, you know. Yeah.

167
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.390
So,

168
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:30.900
Michael Hoefer: Okay, then you know any other things like, you know, have you ever now or in the past felt like you had a problem with cocaine or math or

169
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.550
Michael Hoefer: Anything else Benz or anything like that. No.

170
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.560
Vincent Chopyk: Just the pain pills and dad are all, I guess. Yeah.

171
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:52.290
Michael Hoefer: All right, and so some other kind of more background questions. Have you ever been put on a 5150 year but in a psychiatric hospital.

172
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.150
Vincent Chopyk: No. Okay.

173
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:59.370
Michael Hoefer: And have you seen a psychiatrist or therapist for periods of time.

174
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.930
Michael Hoefer: No. Okay.

175
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.870
Michael Hoefer: Never. Okay, so even the ADHD treatment was from like a primary care doctor and

176
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:07.650
Yeah.

177
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:13.200
Michael Hoefer: All right. And have you ever been in substance abuse treatment in the past.

178
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.040
Vincent Chopyk: No. Now before before this now. Okay.

179
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.130
Michael Hoefer: All right, great. Well, you're new to treatment. So

180
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:20.640
Welcome

181
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.830
To new experience.

182
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.760
Michael Hoefer: Okay and medical issues. Do you have any medical issues we need to know about.

183
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:38.790
Vincent Chopyk: No, not really. The only thing which I actually is better now was my blood pressure was kind of going. That's like my

184
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:51.180
Vincent Chopyk: It was just like not consistently super high but like sometimes it would be really high. Sometimes it would be normal. And this was over, because I had to go to my doctor every month to get a prescription for Adderall.

185
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:58.770
Vincent Chopyk: Mm hmm. And so she kind of was concerned about my blood pressure because it was just so weird and I

186
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:08.760
Vincent Chopyk: She didn't know that I was taking the pain pills, which I think is what was causing those like differences and blood pressure because sometimes I would go in and be

187
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:20.250
Vincent Chopyk: Could do going through minor withdrawals because I ran out. Sometimes I would be on them like at the moment when I went in and so she put me on Lisinopril for that.

188
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.470
Vincent Chopyk: And the Clonidine once I went to her after I stopped taking everything

189
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:35.640
Vincent Chopyk: But then like last night I checked my blood pressure and it was like 132 over 78 or something. So it's kind of gone back to normal now.

190
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.050
Michael Hoefer: Okay, great.

191
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.670
Michael Hoefer: And you're at this point are you still taking them will send a pro.

192
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.440
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, though I sent a pro. Yeah.

193
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.910
Michael Hoefer: And you stop the quantity

194
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:51.210
Michael Hoefer: Yeah okay and any other history of like surgeries or problems with your heart, lungs, kidneys,

195
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.610
Vincent Chopyk: Liver and things like that. No, no. Okay.

196
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:58.770
Michael Hoefer: Any allergies any medications bad reactions any medications.

197
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.840
Vincent Chopyk: Not that I know. Okay.

198
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:09.120
Michael Hoefer: Anybody in your family that you know siblings parents aunts, uncles, that have addiction issues that you know

199
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:24.570
Vincent Chopyk: Well, my, my grandfather has been taking. He was a fisherman and so his back, and he had cancer at like 50 so he's just had a bunch of health issues, like, ever since I was born, and he

200
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:36.960
Vincent Chopyk: Has been taking pain pills, my whole life and in the be like when I was younger, it didn't seem like it was an issue like he was taking them to see at pain but, like, more recently, it kind of is like

201
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:50.100
Vincent Chopyk: I don't know the that's the only thing I think it's more come become an addiction like thing than it is like, it's not just pain management and the more like it's more about taking that next dose for him.

202
00:25:52.140 --> 00:26:01.020
Vincent Chopyk: And my dad has. I mean, he's been drinking. Ever since he's a pharmacist and he was working clinical at the hospital here in town.

203
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:09.600
Vincent Chopyk: And he was okay then. And then he got switched to an office job and he started drinking a lot. And so that's been for the past like

204
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:21.720
Vincent Chopyk: Few years like four years, maybe he's been he drinks like more than he probably should like i think i would i would say he's an alcoholic. You know, we've never talked about it or anything.

205
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.860
Michael Hoefer: Is anybody else in your family ever expressed concern about his drinking

206
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.030
Vincent Chopyk: My mom kind of has like we've talked about it a little bit.

207
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:40.470
Vincent Chopyk: Like she didn't overtly say it was like that. He's an alcoholic. But she we've we've can express concern to each other about it. So yeah.

208
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:47.910
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And anybody in the family with the history of psychiatric issues like depression, bipolar schizophrenia, anything like that.

209
00:26:48.180 --> 00:27:04.470
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I mean there. It's there a Sicilian family. And they're like, my grandfather was born in Sicily, so they're, they're not very open to like therapy and stuff. I think everybody in the family can use

210
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:11.190
Vincent Chopyk: Some sort of therapy. But yeah, there's like some OCD over there on my mom's side.

211
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:29.280
Vincent Chopyk: And then on my dad's side. My uncle has skits like I would, I think, I don't know if he's ever been diagnosed, but he's he's like paranoid schizophrenia. He thinks the government is coming after him and he scrambles his phone number. If he calls. He does all this weird kind of stuff.

212
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:44.580
Vincent Chopyk: In my brother. I think my half brother. I think he has been struggling with depression for a long time. Just undiagnosed and like he kind of just sits in his house and plays video games all day. That's kind of all he does.

213
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:55.530
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I think there's like a fair amount on either side. It's kind of like both ends the thing. It's like OCD on one side and then the spectrum. On the other

214
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:56.700
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha.

215
00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:03.180
Michael Hoefer: So you've got some genetic risks, not only for, you know, substance use, but also for some psychiatric mental health.

216
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:03.600
Vincent Chopyk: Issues.

217
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.890
Michael Hoefer: On both sides that

218
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.610
Vincent Chopyk: You gotta be

219
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:14.790
Michael Hoefer: Careful about and navigate yeah okay and then just some more background questions. Where were you born and where did you grow up, mostly

220
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.250
Vincent Chopyk: I was born in Monterey and I grew up here in Monterey still live here.

221
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:29.760
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, because my whole my mom's whole family big Italian family in town lives here. So yeah, we've just been born and raised here.

222
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.170
Michael Hoefer: Okay, and how far along. Did you go in school.

223
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:43.980
Vincent Chopyk: I have a bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies. I got that done, which I'm glad I got that done before all this stuff started to happen.

224
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.730
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I have a bachelor's

225
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.530
Michael Hoefer: And where did you go to school for that.

226
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:54.930
Vincent Chopyk: at CSU MB is the California State University of Monterey Bay.

227
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:55.860
Michael Hoefer: Oh, cool.

228
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:03.960
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And it sounds like most of your work experience has been like pharmacy technician, as we call it, or for me.

229
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.140
Vincent Chopyk: Now, I was just a clerk and it was like it's a it was a family owned pharmacy.

230
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:17.820
Vincent Chopyk: For like I worked there for five years right out of high school until the family sold it to Rite Aid and then

231
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:28.350
Vincent Chopyk: I left once right a control that I left for a while and worked at another job here in town at its shop calm as a website.

232
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:41.940
Vincent Chopyk: And then I hated that job so that I quit that and then I ended up going back and working because my old manager still manages the store, even though it's right now. And then I went back to work for her for

233
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.250
Vincent Chopyk: A month or so before I got cut taking the pills.

234
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:58.740
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And do you have any. I mean, was working in pharmacy. Is that something that you've thought about as a career or do you have any thoughts about kind of stuff you want to do career wise.

235
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:17.550
Vincent Chopyk: I'm not. I mean, my intention with the Liberal Studies degree was to like be a teacher. And my mom, I have a bunch of family that's an education. And so I was kind of planning on that. But once I got done and I went to the teaching credential program like the orientation for it.

236
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:35.370
Vincent Chopyk: I don't know, I kind of just got cold feet. I guess that that orientation meeting and I just decided I would go and work somewhere and kind of explore, like, see if what I really wanted to do, but I still kind of am lost when it comes to what I want to do is like career.

237
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:43.890
Michael Hoefer: You're, you're in the you're figuring out kind of what what you want to do kind of figuring out what your what the meaning in your life is and kind of

238
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:44.490
Michael Hoefer: Waiting on

239
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.780
Michael Hoefer: What path. You want to go on.

240
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:51.180
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, okay. And have you ever been married or do you have any children.

241
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.490
Vincent Chopyk: No. Okay.

242
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:54.570
Great.

243
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.780
Michael Hoefer: All right, and then

244
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:07.140
Michael Hoefer: You know, I think we talked a little bit about just going back to some of the mental health issues. It sounds like you know anxiety levels running high, just in general.

245
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.030
Michael Hoefer: And also potentially some social

246
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:18.630
Michael Hoefer: Anxiety, which is around kind of confidence around. I imagine public speaking or being judged or actually center of attention type stuff.

247
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.350
Yeah.

248
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.000
Michael Hoefer: It sounds like the depression, mostly in line with the

249
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.310
Michael Hoefer: opiate use but may also be something that would should be monitored going forward.

250
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.990
Michael Hoefer: And then ADHD is something

251
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.290
Michael Hoefer: You've had a diagnosis, since a teenager and been treated

252
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.430
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah periods of time.

253
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:42.750
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever had things like you know hearing voices when other people aren't around or seeing things when other people aren't around

254
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:43.560
Vincent Chopyk: Now,

255
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.810
Michael Hoefer: They're annoyed psychotic symptoms.

256
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.490
Vincent Chopyk: I mean parrot like the paranoid. But now, not to the point where it's like psychotic or hearing things or anything like that.

257
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:55.740
Vincent Chopyk: Gotcha.

258
00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.150
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Is it most, is it more paranoia, like people are, you know,

259
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.120
Michael Hoefer: talking bad about you or

260
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.590
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, that kind of stuff.

261
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.740
Michael Hoefer: But not like the government is trying to

262
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.460
Yeah.

263
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:10.950
Michael Hoefer: No. Okay.

264
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:20.910
Michael Hoefer: Have you ever had a period of time in your life where you like stayed up for multiple days without using drugs and felt like you didn't need any sleep, but you just had like all the energy in the world and

265
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:40.080
Vincent Chopyk: No, I've only had that when I was taking the drugs. I like there was a couple nights where especially when I was trying to quit taking them where I would just, I went through the whole night without sleeping at all. And like just didn't feel like I felt tired, but no, not like sleepy.

266
00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.130
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, there was a couple of times like that, but never before.

267
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.020
Michael Hoefer: Okay.

268
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.120
Michael Hoefer: All right.

269
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:53.250
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Well, those are the the main questions. I need to ask you kind of for intake.

270
00:32:54.450 --> 00:33:03.810
Michael Hoefer: Thank you for answering. I know there's, it's a lot. Do you have any questions for me at this time, or is there anything that I didn't ask you about or feel like you know it's important for me to know right now.

271
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:19.260
Vincent Chopyk: I'm like, I guess the only thing else is like recently, the only thing that's made me want to like even not really want to, but think about like having like a craving kind of

272
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:35.610
Vincent Chopyk: Is been i've been gaining weight like you recently, like with them since I stopped and that like once I started to notice it like I was like Oh my, like, cuz I had an issue with like how I look. Always and

273
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:43.560
Vincent Chopyk: Like the pills was kind of helping that because it was I was only eating for sustenance, like I wasn't eating for pleasure or anything.

274
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:51.120
Vincent Chopyk: Mm hmm. Now that I've noticed like some weight gain. That was the I noticed the first time that I thought like, oh, like

275
00:33:52.200 --> 00:34:02.400
Vincent Chopyk: Not that I needed to take them, but just that, like it was weird. It was kind of like a craving, but also just kind of like a fear of gaining this weight like made me kind of scare be

276
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:09.000
Vincent Chopyk: kind of scared me back towards wanting to take them. That was like the first because I was absolutely

277
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:24.960
Vincent Chopyk: Done for especially like after I got caught. I was completely done with the pills like there was no chance. I was gonna ever you know relapse or anything. And then once I started. Notice that it made me like just kind of like, I don't know, I had the thought.

278
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:25.890
Vincent Chopyk: So,

279
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:39.330
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, that's a that's an that's an important one to track because certainly opiate use, you know, you don't have an appetite, you lose weight, there's like a whole heroin chic thing, not that you're using heroin. But that's kind of the hype, you know,

280
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:41.790
Michael Hoefer: How much weight have you gained

281
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:49.200
Vincent Chopyk: I would say probably about 1010 pounds, maybe right now 10 or maybe 12

282
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.250
Michael Hoefer: And where you are right now compared to like the heaviest you've ever been.

283
00:34:54.030 --> 00:35:00.990
Vincent Chopyk: I'm not quite at the heaviest I've ever been. I'm probably like 10 to 15 pounds under the heaviest

284
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:10.800
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. But right now, are you, what would your, you know, what's your kind of I were, what's your weight right now. What's your ideal weight would you say

285
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.930
Vincent Chopyk: Like right now, I'm probably like 190 or some like around that.

286
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:26.970
Vincent Chopyk: But my ideal weight is like 180 to like 178 so like, like that's kind of where I hovered for a while, when I was okay with how I looked

287
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:33.660
Vincent Chopyk: So yeah, that's like right in the middle of the heaviest and the lightest

288
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.770
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. So you're about 10 to 12 pounds away from where you'd like to be

289
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.960
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. And are you, you know, are you exercising these days.

290
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:53.640
Vincent Chopyk: And no, I haven't been, I've been kind of like trying to gear up to go for runs and do that kind of stuff, but I haven't been able to muster the energy

291
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.420
Michael Hoefer: I mean, it's hard. You know when you're going through withdrawals and

292
00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.680
Michael Hoefer: That is

293
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:09.660
Michael Hoefer: Certainly something that's really helpful, especially in recovery and like you're going through a really big transition right now of coming off of the opiates and getting kind of back to not being on them.

294
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:20.850
Michael Hoefer: That's a huge transition for your body to go through. And one of the things that takes time and I'm talking weeks or months is also your body transitioning to feeling like pleasure and normal things again. So like

295
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:21.570
Michael Hoefer: Pleasure in

296
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:27.300
Michael Hoefer: Exercise pleasure and like you know hanging out with people feather and sex food, things like that, you know,

297
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:36.450
Michael Hoefer: The one tricky. One is with addiction is sometimes food because a lot of times if you start a certain addiction that addictive energy can just transfer to food and

298
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:36.960
Vincent Chopyk: Especially

299
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:47.280
Michael Hoefer: Like sweet food or carbs, you know, like those two things in that a dictum energy and come out that way. And so that's why people in early recovery often gain a fair amount of weight, you know,

300
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.850
Michael Hoefer: And I don't know if you, if that's something you've been

301
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.680
Vincent Chopyk: Sure, yeah. I think with the carbs, especially coming from the Italian

302
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.430
Vincent Chopyk: Method. It's always the comfort food with the spaghetti and everything.

303
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:09.270
Vincent Chopyk: So yeah, it's been kind of yeah going towards eating, which I've been trying to keep track of and not eat so much. Yeah. It's just, I don't know.

304
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:10.890
Vincent Chopyk: Stuff.

305
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:18.720
Michael Hoefer: And in the, in the past, are there any you know exercise activities that you liked in the past that anything that you've ever really enjoyed

306
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:26.910
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I liked swimming a lot like more than running. I've never been much of a runner. I played water polo and did the swim team in high school.

307
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:38.340
Vincent Chopyk: And so I used to like like swimming laps, just the only place you can do that in town right now is a little too expensive for me right now to pay for a membership.

308
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:52.320
Vincent Chopyk: Especially because I lost my job. So now I trying to save as much money as I can. So I was planning on just going for some runs and it's been raining a lot, but now the weather's getting nicer outside so so

309
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.200
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, okay.

310
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.320
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. And then, you know, and I think the next thing we should kind of talk about is

311
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:08.280
Michael Hoefer: You know opiate addiction and what the research kind of shows about, you know, prognosis and things

312
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.450
Michael Hoefer: Like that. And so

313
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:19.470
Michael Hoefer: Specifically, you're in a very interesting position because usually when people come into treatment they're using. And they're about to be in withdrawal and they need help right away you know

314
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.340
Michael Hoefer: But you're in a very different position because you're about a month out from using

315
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:32.100
Michael Hoefer: You've had, you know, certainly have what we consider an opioid use disorder and opiate addiction for about, you know, two years, or however long

316
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.620
Michael Hoefer: And there's really two different

317
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:48.720
Michael Hoefer: Approaches that you could take right now and we don't. An either one would would make total sense. Okay, so one is to do what you initially suggested, which is get into treatment continue to abstain from opiates.

318
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:57.510
Michael Hoefer: And, and, you know, start doing our groups and our counseling and learning coping skills and seeing how that goes.

319
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:04.650
Michael Hoefer: The other option would be to and that option can either be just

320
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:13.110
Michael Hoefer: You know psychotherapy and behavioral management or we could also add a medication called Naltrexone to that.

321
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.550
Michael Hoefer: And

322
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.570
Michael Hoefer: You know you have a pharmacy background. So you might already know what Naltrexone is

323
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.590
Vincent Chopyk: I kind of I've heard the name, but I'm not entirely sure what it is.

324
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:23.040
Michael Hoefer: Okay.

325
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.860
Michael Hoefer: So would it be okay if I told you a little bit about it.

326
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:40.590
Michael Hoefer: Oh yeah. Okay. Sure. So now tracks on is an opiate blocker. And the nice thing about it is it's a medication. It's not an opioid so you don't get high off it. You can't develop tolerance to it. You can't overdose on it. If you start taking it. You don't go into withdrawal.

327
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.320
Michael Hoefer: But what it basically does is it just goes into your

328
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:56.280
Michael Hoefer: Brain and bias opiate receptors and blocks them. And so what it does is it decreases cravings for opiates and also if you were to use an opiate it would basically just bounce off and you wouldn't feel anything. And you would say

329
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.500
Michael Hoefer: Oh, that was a waste of money. I'm not going to do that again.

330
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:09.780
Michael Hoefer: And so that's a, that's a, that's a medication that we can potentially use it's available both in a pill form. And it's also available in a once a month injection

331
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:18.600
Michael Hoefer: And the nice thing about the medication is it's very, you know, very low side effects not really any big risks.

332
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:26.700
Michael Hoefer: The only kind of risk of the medication is people, especially with opioid use disorder don't always take it consistently look like that, especially orally, they'll take it.

333
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:33.180
Michael Hoefer: And and those and then sometimes they'll say, oh, I want to use they'll stop taking it and then within three days it's out of your system and then you can do, you know,

334
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:41.910
Michael Hoefer: But the pros of it is, like I said, it helps with cravings and it's not an opiate so that's good. And that's a medication, you could take either daily

335
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:43.320
Michael Hoefer: For a maintenance.

336
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:54.930
Michael Hoefer: Or you could also just have it on hand in case you started experiencing cravings, or you were going to go into a risky situation like hanging out, you know, with somebody that usually use the opiates with or go to the, I don't know.

337
00:40:55.530 --> 00:41:00.120
Vincent Chopyk: And the line or something, I don't know. And, you know, you would you would want to be protected.

338
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:10.800
Michael Hoefer: So that's an option. The other option would be to start something like Suboxone, you know, and even though you're not currently using opiates the argument for doing that would be

339
00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:16.890
Michael Hoefer: For opiate addiction for people who just kind of stopped on their own and detox is what you did.

340
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.690
Michael Hoefer: data shows that there's about a 90% chance of relapse within one year.

341
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:36.540
Michael Hoefer: And some of those people who relapse, you know, have really bad outcomes like you've had, you know, losing your job getting arrested and then you know it gets worse and you start to end people transition to, you know, injecting or heroin or things like that people can die very easily.

342
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:53.670
Michael Hoefer: And so, the thing about Suboxone, is it really it, it is very effective at presenting presenting, all of those things, um, the downsides of Suboxone is it is a type of opiate. I mean, the good thing about it is most people on it. Say I just feel normal. I don't feel like I'm on an opiate

343
00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:08.040
Michael Hoefer: It also you don't tend to go up on the dose over a while it can help with kind of pain. It also has some mood like antidepressant effects and it also definitely helps with addiction and if you were to take an opiate, it would also block it and

344
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.090
Michael Hoefer: The op would bounce off and you would say, okay, that was a waste of time. I'm not gonna do

345
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:12.210
That

346
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:24.030
Michael Hoefer: So those are different options you have at this point. And I think it's just useful to kind of know what your options are and also kind of think about what would make

347
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:34.830
Michael Hoefer: You know, most sense. So I guess I'd want to pause for a second and just see if you have any questions about those options and or if you also have an idea of kind of which way you, you think, would you would want to go.

348
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:46.560
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I mean, I've kind of thought about like I had read a little bit about the Suboxone type stuff. And I think right now like I want to just try and do it without

349
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.180
Vincent Chopyk: But I mean, it's nice to know that that's an option, like in case

350
00:42:51.810 --> 00:43:03.120
Vincent Chopyk: I don't know in case something happens like he said like yeah cuz one of my best friends, is the one who I used to do it a lot with and he's actually stopped. He didn't get in any trouble or anything, but he stopped using to

351
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:17.370
Vincent Chopyk: Okay, great. So I don't think that's going to come up as an issue or anything. So yeah, I think I want to try and do it with just the therapy and stuff like that. But yeah, it is. I mean, it's nice to know that there's that option there.

352
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:27.240
Michael Hoefer: Great. I think that makes a lot of sense based on where you're at and it's good to know that you don't have, kind of, you don't have people you're living with your close friends that are using a lot and

353
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:34.080
Michael Hoefer: You have, I mean, you have people that are calling you on the phone and saying, Hey, I've got axes. What you want to buy some like you have that

354
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:40.260
Vincent Chopyk: Thing you know it was actually my friend that's doing it. It was always through him. I didn't

355
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.210
Vincent Chopyk: Have any one's number or anything. So that's been kind of nice because if I ever wanted.

356
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:50.190
Vincent Chopyk: Them. Again, I would have to go through him. And I think right now, you probably punch me in the face by asking

357
00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:53.820
Michael Hoefer: That's good. Yeah.

358
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:11.700
Michael Hoefer: Okay. All right. Well, then, I think it sounds clear that the plan should be what would put you into our opioid use disorder track which basically most of our treatments in group settings via phone, and there'll be a continuity physician and the continuity therapists will be working with

359
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:23.730
Michael Hoefer: And working on coping skills and things like that will also be doing some drug screen monitoring with you just to make sure that you're not using and that also can help with reducing cravings and just keep kind of things structured

360
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:33.990
Michael Hoefer: And then I would just would want a situation to where you know if you were having a lot of cravings to us, or if especially if you were to have a slip and go back to it.

361
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:43.050
Michael Hoefer: That you would let us know you know as soon as possible. And then we could think about next steps. And that would that would likely be a recommendation to starting Suboxone you know

362
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.190
Vincent Chopyk: Go back to it.

363
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:55.560
Michael Hoefer: And I think that's, that's a good approach. And then the other thing we could do. Now it's up to you is I could give you a prescription for Naltrexone just to have at like as needed in case

364
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:03.720
Michael Hoefer: Started to get you got found yourself in a situation to where you have a lot of cravings, or you're going into a risky situation and you could just have them in case of emergency.

365
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.240
Michael Hoefer: Or we could also hold off on that. If you want to

366
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:11.520
Michael Hoefer: Just see how it's going. And we could do that if you had a slip or if you got into a difficult situation.

367
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.710
Vincent Chopyk: I mean, yeah, I mean I wouldn't mind having the option. They're like, we want to do the prescription

368
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:28.920
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, just in case, like, yeah, I don't know, especially like I don't know why it's affecting me so much, but especially with this weight gain, like it's really like made me like I don't know like

369
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:40.890
Vincent Chopyk: Before I was so sure of like that I wasn't gonna and then all sudden, it kind of just like I don't know it freaked me out. So yeah, maybe having the prescription as needed. What else. Yeah.

370
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:54.480
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, that's good. And the other thing that you know about on track. So that has it's not high level research evidence, but there's some, you know, moderate to low level evidence that now tracks own can also

371
00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.570
Michael Hoefer: It is now Jackson is often used in some combination products for a weight loss as well.

372
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:02.550
Michael Hoefer: And it also in specifically

373
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.480
Michael Hoefer: It can help with some of the kind of like binge eating compulsive eating you know carb stuff we were talking about

374
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.140
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah.

375
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:14.700
Michael Hoefer: But also if you use it PRN every once in a while it might also help with that.

376
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:21.480
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And so I'll give you, I'll give you basically like a 30 tablets have it a one month supply

377
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.070
Michael Hoefer: And just to write it. Just take it as needed for you know cravings mostly for opiates.

378
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:37.950
Michael Hoefer: And you'll have that just kind of as needed. And the nice thing about that is sometimes even just having that prescription, even if you don't ever use it. It's kind of like a security blanket or anxiety, you know,

379
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:54.540
Vincent Chopyk: Yeah, I think I've had that kind of feeling before we're just having it like even with the opiates, like we're just having them like around kind of made me like not feel as like much. I needed to do them like even if I wouldn't take any so yeah I know what you mean by that.

380
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.160
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, okay.

381
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:10.050
Michael Hoefer: Excellent. And then the other thing I would just mention another resource for these things, you know, in addition to our groups is. I mean, things are kind of tough now with shelter in place and there's not a lot going on in the world.

382
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.120
Michael Hoefer: But there is a website called

383
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.890
Michael Hoefer: In the rooms calm.

384
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.540
Michael Hoefer: And they do online meetings like mutual support group meetings all day.

385
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:28.050
Michael Hoefer: And they have. It's really cool. They have almost anything you can think of on it. So they have a Na, of course, but they also have like life ring and smart recovery and Dharma recovery and

386
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:37.890
Michael Hoefer: Any type of addiction. There's a bunch of overeaters stuff on there too. Like, and it's a real. It's a free website you can log on and do video stuff with

387
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:49.650
Michael Hoefer: And so I'd encourage you to check just check that out because it may, you know, while you're getting rolled up in our, in our clinic. That'll be useful, but those mutual support groups also have a lot of evidence for being really helpful.

388
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:50.460
Vincent Chopyk: Okay.

389
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.030
Michael Hoefer: And if you're just look if you have a lot of hours in your life right now that you need to

390
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.000
Michael Hoefer: Fit hop on one of those and just kind of see how it goes.

391
00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:57.870
Vincent Chopyk: Okay.

392
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:03.120
Michael Hoefer: So yeah, so I'll put that in the note and encourage you, just to check it out and see if it's something that's helpful for you.

393
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:03.960
