00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.660
tracy jackson: So,

9
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.730
tracy jackson: Before we get started. My name is Tracy Jackson. And before we get started, what are you hoping

10
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.510
tracy jackson: To get out of your time at bright heart.

11
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.950
Amber Hascall: I am hoping to get the box and treatment and then

12
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.840
Amber Hascall: She talks off of it like slowly so that

13
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.170
tracy jackson: Okay.

14
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.920
Amber Hascall: I want to get off.

15
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.580
tracy jackson: Okay. And have you been on Suboxone before

16
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.740
Amber Hascall: Yeah, okay.

17
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.460
tracy jackson: And then, what was your experience with it. The first or the other time.

18
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:58.260
Amber Hascall: Um, I mean, I liked it I switched from Suboxone I was using methadone and I didn't like that. So I switch to that and I liked Suboxone

19
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.140
tracy jackson: A lot better, a lot. Yeah.

20
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.470
Okay.

21
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.800
tracy jackson: And what was the reasoning for your switch

22
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.280
Amber Hascall: I'm just because I didn't like the way the Methadone I felt, and I kept telling the doctor says I want less than, less than that I wanted to come up and they kept giving me more.

23
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.640
Amber Hascall: And I like woke up in the middle of the night once and I like fell backwards and being my head and it was just

24
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.610
Amber Hascall: Too much. So I switch

25
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.140
tracy jackson: And you were on the Suboxone before you are on methadone. Is that right,

26
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.670
Amber Hascall: No.

27
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.290
tracy jackson: Okay, so you and how did you start, what was the first IP way that he used and when

28
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:56.190
Amber Hascall: I started I gotten addicted to opiates. When I had my first section. They certainly give me any painkillers. And then I started it turned into, you know, pain pills and then OxyContin and now on. And I've been using heroin off and on for the last 18 years and then

29
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:08.160
Amber Hascall: I wouldn't use it Suboxone to because my son, my youngest son sad. It's an addict and he's always doing it. So I've been trying to get away from the box and then I get clean, then it comes back, but

30
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:19.560
Amber Hascall: Every time I come off the soapbox and I also get incredibly depressed. So I don't know, maybe the doctors are right and I should just stay on forever. Either way, he needs to be kit normal

31
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.610
tracy jackson: Okay, so you've been on some form of abuse since your first C section and how long ago was that

32
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.360
Amber Hascall: I'm 18 years and I haven't completed completely I've had years of sobriety in between.

33
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.840
tracy jackson: And tell me how you were able to accomplish sobriety and those years in between.

34
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.860
Amber Hascall: I couldn't wait for my son's that honestly

35
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.270
Amber Hascall: Okay, and then I just it's moving getting into different environment and the Suboxone that's what's really helps me

36
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.940
tracy jackson: Okay. And have you ever had any inpatient treatment for addiction.

37
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.810
Amber Hascall: Yeah.

38
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.890
tracy jackson: And the prostate

39
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.530
tracy jackson: In Nebraska and how long just went

40
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.490
Amber Hascall: Once as an adult and once as a child.

41
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.320
tracy jackson: Okay.

42
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.480
tracy jackson: And and as a child with that also for appealing.

43
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:24.930
Amber Hascall: No, that was for me. I don't know what I was my for I was on math. When I was like 15 my mom was giving it to me and doing it with me.

44
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.310
tracy jackson: Okay, so

45
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.750
Amber Hascall: That's why I was in there.

46
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.850
tracy jackson: Okay. So, your first maybe let's go back to the beginning. So your first experience with with

47
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.340
tracy jackson: Drugs lives. At what age.

48
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.390
tracy jackson: Were alcohol or tobacco or whatever.

49
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.470
Well,

50
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.510
tracy jackson: At em.

51
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.270
Amber Hascall: And what was what was

52
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.520
tracy jackson: Outcome alcohol. Okay. And how much alcohol. Are you currently using.

53
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.370
Amber Hascall: Right now I don't drink that option at all maybe once every couple months it's

54
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.430
tracy jackson: Okay, for alcohol. It's not really your drug of choice.

55
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.630
tracy jackson: Okay, how about the data, things like a fan x or on a pen or value.

56
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.550
Amber Hascall: Um, I get prescribed point five milligrams of collagen. I

57
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:32.520
Amber Hascall: Told psychiatrists for years, not to give it to me they were trying to me and I finally gave in and I don't really know if that's what I should be doing or not. I want to eventually get off of it, but I am taking point five milligrams looks a lot of time.

58
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.070
tracy jackson: Okay. And are you

59
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:43.740
tracy jackson: Finding that you have craving to overuse that that medication or that something that you are able to just use as directed.

60
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.090
Amber Hascall: I'm able to use it right, unless I'm

61
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:57.510
Amber Hascall: If I'm like dope sick then I you know I do what I can. But I use my medicine right when I'm not sick.

62
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.380
tracy jackson: Have you ever had a accidental every day.

63
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.790
Amber Hascall: Yes.

64
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.650
tracy jackson: And how many

65
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.800
tracy jackson: Probably like 2020 and when was your most recent one.

66
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.340
Amber Hascall: Probably like a year and a half ago. Okay.

67
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.900
tracy jackson: And and

68
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.650
tracy jackson: The recovery from that with with nor can

69
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.180
Amber Hascall: It wasn't just with Suboxone yeah that's what my

70
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:31.350
Amber Hascall: Son sad. I don't know how he does it, but he gets me Suboxone or knock knock on and Bing.

71
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.110
Amber Hascall: And sometimes just putting me in the shower with water works too.

72
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.040
I don't know.

73
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.480
tracy jackson: And

74
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:57.150
tracy jackson: And you're aware that the combination of the colonizer Pam and the pain pills is is what's really dangerous for that every day. Those two together are about 13 times more likely to cause accidental overdose and neither one of them by themselves.

75
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.650
Amber Hascall: Oh really,

76
00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.730
Mm hmm.

77
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.640
tracy jackson: So that's one of the reasons

78
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.140
tracy jackson: That

79
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:13.860
tracy jackson: That people are a little hesitant to give pain pills and benzodiazepines together because of that risk. Do you have Narconon behind now.

80
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.870
Amber Hascall: No.

81
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:26.040
tracy jackson: Okay. All right. So you mentioned earlier, going back about you started with alcohol around 12 but you don't really drink that much anymore.

82
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.330
tracy jackson: And then you were using met at 15

83
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.170
Or before

84
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.250
tracy jackson: At 15. And how long did you use math.

85
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.200
Amber Hascall: For about a year and a half.

86
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.840
tracy jackson: Okay, and then nephew since then.

87
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.810
tracy jackson: Okay, how about cooking.

88
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.020
Amber Hascall: I've used off and on.

89
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.800
Amber Hascall: Since I was 15 but I mean I didn't really do very much, maybe collect a couple years. I did a lot, but it's been

90
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.550
Amber Hascall: I don't know, eight, nine years or something.

91
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.570
Amber Hascall: Since I've

92
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.220
tracy jackson: Been a while. Okay.

93
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.210
tracy jackson: And are you liking.

94
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.630
Amber Hascall: IV. Okay.

95
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.690
tracy jackson: And how many, how long have you been using some sort of tobacco product.

96
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.920
tracy jackson: Since I was 12 2012 and

97
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.740
tracy jackson: How many cartridges like baking. How much are you think in a day. Now with me today.

98
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:32.580
Amber Hascall: Um, I would say, I use I fill it up probably like twice.

99
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.870
tracy jackson: twice in a day.

100
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:34.980
tracy jackson: And then when you were

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.030
Amber Hascall: Like a package a

tracy jackson: 12. Okay. And when did you, when did you switch to a thing.

105
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.630
Amber Hascall: It was about six years ago or something.

106
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:49.770
Okay.

107
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.940
tracy jackson: And do you use any combustible cigarettes at all now.

108
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.790
Amber Hascall: The actual cigarettes. No. Yes.

109
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.830
And then

110
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.020

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.980
Amber Hascall: Drink coffee sometimes

113
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.900
tracy jackson: Okay and and has that been a long standing thing for you. We're good.

114
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.920
Yeah.

115
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.100

130
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:24.090
Amber Hascall: It's anything other than Suboxone I haven't done, but I've. The last time I did Suboxone was

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:42.840
Amber Hascall: Today, I didn't have any and then I found this clinic. I didn't know if you guys were to call me back. So I started at this clinic yesterday morning. This morning, because I don't know if this is going to happen or not, but I would rather keep this and stuff that you know

223
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.530
Amber Hascall: I get paid migraines headaches.

224
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.030
Amber Hascall: A lot

225
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.510
tracy jackson: How this disabling is you're paying for you.

226
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:47.400
Amber Hascall: I'm

227
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.720
Amber Hascall: Kind of, I guess.

228
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.870
tracy jackson: It. How does this about fan help with

229
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.330
Amber Hascall: This box in the hopes that because everything is it

230
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.890
Amber Hascall: I'm just getting old, or not, but it just

231
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.470
Amber Hascall: If I don't take it. I feel my whole body hurts and I get depressed, sir.

232
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.030
tracy jackson: Okay. And the reason that I'm asking is it my

233
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.340
tracy jackson: Specialty yesterday I was an anesthesiologist, and then I was a kind of

234
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:30.540
tracy jackson: Trained at Stanford was an interventional, you know, kind of pain doctor to those procedures and writes the big doses of pain medicines, back when we thought that was a good idea to do

235
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:42.090
tracy jackson: That since become like a yoga instructor and acupuncture to help coach, like all these different things, because obviously the system can hurt people. I mean, you're a classic example. You go into do what the doctor tells you

236
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:53.160
tracy jackson: Right. And then, you know, now all of a sudden, you know, terrible stigmatizing harmful system in many ways as Jennifer for chronic illness. So

237
00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:03.930
tracy jackson: How this normally works. And we'll go through a little bit more in your history before we do this, that have this typically works at right heart just so you know you won't need to go through the whole induction thing, but we will maybe get some baseline.

238
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:16.620
tracy jackson: Information from you. Some lab work based on your end drug testing, that kind of thing. They can mail to your house or, you know, if you have lab work that you can access like even from your clinics and Nebraska.

239
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.930
tracy jackson: Within the past year.

240
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.440
Amber Hascall: I just did. I just got my blood drawn a couple days ago from here.

241
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.150
tracy jackson: Yeah, so if you can just get, and what was the name of that clinic.

242
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.290
Amber Hascall: As Celica

243
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.690
tracy jackson: Can you spell that for me.

244
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.120
Amber Hascall: He, he, Li ca

245
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.610
tracy jackson: Ll E ca and is that

246
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.600
Amber Hascall: An assessment and

247
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.250
Amber Hascall: When West Sacramento.

248
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:43.680
tracy jackson: Sacramento. Okay.

249
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.690
tracy jackson: So we'll see if we can get the lab.

250
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:52.530
tracy jackson: Okay. Well, for me, or maybe even call them and see if they can add on stuff that we might want that they don't have to stick

251
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.000
tracy jackson: Okay and I'm having today and then

252
00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:00.480
Amber Hascall: Yeah, the other girl already told me about the place. There's one like a couple blocks away but

253
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.920
Amber Hascall: For me to go in, but if you guys didn't just get my blood then

254
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.560
tracy jackson: We'll see yourself going for the

255
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.640
Amber Hascall: For the drug test. So you might as well just get that done anyway.

256
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.150
tracy jackson: I but what normally happens is we start out to kind of

257
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:33.120
tracy jackson: A week. A week of Suboxone sort of at a time. So you would check in, sort of, with new periodically for a week. If all the drug testing the labs look good. You're feeling that things are stable what we normally do is

258
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.810
tracy jackson: We can extend your prescription for long. Are we still have you check in every week with agree.

259
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:45.810
tracy jackson: Just to make sure you're staying on track and that kind of thing. Now there's an option if he found that pain so

260
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:52.590
tracy jackson: I run groups for bright heart for pain so not focusing on the medication part but

261
00:20:53.310 --> 00:21:03.540
tracy jackson: Ways that all the different ways that had been scientifically shown to help pain, but don't require pills don't require money don't require you know like things that you can do from wherever you are.

262
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:10.080
tracy jackson: Can access online or for free and just different sort of coping skills training and that kind of thing for pain.

263
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.900
tracy jackson: Addiction Recovery. So if you're interested in

264
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:24.450
tracy jackson: Going in that group. After we make sure you're stable on Suboxone and in the in the system. Normally when you're to the point you're getting monthly prescriptions, which for you shouldn't be too long. Given the fact you've been on a while already

265
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.070
tracy jackson: You can then potentially enter these pain grits if you felt that was helpful. So

266
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:36.570
tracy jackson: Then again, it's just more sort of tools in your toolbox and you're obviously you're going through a really stressful time right now.

267
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.520
Amber Hascall: With your son.

268
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.220
tracy jackson: Your youngest and all that they may be helpful for you think yeah

269
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.920
tracy jackson: Anytime you suffer from insomnia as well.

270
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.440
Amber Hascall: Yeah, I think that's

271
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.460

Okay.

317
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.210
Amber Hascall: Oh, so it's asked for in the past. And what was the question.

318
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:28.410
tracy jackson: That in the past, a lot of these things were true. But right now, you feel like when you're on your Suboxone you're not having

Yeah.

322
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.910
Amber Hascall: Yeah, or any of that.

323
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.600
Amber Hascall: Yeah, that's the Boston takes away all the crazy medicine helps me live a normal life.

324
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.720
tracy jackson: All right, and so what we'll do from here it will tell me, do you have any questions for me.

325
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.810
Amber Hascall: Um, I don't think so. Okay.

326
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.960
tracy jackson: What we'll do from here is

327
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:20.910
tracy jackson: I will have the care coordination team call you back and just confirm that all the that they've got your appropriate pharmacy on you know on file, a way to contact you have them make you an appointment to see me in a week and we'll give you a week of Suboxone and then make you

328
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.920
tracy jackson: Over to to meet a week from there and

329
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:32.640
tracy jackson: See how you're doing. By that time, you should have gotten the drug screen and any of the other sorts of labs or anything that we needed and we'll sort of revisit how the situation is from there.

330
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:40.260
tracy jackson: And and then at some point we'll see you again a timer to just one on one, and then we'll talk about

331
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:46.980
tracy jackson: How to get you in groups and on a more stable regimen. If this is if you prefer to stick with bright heart as opposed to

332
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.570
tracy jackson: As opposed to going back to the clinic daily wherever you are.

333
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.660
Amber Hascall: Yeah, don't do that. But OK.

334
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.500
OK.

335
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:57.450
Amber Hascall: OK.

336
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:11.910
tracy jackson: So and so, yeah, it would just, it will require just weekly meetings that first individually and then group for a while and then we'll would it should all be online and we'll go from there. Okay, cool.

337
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.510
tracy jackson: Awesome. The only thing I would tell you, Amber. The only thing I would

338
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:27.150
tracy jackson: Suggest is it is safer Suboxone and clonazepam together are safer than clonazepam and heroin or client phone as a payment other sorts of things. But wherever you are. You can find our can

339
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:29.370
tracy jackson: Over the counter.

340
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.010
tracy jackson: And is there anyone in the home with you, other than your son.

341
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:36.570
Amber Hascall: No.

342
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.810
tracy jackson: And how old is this your oldest

343
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.920
Amber Hascall: He's 18

344
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:47.520
tracy jackson: He's a team. Okay so worst, worst case scenario, if he had to give you a shot of something he could, but

345
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:47.790
Amber Hascall: Yeah.

346
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:58.800
tracy jackson: I would say just, you know, having that in the home. If you're taking buzzes and I mean, ultimately, if there's a way like with the group work if you're able to tie trade off this club as a Pam, that would be safer, but

347
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:04.380
tracy jackson: Can buy an arc and over the counter at any pharmacy, just to have as an emergency situation or

348
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.930
tracy jackson: Make sure that your son to teach in the house.

349
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:07.800
tracy jackson: You know if

350
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:15.240
tracy jackson: Something happened to call 911, I do not think it's the likely possibility because these are stable doses of both of these medications.

351
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:15.750
Amber Hascall: Then you have

352
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:23.730
tracy jackson: an overdose. The past year you've been taking them. I just want to make sure that you are aware, so that we have, you know, the plan is to keep you safe. Yeah.

353
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.410

358
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.430

360
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.910

361
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.640
tracy jackson: Still need a lab or you're in drug screen her

362
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:26.910
tracy jackson: Team how God was 19 to severe anxiety her cures database, should that her last prescription for clonazepam do point five milligrams today was given by her nurse practitioner.

363
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:40.590
tracy jackson: filled you in W O Li in March, it looks like she's been getting regular prescriptions of that for several months since last April with one provider.

364
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:47.250
tracy jackson: With no indication of significantly early refills, maybe a day or two.

365
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.340
tracy jackson: And

366
00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:08.220
tracy jackson: I have also reviewed her expert. A SAM and BAM Gore's to the plan for her will be to begin with 12 milligrams of Suboxone

367
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:17.310
tracy jackson: Key day will give her a week supply will read check in after she's received her infectious disease testing and her drug screen. See how she's doing

368
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:33.690
tracy jackson: It. She is stable on that probably plan to extend to two week prescriptions and then thereafter. If she continues to be compliant. We will put her in my my penguin.

369
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.510
tracy jackson: And potentially

370
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.820
tracy jackson: The two weeks in an IUD Griffin two weeks in a pain group would be the plan.

371
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:52.380
tracy jackson: I have advised her to put Narcan and behind for innovation in potential for inadvertent every day.

372
