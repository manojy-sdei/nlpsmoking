C210AE: I'm alive.

29
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.380
Jonathan Figg: Okay, that's a good start, I think, how can I help you today.

30
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.760
C210AE: Well i'm suppose I wanted to get I've been on I've been getting my meds through a doctor for almost 20 years

31
00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:10.500
C210AE: And so I had a I had a successful life with my meds and I'm like, about two months ago I was kicked out of my last clinic because I missed one to me doctor's appointments so um for two months only I've been buying stuff off the streets because I've been withdrawing so much, you know,

32
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.250
C210AE: So I'm just trying to get back on my soapbox on. That's all I'm trying to do.

33
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.110
Jonathan Figg: I see. Okay. Alright, so let's

34
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.610
C210AE: Talk about four years. And before that, I was on methadone for 16 years

35
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.330
Jonathan Figg: Uh huh.

36
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.650
Jonathan Figg: Okay, well we can we can certainly work on that today.

37
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.770
Jonathan Figg: So you were, you were previously on Suboxone. Did you have a stable dose.

38
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.950
C210AE: Yeah, I was. I took one eight milligram strip. OK. OK.

39
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.940
Jonathan Figg: And then you, you had to stop that, because I guess it sounds like they discharged you because you didn't miss meetings or

40
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.800
C210AE: Appointments the day my doctor's appointment, because my document was that for

41
00:03:50.220 --> 00:04:03.030
C210AE: That day I went in early and I talked to my counselor for like 20 minutes and let her know what was going on that date night or no, I might be missing my appointment. I'm not sure. And so I thought that would maybe be good enough, but it just wasn't, I guess. Okay.

42
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:10.560
Jonathan Figg: Okay, and before that. What was you were on to your on Suboxone for the last four years that stopped. Two months ago.

43
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.780
C210AE: Yeah, yeah. Only one of the years was through a doctor. The other three years I bought this or boxing off the streets.

44
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.650
Jonathan Figg: See, okay.

45
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.990
C210AE: And then before that I was on methadone for like 16 years or something. All through the clinic.

46
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.640
Jonathan Figg: Okay, I'm sorry. So was the Suboxone through the same clinic. There's the Methadone

47
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:35.550
Jonathan Figg: No, no. I see. Okay. All right. Um, tell me about what happened that lets you get it on methadone, I guess, almost 20 years ago.

48
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:49.170
C210AE: I used to be a hardcore gangster. I was up for like 10 years and I didn't eat tears, basically. And I got clean. I didn't ever felt good. Again, a couple years went by and

49
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.730
C210AE: I started getting a Viking and somebody would give me I would take it at night to help me sleep.

50
00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:02.430
C210AE: And one day I took it in the morning and I gave me quality of life. I felt so good that I told myself, right. Then I'll never go another day without opiates and so

51
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.120
C210AE: That's why I've been on opiates for so long, because again, gave me quality life.

52
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:16.770
C210AE: With the two years after I got off crank. I didn't even leave my couch. I didn't feed my kid. I just couldn't catch a grip. I didn't shower and then the opiate changed my world. And so I just found them ever since.

53
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.560
Jonathan Figg: Okay and so

54
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.600
Jonathan Figg: You, you, you said you took a blanket and that's what

55
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.410
Jonathan Figg: Started what what led to you getting onto method.

56
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.570
C210AE: Because it's legal. It's easy. It's easy. I didn't have to go and try to find meds, all the time.

57
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.490
Jonathan Figg: Gotcha. Okay. Okay, so that

58
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:45.900
C210AE: That lifestyle. I'm, I'm a normal functioning person. I had a business for many 14 years. That was really successful as PTA mom as a big part of my church.

59
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:53.610
C210AE: I started clothes closets all over the community where I'm from, and and that's what that's what my meds do for me. You know, I thought, well, that's

60
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.290
Jonathan Figg: That's what we want. Certainly.

61
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.510
C210AE: Good. So you are functional. It's not having the only problem with opiates is not having them, you know,

62
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.090
Jonathan Figg: There is the withdrawal. Okay.

63
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.540
Jonathan Figg: Right. Okay. Um, and then. So you said in the past few months you've been buying the Suboxone

64
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.800
C210AE: When's the last time.

65
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:21.450
C210AE: No, I haven't. I didn't get Suboxone nobody I can't find it. I'm new to town out here. So all I can. Three is I never even heard of it before. It's basically I'm taking fentanyl basically but they call it Red Rock.

66
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.940
Jonathan Figg: Okay, do you bet you would mind something so that you work on withdraw.

67
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.270
C210AE: Yeah. Bob I'm buying anything I can get my hands on basically

68
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.290
Jonathan Figg: Okay, well, we want but but you want to get back on the Suboxone

69
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.950
C210AE: Because that

70
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.450
Jonathan Figg: Kept you functional. Okay.

71
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:49.380
C210AE: Well, it's legal, and why I don't want. Why do I want this life. This is fucking stupid trying to drive withdrawing every day. I mean, I, I've missed out on jobs and everything now. I mean, it's been two months have been horrific. Okay. Okay.

72
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.310
Um,

73
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.900
Jonathan Figg: Let's see. Are you allergic to anything.

74
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.010
No.

75
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.720
C210AE: Okay.

76
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.940
Jonathan Figg: Do you take any other medications.

77
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.200
No.

78
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.730
Okay.

79
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.660
Jonathan Figg: Have you ever been hospitalized relating to opiates.

80
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.250
No. Okay.

81
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.310
Jonathan Figg: When's the last time you had anything

82
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.330
C210AE: And let's see what it was yesterday morning.

83
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.540
Jonathan Figg: Okay, is that you had Red Rock that

84
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.880
C210AE: You're talking about right. Okay.

85
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.830
C210AE: Yeah, that's a new thing out in this town. But it's basically made with fentanyl this you know

86
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.410
Jonathan Figg: Cut with cut with. We don't know what right

87
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.010
C210AE: Right, I think, sugar, it's it's killing people every day out here, you know,

88
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.430
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, that

89
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.590
Jonathan Figg: Was a scary thing. Absolutely.

90
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.340
C210AE: I'm responsible responsible with it because I'm not trying to get loaded. I'm trying to just feel like a human. No. Okay. Okay.

91
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.380
Jonathan Figg: Do you have any history with alcohol.

92
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.300
C210AE: No. Okay.

93
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.380
Jonathan Figg: And have you had any surgeries in the past.

94
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.840
C210AE: I had surgeries.

95
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:59.850
C210AE: I'm 44 now and I had my surgeries. When I was like 16 or 17 I was hit by drunk driver.

96
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.670
C210AE: A long, long time ago. Okay.

97
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.180
Jonathan Figg: Is that what started you on something.

98
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.870
C210AE: No, I told you what started me. I felt like such shit and for years and one day I took an opiate and it made me feel good.

99
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.560
Jonathan Figg: I understand.

100
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.120
C210AE: I understand that part but I

101
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:23.640
C210AE: Wasn't like addicted to anything when I started on when I went in Macedonia wasn't addicted to anything I I purposely went and put some opiates in my system just like it, you'll get on the Methadone clinic.

102
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.770
C210AE: I've never been a heroin addict or anything like that. I just need opiates because it gives me quality life. That's it.

103
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.210
Okay.

104
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.300
C210AE: I'm medicine attic of it now because

105
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.900
C210AE: That's I'm always going to take opiates, no matter what.

106
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.870
Jonathan Figg: Okay, okay, I understand.

107
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.000
C210AE: Alright, it's possible, maybe I would feel good. Without them, it's just

108
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:56.370
C210AE: Hard to get to a point I had someone to have to support me while I was trying to come down and all that and and there's just like there's no time for that. I don't have anybody in my life to, you know,

109
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.180
Jonathan Figg: Gotcha.

110
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:07.470
C210AE: Okay, one day, if I ever had the opportunity to or somebody actually wanted to help you and help support you and shit. Maybe I'd give it a try, but I don't see that happening in my life. Okay.

111
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.690
Jonathan Figg: So you were on the stable dose of the Suboxone they did they ever talk to you about a slow type or anything like that.

112
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.340
C210AE: Um, God no.

113
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.270
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

114
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:21.510
C210AE: All right, I would. I know I asked that one. If that's the if that's their agenda and I like to know that right off the bat, because

115
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.870
C210AE: There's no I don't boast. There's no reason for it. I'm a functioning. Good. I mean, I'd rather I'd rather

116
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.940
C210AE: I'd rather have quality of life or be dead doesn't do. Why would I want to, you know, I mean,

117
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.770
Jonathan Figg: I understand. Okay, so let's talk about the way bright heart works. Okay.

118
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.700
Jonathan Figg: We are an addiction treatment and recovery promotion.

119
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:48.300
Jonathan Figg: Program. We operate by telemedicine. So all of our interactions are done through zoom, which is what we're using right now.

120
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.100
Jonathan Figg: We are structured around weekly support groups.

121
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.500
Jonathan Figg: So those are about an hour long. It's kind of like an NA or a meeting.

122
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.520
Jonathan Figg: We group people up with other people who have had a history with

123
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:14.340
Jonathan Figg: Substances opiates, who are in various stages of recovery to support each other. The group is led by a counselor or therapist.

124
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:24.690
Jonathan Figg: Who has a history with addiction treatment. It's about an hour long. It starts with a check in with the doctor to make sure that you have medication that you're on a good dose, you're not having problems with it.

125
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:35.730
Jonathan Figg: That all of your questions are answered. So you do get access to your doctor basically every week basis, just for a minute or two. If you have any issues and certainly longer if you need

126
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:56.190
Jonathan Figg: That's the end. So that's the way bright heart works. We do want people to be engaged in the weekly support groups because we feel that it's very important to continue promoting recovery, you talked about how functional you were, which is an excellent thing and we want to promote that.

127
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.620
Jonathan Figg: Do you think you'll be able to commit to weekly

128
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.060
C210AE: So is it is anytime of the day, or my sister, not have a job.

129
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.620
Jonathan Figg: No, so there's

130
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:14.850
Jonathan Figg: There, there are groups at various times, we have a lot of availability, it would be at a consistent time each week.

131
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.250
C210AE: Okay, it can it be late at night.

132
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.220
Jonathan Figg: We do have some that are later in the evening. Yes.

133
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.950
C210AE: Yeah, because any the job. I just got a job yesterday and I was supposed to be working right now but

134
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:34.560
C210AE: I couldn't go because I don't have work boots or gas money but i'm i'm consistently trying to I've gotten many jobs like four really good high paying jobs in

135
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:49.860
C210AE: The last couple months and just can't go cuz I'm so down and out. But I keep trying, hoping to maybe America will happen, and all the jobs. I'm going for are like 10 hour long days, you know, from 830 or eight till. Okay, whatever. So it's nighttime is the only if I had to do.

136
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.810
Jonathan Figg: Something later in the day or understand

137
00:11:52.050 --> 00:12:01.020
C210AE: If it's if it's not going to be late in the evening, then I don't know how they expect you to get a life if you have to tell your jobs that you know I gotta go take my hour, an hour break or whatever, you know,

138
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:01.950
Jonathan Figg: Thanks, Shane.

139
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.760
Jonathan Figg: I understand. Yeah.

140
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:10.470
Jonathan Figg: We do have doctors who run groups in the evenings. I don't, but we do have doctors who run groups in the evening that may be better for you.

141
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.790
Jonathan Figg: What I would suggest for you withdrawing now.

142
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.170
C210AE: What

143
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.300
Jonathan Figg: Are you are you in withdrawal now.

144
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:24.420
C210AE: Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, it starts small but then it gets within a few hours, it gets worse and worse and worse and worse, you know,

145
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.170
Jonathan Figg: What's your, what's your pattern of symptoms, what starts first and then kind of

146
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:44.340
C210AE: Helps me it's like yawning and and sneezing, runny nose, that's all the mild stuff and and then once it starts eating more severe. I feel like a mumbles contorting, you know, I, you can't stay still at it makes me want to kill myself by the second day

147
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.090
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so where are you now in that process.

148
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.950
C210AE: I'm at the very beginning. Okay.

149
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.020
Jonathan Figg: Should have yawning, and maybe some

150
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.850
C210AE: Very beginning. I just know that it's coming you know

151
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.270
Roger

152
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.230
C210AE: A couple times very beginning

153
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.340
C210AE: About 24 hours. I know it's coming in any minute, you know,

154
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:15.210
Jonathan Figg: Gotcha. Okay, so let's talk about Suboxone here because that's important. So you understand Suboxone is an opiate you understand you're dependent on it if you stop it, you withdraw.

155
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.560
Jonathan Figg: You understand all that I know.

156
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:28.290
Jonathan Figg: Suboxone will hold on tire in your brain to those receptors and other things, including fat and also if there's anything left in your system. When you take that Suboxone it okay but you enjoy worse withdraw.

157
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:39.840
Jonathan Figg: Withdraw so it needs to make sure that you're at least in modern withdrawal. So you're not really at the very beginning, you need to be a little bit further along in that withdrawal before you take your first dose of spots.

158
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.350
C210AE: Right, yeah, I totally understand it because it's an opiate blocker to

159
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:44.430
Jonathan Figg: Right.

160
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:52.890
Jonathan Figg: So, it prevents the action of other things. So, but I stress it because I don't like seeing people go into precipitated withdrawal. It's very unpleasant.

161
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:03.960
Jonathan Figg: The if you are on a stable those previously. I think that's a good place to start. Are you still there. I think I lost you.

162
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.230
Jonathan Figg: There she is. Okay, here we go to be get you back.

163
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.320
C210AE: Are you there that meeting just fucking up this completely does he disappeared when I

164
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.350
Jonathan Figg: See the park, you know,

165
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.120
C210AE: High. I don't know what just happened. Sorry about that.

166
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.370
Jonathan Figg: That's okay. Sometimes the reception can be funny, you

167
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.510
C210AE: Can keep the media. I stood up. So that must have done something

168
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.340
Jonathan Figg: I can hardly hear you.

169
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.020
Jonathan Figg: Okay.

170
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.280
Jonathan Figg: Can you hear me okay

C210AE: Okay, so are you talking cuz I don't know if I can hear you.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.470
Can you hear me now.

176
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.800
C210AE: I guess we can't hear each other. It says nope that's normal. I can hear you. I can't

177
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.570
C210AE: I know you just talk, but I can't hear you at all.

178
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.990
C210AE: I'm gonna put my chair back where it was. I guess and dude cannot

179
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.770
C210AE: Let's see. Okay.

180
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.760
C210AE: Can you hear me.

181
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.900
Jonathan Figg: Yes, I can hear you.

182
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.480
C210AE: Yeah, we can't hear each other. OK, I can hear you.

183
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.240
Now,

184
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.030
C210AE: I'm gonna ask her to reconnect decided make shit up.

185
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.360
C210AE: Jonathan

186
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.470
C210AE: Oh, you can hear me okay well I can't hear you. Okay, that's weird. I guess I'm muted. I just don't know how to unmute it

187
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.840
C210AE: This little button should do it. It's just not working.

188
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.990
C210AE: Hey, maybe didn't hear me now.

189
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.790
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, I can hear you.

190
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.490
C210AE: Okay, cool. Now we can

191
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.250
Jonathan Figg: There we go. Okay, wonderful. I don't know what that was but

192
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.440
C210AE: We got it sorted. Okay. Sorry about that.

193
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:28.890
Jonathan Figg: It's okay so what what I think we should do your you're clearly uncomfortable.

194
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.460
Jonathan Figg: You're going to continue to be in which all until you get a dose of sandbox. So, which I think is right for you. It sounds like you were very functional before on it.

195
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:49.740
C210AE: And I think is way better than it works better. It's the best thing that's ever worked for me. I never need more. I never take extra nothing like that. It says, It's a wonder drug. You know, good. Okay.

196
00:16:50.160 --> 00:17:01.920
Jonathan Figg: So what I think we should do is I'll write you a script for the Suboxone I'll send it right now is the the pharmacy that I have is dollar drug on West college Avenue, is that

197
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.550
C210AE: Correct for you.

198
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:03.870
C210AE: Yeah.

199
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:13.680
C210AE: I can't even tell you how fucking thing for lying because life is so hard right now. Um, there's no hope in my life and at least to have my meds, I can hopefully give my get some help, you know,

200
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:21.420
Jonathan Figg: Okay so much. Okay, I need to. I need to be clear. It's not going to change whether I write your script, but are you feeling like hurting yourself right now.

201
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:30.000
C210AE: No, I mean I sometimes I wish I could disappear, but I don't never have the guts to hurt myself. Okay. I have a son.

202
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.800
C210AE: Okay, I would little dog to eat right, my sweet, sweet good

203
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:45.090
Jonathan Figg: So what I'm going to do is write a script for the sandbox. So to your pharmacy right now. I usually tell people you know give the pharmacy, at least an hour to sort stuff out.

204
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:52.230
C210AE: Make sure they feel it like like he said, I probably wait, just to make sure I'm and more withdrawn, like you said, you know, right.

205
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.690
Jonathan Figg: So if your last us especially

206
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:01.650
Jonathan Figg: If you took fentanyl fentanyl is difficult because we can never guess how long it's going to

207
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:02.580
C210AE: Last person.

208
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.960
C210AE: I'm sorry I moved from one more distinct next to me, I hope.

209
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.100
C210AE: We don't get disconnected.

210
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.230
C210AE: Okay, yeah. Well, it wasn't that good because the way it was made. I never

211
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.850
C210AE: It wasn't that great.

212
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:24.900
Jonathan Figg: But yeah, I would say if you can't get I'm going to do two things. I'm going to write your script for Suboxone. Yeah, and I'm going to write your script for quantity which

213
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.700
Jonathan Figg: Is a medication, we use to help them.

214
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.410
Jonathan Figg: What's that

215
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.610
C210AE: That's awesome. No, that's awesome. Somebody would

216
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.150
C210AE: Want him.

217
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.130
Jonathan Figg: To produce

218
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.720
Jonathan Figg: Those symptoms of withdrawal.

219
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.910
Jonathan Figg: Because I I think based on the fact that you took fentanyl so you should wait until tomorrow morning to take your dose of Suboxone

220
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.710
C210AE: Because they

221
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.490
Jonathan Figg: Don't want it to put you into precipitated withdrawal. Does that make sense.

222
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.630
C210AE: Right. Oh yeah, totally. I understand. I've done it wants to myself like 15 maybe 10 years ago.

223
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:08.490
C210AE: I accident. I'm a male. It was right, which was about some came out whenever that was I took one and within 45 minutes I thought I was dying and said, you're in force withdrawal. I was like, oh my god. Right.

224
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.720
C210AE: Okay, so

225
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:18.030
Jonathan Figg: One for Suboxone one for quantity. That way you can take your first box home tomorrow and you can use the quantity

226
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:18.540
C210AE: Today,

227
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.190
C210AE: To get through the withdrawal.

228
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.670
Jonathan Figg: Do you get really nauseated as it progresses.

229
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.730
C210AE: And yes,

230
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.840
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so I'm going to write your script for zero friend as well, which is an anti nausea medication.

231
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.990
C210AE: That the thing, the thing that makes me feel the most crazy is that leg cramps.

232
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.940
Jonathan Figg: So usually

233
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.320
Jonathan Figg: Helps for that. Yeah.

234
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.270
C210AE: It does. It's only a day so I can handle anything for a day, you know, right, yeah.

235
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.950
Jonathan Figg: short period of time.

236
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.680
Jonathan Figg: And then it's gonna the Suboxone will help

237
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:57.300
Jonathan Figg: And then I'm going to have since you need a group LATER AT NIGHT, which I don't I don't do the later I groups.

238
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.950
C210AE: I'm going to have the care coordinator. I'm not

239
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:07.740
C210AE: I'm not for sure confident because I'd like I said I got the job. And I couldn't start it. So technically, I don't have a job right now. So who knows what my next job will be, but I'm

240
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:13.410
C210AE: I'm so I don't want is that going to my permanently stuck in that group or am I let it change it if my situation changes.

241
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:18.000
Jonathan Figg: Know if your, if your situation changes if your job changes or something like that. Yeah.

242
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.590
Jonathan Figg: We just we wanted to be consistent, week to week but if you suddenly have a life change where you go, Why do that time anymore, then I can chew. You know,

243
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:26.460
C210AE: Okay, cool.

244
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.930
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, it's, it's like

245
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:28.530
C210AE: Like

246
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:34.110
Jonathan Figg: It really is. It's a support group. It's not meant to be punitive or anything like that. It's to help encourage your recovery.

247
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:41.460
C210AE: That's what know places using like that. It's usually a punishment thing, you know. And I always thought, This isn't a recovery, man. You know, so that

248
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.560
Jonathan Figg: We. We. Yeah. We want people to share and we want people to support each other so

249
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.820
C210AE: Jobs, the most important thing to me. I want to work. I like working

250
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.290
C210AE: As a grownup. What are you doing, you should be working, you know. Okay, good.

251
00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.440
Jonathan Figg: So I'm big because of your schedule. I'm going to have the care coordinators who you talk to, before me.

252
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:08.010

Jonathan Figg: Schedule. So they'll figure out a time that works for you. Okay.

254
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:17.190
C210AE: Okay, I can't believe this is happening. I felt like, man, I just thought my life was over the last couple months. So I'm so thankful

255
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.170
Jonathan Figg: I'm glad we can help.

256

Jonathan Figg: So if, if you run into any challenges at the pharmacy if they want. They say insurance they need forums or something like that, where

C210AE: OK, so the very original number. Okay, thank you.

275
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.500
C210AE: Yes, ma'am. Okay.

276
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.940

277
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.610
C210AE: For you right now. So, so I still go in in like an hour or two, and try to pick up my meds.

278
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.180
Jonathan Figg: I think you should. I think you should try it because we won't know if we have extra work until you try and pick them.

279
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.370
C210AE: Up. Yeah, thank you so much.

284
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.350
Bye bye.

285
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.940
Jonathan Figg: Okay so Blaze is clearly uncomfortable. She's very restless because she's

286
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.120
Jonathan Figg: Withdrawal she

287
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.580
Has

288
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.480
Her problem was would be opioid abuse and opioid dependence.

289
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.770
Jonathan Figg: Her cures. I pulled her cured report while we're talking

290
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.590
Jonathan Figg: And it shows us on

291
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.570
Jonathan Figg: A nice stable dose of Suboxone for a period of time there.

292
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:52.140
Jonathan Figg: In the last I think was 2000 and 2019 that ended in November 2019

293
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.240
Jonathan Figg: And I pulled her

294
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.850
Jonathan Figg: Let's see, I reviewed or as a

295
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:08.430
Jonathan Figg: Questionnaire which was not conservative or Odyssey spoiler zero. And then, or excuse me, that was on our expert in our as and

296
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:17.940
Jonathan Figg: She's not suicidal and she's appropriate first box, and especially since she was stable in the past.

297
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:28.170
Jonathan Figg: Alright, and so we're going to keep her on milligrams per day Suboxone and then we'll set her up with a later you think appointment. Hopefully she. What's your job.
