00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Lauren

2
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.449
Gwenevere Abriel: Fallen on that one side works. And then the other one doesn't.

3
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.120
Lauren Anderson: There we go. Got it. Am I, are you straight my

4
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Are vertical

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.910
Okay.

6
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello. How are the

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing, physically has the same stability in there.

8
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.530
Lauren Anderson: Yeah I slept a little better. Last night, I think the the colon. The colon colon as a beam.

9
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's quantity quantity

10
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.410
Lauren Anderson: It seemed to help. I took one with the circle last night and it helped and I started to feel anxious this morning because I'm

11
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.840
Lauren Anderson: Getting close to 24 hours for the sides and I took it because it says up to three times a day with

12
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.630
Lauren Anderson: Clonidine, so I took another one this morning, and it did help a little bit with my

13
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
Lauren Anderson: Anxiety and feelings of, you know, I need to take my meds, like

14
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.560
Lauren Anderson: Okay, okay.

15
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha. So what time of day do you normally take the buprenorphine.

16
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.740
Lauren Anderson: I was taking it to and

17
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:37.770
Lauren Anderson: Then I I I took it way too soon, and then to send again so now i'm i'm actually back up all the way to 6pm if that makes sense. Not forward but back that I see.

18
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.130
Lauren Anderson: Okay, what kind of my head. Really, I guess.

19
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the point with was again I'm just a messenger. I've just been listening to, to what the doc has been saying. And I think it's less about when you take it more than once you pick a time

20
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.620
Consuming

21
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.420
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

22
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I

23
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:13.080
Lauren Anderson: wasn't feeling real good on the on the Mount. I was on was I think partly what I was trying to do so now them on the three. I'm trying to stick to the same time. So, forcing myself to wait. Okay, well at 6pm so

24
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.830
Seems

25
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so the weird, I just got to say the weird part that what you're putting yourself through that the rest of every other client doesn't put themselves through is being awake.

26
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: During so right there's okay I took my medicine and now it's all in my blood level and then these people are still sleeping. They're sleeping and they wake up in the morning and they take it in the morning. This is you.

27
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like, let me try and see where are you, where the heck are you, you're like a

28
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.380
Lauren Anderson: Bit better but took it in the morning. So you're thinking

29
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because yeah because the rest. I'll say us because it's easier. The rest of us are sleeping during the downward part of the roller coaster we're asleep, and you're like,

30
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like, you're awake suffering and I'm like why would she do that yourself. I mean, maybe there's a piece that I don't understand. But like I would be because most of my clients are like

31
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I woke up. But, you know, at five or six and so then we start to adjust it just slightly, but they're not waiting all day because you're having to wait all day. That seems like undue torture to you.

32
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.930
Lauren Anderson: Yeah. Well, it started, I was taking it in early mornings. And then when I am

33
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:52.260
Lauren Anderson: I didn't have the medication and actually didn't get, get it through at the doctor told the evening that time or something or or afternoon. That's why I started at 2pm or something. It's that's when I picked up the prescription. So that's when it got switched to that time.

34
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be open to

35
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to nose around outside my lane, and I'm not a medical clinician, but would you be open to discussing that with the physician and saying, you know, when brought up this point.

36
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could tell you this, you could tell the

37
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.430
Lauren Anderson: Client take it in the morning with your donors on it. And that worked really well for me, like, first thing in the morning.

38
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.960
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, so all that

39
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how to get there. So it's like okay well now. Maybe I'll take it for at 321

40
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.270
Lauren Anderson: To say

41
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then kind of inch your way back in time. You see what I'm saying, like moving back the other way towards the morning, then

42
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.530
Lauren Anderson: Maybe for a couple days, take a half dose in the morning and a half at night and I don't know.

43
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, but I'm just worried about you. Cuz, cuz you have you're sitting there like during that kind of a rough. That's like the roughest time and you're wide awake for it. Like I wouldn't want that.

44
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.380
Lauren Anderson: Well, I probably wouldn't sleep. If I were you know it would keep me up if I were feeling withdrawals. He, too, so I don't know.

45
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.170
Lauren Anderson: But alas, the doctor, I think in the long run, they'll be better from taking it in the morning, for sure.

46
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so we checked on the physiology. Let's check on the psychology

47
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing on an emotional level. I heard a little bit of anxiousness you were saying.

48
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.680
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I'm, you know, kind of like starting to count the minute before it's time to take my son.

49
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.540
Lauren Anderson: So I

50
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.270
Lauren Anderson: Started feel emotional and anxious and stuff.

51
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.570
Lauren Anderson: And I'm still really frustrated, cuz I

52
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.060
Lauren Anderson: Keep coming

53
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Back for two seconds just the

54
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.350
Lauren Anderson: Emotional because it's important

55
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So just think about this particular dose of treatment. This is a talking dose right this is us talking and you're here at two o'clock.

56
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And your emotional and anxious, most people that are activated the memory. They have the campus isn't going to do a great job of remembering things, it's unlikely that new information that you and I

57
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of work on and whether it's skills or we do some reprocessing it's unlikely to stick. So the talk therapy medicine part won't be as effective. That's another reason why it might be nice if you were kind of at a nice optimal optimal feeling when you and I need is that

58
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:41.220
Lauren Anderson: Well, what I wanted. When I was about to say was, I still since since detox. Um, I really haven't felt good, not any hour of any day. I still have not. I've not gotten to a

59
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:55.890
Lauren Anderson: Point where I feel good and feel like doing anything. Oh, I'm still I'm still waiting for now I want to practice for hours a day. I really do. I'm walking my dog. I do. Do I make sure to do that. I mean, even that my worst that was making sure to that every day but um

60
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.310
Lauren Anderson: But I mean, I don't know, I, I'm used to having not really on the heroin, but it in my lifetime and everything.

61
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:13.890
Lauren Anderson: I don't know. I usually read a lot. I usually have a lot of energy and what to do not saying that. And I do want to them by just don't feel up to it. I just

62
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:23.730
Lauren Anderson: And I don't usually I mean I talked to subs would help more with that kind of because I know that's from the heroin like

63
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:35.760
Lauren Anderson: How gives you. I used to joke that the only time I felt good enough and up to quitting was when I was hot, because I had the confidence and the euphoric feeling that I could do it.

64
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:46.800
Lauren Anderson: And when I was sick or lean and, you know, I knew it was impossible. And I couldn't do it. And you know, that's, I think that's why a lot of people go straight to treatment right after they use because

65
00:07:47.280 --> 00:08:04.350
Lauren Anderson: It's what gets them in the door helps give them that. But anyhow, I'm so I really haven't reclaim that with the with the subs that I had before the heroin. Yes. I mean, I wasn't really doing anything at the end of their when except walking my dog and laid down all the time.

66
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.640
Lauren Anderson: So,

67
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:14.700
Lauren Anderson: Can I slept before us Bureau busy so i don't know i'm just i'm willing to feel good enough to even even do a little bit each day like start cleaning my damn house.

68
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I say something

69
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.970
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, sure.

70
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to see if Dr. Aubrey also available to meet with us now because what you're talking about is my client, you still isn't stable, I can't, I don't know how useful like we can do some work. I can talk to you about some things but

71
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You sound just the way you're describing anxious and emotionally sound exactly as

72
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:54.720
Lauren Anderson: You're describing it. I'm frustrated. I was, I don't know. I know it's already I'm already on a big dose. I just, I don't even know. I'm like, maybe it just doesn't I'm immune to it. Now it's, it doesn't work for me because I really thought it'd be feeling better by now.

73
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think it's immune. This is I'm

74
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Never in group. I think I, I was asking you specifically I was I wanted to know how much was really important that we talked about how much, how often member I pushed it grew by

75
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: A few right

76
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.390
Lauren Anderson: And I don't want to talk about all in group because at the

77
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.950
Lauren Anderson: End. Remember I was doing a family.

78
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.930
Lauren Anderson: That was doing probably

79
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:26.460
Lauren Anderson: four grams a day, once I started doing my buddy went up from three to four because I had to do more for it to work. Basically because

80
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, and I never asked people how I just wanted to

81
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.730
Know,

82
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: These, these people, everybody's been through the same thing.

83
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just go see if I can get ahold of her

84
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I just, I just don't think you're going to benefit too much from

85
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.790
Lauren Anderson: Whoops. Let's see what we got here.

86
00:09:51.330 --> 00:10:04.350
Lauren Anderson: But I have. I've still been doing better on the cocaine. I had like a crazy craving the other day and then tried to scrape my strong did like a tiny line, but I was doing it every day. And I've still since I started on the Wellbutrin

87
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:16.590
Lauren Anderson: Like about a week and a half ago now, I, I've not been doing. I mean, I just did that one line that's great for my straw, about five days ago when I was having a bad moment. But otherwise, I've not been doing it and I was doing it every day.

88
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So, this this this rate of speech. The way you're talking. Now, does this feel normal for you.

89
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.440
Lauren Anderson: I have some social anxiety. So in person with people I talk non stop. A lot of times, yes. Okay.

90
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:31.800
Lauren Anderson: So,

91
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But this rate, even though you may have, like, like you wonder, I wonder if this is part of a social anxiety. At this rate, how quickly you can you can speak, that's normal for you right

92
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.620
Lauren Anderson: Pretty normal. Yeah, okay.

93
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's rapid

94
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.280
Lauren Anderson: Because my mom crazy

95
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.930
Let me just see if I can coordinate some

96
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.440
Lauren Anderson: Girl.

97
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.870
Lauren Anderson: Oh boy.

98
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, she's finishing up a meeting, so she's going to join us in a little bit. So let me hear a little bit about some context, you probably told me, but

99
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know information during that bio psychosocial comes to me so fast. It's hard for me to retain, are you, um, are you living alone with just your mosquitoes.

100
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.130
Lauren Anderson: Yes.

101
00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:56.910
Okay.

102
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just struck me

103
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That social anxiety thing I just remembered something wasn't you, that talked about

104
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Hearing. Was it a step mother that was terribly negative to you.

105
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.820
Lauren Anderson: Yeah yeah

106
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you share a few stories are kind of let me in a little bit about that what that was like.

107
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:42.900
Lauren Anderson: I wasn't closes to age to her only child closest in age to her only child, as I think that's my theory is. That's why I got the brunt of it like the worst of it.

108
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:53.400
Lauren Anderson: Because she did do it to my siblings. Also, my, my brother who's older and my sister who's much younger. Um, I mean, it's like things. I don't know. I wouldn't say to my worst enemy.

109
00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:03.270
Lauren Anderson: But maybe it's partly because I learned from her how bad it fills, but I don't know, just really she used to make fun of me for example.

110
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:21.390
Lauren Anderson: Right after they got married, I was a it was the end of my sixth grade year, and she started to harass me on a daily basis about how dorky I was making fun of my clothing and that I was ugly. And then I had no friends that I was a loser. So, um,

111
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:31.560
Lauren Anderson: When then this was a daily tirade I mean every day and she would just laugh and point and make fun of me and everyone joining in the sets the way she did it.

112
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:40.470
Lauren Anderson: Oh my gosh, my siblings to she called my brother nigger knows my sister pirates dream concave chest

113
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.820
Lauren Anderson: Snuggle tooth.

114
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: where we're at in this as someone to talk to. Intel, this was going on.

115
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:55.980
Lauren Anderson: He tried to defend me sometimes, and they would end up fighting and eventually she would threaten divorce and he would try and just

116
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.810
Lauren Anderson: Keep her

117
00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.220
Lauren Anderson: Or something.

118
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.210
Lauren Anderson: No, no.

119
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like it. I don't like it. I like it.

120
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:18.090
Lauren Anderson: Apparently I left my senior year to live and ironically with her older sister, my step moms older sister in California, and it was one of the most therapeutic things I've done

121
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:26.400
Lauren Anderson: Or sinister apparently she'd been like that since she was about three or four years old and she started to rule the house.

122
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:38.190
Lauren Anderson: You have you look at a yearbook of the whole things like dedicated to her. It's basically a thing to worship my step mom real real prettiest flight attendant total bitch makes fun of people

123
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.450
Lauren Anderson: And also easy to talk to. I think she also taught me to

124
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:50.910
Lauren Anderson: Not be repressed. I mean, maybe it's almost like sometimes TMI kind of thing. But I don't hold stuff in, you know, my mom is that way.

125
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:59.190
Lauren Anderson: We'll closed off, which wasn't the best combination. I mean, I don't think she probably helped me enough when I was little, because she's not very touchy.

126
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:07.350
Lauren Anderson: very affectionate like I've only seen her cry one since when I soak the bathroom trying to clean it. I didn't notice doing I was like seven

127
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:18.810
Lauren Anderson: And that's the only time I could remember her ever crying. So she, you know, it's, I don't know the two extremes. I guess if she was a little bad to me the step mom so

128
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Lauren the treatment that I want to offer you.

129
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:34.920
I think fits really well with what you're describing, you're talking about an interpersonal attachment wound and

130
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm optimistic.

131
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want you to not be so distracted physiologically that we can't have these experiences. Now I can't really tell because I'm not in your body. I don't know whether you're fine. Really, and we can proceed forward. I don't know. Right. Um, I

132
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.720
Lauren Anderson: Don't feel very withdrawals he physically. I really don't.

133
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.260
Lauren Anderson: Oh,

134
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.810
Lauren Anderson: It's, I think, more of it is

135
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:11.340
Lauren Anderson: Just the, the feeling of being okay and feeling motivated to do things with my day.

136
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.150
Lauren Anderson: You know, just having positive energy

137
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and that do that. We can we can talk about maybe

138
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Why the motivation, isn't there, and maybe why dopa mean isn't there and why serotonin, isn't there and why sort of that baseline happy isn't there, we can get into the physiology of the brain.

139
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And what we've done, sort of, with those drugs to mess with that baseline that that makes sense. And then over time.

140
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: As you start to normalize and maybe now that the doc is here. I invited her and thank you for making time Dr brielle we can see if we can get you

141
00:19:48.540 --> 00:20:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So that all day isn't like this right you supposed to have maybe a half hour in the morning, but most people are sleeping through that worst part.

142
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:15.600
Lauren Anderson: I don't, I'd still last night, I only slept three, three and a half hours, but the difference was after I took the meds. I did fall asleep right away, which was nice. Usually I'm up for four or five hours just trying to go to sleep. So that was a change

143
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But, and, you know,

144
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have

145
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Any of that amphetamine or cocaine any stimulant in there that has just got to be gone gone gone gone

146
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.030
Lauren Anderson: Right and

147
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You said

148
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you had five days, right. You think you

149
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:37.710
Lauren Anderson: Guys great my strong to go. It was like a tiny bit in the morning early like, you know, the beginning of my day. And that's it. Otherwise, I haven't done anything since

150
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Which

151
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.360
Lauren Anderson: I did on Wellbutrin

152
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.270
Lauren Anderson: Let's say Today's Tuesday.

153
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.400
Lauren Anderson: Been longer. It was last Wednesday was last Wednesday morning so

154
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not so we're not talking about a stimulant. So it might be, what's happening is something else. Now we know Seroquel is working for you.

155
00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And we know the quantity, maybe let's update. Dr. Aubrey all about what is working and then let's see what else we can do to support you through this. Once you share with her. What you did as far as the Seroquel and the quantity

156
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:18.000
Lauren Anderson: Oh, okay. Well, I tried the fair cool that first week. The 25 milligrams to help and it didn't do anything at all.

157
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:32.220
Lauren Anderson: But last night, I took it with one of the Kalani team and I did get tired right away and I slept like straight for three, three and a half hours, which is a big improvement for me.

158
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, oh, go ahead, go ahead.

159
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.150
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you could you could also increase the Seroquel to 50

160
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.010
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

161
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.370
Dawn Abriel: And that that is not a huge dose.

162
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.360
Dawn Abriel: I'm just, I am concerned that

163
00:21:52.830 --> 00:22:03.420
Dawn Abriel: The fact you I think you have it in your mind that taking the buprenorphine at night is helping you sleep and

164
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.610
Dawn Abriel: I really

165
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:12.630
Dawn Abriel: You would get the most benefit out of the medicine, by taking it first thing in the morning.

166
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:31.260
Dawn Abriel: Getting your blood level up within an hour, an hour and a half after taking the medicine and having the steady state of the medicine all through the day. I mean, you're at 24 milligrams of buprenorphine now low, a lot of medicine so

167
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:41.070
Dawn Abriel: You know, taking the the Seroquel in the Clonidine at night with still a high level of buprenorphine in your system.

168
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:55.260
Dawn Abriel: So that you know but and and it stays in there for you know 3642 hours. So you're taking it at night is kind of a magical thinking on your part that

169
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:03.750
Lauren Anderson: It wasn't intentional. I just wasn't feeling well. So I kept taking earlier and earlier and then it ended up being 6pm

170
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:13.320
Dawn Abriel: real important to cake at the same time every day real important in order for you, your body to get accustomed to this medicine.

171
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:23.340
Dawn Abriel: whatever is happening set an alarm, whatever it is, but take it the same time in the morning, every day, so

172
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you to, if we're starting at let's say we take it at six o'clock at PM. How do we get to

173
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How do we get to how do we get there, all at once like

174
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.550
Dawn Abriel: Tomorrow morning,

175
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

176
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.110
Dawn Abriel: Take it in the morning.

177
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.870
Lauren Anderson: Okay, but to take today's at 6pm so or maybe I should take it a little early tonight.

178
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.350
Dawn Abriel: Now, no. Yeah, because that way by closer reasonable. Yeah.

179
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.370
Lauren Anderson: Okay, I'll pick it up to the meeting. So I'm not talking about dissolving

180
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.480
Dawn Abriel: You bet.

181
00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.970
Lauren Anderson: Okay, let me if I run my mouth slug.

182
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.790
Dawn Abriel: That makes sense.

183
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:03.960
Lauren Anderson: I

184
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:09.180
Lauren Anderson: Don't get my start helping me also, I, I, I just thought I would be a little more

185
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.080
Lauren Anderson: Bill, a little more optimistic.

186
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.730
Lauren Anderson: About it now.

187
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:28.140
Dawn Abriel: Within know look all opioids have a an effect on serotonin. So as the opioids are up and you've got a lot of dopa mean being

188
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:35.910
Dawn Abriel: Created because of the opioids it suppresses the serotonin. It makes people depressed.

189
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:45.390
Dawn Abriel: So that's one of the reasons I taper everyone. We've got to get your eventually got to get that down. See your serotonin can come back up.

190
00:24:45.810 --> 00:25:02.220
Dawn Abriel: Or we put you on an antidepressant that artificially brings the serotonin up. But no, you are not going to feel Groovy here for a while because you're on so much opioid the long acting opioids, but still it causes depression.

191
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the behavioral health King carp come in here. If you can say the meaning I make out of this low motivation is the following. My body is getting used to this.

192
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.050
Lauren Anderson: I will get better.

193
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It will get better. This is not depression. I'm right. This is chemistry.

194
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: A run in a chemistry experiment here.

195
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, I'm

196
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.280
Lauren Anderson: Here you permanently know

197
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, it's okay, I'm going to get through today. Today is a day. I'm going to be a little slug. I'm just going to slog through today. I'm okay. I'm lovable. I'm okay. Just me and my dog. Okay. Lots of folks with him.

198
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:55.170
Lauren Anderson: I think now that you mentioned that I realized that I think that's I'm more afraid of it being enough. This is how it from now on, then that's when then today not doing stuff. It's

199
00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:03.930
Dawn Abriel: Where it will pass you will. You've got to rewire, you've got to retrain your brain and the work with Guinier

200
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:23.940
Dawn Abriel: Creates that opportunity for your brain to change because once you get the incentive and the understanding that you have to generate your own doping mean with self care with finding joy with finding things that that make pleasure that

201
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:38.400
Dawn Abriel: You know they're there they are. They can't compare to math, they just can't. But so they start getting you in the habit of creating your own doper mean and not relying on it from the outside so

202
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So a substance introduces into the body. This amount of

203
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.690
Dawn Abriel: Show a picture.

204
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a dope. I mean, right, it's, it says, I'm going to allow this much dopamine release.

205
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's artificial it's inhuman it's alien should never happen. Watch this is how

206
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how much we naturally produce

207
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.850
With a sunset.

208
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You did this. So now your brains waiting for this.

209
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what we produce and you want to hurry up and say what's up, bring give it a chance to heal.

210
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you were doing this. That's what's happening. It's expecting all of this to come in. By the way, this domain is not the same thing.

211
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: As a satisfied life which is serotonin production.

212
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This dopa mean well there goes my fingers, it inhibits long term happiness hormone

213
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the serotonin to actually messes with the production of it. So this is really this gets complicated. But if you just picture. Yes, I'm trying, instant gratification, with the dopamine rush. It's inhibiting long term happiness. We can get there, we gotta let your brain recover.

214
00:27:53.970 --> 00:28:05.670
Dawn Abriel: Go ahead, this is this is a little cartoon of this is just baseline, you know, going along. This is the best day ever good hair day

215
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:22.830
Dawn Abriel: At you know that people love you, you know, you got the job you want everything is just so perfect. This is the amount of dopamine you're succeeding, you're making this is just regular dose of methamphetamine crazy it's

216
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.540
Dawn Abriel: A brain can't compare

217
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:33.090
Dawn Abriel: It is so huge that you could have you know the best day again just does pales in comparison

218
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:46.920
Dawn Abriel: So, your brain is remembering this and your brain is saying, hey, go to do that thing that made you feel like this. So it's giving you a false message and

219
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:55.350
Dawn Abriel: You know, being with going to be here and learning the therapy where you can say, yeah, my brains trying to trick me and I'm going to get in the habit of

220
00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:20.310
Dawn Abriel: You know, exercising meditating doing chicken learning Tai Chi, whatever it is, where you can start manufacturing your own and and feeling that you're manufacturing it that will get you on the road to, you know, then when you're tapering it adds into the possibility of normalizing

221
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.470
Lauren Anderson: Well, I did not do methamphetamine, just to clarify,

222
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Oh.

223
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hope you did.

224
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's kind of

225
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.120
Lauren Anderson: Right now.

226
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

227
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Just replace those two

228
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So while she's here. I want to let her get back to what she was doing but

229
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You have any questions around. See, when you mentioned it was interesting you mentioned Seroquel at 25 what I've been listening. That's typically those people go down to when the 50 doesn't work. So I was surprised you started at 25

230
00:29:52.470 --> 00:30:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So just to normalize it like what I'm used to hearing. Again, I'm not a doctor or an RN usually 25 to one when was too much they're waking up sluggish or

231
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Were there were some other negative side effects, but either way 50 is low 25 really low and you experienced three hours of sleep. I'm excited about this other 25 milligrams of Seroquel for you.

232
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.060
Lauren Anderson: Well, I think it was a calamity and more than anything, because I took the 25 every night for a week and it did nothing.

233
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.680
Lauren Anderson: Right last

234
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.330
Lauren Anderson: Yeah yeah don't work.

235
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.800
Lauren Anderson: The combo that adding it maybe. Okay. All right.

236
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple of changes. Here's what I'm hearing trying 50 milligrams a circle. I'd like to see you get six hours of sleep at night.

237
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.070
Lauren Anderson: I know it's been

238
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.330
Lauren Anderson: A while. I don't even know.

239
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I want nine but I want to make a goal we get you to have six

240
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:54.750
Lauren Anderson: It's been two or three years since I've slept that long. Yeah. And once I'm and should I continue for the rest of the 30 days on those will be turned to someone stick to

241
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.340
Lauren Anderson: The same one also.

242
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.320
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, okay.

243
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.630
Dawn Abriel: And, you know,

244
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:12.900
Dawn Abriel: It takes a while to have its effect. So let's see how you feel in in a month. And if we need to increase it. We can just to be

245
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Here are you recommending an increase in Sarah colon. If you are. Is there enough medicine to get her all the way to the next date of service.

246
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.360
Dawn Abriel: Oh yeah okay there's

247
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Do you have any other questions. So we've got will end here you'll take the medicine because now you're getting closer to the morning then tomorrow ticket. When you first get up and

248
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:38.850
Lauren Anderson: And

249
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:45.420
Lauren Anderson: You guys know I just have three days supply from yesterday right the for the up north in

250
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.850
Dawn Abriel: I think, yeah, that was to get you to

251
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.650
Lauren Anderson: Disappointment. Okay.

252
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:51.450
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

253
00:31:52.320 --> 00:32:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, any other questions before we let her go love that animation that was really cool. Nice to see ya.

254
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.890
Lauren Anderson: Thank you, Dr.

255
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.650
Dawn Abriel: You're so welcome. Take care. Thank you.

256
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.070
Bye bye.

257
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's talk a little bit about

258
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coping skills you already have. I don't want to repeat something that you already have a one that I like to teach immediately.

259
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Addresses what you were talking about earlier, which is this. I'm feeling emotional and I'm feeling anxious 99.9% of the people that come in here saying the same thing.

260
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm treating my social anxiety. I'm treating my trauma. I'm treating my PTSD. I'm treating I've got this marriage that I'm unhappy with oh it's this work their self medicating right what they consider sort of this

261
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Anxiety.

262
00:32:48.720 --> 00:33:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're in good company because most people kind of have looked at sort of the off label of benefits of it. And what I want to talk to you about is a way to use your body

263
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The Vegas nerve in order to regulate the body and I want to talk to you a little bit about it, but I don't want to repeat something you already know. So when you've been in you've been in a rehab before craft.

264
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.850
Lauren Anderson: Detox just seven days.

265
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Your whole life. That's the only treatment you've ever had.

266
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: As far so far. Oh.

267
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay, you are interested. Good stuff. Then, and I'm excited. I'm going to give everything I have is yours. I don't hold anything for myself if if I could pack everything into 60 minutes I'd give it all to you right away.

268
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So the first one I want to give you and me give you the one thing

269
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That most people. And you know what's really cool. I just got a text from someone who said I kid you not, it is one year. I have been off of the buprenorphine still clean

270
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so excited. And I said, I made some really some information come into the group and you can talk about your story. So I'm really excited. Maybe I'll be able to have him be a guest in our groups, but my point is

271
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The one thing that people and I'm gonna teach it to you now that they remember that helps them remember all the other cool things you're going to learn

272
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is die from out of breathing. That's the belly breath or box breathing. Has anyone ever talked to you about the importance of it. The value of it. The science behind it even talk to you taught you how to do it.

273
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.010
Lauren Anderson: Go ahead. Okay.

274
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:34.200
Lauren Anderson: My mom is a singer and a speech language pathologist. So I've heard a lot of stuff. But I want to, I haven't heard it from a psycho social

275
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there

276
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.670
Lauren Anderson: We go.

277
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, oh, I'm totally. I love this. So I'm I see myself as sort of a salesperson. So I'm going to sell you this idea

278
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm gonna give it my best shot. Now the neat thing about this is you don't have to believe it for it to work. It's not psychological okay

279
00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body has nerves, which you already know that there's a nerve called the Vegas nerve that is also called the wandering nerve. It goes to our ears are our facial muscles. This little

280
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Bone in our ear, he goes to our lyrics in fairness to our heart to our lungs to our stomach to other organs in our body.

281
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember the stomach one, remember the heart. Remember the lungs. Remember the facial muscles that's going to come into this this social medicine part on another day we'll pick that one up. But for now I want you to remember

282
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's connected to the viscera. Those are your guts. So here's what diaphragm breathing does for you and I'm a call a belly breathing, because that other words, way too long.

283
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is I'm going to give you instruction. You don't have to do it. This is only the explaining and then I'm going to do it again and again and again and again and we'll do it together. So here it is. The instructions are these, you'll be asked to breathe in through your nose.

284
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: For four seconds while you're breathing in through your nose, you're going to be focusing on sort of the tactile experience of the cool air, maybe even your little nose hairs kind of noticing how they're going in.

285
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And the main piece that's important, even if you forget everything else about it is this

286
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're breathing in through your nose. You're going to have your hands on your stomach and you're going to actually notice that the shoulders. Don't move. And why don't they move because the air is coming in through

287
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: top of my lungs and instead it's going down into the bottom of along of what's happening with my hands as I'm pressing in, they're going to come out to hear they're coming out to hear because the bottom of my lung is full. I'm not breathing like this.

288
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Not anymore.

289
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The differences belly breath. That's actually why I call it because I don't want anyone to forget that we're breathing into the belly expanding it like a balloon. So I'm gonna do it a few times and

290
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of talk you through this, but this is the key piece. This is the mechanism of change. So it's going to be something like this.

291
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that my shoulders didn't rise up and down, but I did was

292
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I breathe in through my nose for four seconds I breathe in mindfully paying attention to texture and temperature.

293
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: As it made its way, I noticed that my hands were pushed out by the expansion of my lower long, then I held my breath for 4321 and then I deliberately exhale out of my mouth and I could feel it.

294
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I could feel that my right, my stomach was getting flatter. My hands were coming in and I could feel the air coming out of my mouth and I was concentrating on it and I did it for

295
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Four seconds and then I hold it out, no breath and my long for 4321 and then inhale.

296
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold

297
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale,

298
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull no breath.

299
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to be inhale.

300
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's the instruction. We're not going to do it still going to keep explaining to the mechanism, why this is science. It's not psychobabble okay

301
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This will work, whether you believe in it or you don't.

302
00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what's happening.

303
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're in a stress response up in our head, like I'm a, let's say,

304
00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: There's always going to feel like I'll let's say I've got a story of that I run through my head, which is an accomplished, and I didn't reach my goal.

305
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm a loser. I might label myself, I've got this running dialogue going and going and coming up with more evidence and I'm in

306
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in a neural network in my brain is very negative and it's attached to emotions in my limbic system that are very distressing and I'm feeling sad and scared.

307
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to feel like that. I'm unproductive. I can't get my to do list. Done. I don't even want to talk to anybody. I want to feel better. So watch what's happening.

308
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Up here, I'm thinking a negative thought about myself. I'm an idiot. I'm a failure and emotionally I'm anxious that's happening right here, up here, guess what happens when I breathe.

309
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: My diaphragm pushes down the Oregon's underneath you know die from great you got medical people that you're you got the singer. So you know what the diaphragm. So the diaphragm pushes down the organs.

310
00:39:54.030 --> 00:40:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Underneath it and send a message upward, a fairly upward and says, hey, we're fine.

311
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the message from here going, yeah. The message from here going down is time to freak out. I'm a loser. I encode it's

312
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Always going to feel like this. That's a fact. I've got fact I've got lots of stories to prove it. So it's up here going like that. And guess what the message coming up this way.

313
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.850
Lauren Anderson: You use the middle finger for that the message.

314
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:24.570
Lauren Anderson: Well, good.

315
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'll kind of like, I guess I gotta remember you have a great sense of humor. We're going to go on why

316
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the thing. So it's incomplete.

317
00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Contradiction isn't it.

318
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because guess what if there really was someone in the room we look around right now, I want you to look for actual danger.

319
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.570
Lauren Anderson: But I want to talk to me when my house was cleaner.

320
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's perceived threat.

321
00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about danger that would be a grounding dog at you about to bite you. That would be danger. Right.

322
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:01.530
Lauren Anderson: Yeah.

323
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm knife, a gun someone about to. Okay.

324
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.990
Lauren Anderson: Right, yeah. Gotcha.

325
00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like it, but I would have explained this little bit anyway. But the point of the matter is up here, you're perceiving danger, you're perceiving it this

326
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is proof. You are not because guess what, there's no way you are breathing deeply if there's a lion or a tiger or a bear no one breeze like that we do this.

327
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And our little hands come up here, right. We're ready. We're ready to to protect ourselves or we're ready to run. We're in fight or flight. That's the sympathetic nervous system. What I'm talking about is called a video break

328
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The, what did I say earlier the Vegas nerve so Vegas break that's putting a break on this stuff up here. All that rumination of worry and fret and anxiety of here. This is working with the body.

329
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And telling that mine that's not true. We're okay. Guess what we get to be in a relaxed body can stay vigilant, you can be conscious and have your eyes open and still know what's going on and be in a

330
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be in a relaxed body my muscles can relax my heart does not have to demand as much oxygen respiration slows down right

331
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I can breathe deep into that belly. That's why the truth be told, it's not because I have dramatic reading so long. It's because belly breathing. I don't want to take a chance at any one forgets the important part. It's the belly expanding why

332
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: smashes the diaphragm down sends a message up here. Look at us. Look, it is blowing up alone up down here, we must be all right. There's no way. There's no way we're going to read like this, if we're in trouble.

333
00:42:53.010 --> 00:43:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right sends a message total contradiction to the thought, I'm no good. And I'll always be no good. I'll never be happy. It's incomplete.

334
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.590
Lauren Anderson: That's a physical that's a physical message. Good.

335
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.870
Lauren Anderson: And this one is is right.

336
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.350
Lauren Anderson: Now, that's what the message coming from here. Those not about our physical health, necessarily.

337
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can get into the fact that even up here. This mushy thing we call a brain.

338
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still chemistry still

339
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.510
Lauren Anderson: Bother you can help, but I don't, I don't know. Okay, nevermind.

340
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.220
Lauren Anderson: Yeah yeah

341
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll come back to it very complicated. So we'll take just this one piece of information. And again, I say, you don't have to believe it for it to work.

342
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you look in history and you look at certain spiritual beliefs, the breath work has been a part of a lot of beliefs, maybe we didn't have the physiological explanation for it before, but we do now.

343
00:43:51.930 --> 00:44:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: People have known that this works before we even knew we say we'll take a deep breath, man. Watch. Calm down. Okay, well, you know, first, screw you don't tell me what to do but number two.

344
00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like we've known it all along. We just didn't really kind of get the science behind it. But now we do

345
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So I like to teach it to you again. But in a little slower methodical way and and do it with you.

346
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'd like it to be useful. So are you open. Well, what do we got we got

347
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Like 10 minutes let's see what we can do here.

348
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you think of something that's not 100 out of 100 scary horrible thought I don't want the worst thing you've ever thought that maybe just a little like this kind of sucks. I don't like this thought. Just think of maybe about a 50 that's kind of a man. That's kind of a yuck.

349
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you think of one.

350
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.350
Lauren Anderson: I don't know what to ask him.

351
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What's okay, well, you're probably already in an anxious mode. So I probably don't even need to tell you what

352
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You're probably already in it. So we'll just go with how you're feeling now. So the problem with what I'm seeing with your posture, for example, you're not sitting on my couch.

353
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sitting over there. And if you were here, I would say, I'd like you just sit up. So the air can actually get in the lungs. Can we do that together. Can we sit up a little bit.

354
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And let your thought just be whatever it is, whatever is happening in there and just pay attention. Let's do a little body scan.

355
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And just sort of pay attention to what catches your attention where you notice there's tension or maybe there's energy shifting

356
00:45:48.120 --> 00:46:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be a sinking feeling heavy could be nasza some people notice tension here, they might notice it got a bit of a headache or their hands are tight. They might notice their foot is tapping

357
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: They might notice that their chest short shallow breaths. The stomach is turning where there's pain in the back, the knees something happening for you arm. What do you notice, just as you do a little check in with the body a little scan. What did you notice

358
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.430
Lauren Anderson: Physically, a little queasy with maybe a little about my stomach.

359
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:27.570
I'm

360
00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:34.140
Lauren Anderson: Angry like we've been okay for my bill right here.

361
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.350
Lauren Anderson: Like hurting myself.

362
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so queasy. That's an

363
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.500
Lauren Anderson: Estimate on using

364
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.000
Lauren Anderson: My stomach. Yeah.

365
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.020
Uneasy

366
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then also, you notice an emotion of anger.

367
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.760
Lauren Anderson: That's really first emotion for. Yep.

368
00:46:54.330 --> 00:47:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the body that happened to happen the emotion is labelled angry. The body registers queasy in the stomach and you notice something else we be

369
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.700
Lauren Anderson: With for the first one I've realized swelled up top. My throat by

370
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.120
My

371
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Top of throat. That's it. And behind the eyes.

372
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:17.400
Lauren Anderson: Then I'm Clenching my teeth.

373
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And there we go. Now we're getting somewhere.

374
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: clenched teeth weepy this sense of right at the top of the throat. You can feel it sort of sitting right there, let's do this together.

375
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to exhale all your air out and I'm going to be guiding for quite a few of these. So let it all out.
