00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Me.

2
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.040
James: Alright.

3
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: As doing a couple things. One, I was running over with my client this morning and be I have to have all the zoom videos separate so I gotta close your eyes out. And so I kicked out this last time.

4
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.270
James: Yeah.

5
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so let's um let's continue the conversation from Abby video group. What are you, what are you noticing about yourself in there. That's just starting to change a little bit.

6
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.470
James: With the group.

7
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.390
James: Oh,

8
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.630
James: I don't know.

9
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.740
James: I mean, I guess I'm becoming a little bit more open

10
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there's that per se. I always know when the per se is there. It's like these, these little buffers. He's little you know this little cushion, it's like not quite the full truth, nothing but the truth, so help me God, per se.

11
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.800
James: Yeah, they basically

12
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, your language gives you away.

13
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.380
James: Photos, it does sometimes it does it.

14
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway. Well, I'm glad you're here.

15
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And something you had said in in group was well I can go back in there just open this note up

16
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: See

17
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, damn, isn't it, yes.

18
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. What did you say

19
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think she put

20
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: In quite what were you studying quotes. She paraphrase a little

21
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm I have been something up on my meetings differences. Oh Father lent me his vehicle. I could come to my workplace where I have Wi Fi to do meetings.

22
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I just had to ask. I was surprised. It was as easy as it was kind of dissipated and by the law. This week I have not been doing too well.

23
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: filled with rage a lot and angry about things. I can't control rage towards current situation with the court and probation and work. Sometimes I cut my hours again.

24
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

25
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.780
James: Yeah.

26
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.640
James: Yeah.

27
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So how many hours are you basically going to work this week.

28
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.170
James: Oh, I'm not sure yet.

29
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well it's Thursday I call me me worked yesterday.

30
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:23.370
James: See that's the thing they cut my hours again due to the fucking coven 19 bullshit. They now I have tuesday wednesday and Thursdays often only work Monday Friday and Saturday.

31
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So it sounds like based on all the expletives that you see this as a negative thing.

32
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, where's your money going

33
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.230
What do you

34
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.890
James: Mean money.

35
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do with your money. Wait, we don't watch money.

36
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.050
James: Oh, happy.

37
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.940
James: If

38
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.310
James: It goes to the core to goes the food he goes to helping my family. It goes is supporting myself.

39
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.270
James: Because of my suburban goes in my vehicles because of my dad's feel a vehicles and feel

40
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, you have a car payment.

41
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.510
James: Not necessarily car payment just more like it goes in the gas money. It goes into shit that I have to buy for the house.

42
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example of a ship. Yes.

43
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.340
James: My, my own ship which I want to buy

44
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: A house, man.

45
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Food yeah food. I've got courts.

46
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Groceries.

47
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that an expectation that kind of does just this

48
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.130
Girl.

49
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.690
James: Okay.

50
00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it kind of like at your house. Hey, you're gonna you're going to be eaten like

51
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to bring bring your own food and kind of thing.

52
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.290
James: Yeah, basically.

53
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts on that.

54
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

55
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it like mom's house.

56
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.690
James: No.

57
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think dad's reasoning is for

58
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That

59
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.480
James: Oh, he's got

60
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:16.980
James: He's got too damn good reasons. One, one being the low. Well, it's his house to actually he's got a couple damn good reason to being in his house, so it is food. So, therefore, if I eat something, I gotta replace it three being he's preparing me to be on my own.

61
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.710
James: He's like whatever food you eat you place.

62
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:35.700
James: Basically going and it's like a it's like having a fucking apartment. He told me he's not used to live here but you buy food whatever food you eat your place, whatever you drink your, your players. You don't touch my booze.

63
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I really

64
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.760
James: Simple rules from him.

65
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like a like a roommate, like you, you would be more like a roommate.

66
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.110
James: Yeah.

67
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.880
James: I got. Yeah.

68
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.030
James: I roommate that I've known my whole entire life.

69
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I get it. Yeah. So, so you can really see was there some resistance inside of you. When you first heard this. Were you initially angry, but now you've come around, you kind of get it like this is for your best interest.

70
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.630
Yeah.

71
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

72
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.230
James: And when it's not your mom, I get it, understand it, for sure.

73
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.340
James: Go for it.

74
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we have this really long delay. So it ends up happening in

75
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.440
James: My mom.

76
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, in the video. We have a long delay. I just want to say, so we'll have to really sort of pace our responses. So, all right, let me say something

77
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I was asking you is over at moms, is it I don't get to have as much freedom. I don't get to demonstrate to myself that I'm an adult. Right.

78
00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have to follow more of her rules. Yes, I might get free food, but it means I have to follow her rules and I don't get to see in real time. If I can handle my own shit.

79
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.350
James: Yeah, basically.

80
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sense. I get it. So you kind of opted for this approach with the

81
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.050
James: Yeah.

82
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. OK, so now I really see why this is frustrating for you.

83
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your Dad saying, I mean, are you communicating with a dad, I mean massively cut back on ours. What does he respond to with that like tough shatter. What's he say

84
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.680
James: He just told me to do what I can to help

85
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So good roommate to have

86
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.010
James: And he's being

87
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.610
James: Understand yeah he's being, understand the standing of it.

88
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's flexibility. That's nice.

89
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you noticing that you're offering to help

90
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.800
James: Yeah.

91
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Like helping build something or work on a car something extra to sort of make up for

92
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.710
Not only

93
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:50.940
James: Yeah, helping with vehicles helping with yard work helping around the house, helping doing chores helping fixing things

94
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.990
James: Putting the weeds.

95
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.090
James: shit like that.

96
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's shift gears a little bit and go over to

97
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually know let's say this here for a second because you know how

98
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You have more time, but maybe all that time is getting filled with doing this busy.

99
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Household sort of around the house stuff, helping out your pops.

100
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is there also time where you're hanging out on a couch or in bed and not doing anything or is there any of that extra time going on.

101
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.980
James: Sometimes a little

102
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:56.280
James: Well, mainly I try to keep myself busy between doing stuff for my dad or doing stuff for myself or just straight up.

103
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.710
James: Working out and

104
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.130
James: keep him busy. Okay.

105
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So, what's something else you could be doing with this unexpected time that would contribute to your long term goals. What some something you could be doing

106
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.230
James: Working out harder longer

107
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What is one of your goals in your treatment plan that you and I have here.

108
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.200
James: Oh, I'm not sure to go to the Navy. I guess I know get out of town initiative.

109
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Get the f out of town. No, but yes on me.

110
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To do. Where is it, it's I want to join the Navy Marines.

111
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you already have the working out. But notice how if you have expected time your, your issue was never the working out.

112
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:19.980
James: Yeah, I understand.

113
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great news.

114
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So anyway.

115
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What is it that you're doing.

116
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That

117
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you could redirect some of that.

118
00:12:53.700 --> 00:13:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Sitting on the couch. They could also be an investment, you've already mentioned, working out, which you hadn't identified before you told me you are already working out.

119
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But what could you be doing to help yourself get towards that goal. Now that you have unexpected time. What could you be doing

120
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.820
James: I'm not too sure if you

121
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.230
James: Studying for testing as fab.

122
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

123
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had it cross your mind and decided, yeah.

124
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.820
James: No, I haven't been crossing the line for a little bit.

125
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about a little bit

126
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello long is a little bit

127
00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.340
James: Couple weeks.

128
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.160
James: To dig up dad. My dad, put it

129
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And would it be any different if you were at your mom's would she be saying, hey, we need to be studying or would it be sitting somewhere, you'd be able to find it.

130
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Would there be a different sort of in that that environment.

131
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.040
James: Not really.

132
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, gotcha.

133
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you think that says about

134
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your commitment and resolve to going to the Marines. What do you think that says that you don't know where the book is

135
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.320
James: By now,

136
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:10.170
James: But no matter what anybody says, including your my probation officer la even the fucking judge. I'm going to stop me from going to the fucking Marine Corps, the Navy on going, no matter what.

137
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you hear me saying right now.

138
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.940
James: I hear doubt.

139
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.030
James: Doubt from a lot of people

140
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, whoo. Good stuff. And what's the emotion you feel when you hear doubt from me.

141
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:52.500
James: I honestly do not give a fuck what you think about me or what my future plans are.

142
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.740
James: Yeah, so it really doesn't affect me. I mean, it makes me

143
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.090
James: I don't know, just kind of

144
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.970
James: I don't know really doesn't matter.

145
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.490
James: what it feels like.

146
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.140
James: My sister.

147
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.000
James: Are my mother.

148
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so similar.

149
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did a great job of describing the thoughts, but go at it one more time. This time, see if you can find. It'll come from one word whole group of words.

150
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: For the emotion, so I don't give a fuck what you think. Right, that's, that's the thought that goes with

151
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Your care about my opinion. Hey, and you know, I don't give a fuck is much like how you might see me in a sense, along with sister and mother.

152
00:16:53.490 --> 00:17:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you may see in sister and me and mother is we doubt you so that's how it feels. That's how it is experienced. Those are the thoughts. But what I'm asking is the emotion. So right now, see if you can identify the emotion big emotions. I can make it typical is sad, angry.

153
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Afraid anxious disgusted surprised jealous happy.

154
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the big guys. Which one do you think would capture how your emotion that you have right now.

155
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.810
James: Oh,

156
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:52.650
James: Probably somewhere along the lines of enraged and yeah

157
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

158
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes

159
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.020
James: It really enraged

160
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. James, if I

161
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sensed if I believed that someone didn't believe in me.

162
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I cared about their opinion. I would be enraged

163
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But if they didn't care about their opinion.

164
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be like this full just didn't know me, I am I already got. I already know what's up. I'm gonna get my butt or two.

165
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Marines and that that's that.

166
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible

167
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That there's

168
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A filter that maybe is between my intent and your, your, let's say understanding of my intent. Is it a possibility that it's some altered universe, maybe

169
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone else

170
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: might interpret my intent differently than doubting you

171
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:20.550
James: Um, I don't know, maybe, maybe not becomes an how you look at it, it depends on how you perceive that

172
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. So someone else are you saying someone else might perceive my asking

173
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: About

174
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you're

175
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing where your book is

176
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Is maybe why you're not remembering to study.

177
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus downing you as if you can't do it. I mean, those are hugely different

178
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.180
James: Yeah.

179
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so do you notice that how I like if you had to guess, would you say I'm enraged to

180
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.070
James: Know I'm like you

181
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, right. So even though you presented with obviously right some behaviors.

182
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: F bombs, etc. Which is pretty standard fare with you. I'm like,

183
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he's going through something right but that's not about me. That's about you.

184
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you interested in actually knowing what my intent is about those questions about where where that book is the F I forget the FF book. I gotta keep forget the acronym, do you actually want to know my intent.

185
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:03.780
James: Yeah.

186
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.860
Yeah.

187
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So is

188
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: James like ask I dance. I asked questions that are sort of indirect and I dance around things, um,

189
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But my intent is truly. Hey, have you thought of studying with your downtime. When you're not working. This could be great timing to be studying and showing your dad.

190
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Legit I'm for real on this like look quiz me dad or, you know, I'm trying to say like investing in yourself because

191
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're going to obviously you're getting in, you're going to get in. It's just going to be a matter of sort of managing time getting, you know, maybe. Okay. I want to work out a second time today.

192
00:21:48.840 --> 00:22:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I do the hard stuff. I'm going to set it up so that I study, study account just I'll do 20 minutes and then I'll give myself a ticket to go lift weights. I'm a trick myself. I'm going to be my own parent because that's what we all do I

193
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Make doing the hard stuff first. Well, I want to trick myself and I'm going to do just a little bit of it, and then I'll reward myself.

194
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: With the good stuff. So you know I get up and I signed some notes and I do it while I'm exercising and it's like, Okay, well, this is how I'm gonna get this stuff done. And then I'll watch some funny YouTube videos.

195
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Will start doing some of my fun projects.

196
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But I, I, kind of, I made myself do it I don't overthink it. I've gotten in the habit of it. So, for a lot of people. It's a really handy trick. So

197
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you still hearing me doubting you or is it starting to shift.

198
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.610
James: Know,

199
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.310
James: It's starting to shift.

200
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, good. Oh good, but we needed to get through that did

201
00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, we needed to get through that and i'm i'm not surprised. I sit with people all day long, where our initial response is a sense of this guy is put me down. This woman is doing what all these these females in my life. They don't believe me they don't believe in me.

202
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you really believe in yourself, which you do, obviously.

203
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Then let's get in it. I want to support you and that's why I wrote down your goal. And so sometimes it really truly is that maybe no one ever told you these little hacks. These little tricks.

204
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To because maybe dad's giving you a lot of freedom, maybe mom was pressing down too hard on you. Maybe somewhere in between.

205
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is maybe what you and I can do, which is kind of giving some brainstorm ideas about ways that have worked for other people that might work for you so that you can do the hard stuff, which nobody wants to do, you know, nobody wants to do that stuff. It's awful.

206
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's the thing, here's the truth of the matter, right.

207
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. The truth is that

208
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I can almost promise you I can't do it 100% but I'm about 98% sure that you're imagining of how hard it is, and how frustrated. You're going to feel I truly do believe that your imagination is worse than how it's actually going to be, I think, when you actually get to the page.

209
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say, okay, just something to entertain this lady. I'm just going to see some find that book and I'm gonna take one page on a look at this one page or go online, I'll look at kind of, what are some of the different things, the skills needed to do this page.

210
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to see if it's as bad as I thought it would be.

211
00:24:46.830 --> 00:25:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I going to feel, you know, is not smart enough not good enough. Is it as bad as I thought. Or am I as frustrated as I thought it would be origin, I start problem solving and I basically just handled my shit I just handled it.

212
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I faced it I set a timer is only going to be 20 minutes while I'm going to do one page, whichever comes first and then I'm gonna go work out, am I going to overanalyze it. I don't even have to tell anybody. I did it because your life.

213
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you go and guess what, that's what adults do. That's what we do. It's nothing fancy.

214
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just we just drink ourselves all day long trick trick trick big trip there, you know, like, is we do, we do the hard stuff first

215
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you don't do it that way. The other thing that will happen. Most commonly, is that I think I've talked to you about what procrastination does right it will wait until it's right here right up next to us. And then, hurry up and scramble and get it done.

216
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So you

217
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: might decide to do it that way. Do you think that's probably what you're doing. You don't even know where the book is kind of thing.

218
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

219
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what about that phrase.

220
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:07.560
James: A little

221
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever heard this phrase I kind of like this one luck favors the prepared. What do you think of that phrase.

222
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.660
James: Never heard that before. I think

223
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see how

224
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you already. Yeah, look at, look at how it might be happening right now you have that book at your pops house somewhere maybe it's luck. You don't have as much work.

225
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, time to study, you could flip the story around and make it. You know what this might be good timing. I'm gonna see if this is going to pick, pick my pops off. Hey pops. What if I put in, you know, five hours of study time

226
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can prep for this a week without piss you off, or is that cool.

227
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: See what he says. I mean, maybe he'll be like, respect, what can you do in the hard stuff he might

228
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly

229
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you and then you can prove all us later.

230
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.680
James: I get what you mean I get what you mean.

231
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I don't doubt you

232
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:21.930
See

233
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what doubt looks like when in doubt what Dell would look like on me. I don't do it very much. I actually have a lot more belief in my clients, then

234
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Even family members do I assume you're capable. Actually, that's why I talk about what's next. If I didn't think you were capable, I wouldn't be saying, hey, what's next.

235
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I would just go up or down. How can we all take care of. Yeah, you know what, I'm not doing now i'm i'm saying let's listen X Men, what you're going to do what you can do wish.

236
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.030
James: Yeah.

237
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And actually does mean, I think you're capable

238
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see we got through that.

239
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.710
James: Again, what you mean. Thank you.

240
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

241
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what

242
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

243
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I was thinking about the other day.

244
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how your the people that you were hanging with that maybe were your pools. Right. They were getting alcohol. Are you spending less time with them, are you spending different time with them. How is that starting to change or not changing.

245
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.320
James: Oh, I haven't seen them in a while.

246
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That per se.

247
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.550
James: Oh, I said, I haven't seen them in a while.

248
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. I was, I was kind of making fun of you there a little bit. So

249
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So, it

250
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So it can feel lonely though without hanging with with people. Are you feeling a little bit like that isolation more so now that you're not hanging out with them.

251
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.610
James: Kind of, but I still hang out with different friends that don't drink.

252
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what are they into I think playing baseball video games. What are they doing for fun.

253
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:46.320
James: Oh, video game is hiking shooting fucking around for Willie dog walking fighting wrestling.

254
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.860
James: You name it, we're pretty much doing here.

255
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Are some of your friends that you're doing that.

256
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't worry, I'm not going to call him up.

257
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.870
James: Got a couple home is a hunter CJ

258
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:14.070
James: Hawking here. There you go. So, even some of my co workers.

259
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

260
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

261
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are, how are sort of tempers around the house with dad.

262
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you guys these days.

263
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're completely frozen right now.

264
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Video now.

265
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This

266
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Has this weird delay. Still, but I was asking you how you and your pops we're doing, is there any sort of arguing going on with you to these days.

267
00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

268
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.850
James: No, not really.

269
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:04.860
James: We're pretty good.

270
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about coming from maybe mom from

271
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty good. Any tension kind of between you and your mom.

272
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.090
James: A little bit, yeah.

273
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it kind of that same thing like you get a you get a vibe from her that she doesn't believe in you is that same kind of thing that happened in here.

274
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I didn't hear your response. I don't know what you said just now.

275
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This video today.

276
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, and you're frozen again.

277
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I've got your back. Okay, so what cut. What is the the

278
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The arguing or the conflict between you and your mom over because I wasn't able to hear that your video froze.

279
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Up. Dude, I can't hear you at all. What's the what hit your hit your mute button, maybe a couple times if that's NASA awake. A B C D E F G Yeah.

280
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope.

281
00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude, try, try maybe without the headphones and see

282
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. Maybe that's the problem.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:50.760
James: Like certain questions like, whether I'm going back over or where they are addition that, blah, blah, blah.

293
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's three blogs. Right.

294
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Blah, blah, blah. Yeah.

296
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Going back over. Are you saying she continues to say, when are you coming over you moving back in. When are you coming back. She keeps kind of doing that.

297
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:18.870
James: Yeah.

298
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:19.950
Oh,

299
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, is that because she doesn't know what to talk to you about

300
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:38.820
James: Yeah, that's basically because she fucking misses me being at her house to be her little fucking nigger, and do whatever the fuck she tells me to do with Shane doing this shit.

301
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you felt used over there.

302
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.710
James: Yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

304
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And no chance that that it's a misinterpretation. Right.

305
00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: No chance.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.020
James: Yeah, no.

James: Just whatever your fucking whatever

310
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:43.650

311
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:53.310
James: labor intensive and we're going to take the rest of the fucking day. And I'd be like, No, I'm home. I just got home, I want to fucking go to sleep.

312
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.080
James: Or I want to go pick up my friends or some shit.

313
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.950
James: Yeah, to get down controlling and manipulative

314
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You needed a chance to go

Gwenevere Abriel: Anybody else helping her is your sister with a mother.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:33.570
James: Oh fuck no. My sister is a piece of shit. The only sister lives in Colorado with her husband right now. My mom's living by herself with her.

James: Where I'm at Vanya

326
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so she's right there. And is that like a town where you kind of know every little

James: Yeah, my wife.

329
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:36.900
James: Yeah, more or less, because I know a lot of people down here and then a lot of the cops know me because of my mother. And because of my passion.

330
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:48.060
James: So the good and bad thing but know everybody knows everybody down here kind of fucking sucks. It really does. Honestly, fucking, so I can you can't take a shit sideways in this town without somebody saying something.

331
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of funny, I was picturing. How do you take a shit sideways.

332
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: On your leg.

333
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:09.900
Oh my

334
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I, I feel you on the small town thing i i've tried that and it's

335
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:17.430
James: Not a good

336
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I need a bigger town. I need a city.

337
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:21.930
James: Yeah, no.

338
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's the direction you're going.

339
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're going to have all of those

340
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.240
James: Opportunities. Yeah, honestly.

341
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. When you travel, you're going to get to see the world.

342
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get to see where you want to live.

343
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.490
James: It's gonna be fun.

344
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard work though. Let me tell you what, guess what you're going to be faced with

345
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: People that look like they're doubting you

346
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.760
James: What

347
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to look like they death, you're going to be faced with those kind of people all the time. Or you can find that switch that cool confidence inside when someone looks like they don't believe in you. And you can kind of keep chill.

348
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That is a skill you are going to be able to use when people are yelling at you and saying you're not doing this right. You know those in doc processes for those for the Marines, etc. Oh my gosh, we got to set pride.

349
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.760
Aside

350
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, for sure.

351
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.860
James: Honestly though.

352
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you heard some some stories about what in Doc is like

353
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:39.990
James: Yeah, my STEP BROTHERS an ex marine my dad was in the Navy. My grandfather was in the army and then I have a homie. That's actually the Marine Corps right now to

354
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's he what's a recent story. He tells you about what's it like for him.

355
00:41:49.440 --> 00:42:08.100
James: He says he likes it because he got away from home and he's not in state no more, he was able to get the fuck out of here. But at the same time he says that it's not what he thought it was going to be. And I still haven't deciphered that whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.

356
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

357
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:14.580
James: Yeah.

358
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I would. I'd be like, Well, what do you

359
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.600
James: I'm ready, I'm ready.

360
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's maybe there's a little

361
00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a part of you that doesn't want to ask that question.

362
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:35.040
James: Now there's a part of me that doesn't want to know in the party that just says I'll figure it out when I get there.

363
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly, yeah. I'm already here. I got to work it out. Yeah, that might be a good plan.

364
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:42.780
James: Yeah.

365
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Okay, so we managed to, um, we got some work done here, you did some inner personal work with me you able to sit with sort of a negative experience. You got through it. So let's have one little summary from you about what you notice

366
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: About yourself in here.

367
00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a little different. What did you notice about you felt just even a little bit different.

368
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.400
James: I get really ticked off and people doubt me, I didn't think that

369
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

370
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Really get ticked off when you, is it possible that it's a perception. When you perceive that someone's doubting you. It happens instantaneous, doesn't it.

371
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.870
James: Yeah yeah

372
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool, that's self awareness. Nice. I think that will serve you having that awareness, because then when you know yourself, you can kind of manage yourself and control yourself a little bit. If you want to

373
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I will see you on Tuesday.

374
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.390
James: Oh no. Yeah, exactly.

375
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.690
James: All right, I'll see you next Tuesday.

376
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.330
James: Have a good one.
