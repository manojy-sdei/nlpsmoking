Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so what were you saying yep court in two days.

44
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.180
Dawn Ninham: Yeah. According to days. Um, I went to my lawyer last was it last Wednesday and

45
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.000
Dawn Ninham: I asked him about the stuff that I have to, you know, print out through and then he is formatted that we get to know how far visit inside and a half, but they only watch us

46
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

47
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.280
Dawn Ninham: He, he got a phone right after we left there goes the phone and called her so now like she's like Oh didn't Veronica talk to him, like, no.

48
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:15.120
Dawn Ninham: Like you guys can't go out alone anymore. Well, wait a second. So now that you're getting, you're going to watch us outside because I told my lord of the truth. Yeah, so they're gonna make it seem like it's

49
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I don't understand. You can't go outside anymore. What does that mean,

50
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.210
Dawn Ninham: Like it's supposed to be.

51
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.600
Dawn Ninham: Supervision supervised visits.

52
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.030
Dawn Ninham: Oh, but really, like we sit inside and they know we're good with our kids. So they go outside the other the other hour, one hour in one are out if it's sunny.

53
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.310
Dawn Ninham: And nobody watches us because they know that we're good, we're good to go. Well, I told my lawyer that is so because that was one of my things that she was lying about

54
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and he

55
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:57.150
Dawn Ninham: Immediately called her so now she it's like she's on her side. You mean like whatever I was going to bring up in court. He's already calling her so that way. She can dispute or they are fixed it.

56
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.510
Dawn Ninham: I feel like public speaking up on but

57
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is

58
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Crazy. Yeah.

59
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's supposed to be on your side.

60
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.540
Dawn Ninham: That's yeah us too. He said, You know, I work for you, right, not counting. I didn't even ask you that.

61
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.540
Dawn Ninham: You know, why did you try

62
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.560
Dawn Ninham: To pursue that. So,

63
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And why would you call the worker and tell them you know private information.

64
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.880
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

65
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:36.630
Dawn Ninham: You know, this is, this is where I sit down and call the worker Rafi leave and then tell her what you've been for me of. But why would he do that when that's my presentable stuff in court, like

66
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

67
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.450
Dawn Ninham: But now she stopped it so

68
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That doesn't make any sense.

69
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.530
Dawn Ninham: It's like a crack like I got apparently I got

70
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.090
Dawn Ninham: Four months, like if they do terminate services, I'll have four months.

71
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.910
Dawn Ninham: Before like the final process. And so in two months to put another

72
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.950
Dawn Ninham: The end of the quarter.

73
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.840
Dawn Ninham: And then

74
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.980
Dawn Ninham: So they are my my age is told me to.

75
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:18.150
Dawn Ninham: Go to every test, like, dude, like I wasn't my fault, like our band was broke this whole time, like the cooking got me. It could have took me, you know, but that wasn't an option so

76
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't under I. It doesn't make any sense to me at all. What do you have to do. What is it on your plan that you have to that you still have to complete

77
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.280
I'm

78
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:40.920
Dawn Ninham: Nothing, it's just a oh going to test, which was hard, right, and then I just after story. She's gonna hurt search. I just gave up. You know, I mean, I can go test like the last two times

79
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:53.160
Dawn Ninham: But when I found out that I do have an option to kids back I told Jeff like old and I'm gonna freakin be there, you know, and that's why he fixed a man, he got out here lifted the hood figured out what it was.

80
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.760
Dawn Ninham: fixed it. So now we have a vehicle again.

81
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're going to see

82
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:05.880
Dawn Ninham: Total difference we had a vehicle and then boom, we didn't have vehicle not performance was held, and then we have a vehicle again don't notice, hopefully.

83
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:15.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you just keep, you know, you just keeps you showing up and testing you know God you bought you call up and volunteer to test it out if he

84
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:32.460
Dawn Ninham: Like you, but they said they said we can't, we can't. I walked in their everyday ask you to test if you want to just, we can't, we can't test you because you could be merging it or, or, like, I don't know the lady watches weepy how much it. You don't need to say the words that were

85
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.080
Dawn Ninham: What's it called

86
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.540
I

87
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:48.720
Dawn Ninham: Think we're giving them maybe different P, but she's literally as if they're watching me chance to compensate. There's like no way to get away with it you know messages dangers system for three days and sees your system for a lot longer than that.

88
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.130
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, so

89
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so I you know you just got a kid.

90
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.030
My

91
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:08.190
Dawn Ninham: My husband's cousin on the house and he's renting to the news this couple and that that couple. It has to my voice.

92
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:20.010
Dawn Ninham: And he showed up there was red check. And the guy said he, is he has adopted these kids. He's like, wait why your weight what the last four years, and I was like I adopting my kids, if I remember last year.

93
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I'll tell you what they do. They the system to get those things in place ahead of time that's that's really kind of their like that's like

94
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.160
Dawn Ninham: Like basically discouraging you like they don't

95
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.040
Dawn Ninham: Think that we're going to just lose or, you know, no matter what we're gonna be we're gonna fail. It's like

96
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.230
Dawn Ninham: What I do all this, then

97
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:53.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but you're not, you got to keep you just got to keep fighting. No matter what, Johnny. Don't give up. And don't stop fighting. Because I can tell you why because I

98
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.890
Dawn Ninham: Always get a second chance. Like I've know most people I've got

99
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.630
Dawn Ninham: Two or three times.

100
00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

101
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.640
Dawn Ninham: I don't want you

102
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:11.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just gotta keep you gotta you know do what they want you to do and fight at every step of the way, and it's not going to be easy. And you're going to get discouraged and frustrated but don't stop, no matter what.

103
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, just stop you know you and I just put in to find out who your care coordinator is so that I can ask them to get that letter to you ASAP.

104
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have two days, you know, before court. And so you need it.

105
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:42.690
Dawn Ninham: Yeah. And then he told me I need to get everything, um, whatever. I was going to present to the judge me. I needed to turn it in the beginning of the week because I'm yes to, I guess, put it through like a process thing. Like, what could I just hand them the evidence like right in court.

106
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He wants to be able to to review it and see, you know,

107
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What it means, put it in with the DHS worker that you're doing these things. And you're compliant and

108
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:05.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, as far as that goes. So that they know to they both are on the same page when you walk in the courts. What I know is that a lot of times the judges don't like to see

109
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:13.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That lack of communication or dysfunction with with things, you know. So if you're

110
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:24.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Giving your lawyer every piece of paper that you're to prove that you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. You know what I mean. Then he submits it to the DHS worker and then she doesn't have a leg to stand on to fight.

111
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to buy things. And so it's kind of hard to bring a war when there's evidence that you know

112
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Contrary to

113
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:45.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To what they want to fight about so there's that. And you have to remember DHS workers, you know, their most of their mindset is that you're lying.

114
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Period and

115
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.540
Dawn Ninham: I've been in every single one of your kids situations in their shoes. I'm like, wait, you have been in my shoes.

116
00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:02.310
Dawn Ninham: You should have been in my shoes because she is mother, but she is. She's like our second tip is she hasn't been in my shoes. She might have been a kid in foster care.

117
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:11.130
Dawn Ninham: And her mom might have been about mom but I i've only lived my life frickin take care of the kids, even when I was a teacher. I just, you know, I mean, it was like

118
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:22.320
Dawn Ninham: Boom, you wake up in the morning, you get, you know, breakfast and mala preschool you like breakfast, lunch, dinner, you know, bedtime. It was like a clockwork. I didn't leave and take off and no

119
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.030
Dawn Ninham: No.

120
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.040
Dawn Ninham: But I wasn't there. You know, like mentally

121
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.640
Yes.

122
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Great. Sure.

123
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.650
Dawn Ninham: A lot better now you

124
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you are you required to go to any kind of parenting classes.

125
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.810
Dawn Ninham: Or again, graduated four of them.

126
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You Brett you've graduated four of them.

127
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.190
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, graduated the baby was

128
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.730
Dawn Ninham: Incredible years i'm loving logic and recap now.

129
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.170
Dawn Ninham: As I know

130
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.760
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

131
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's you.

132
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.220
Dawn Ninham: Freak out in five weeks.

133
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That rocks.

134
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:09.690
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, I know what I mean. And if that doesn't show motivation and urine. You know, you're engaging in treatment and you're doing that piece you're compliant, you know, in our area.

135
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

136
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When it's hard for the courts to justify taking kids away when the parents are doing everything that the workers asking

137
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and the minute that you don't do something that they asked, of course, they're going to come down like a hammer and of course they're going to be really hard.

138
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, of course, they're going to say things that are that are discouraging and they're rude and that are mean you got to build a shell against against all that you got to realize

139
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:44.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you have done what you are doing and stay on this path because you know what I know is at the end.

140
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The kids get to come home. As long as

141
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:55.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Y'all stay sober and do what you're supposed to do. You know, it's their job to make it is their job to make it hard. You know, they want to see.

142
00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:06.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's the job it is to try to make it hard to try to break it down a little bit to see how easy it is for you to turn back to you to using. I mean, that's

143
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:20.790
Dawn Ninham: Like a third, and he was like the depression because I don't think I'd never get mad like mandatory want to hurt anything or when I get them fairly cry. You know, like, like, I don't want to not show emotion in the visit, because the requirement.

144
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure. My dog.

145
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.310
Dawn Ninham: My dog.

146
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.820
Dawn Ninham: You can see on your screen.

147
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:44.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can't see it. I just hear these little you know these noises that that's okay. Um, I've worked with DHS in the past, and I've worked with, you know, for my clients and. And again, I can tell you, you know,

148
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:55.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their job is to make it tough for you and the top of that they make it for you. The more determined and motivated you are to continue doing what you're doing.

149
00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you've got a turtle up. You've got a to build the shell that anything that they say anything that that

150
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, any downgrading things you know that you hear or that you know they say you've got to build a shell for and and persevere through it and just count what you've already done. Take a look at what you've already done and what you're doing. Yeah.

151
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

152
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:32.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Got to remember those things. Yes, I know you know this is tough. It's the same thing with when you are on probation and

153
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you've got these new charges and probation gives you this whole list of things that they expect you to do that feels like a mountain like

154
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:55.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How am I supposed to get all this done plus gap, a full time job and and support, you know, get on my feet. But the great part about it is that we persevere through those things we climb that mountain because our children mean that much to us.

155
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.830
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, I was like,

156
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.830
Dawn Ninham: That's what my wife and my kids. Yeah.

157
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.350
Dawn Ninham: And so like

158
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.770
Dawn Ninham: I think I've got like like

159
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:19.980
Dawn Ninham: OH MY GOD WHAT I DO IF I COULD EVER. You don't mean like I couldn't. I don't know why I went live. I don't, I don't think I want to be in the same town. I don't know. I do well.

160
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't even don't even think that right now. What I know what I know is that when DHS is working with a family there an ultimate goal is always reunification, but they have to have a backup plan.

161
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:43.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In case you know you continue to read if you continue to relapse you continue to throw dirty ways, you know, there's a point where they say we can't do this any longer.

162
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so they have to make sure that they have a backup plan. And so it sounds to me, what they're doing is they're getting that backup plan in place.

163
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Period. And that's how you have to look at it.

164
00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, got, you know,

165
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.790
Your p

166
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just remember that backup plans, you know, backup plans.

167
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what it is. I'm definitely does. It don't let it discourage you take it.

168
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:26.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, take it and add the add that fuel to your motivation to to, you know, continue doing what you're doing. Yeah.

169
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

170
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And again, you know what I mean it.

171
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What they I think what they look for his reactions to things. How do you handle tough.

172
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:45.420
Dawn Ninham: Situation. I'm like, I just feel we were doing great. Like you know me. We actually got our kids back to first six months of this

173
00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.720
Dawn Ninham: But I'm still there.

174
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:49.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

175
00:15:49.980 --> 00:16:01.050
Dawn Ninham: Oh, but Jeff. We didn't have a house to transport took our money. So we're going to buy a trailer until we asked him to stay in busker for one more week when we shouldn't have, like, I didn't go to court. Does anyone even ask that.

176
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:13.020
Dawn Ninham: Yeah. So I mean, but that that doesn't say anything like that in there. It's like all paperwork is so much. It says that I'm a judge to kids away when that wasn't even like judge who's an Indian lady.

177
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.460
Dawn Ninham: Don't even know which was

178
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.070
Dawn Ninham: This lady wrong companies.

179
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

180
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.230
Dawn Ninham: And I'm gonna bring up the point where we didn't have a van and now we do

181
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.000
Dawn Ninham: was different than my dog.

182
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:36.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. You just gotta keep, you know, pushing through you know you and you know make sure that the judge knows that you had a vehicle that was broke down.

183
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:53.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You now have a vehicle that is running, you did what you needed to do to get it together, you know, and to make it run again. You know what I mean. Yeah, you just don't let you know. Don't let any of this discourage you. This is what this is the tough part about working with DHS, you know,

184
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you're on the right track. You're doing the right things.

185
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you just have to remind yourself, you know,

186
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.930
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, and all my kids I want my kids be proud of me anyway.

187
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and you want to be proud of you.

188
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.950
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

189
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.760
Dawn Ninham: come a long way.

190
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:26.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you get, you know, you're at work in progress, like the rest of us. Yeah, we all are we close ourselves off to learning new, you know, learning things then we stay stagnant.

191
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And under the influence. Worst stagnant. We're stagnant emotionally, mentally, you know, we're stagnant and you know your persevering through all of this stuff. You've got to just hold on to. And remember that, you know, yeah.

192
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.650
Dawn Ninham: Well,

193
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.340
Yeah.

194
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.350
Dawn Ninham: The thing is not a positive. No, I didn't think of something happy the way I'll get

195
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you need to write down the list of everything that

196
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.050
Dawn Ninham: ever visit today. So that's good.

197
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.400

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.500
Dawn Ninham: Already done

Dawn Ninham: Yeah, I'm gonna write down, I will have a proven everything I've already did.

202
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:18.930
Dawn Ninham: I'm sure bring up the Madam, I don't want to, I want to get some like excuses, you know, we're not going to attack the social workers. So whenever I'm just gonna

249
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:55.920
Dawn Ninham: We were living clean like for four years and then three years, but this has been the best you're

Dawn Ninham: Both working groups and

251
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.380
Dawn Ninham: It probably the, I don't know what the group probably

252
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It does. And it's just keeping an open mind and learning the skills that you're being taught in group and

253
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:13.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, this is one of them.

254
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:23.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have to remember to persevere and that this is a moment you everything is going to be different. You're, you're doing what you're supposed to do.

255
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You cannot forget that when you start feeling, you know, bad or discouraged or frustrated. You have to remember how far you've already key.

256
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:37.290
Dawn Ninham: Okay, I don't have to make sure I get up in the early because when I sleep all day. That's why we missed his work, you like to have them.

257
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:46.110
Dawn Ninham: Or because we just let it all the way till two or three o'clock in the afternoon, I cannot do that I have to make sure I get up early. So I'm going to take down

261
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:24.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, change your sleep pattern to where you're getting up with a good time in the morning, you know, okay, and all of that kind of will reflect in your pre your presentation with people. Yeah, start getting, you know what I mean. To get your color back in phase you start responding differently.

262
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just takes just takes a little bit of time.

263
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:29.370
Dawn Ninham: Oh, man.

264
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.630

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A month, really. OK.

269
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK.

270
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.840
Dawn Ninham: I didn't tell them that I told my lawyer that which sucks because

271
00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:07.860
Dawn Ninham: I don't even know why would tell him that like me. I told him. If they don't believe me this Matt and then that I realized that was stupid. I shouldn't say that, but I don't, I'm not gonna lie, either.

272
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:09.480
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

273
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

274
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:22.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, the best thing is not to, you know, not to lie because truth always comes out eventually. Anyways,

275
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you know, yeah, that looks 10 times worse.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Hmm.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:32.190
Dawn Ninham: We've always been honest about it anyway. We were honest with them from the, from the beginning.

278
