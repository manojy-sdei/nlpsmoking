00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.870
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me, Sandra.

2
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.570
Sandee A: I miss, Rochelle.

3
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.290
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

4
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.730
Sandee A: Yes, I can hear you.

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.590
Richelle Direny: Sorry. Hello.

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.380
Sandee A: Can you hear me.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.160
Richelle Direny: Yes, I forgot to put this in my ear.

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.000
Richelle Direny: How are you

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.990
Sandee A: Oh, I'm okay. I'm getting over a kidney infection.

10
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.960
Richelle Direny: Oh, sorry to hear it. So that explains why I'm extremely sweet.

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:01:04.230
Sandee A: Yeah, I called the doctor's office on Thursday morning and he called me in me and I bought it, so I didn't have to go to the doctor. But as soon as I got home, I took one and I laid down. I didn't feel good and I fell asleep and woke up at five minutes till seven

12
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:19.110
Sandee A: Yeah. As soon as I woke up, I called and let them know I'm, you know, I wasn't feeling well and I'm still taking antibiotics, but hopefully it'll clear up

13
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.710
Richelle Direny: Hopefully for better soon.

14
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.760
Sandee A: And lucky for me. I did not need the prescription last week she called me in one week with a refill.

15
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.610
Richelle Direny: So let's go

16
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.880
Let's go.

17
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.040
Sandee A: When I checked in today. I was not aware that I still have to get testing done

18
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.220
Sandee A: Excuse me, I'm at Quest

19
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.160
Richelle Direny: Okay.

20
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.710
Sandee A: I thought it was just the urine drug screen that I was supposed to go and get

21
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.490
Sandee A: When I first started with bright heart.

22
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.210
And

23
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:17.610
Sandee A: On my way to quest. I was actually stopped by the police and asked what I was doing out and told him I was on my way to quest for some tests and then wanted to see the paperwork and I didn't have any paperwork.

24
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.600
Sandee A: So they had me turn around and come back home.

25
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.200
Sandee A: And they send it to me in the mail and I did the urine.

26
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.960
Sandee A: Drug analysis last on the second of April.

27
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:44.610
Sandee A: But he told me today that I still haven't completed my test which I wasn't aware what it makes sense. I guess I have to go and have the

28
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.680
Sandee A: testing done for hepatitis. That's what he said. Anyway,

29
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.630
Richelle Direny: Okay, very good. Talk to Natalie about that.

30
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.890
Richelle Direny: So,

31
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:24.900
Sandee A: I am a very high risk so boy even going to the store and stuff. I mean I got home health aides that come three times a week. So they're pretty much doing all my shopping and everything and

32
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.640
Sandee A: It's been 19 days today since I've been out of my house.

33
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.230
Richelle Direny: Wow.

34
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.260
Richelle Direny: And you got her back around.

35
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.400
Yeah.

36
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.170
Sandee A: Well, I wasn't, I wasn't counting when I went to

37
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.070
Sandee A: Actually go anywhere, came back home.

38
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:15.180
Sandee A: Now, when I talk. Initially, Rochelle. When I spoke with Natalie and we talked about these weekly group meetings and I've been on the Suboxone for a year and four months.

39
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.140
Richelle Direny: Uh huh.

40
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.820
Sandee A: Um,

41
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.970
Sandee A: I don't, I'm not

42
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.470
Sandee A: I have never had to go to groups because my circumstances are different.

43
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.770
Sandee A: She said, I would probably benefit more from one on one.

44
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:47.940
Richelle Direny: So why don't you just maybe check into the group because when she she fills your own prescription. What a month at a time or two.

45
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.810
Sandee A: Hours, she sells it build it for two weeks on a second. So this coming Thursday. I'll have to have another refill.

46
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.230
Richelle Direny: So then why don't you come to group every two weeks, then

47
00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.490
Okay.

48
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.840
Richelle Direny: Alright, so our session today is we'll meet one on one. But we'll talk more about it towards the end about how we're going to schedule our time.

49
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.810
Sandee A: The gentleman that check me and said I was scheduled to do one on one every two weeks.

50
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.850
Richelle Direny: I think he's talking about groups. I'll double check everything

51
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.890
Richelle Direny: That yeah

52
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:35.610
Sandee A: Actually, that's what Natalie told me that I would benefit from one on one, like every two weeks. For now, I've got a lot of stuff going on. Oh, I'm this fight this coronavirus stuff.

53
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:46.650
Sandee A: I'm, I'm in the process of trying to move. I mean, I'm surrounded by boxes my apartment is backed up and everything. You can see behind me here.

54
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:56.700
Sandee A: I'm supposed to be moving to Miami County with my daughter, which is almost 300 miles away and

55
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.320
Richelle Direny: You said Miami County.

56
00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.940
Sandee A: Yeah, in Ohio.

57
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.730
Richelle Direny: Oh, there's a place called Miami County.

58
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.140
Sandee A: Oh, it's, it's a, it's actually a county in Dayton, Ohio.

59
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.350
Richelle Direny: You said it's about 300 miles away.

60
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.910
Sandee A: Yeah, it's

61
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.520
Richelle Direny: Windy how biggest Ohio what my gosh 300 miles. That's like trying out of Florida.

62
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.450
Sandee A: Maybe 200 it's like 100 I think it's like 197 miles. I'm

63
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.060
Richelle Direny: Two to three hours.

64
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.070
Sandee A: It's two and a half hour drive

65
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:50.820
Sandee A: But I'm in October, November and December of last year I went through a couple of pretty serious operations and I had no family around or anything. And that was terrible. And now I need to have my right hip replaced

66
00:06:51.540 --> 00:07:11.370
Sandee A: Direction. I can't walk without my Walker anything. So I'm scheduled now for surgery in June and that's provided everything blows over by them to have my right hip surgery but I don't want to go through another major surgery without family support.

67
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.290
Richelle Direny: Okay.

68
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.880
Sandee A: So I've got that coming up as soon as they list this social distancing stay at home, man.

69
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.130
Sandee A: My daughter is prepared to get a U Haul and come up and move me

70
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.160
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's good. I mean, it's nice that you have a family support.

71
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.110
Richelle Direny: To I totally agree. If you can, if you can

72
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.170
Richelle Direny: live closer to family or

73
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.880
Sandee A: Live with film I

74
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:54.060
Sandee A: live here in Richmond County all of my life and Mansell because my mother lived here and she passed away a year ago. So there's really nothing here for me.

75
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.900
Richelle Direny: And you said that you're going to wait till they list the band before you move

76
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.270
Sandee A: Yes, I can't move before them.

77
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.010
Sandee A: You're

78
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.660
Sandee A: Told

79
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.280
Sandee A: Do you know differently because I would really like to get out of here.

80
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:26.250
Richelle Direny: I thought that was i mean i mean they have. And I don't think that they block you from leaving your house at all. I mean, if you're if you're just if she's just picking you up loading up in a car and bringing you over to her house.

81
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.650
Sandee A: Now we're talking about loading up a you all

82
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:37.350
Richelle Direny: Either way, either way. I mean, we're just moving from one location to the next, do they stop you from doing that and

83
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.450
Sandee A: I don't know that's we're afraid of

84
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.030
Richelle Direny: You please call and ask

85
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.290
Richelle Direny: For instance, it's like it's like if you're traveling

86
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:54.060
Richelle Direny: So let's say you're traveling from Ohio to to Florida. I'm like, I even called the airline because I have

87
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:04.170
Richelle Direny: A family member, I'm doing it for my mom actually. And so all I do is called the airline and asked them, and they said that she could, she could come

88
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:15.840
Richelle Direny: You know, they just tell you that when you come, you just have to quarantine yourself for the two weeks, basically. She's coming. She just comes, and she stays here. She can't leave for two weeks. That's it.

89
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.120
Richelle Direny: Which is

90
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.370
Richelle Direny: Which is basically what you're doing.

91
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.790
Richelle Direny: With your daughter. You're just leaving from one location, you're leaving from one quarantine location to the next.

92
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:41.700
Sandee A: Yeah. I understand that. But actually we had the U Haul and everything was reserved on the last week of March, and I was supposed to be moving that weekend and they

93
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.010
Sandee A: Mandated the stay at home stuff so

94
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.810
Richelle Direny: They made it all day. They ended it all day, or like at a certain time.

95
00:09:52.290 --> 00:10:06.660
Sandee A: They mandated it into effect, I believe it was March 31 or march 30 the stay at home, they became effective and if you didn't have to go out. You are told, stay at home.

96
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:24.420
Sandee A: And my daughter call them and ask them, you know, we've got the U Haul remedy. My mom's all packed up ready to move. What do we do, and he said, well, if you go out. Now there's a possibility that you could be stopped. And you could make give you charges.

97
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:34.710
Sandee A: That will be on your record for the rest of your life. And she said, what kind of charges and he said they're actually federal charges and you don't want those on your record.

98
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.860
Richelle Direny: Really there is really

99
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.870
Sandee A: Nothing older

100
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.870
Sandee A: The Miami County Police Department that she called

101
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.130
Sandee A: SO SHE CANCELED do all and everything.

102
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.190
Richelle Direny: So hold on. So just because you go outside.

103
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.280
Richelle Direny: They're going to put federal charges.

104
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.770
Sandee A: Not because I was going outside because

105
00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:58.980
Richelle Direny: What

106
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.670
Richelle Direny: You're moving frame, you're moving

107
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.260
Sandee A: Obeying the stay at home.

108
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.970
I mean, I

109
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.710
Sandee A: Know,

110
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.810
Richelle Direny: That is, no. I know, I know, but then to say that I mean every state is different.

111
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.490
Richelle Direny: That's best just a bit of

112
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.740
Sandee A: A bit. What state are you in

113
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.910
Richelle Direny: In Florida, they just tell you, like they just, they just order to

114
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.450
Earn

115
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.690
Sandee A: Mm hmm. Oh my.

116
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:42.300
Richelle Direny: They just told us that we can't, um, they just told us that, so like as of last midnight last night, like if I was supposed to leave my house to go to the grocery store anything like that, that I would have to

117
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:57.540
Richelle Direny: I would have to pick up the, what you call it, I would have to wear a mask, like that's like if you have to leave your house to go to a central place. I would just have to wear a mask that's all

118
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.850
Sandee A: They're telling us here in Ohio is that the mask is not going to protect us.

119
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:10.620
Sandee A: From getting it, then the only thing the mass does is protect people who have it or who are

120
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:18.330
Sandee A: Just carriers of it without symptoms because you could have it for two weeks without knowing it.

121
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.090
Sandee A: keeps people from spreading it

122
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.630
Sandee A: So, and we don't have any masks and I'll you can't find a mask here.

123
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:38.490
Sandee A: So they're encouraging us to make our own or I mean I can't imagine going into a grocery store where I'm bandana around my face. You know, it would be

124
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:53.820
Sandee A: Kind of crazy, but I haven't been out. I'm afraid to go out my immune system is I'm very high risk for infections and I just had a double bypass in December.

125
00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:03.780
Richelle Direny: And, um, yeah. So, I mean, I use, I guess every state like they even say they just respect you just if you're someone that's coming into the state.

126
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:14.970
Richelle Direny: They just asked you that we respect the laws so like if you come here. You're quarantine. You're saying in for two weeks and then you would um

127
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:24.030
Richelle Direny: You know, you, you wouldn't leave unless you absolutely have to which you're literally staying home all day anyway. You're not really leaving to go anywhere.

128
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.130
Sandee A: Well, I mean, you know, here they shut down the walls and everything were

129
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.040
Sandee A: Night lot good church and worship.

130
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:41.280
Richelle Direny: Yeah they do it here, too. So everybody's kind of like on there. They're kind of like this, they're going to church like this.

131
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:50.430
Richelle Direny: So, I mean, every state, but then to say, but I haven't heard about going to get a charge that whenever I think

132
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:57.300
Sandee A: That part here, and am I my camera man so they're arresting people there.

133
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:07.350
Sandee A: They're charging them with violating the mandatory stay at home, just for taking a walk. You're not supposed to be out in it.

134
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.100
Richelle Direny: Really well. Yeah, that's that that they're there. I think that that's did. They're just doing a bit much, because

135
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.240
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's here like

136
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.870
Sandee A: Marshall.

137
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.340
Sandee A: The man well

138
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:30.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah, to hear they as matter of fact, they do encourage you, you could go on like you and your community and you can walk like over the weekend I was out in my community was taking my kids for a bike ride. I mean you didn't

139
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.770
Sandee A: wear a mask.

140
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:41.460
Richelle Direny: I didn't, I didn't ensnare nobody actually that was out riding their bicycles are walking pushing their kids in their stroller just taking a

141
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:47.790
Richelle Direny: Browse in the community. Nobody had on the mat, not in the community. I didn't see anybody. Maybe I felt like one person.

142
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:58.950
Richelle Direny: With a mask but nobody else had on the community and they were in the community. Now I'm sure if they went to the grocery store. There are places that have been and I've seen people

143
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.560
Richelle Direny: I've seen people with their mask and things of that nature and

144
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.570
Sandee A: What every day at two o'clock. The governor

145
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.370
Sandee A: And

146
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:31.770
Sandee A: What's her name Dr at can who is oversee DC here in Ohio, they, they are on TV for an hour and they get updates and they talk about the number in the state of Ohio and the number of deaths and the hot spots in Ohio and

147
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:50.910
Sandee A: We've been pretty lucky here in Richmond County. We don't have, I think we have three deaths so far, but in the state. I mean, it's ridiculous and they're almost doubling by day. I think we had 700 or some

148
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:59.910
Sandee A: Last couple days people dying with this virus and it's scary to me because I am so high risk.

149
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:11.940
Sandee A: I even had one of the AIDS that comes to help me three times a week. I sent her home last week because she had that dry cough.

150
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:28.260
Sandee A: And then she just said she thought real tired and stuff. Well, she goes to other elderly people and help them before she comes here and I'm afraid she's going to give it to me.

151
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:40.350
Richelle Direny: The question is, is she is. She does she have anything but it be, you know, call from something else, because I think now, everybody is just so

152
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.700
Richelle Direny: Focused on the virus that if they are not even

153
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:53.820
Richelle Direny: Taking into consideration. There's so many other illness that's out there that it could be something else, like, you know, it just could be I think everybody just feels like

154
00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:03.900
Richelle Direny: Like you said, If you cough. They're like, oh, you have the corona. If you have a temperature. Oh, you have like there's so many. There's with the regular flu. Nobody's talking about the regular flu.

155
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:10.830
Richelle Direny: And it could be just a regular flu, you know, you're talking about. We're in spring. The pollens and everything is out.

156
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:29.490
Richelle Direny: There is that I mean I know for me, if you know if it's the the pollen has high outside the i'm sure anybody would think I have the corona simply because of the pollens are high. So what happens to me. I'm sneezing. My nose is itching, all of these different things so

157
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.720
Richelle Direny: You know, just like you said that you

158
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:49.200
Richelle Direny: Your because of your age, and maybe your immune system. Yes. You would think that if you were supposed to contract the coronavirus. It could be, but then solace. So the flu virus could do the same thing to you because when it's all said and done,

159
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.080
Richelle Direny: I know any illness could do that to you.

160
00:17:52.440 --> 00:18:05.460
Sandee A: Two years ago I got pneumonia and yeah I wasn't an obstacle for six weeks and I was down for a total of three months. It took me to get over it.

161
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:20.880
Sandee A: So I was warned back then that I'm really susceptible now because once you get pneumonia, your apt to get it again. So, even before the coronavirus hit. I tried the process.

162
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:35.580
Sandee A: And I let the agency that provides health care for me know that I don't want to work her coming to my house who doesn't feel well under any circumstances. And that was

163
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:43.980
Richelle Direny: Done. Yeah, exactly. And so then you have to treat you have to just continue treating it the same way, because the because you have to think that through

164
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:57.840
Richelle Direny: You know, because of your underlining medical issues or conditions that you know anything can be detrimental for you so you have to according to what medical, you know, the medical

165
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:09.600
Richelle Direny: Providers are telling you, so you would have to just look at it that if anybody is sick. You don't want them coming to their house, or if you really shouldn't need to help them. You tell them put on gloves put on

166
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:18.750
Richelle Direny: You tell them put on gloves for our masks. They have a little booties that they can put on on their feet. Tell them to put on little booties.

167
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:27.720
Richelle Direny: Tell them to if you feel, you know, you will be safer. Get them have them were a little town that they take off and you wash it or what have you.

168
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:39.240
Richelle Direny: I mean, there's so many different ways. So you'll still treat it the same exact way because the reality. I think the reason why there's so much alarm to this whole thing is that they really don't know.

169
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:49.590
Richelle Direny: Here it is this like a new strain of the flu that and and and keep in mind that the corona has been around for a long time for years.

170
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.860
Sandee A: Right.

171
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:59.190
Richelle Direny: So it's not like so, you know, for a lot of us, we probably don't remember it. But then, because then I think people started becoming more aware when they started reading the Lysol and and they see

172
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:07.260
Richelle Direny: Like how is it the corona just came out last month. It's already on Lysol can means that it's already been around. It's just maybe this is a new strain of it.

173
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:23.250
Richelle Direny: And with this strain and people are, you know, they don't really know how to control it. So, you know, of course, you have to listen to the law of the land and what they say. But, uh, you know, the when it's all said and done, I know for me I look at things like

174
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.810
Richelle Direny: Okay, I understand, but I know for me.

175
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:39.390
Richelle Direny: If I can get something from a doctor saying that hey listen. My mother has, you know, slew of medical issues. It's not really that safe for her to live will continue to live alone.

176
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:46.890
Richelle Direny: We're in the process of moving her in with us. Can we get some kind of documentation, then you can show it.

177
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:54.510
Richelle Direny: And then because i mean i mean if a person. If a person is homeless and hungry and sick and out there. Are you going to say, Oh, I'm sorry.

178
00:20:54.990 --> 00:21:08.820
Richelle Direny: You know, you may have to Corona, you're going to have to stay out there for another month or two, or however long they want you to stay out. I mean, however long you're going to have these things upheld, are you going to do that. I mean, that's just my spiel on the whole thing. I mean,

179
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:20.880
Sandee A: You well as of right now, we're planning on the made the first which you never know. Yeah. And I feel like this. That's the, that's the other crazy part. I was talking to someone this morning in

180
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:31.170
Richelle Direny: You, they tell you may 1 and then they'll turn around and tell you. Oh, because remember, just a month ago we were looking at me 50 or April 15 and today. Yes.

181
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:43.230
Richelle Direny: Got it, got pushed to me first. OK. So now, everybody is saying, Okay, I could hold out to me first. Then what you know week or two, they're going to say, Oh, we're gonna have to push it to the end of me. Well, how long do you think people couldn't

182
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.920
Sandee A: I, I agree with what you're saying.

183
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:57.900
Richelle Direny: That how long, like I have to take. Listen, I'm gonna just take my chances, just like I would with the flu virus and everything else, um, you know, my spiel. Is this and because

184
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:17.400
Richelle Direny: our session today is to do the your, your bio psychosocial but you know you have to again at the end of the day, you have to make sense out of nonsense. I'm with the flu virus. If I am your caretaker. And if you You're ill, and I come, I have a cough.

185
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:26.340
Richelle Direny: Out of common courtesy. I think I owe it to you to tell you, Hey, Sandy. I'm not able to come by today because I'm not really feeling that well.

186
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.920
Sandee A: Well, and with that being said, Rochelle. I understand. I agree, and I respect.

187
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:40.710
Sandee A: That but these workers that are doing this service for us, um, at the end of the day it's a paycheck.

188
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:48.060
Richelle Direny: You know, and that's it. It comes down to money you're 1,000% and see, that's the thing. And that's what everything comes down to, it's all about money.

189
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:58.650
Richelle Direny: Because people are just saying, Oh, well, you know, the corona this and Coronas that and you can't you are. You can't come to my house. But then, my thing is, but you just went to work today.

190
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:08.430
Richelle Direny: You just went to work in a nursing home. So tell me, why is it that well because I need my money. Well, well, if you're dying. Go ahead of money, how are you

191
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.180
Richelle Direny: Are you going to be

192
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:21.420
Richelle Direny: So if you're so fearful. You think you're going to die. Don't you think if you die in the process. What good is that money going to do for you. So you're absolutely right. It comes down to a money thing and so

193
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:29.130
Richelle Direny: You just really have to you know it and I, you know, I've had a few people that are know that are medical

194
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.480
Richelle Direny: They work in the medical field and, you know, a lot of them.

195
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:47.100
Richelle Direny: You know, it comes, it really just comes down to, when it's all said and done, money because there are people who you'll be surprised. There are people who are sick, who have some symptoms, but because they're not severe symptoms.

196
00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.860
Richelle Direny: Enough for them to

197
00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.160
Richelle Direny: Yeah, they're still going to work, and how are they old just put on a glove, just put on just just strap up yourself because

198
00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:03.240
Richelle Direny: You know what Sandy's in the hospital and we need we need people to be here to help all these people in the hospital.

199
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:14.670
Richelle Direny: So guess what you're not showing your fever is not 100 into your favorites, or 99 you're fine, just take some Tylenol and come to work and that's I've been hearing a lot of that.

200
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:26.880
Sandee A: Yes. And it's absolute truth and more medical officials are becoming ill mount to and feeling the coronavirus

201
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.150
Sandee A: Consequences, but

202
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:39.360
Richelle Direny: But like, even with the flu. But like even the full. What do you know in all your years even with the flu. When you get sick. What is the one thing they always tell you when you first get the flu.

203
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.310
Sandee A: Stay home.

204
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:48.390
Richelle Direny: And get rest if you don't get rest the flu will never leave you. Because you need to rest.

205
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:56.760
Richelle Direny: You need to sleep. Drink lots of fluid this body telling you, since you don't want to slow down. I'm amicus slow now.

206
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:14.010
Richelle Direny: And so if I'm halfway sick and I send you out to work and I you keep over exerting yourself. You're just making the your exacerbating the situation. So, and that's just feel so

207
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.450
Richelle Direny: But if you're gonna

208
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.620
Richelle Direny: Go ahead.

209
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.550
Sandee A: What did you say our session was supposed to be today.

210
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:30.180
Richelle Direny: So, today it's it's it's what is called bio psychosocial where I just do an intake on

211
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.880
Richelle Direny: gathering data information because this is your first time with bright heart completely right.

Is and boy.

215
00:25:47.640 --> 00:26:00.330
Richelle Direny: So basically it's just it's asking questions on the LEAD LAP found like in the last few shows I've done they haven't. They're not really that long, because the history is not that much but

216
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:13.800
Richelle Direny: So it's just me just asking just a series of questions basically about your history, and I know you said that for you in group you had shared that

217
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:21.120
Richelle Direny: You don't have an extensive background or history of substance abuse your thing was more pills.

218
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:22.860
Richelle Direny: I

219
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:37.170
Sandee A: Correct. Um, I was gonna say I i've been using our I've been prescribed some died of prescription pain medications, since I was 12 years old and I started my first period.

220
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.500

222
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:57.780

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.410
Sandee A: I've never used marijuana

224
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.670
Sandee A: Or that fits in all our

225
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:05.940
Richelle Direny: Ways.

226
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.830
Richelle Direny: Like a lot of those like those different. Okay. So let me ask you this, how to do

227
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.110
Richelle Direny: Who told you, how did you hear about Braveheart

228
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:24.750
Sandee A: I'm a friend that is when all this karama stuff started, I was actually going through an agency called Healing hearts.

229
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:42.630
Sandee A: Field and I will go there once a month, and I'd meet with a counselor and I would see the doctor and I would do the urine drug screen and then I would get my monthly prescription and go home and that was on a monthly basis. Well, when this Corona stuff started

230
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.180
Sandee A: Using that agency was looking into

231
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.230
Sandee A: Excuse been going with the video.

232
00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:09.570
Sandee A: And I believe now they are doing the videos, but that was also at the time when I was thought I was going to be moving to another cat and other towns you on some miles away.

233
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:32.010
Sandee A: So a friend of mine said, well, hey, I heard of this place called bright heart and they do video online and I just decided to give it a shot and I still had one more appointment with Dr. Danny I chew at healing arts that I canceled because bright heart got me in right away.

234
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.440
Sandee A: And I actually had my first session with

235
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.100

244
00:29:50.370 --> 00:30:00.030
Sandee A: Yes, and there was really not a whole lot they could tell my mother anything at the time as I got older, you know, they told me that it was different.

245
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:15.450
Sandee A: Biological at my uterus was tilted and it just caused a lot of cramping and I'm talking serious menstrual cramps and such. And they told me when I had children.

246
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:34.500
Sandee A: That it would ease up while that was alive, but I had five miscarriages. One of them was a topic, and I'd about killed me because I was being treated for appendicitis. When I was 20 and it wasn't a topic pregnancy that I had to have an emergency surgery for

247
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.300
Richelle Direny: So I just

248
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:42.030
Sandee A: Best Lee did have two children, but it did not take away the cramping.

249
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:52.290
Sandee A: Though i don't know i i ended up having to have a hysterectomy and everything taken out when I was 30

250
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.930

Richelle Direny: And a daughter. Okay, so, um, but so in terms of your history. It's you've always just been prescribed pain medication associated with your menstrual period.

254
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:19.440
Sandee A: Well, yeah, that up until like I started when I got married, I was working and everything and it just

255
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:27.570
Sandee A: I don't think I can act. I can't recall the time that I didn't have something in the medicine cabinet to take if I needed it.

256
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.580
Richelle Direny: Um,

257
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:46.620
Sandee A: And I mean, it was more over the years and I think back on. It was more if I needed it. I had it to take, but in 1989 I had a serious injury at work. And I fractured my back.

258
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:58.890
Sandee A: Into places and I was bedridden for six months and that probably looking back on it was when I became really dependent dependent

259
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.620
Sandee A: On medication. Yeah, um,

260
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:03.690
Sandee A: And then

261
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:12.000
Sandee A: That was like between the years of age 30 to 45 and then

262
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:38.220
Sandee A: I came down with crowding pancreatitis. And that was in 2019 99 2000 between 2001 2004 and I finally had my gallbladder taken out and they sent me to a group of gastroenterologist here in Columbus in

263
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.250
Sandee A: And they diagnosed me with

264
00:32:45.510 --> 00:33:00.390
Sandee A: Cysts on my pancreas. We all know you cannot live without your pancreas. But in doing numerous tests they come to the conclusion, my pancreas is eating. It's consuming itself.

265
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.950
Sandee A: So I'm on different medications to digest food.

266
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.740
Sandee A: In 2011

267
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:22.650
Sandee A: They were going to go in and remove and drain the cysts on my pancreas and they were prepping me for surgery and they put in a pic line.

268
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:38.400
Sandee A: And I dealt with a very bad blood clot from the pick one, so everything was just thrown into turmoil and I canceled they canceled my surgery. I couldn't go to surgery.

269
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:46.890
Sandee A: That was in 2011 and 2012 they sent me to a nursing home then

270
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:57.030
Sandee A: I weighed 87 pounds and when they sent me into the nursing home, Rochelle What they prescribed to me was

271
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:16.110
Sandee A: 30 milligram oxy cotton or oxycodone eight times a day and 60 milligram oxy cotton three times a day. And I honestly now thinking back on it, I think they sent me there thinking, I would die.

272
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:33.810
Sandee A: Because that's enough medications put down an elven two horses. Um, but from 2011 up until 2019 or eight 2018 know

273
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:43.230
Sandee A: December I was prescribed all those medicines every month for nine years.

274
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.630
Richelle Direny: And you were on a while.

275
00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.430
Richelle Direny: I

276
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.920
Richelle Direny: Know, you've had a lot of medical issues.

277
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.770
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes.

278
00:34:53.310 --> 00:35:08.010
Sandee A: And I got more now. I mean, I just had to have bypasses BECAUSE I CAN'T WALK, MY, I'VE GOT peripheral artery disease. I've got pancreatitis. And when my pancreas letters up I'm bedridden.

279
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:26.880
Sandee A: But when they came out with this opiate crisis and epidemic stuff. I started doing more research. I mean, you have to remember, I was prescribed this medication because they told me it would work. And they kept me from pain. I didn't know what pain was, I guess.

280
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.660
Sandee A: Until I started trying to take myself off of all that medication. They wouldn't help me.

281
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:50.040
Sandee A: They were more than happy to write prescriptions to me and see in a couple months. But when I asked them to lead me down off of these medications, Rochelle They told me it was too risky that probably killed me.

282
00:35:52.650 --> 00:36:03.900
Sandee A: So that's when an a, you know, this was that was probably the first time I turned to the street for drugs and I tried to get ahold of Suboxone on the street.

283
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.350
Richelle Direny: When you, when you started the Suboxone

284
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.020
Sandee A: It was a year and four months ago.

285
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:14.580
Sandee A: Yeah.

286
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.390
Richelle Direny: December.

287
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.630
Richelle Direny: You started doing from the streets or use

288
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:30.750
Sandee A: I yes I started it, I found somebody that would sell me the Suboxone and it was it allowed me to get off of the oxy cotton and the oxy kill them.

289
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:52.770
Sandee A: And I found a doctor in Columbus, who I I seen him once a month, and he took my $250 cash money and he wrote me a prescription for Suboxone and I felt better because I was getting it, you know, through a doctor but

290
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:58.050
Sandee A: Honestly, I was very amazed at how much it helped with the

291
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.860
Sandee A: Getting me off of the oxy cotton oxycodone

292
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.260
Sandee A: And it has literally probably saved my life.

293
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.400
Richelle Direny: So I'm

294
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.060
Richelle Direny: Sober. Wow.

298
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.350

397
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:26.910
Richelle Direny: And for you said that he's the only one with suicide attempts. Now,

398
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.310
Richelle Direny: And you don't have any history of

399
00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.830
Richelle Direny: Legal or illegal things anymore. Otherwise,

400
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:46.410
Sandee A: I the I have to be honest that you know over my life I have done different drugs, but it was more recreational

401
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:53.070
Sandee A: Um, I've experimented with LSD. Um, I've used cocaine.

402
00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:05.760
Sandee A: But I it was experimental and it was, it wasn't something I had to have I could take earlier. I've never been a cannabis or marijuana

403
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.500
Sandee A: I just don't like it. I never liked the don't like the smell of it.

404
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.010
Richelle Direny: Okay.

405
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.660
Richelle Direny: Um,

406
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.820
Richelle Direny: All my questions as

407
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:34.110
Richelle Direny: But your, your drug of choice is just over the years has more been related to

408
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:36.900
Sandee A: Opiates

409
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:50.220
Richelle Direny: What would you like. So the in your time. I'm like, even with you saying that it was recommended. I mean, yeah, you could do the twice a month on groups, but

410
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:59.700
Richelle Direny: What is it that you would you would hope to work on. Or you would like to get out of your time, like in counseling.

411
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.770
Sandee A: I personally just want to continue to

412
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:15.330
Sandee A: Be stable, but I also understand now that I'm old.

413
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.990
Sandee A: In order to be stable. There are some pieces of me that I have to fix.

414
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.930
Sandee A: my right hip is so bad right now. I cannot walk without a walker.

415
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.280
Sandee A: And I can only fix me one part at a time.

416
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.530
Sandee A: I'm

417
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:39.720
Richelle Direny: Just being able to talk through as you go through the different stages and changes.

418
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.950
Richelle Direny: Seasons. I was

419
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.030
Told

420
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:52.050
Sandee A: By one clinic. The doctor was saying in Columbus, that as far as Suboxone it helped me with pain.

421
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:53.580
And

422
00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:13.470
Sandee A: If I could take if I was one of them. Balancing scales the legal system. Um, if I had the opiates. I was prescribed here in the sandbox. And here what would my drug of choice be today, it would be Suboxone

423
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:23.040
Sandee A: And the reason for that is when I was active in the opiate addiction.

424
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:35.460
Sandee A: I didn't want to leave home because I wasn't sure if I would make it back in that three hours to take that next pill.

425
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.500
Sandee A: I did it. My carrying drugs on me.

426
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:49.110
Sandee A: And the prescription bottles, because people just, you know, this new bottle of pills in your purse with the grocery store and walk by and pick them out.

427
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.370
Richelle Direny: And

428
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.490
Sandee A: I've never had it happen, but I've heard about it.

429
00:50:55.650 --> 00:51:03.780
Sandee A: And I know that the drugs that I was taking and getting from the doctors are or in you know i'm gonna i'm not going to

430
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:23.970
Sandee A: fool anybody I had many people come to me with their hand out, you know, can I have one or your cell me one. Those are things that I thought of every day while I was taking them towards the end of people out there would do anything to get their hands on.

431
00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:32.880
Sandee A: And when it comes down to it, people wanted what I had. And I had to get those people out of my life.

432
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:36.540
Sandee A: So I'm

433
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:57.120
Sandee A: The Suboxone it just it to me. It's been a blessing and godsend because I take my strip in the morning and I'm free to go about my day and do whatever I need to do. And I don't have to worry about getting back home to take that next dose.

434
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:03.450
Richelle Direny: Because I promise you it's been helping

435
00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.550
Sandee A: I just enough I

436
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:26.070
Sandee A: In December, I went through two major surgeries. I had first I had the angioplasty with stents for my legs that went way south and the perforated artery and I bled out was in the hospital for a few days. But so boxing is what got me through it.

437
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:42.390
Sandee A: Right after the surgery. I think they gave me two doses of a stronger medication, but it was in a clinical setting. And after those first two doses. I didn't want anything else.

438
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:49.050
Sandee A: And then in December, when I had to have that double bypass.

439
00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:54.240
Sandee A: I had to take my own box and with me to the hospital.

440
00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:55.830
Sandee A: Gives it

441
00:52:55.890 --> 00:53:02.340
Sandee A: To the nurse and they would give me my own Suboxone every 12 hours.

442
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:04.950
Richelle Direny: Okay.

443
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:11.130
Sandee A: So I got through that surgery without any help from you know any other medication.

444
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.660
Richelle Direny: And because of the how Moscow Suboxone has helped through a lot of your pain.

445
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:19.320
Sandee A: Yes. And it helps me today and

446
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:27.960
Sandee A: I was told that coming off Suboxone can be just as hard as coming off of the opiates.

447
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:30.360
Sandee A: And it

448
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.240
Richelle Direny: Takes a while. It takes a while, you would have to

449
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:39.360
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, speak to the doctor about me off of it. But, you know,

450
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:44.310
Richelle Direny: You wouldn't really have to have intentional conversation.

451
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:57.810
Sandee A: Yeah, actually, we're running out of time here, I just want to run something by you real quick. I've been contacted here in the last month by a group of attorneys who want me to become involved with a lawsuit.

452
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:15.240
Sandee A: Against the pharmaceuticals that manufactured the opiates that I was on because I've taken different medications over the last 10 years like you trans oxy cotton and and then 30 milligram oxycodone

453
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:23.910
Sandee A: And frankly, you know, I took those medications, because they told me they would help me.

454
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:35.640
Sandee A: When in fact, the only thing they were really doing was covering up the problem masking the pain and giving me a false sense of security.

455
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.170
Richelle Direny: I mean, don't you think that to some degree.

456
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:42.600
Sandee A: I good

457
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:51.420
Sandee A: What I'm I guess my question to you is, um, should I become involved in this lawsuit or

458
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.880
Richelle Direny: What do you think, what do you

459
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.650
Sandee A: I don't know my own

460
00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:01.140
Richelle Direny: What is what is, what is it that when you read it. What, what was the first thing that came to your mind.

461
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:07.380
Sandee A: Getting my information like putting my personal business on blast.

462
00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:16.680
Richelle Direny: That is that is going to be a possibility because if you're going to get involved in awesome, you're leaving yourself open

463
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:37.740
Sandee A: Well, that was one year when I was on all those opiates, Rochelle. And I'm not exaggerating. I went to the doctor and they gave me 24 prescription okay 12 prescriptions of the oxy cotton and 12 first corruptions of the oxy Cotto

464
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:43.260
Sandee A: And sent me away and told me they would see me in a year.

465
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.970
Richelle Direny: So I will like you were taking advantage. Oh.

466
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:50.130
Sandee A: I feel like I was

467
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:58.380
Sandee A: just pushed into the system. They no longer cared about the issue.

468
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.390
Sandee A: Of my health.

469
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:21.210
Sandee A: They had me on all these pain medications and I wasn't crying every month about my pancreas hurting or not being able to eat or anything else. I mean, I was in a whole nother world all around because these doctors

470
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:27.990
Sandee A: Were addressing the issue. They were simply writing me prescriptions that and sending me away.

471
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:40.290
Richelle Direny: I mean it sounds. It sounds before you're saying to me it sounds like part of you wants to get involved. But then you're a little bit skeptical as to how much of your personal business, you want to share

472
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:41.730
Sandee A: Yeah, well,

473
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:54.150
Sandee A: Part of the the forums that they've sent me through the emails and stuff are asking for Social Security numbers and stuff like that. And I'm just not real comfortable with it.

474
00:56:54.540 --> 00:57:03.510
Richelle Direny: Vendor Yeah, once you start asking me because I mean, the question is how legit. Is this lawsuit or this company who was reaching out to you. What is your daughter say about it.

475
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:11.640
Sandee A: And she said, I could probably get enough money to send my grant my granddaughter the veterinarian school

476
00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:17.880
Sandee A: I mean, I've never been a person just to anybody, or, you know,

477
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.480
Sandee A: And I really don't know what it would entail.

478
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:29.100
Richelle Direny: I would, I mean I would talk to your family about it, see what they say. But then, like you said you're opening up yourself.

479
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.180
Sandee A: Yeah.

480
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:41.430
Richelle Direny: So like you said, then going into your, your life when it comes on to pulling your social and you know all of this, you have to be where you have to know that the company was reaching out to you if that is

481
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:52.440
Richelle Direny: A legitimate you know lawsuit. And it's not like some form of scam because these opiate companies that it's been around for a long time and

482
00:57:52.950 --> 00:58:06.870
Richelle Direny: Are still around some degree and it's still doing what it's doing. I mean, you take medication medication does, to some degree, it helps with the pain but it mass what the root cause of where it's coming from it up to today, it's still does that

483
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.770
Richelle Direny: You can take Tylenol all day. You could have a tumor in your brain.

484
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:15.900
Richelle Direny: But if you keep taking the Tylenol and pain keeps going away. You will never figure out that you have a tumor, right, because you just

485
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:26.310
Richelle Direny: Like to tell it all. So it's you know it's you know it's up to you. I would talk to you. I would talk to my family. I know a lot of them times when it's like a class action lawsuit.

486
00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:37.710
Richelle Direny: Those things are a lot of people involved, the people who get the most money are the ones that has been impacted by the most. A lot of the times, if you're saying that you could get as much money.

487
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:45.060
Richelle Direny: To send your granddaughter to veterinarian school. Um, if you're going to get a large patent. She's going to be a long, long time.

488
00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:50.100
Richelle Direny: They're going to keep sending you to the doctor. They're going to be probing you they're going to do all of that. So,

489
00:58:50.940 --> 00:59:04.620
Richelle Direny: All in all, I would say that you get a lawyer of your own house, you would see if it is something legit. If you really want to be a part of it. And if you think it's all worth it. Then, you know, I would say you want, by all means, but at the end of the day it's your decision.

490
00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:09.240
Sandee A: And they I'm just grateful that I'm hearing grateful just

491
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:10.350
Sandee A: To be kicking

492
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.970
Richelle Direny: There you go, and being able to spend this time. Now, with your daughter and your grandchildren.

493
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:15.960
Sandee A: And you

494
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:22.710
Richelle Direny: So yeah, so it's, you know, you have your hand raised in Ohio.

495
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.350
Sandee A: Yes, and and all my life.

496
00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:39.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, so let's do this. Let's see. Um, when we can reschedule your reschedule but scheduling an appointment. The next opening that I actually do have is going to be on the
