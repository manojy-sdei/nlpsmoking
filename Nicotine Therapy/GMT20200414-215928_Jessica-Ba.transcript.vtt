44
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:26.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm not asking the right question to select either much context. So tell me, what are you thinking right now. What are you feeling and how have those thoughts, feelings aligned with your behaviors as

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.880
Ryan Morrow: Nothing really. He just told me he feels like

102
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.580
Ryan Morrow: I need to be doing therapy for whatever reason he didn't really tell me why.

103
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He made fire as to why

104
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.250
No.

105
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:38.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we met initially to do your bio psychosocial chat was March status and you saying that there was some relapses in the past and you just want it to get like structured again.

106
00:12:47.610 --> 00:13:05.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm just, I'm wondering what Dr element has seen, or what the discussions have been with you all for you to present today and in session, the therapy only works, unless barris conversation going back and forth. So tell me what you would want to discuss

107
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that we can make this an Eastern Time.

108
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.490
Ryan Morrow: I mean honestly like whenever we're in our groups.

109
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.380
Ryan Morrow: We don't really do much talking

110
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.580
Ryan Morrow: We just do a lot of listening.

111
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.670
Ryan Morrow: And

112
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.880
Ryan Morrow: I mean, I don't, I don't know what else I don't really know what else to talk about.

113
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:45.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in the last group session. What from what you heard what was useful for you.

114
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.630
Ryan Morrow: What was, what

115
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:58.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Useful for you to skills that you learned in group or in skills that you would want to to learn to help cope with some of the worry

116
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.610
Ryan Morrow: Now, I mean, life is life. And there's always going to be worries and

117
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.860
Ryan Morrow: You just deal with it.

118
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:16.470
Ryan Morrow: I mean having a structured environment is

119
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.710
Ryan Morrow: Is what keeps me going as far as like having a job and

120
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.250
Ryan Morrow: Going to the gym and stuff like that.

121
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.100
Ryan Morrow: And so since right now. I can do that.

122
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.240
Ryan Morrow: I'm just, I'm

123
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.850
Ryan Morrow: staying home and and watching movies and being safe.

124
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:44.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right up a very relevant point have that structure that structure is taken away from you.

125
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It is challenging of how you navigate that and

126
00:14:50.130 --> 00:15:04.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I will choose to just, you know, life is full of worries me just kind of let it be, um, there are skills. There are skills that can be learned when there is this. This is a lot, having

127
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:16.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: losing your job that you were very hopeful for doing a hobby that brought you a lot of the release through exercising and not having access to that so

128
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:26.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm going to pull up. I just have like the scale that kind of helped me to get a better sense of where you are, as far as stress those

129
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:34.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know, just be a visual aid to understand why sometimes talking, it's, it's a bit much. When you don't know what to discuss

130
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:35.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

131
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:45.150
Ryan Morrow: I mean, honestly. Like right now I just have to be patient and wait for things to fall into place. I have to wait for all this front of virus stuff to blow over.

132
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:55.710
Ryan Morrow: I got away from my unemployment, I gotta wait for my stimulus check and I gotta wait for yeah the coronavirus stuff to blow over. So I can

133
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.460
Ryan Morrow: Get a job.

134
00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:03.270
Ryan Morrow: So basically right now, just in a waiting period and and that's fine. Like I can deal with it. Okay.

135
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:12.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Aside from everything that's been going on with the color bars are there any other stressors.

136
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.160
Know,

137
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So tell me on this scale. You see my screen. Right.

138
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.050
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

139
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On a scale of zero to 100 tell me

140
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:40.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What level of distress, you're at right now and that stress can be equivalent to worry frustration whatever emotion you want to tackle this.

141
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.360
Ryan Morrow: Is probably say like

142
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:48.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: 3030 okay mild anxiety distress, no interference with functional

143
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.600
Ryan Morrow: No.

144
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was at 50. What would that look like for you.

145
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:15.600
Ryan Morrow: I mean,

146
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.210
Ryan Morrow: I don't know why.

147
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.080
Ryan Morrow: That's a very vague question.

148
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.450
Ryan Morrow: I guess my anxiety would be worse. And I'd have to

149
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.260
Ryan Morrow: Me. I don't know how to answer that.

150
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, think about a time when you were stressed and you are sorry what was going on for you.

151
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.520
Ryan Morrow: I was worried about how I was going to get out of this situation.

152
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.540
Ryan Morrow: I go into damage control and try to figure out how to fix it.

153
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.990
Ryan Morrow: And problem solving.

154
