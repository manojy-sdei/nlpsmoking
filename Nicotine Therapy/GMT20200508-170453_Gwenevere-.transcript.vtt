00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.690
Nicole Roybal: Hi, I'm sorry, Emily. As soon as I was about to sign in. I threw up.

3
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.270
Nicole Roybal: Oh no, yeah.

4
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.750
Nicole Roybal: It's weird because I haven't even taken my goal attention yet.

5
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:45.750
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, but I woke up like 30 minutes ago, and I was fine. Also, Instagram, and I came inside. I was getting ready to sign in setting up my little setup and then also I just went to the bathroom.

6
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And I sure do wonder if you're pregnant.

7
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.590
Nicole Roybal: And they say no.

8
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: One.

9
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.790
Nicole Roybal: I've had my period. I just ended my period like three days.

10
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So you said you've had your period. You've been menstruating. So it's not that

11
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what it is. Then we'll keep an eye on that.

12
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.690
Nicole Roybal: I don't want to pick me up. I was hoping that would be a though I can know what's wrong with me but

13
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to spend the whole time talking about this, but I just want to ask you. I want to get the origin of it date. So I want to, I want to understand. Did it start

14
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's start the program.

15
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And things are going along. Do you remember when the nausea started

16
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.060
Nicole Roybal: Lagging

17
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when did it start, was it a month ago, or tell me

18
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.870
Nicole Roybal: I honestly don't even know it started, I

19
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.590
Nicole Roybal: Want to say like December.

20
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you start with us.

21
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.240
Nicole Roybal: With the throwing up right

22
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. When did you start with right

23
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.690
Nicole Roybal: Oh, I started with you guys in

24
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.870
Nicole Roybal: September, October.

25
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.010
Okay.

26
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so wasn't just the onset of starting buprenorphine. It doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the buprenorphine.

27
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.590
Nicole Roybal: Oh, I was even taking it before this program.

28
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got you. Okay. All right. Um,

29
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you are you having pain. Also, or no pain just just the Niger part

30
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.180
Nicole Roybal: I'm sorry.

31
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you having stomach pain.

32
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain.

33
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain stomach pain.

34
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is just just nasza

35
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.830
Nicole Roybal: Empty like oh like gurgling like in my stomach because it's

36
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to put

37
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.670
Nicole Roybal: Stuff out that doesn't have

38
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, do you need to go eat just even a half a slice of bread. Do you want to see if that helps at all, just so that this morning is pleasant just even a little bit of a little half of muffin or some little piece of bread. Some carbohydrate or

39
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:49.890
Nicole Roybal: I feel fine. Now I can I do love I feel fine like completely fine. It's just like, it's just that moment. Once I feel the nausea and then I know I can feel the throw up coming out and then I'll just go throw up. And then after that, I'm fine.

40
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.010
Nicole Roybal: And nauseous it all.

41
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

42
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's I'm looking at the

43
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Only

44
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

45
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So some of the things we did last time we're, we've really focused on sort of in vivo challenging irrational beliefs, meaning

46
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, hey, I don't know what this means and the people that I talked to on the phone are going to be dismissive and insensitive and you won't feel at your best. Did anything happen after you and I spoke. Did you take any further action with the with the school loan.

47
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.540
Nicole Roybal: I will. Okay, it's I called them and I was on hold for like 40 minutes and I went on hold people on the phone for the past couple of weeks.

48
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.190
Nicole Roybal: Quality People impressed actually

49
00:04:48.210 --> 00:05:02.160
Nicole Roybal: At the call to pay off our couches. I mean down on your couches and have to call it a little bit. So I'm holding them to and plus I was calling the tuitions Nathan on hold with them and I just got tired of it didn't get a hold of that as

50
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.910
Nicole Roybal: Well, which was three hours on the phone waiting

51
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.570
Nicole Roybal: To sell four minutes of the call the period.

52
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Nicole. I want you to see this as

53
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A you did the task don't see it as that you didn't you made the call you prioritize where you wanted to put your patience. Your attention and 45 minutes is more than a reasonable amount of time to wait and then you just said, I don't want to spend any more time.

54
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe some other time. He'll give them a call. That's all. Okay, it isn't, it isn't a

55
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.320
Nicole Roybal: Great idea.

56
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not a fail because you made the call, you would have talked to them if they were on the phone, but they just didn't answer that's different than you not calling. Don't you think it's different.

57
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.690
Nicole Roybal: Like everything has crazy wait times right now.

58
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Uh huh. But that's not you being afraid. That's everybody's making the call. Those are different.

59
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There's you i'm going to feel

60
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Stupid right I've

61
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Really been down on myself for it. Oh no, I don't see that at all. I, I like you made it. You waited even tennis would have been a win.

62
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. Oh yeah, I know you made the call and call that means you were in your solution you were going to find out what the real deal is. Okay.

63
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can have today, sort of moving away from those kinds of exercises and maybe we could do a little bit more psychotherapy. Spend a little less kind of do some of that I'm looking at some notes.

64
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be a little bit of quiet while I'm looking, I'm just kind of keep munching away and and as I'm looking, you may consider

65
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe an area that you're feeling blocked around maybe you have wanted to solve something and you keep going at it your way. But still there. You are frustrated again.

66
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may have something that you want to work on today, just if you notice it. You can let me know. Otherwise, I'll kind of come up with something

67
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:27.300
Nicole Roybal: Well, how the other day in a group therapy, towards the end. How I realized something about Daniel that um

68
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:38.880
Nicole Roybal: How I think that maybe he just loves me for my lip look I'm not the person I am. Oh, I've been. I told him I did. I wanted to ask them a question and important question.

69
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:53.370
Nicole Roybal: And later on, when he was home after work. I told him I want to ask you something important, and it's like yeah what's up. I'm like, Okay, get off your video game. First, I can't let go. It just started it and just like like automatic walk outside and smoke. But I don't know how

70
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.560
Nicole Roybal: I guess what I'm asking you can help me figure out how to ask them that question.

71
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:09.000
Nicole Roybal: I love them, say, do you really love me for me, or do you love me for my looks. But like, that's so such a blanket question like it needs to be a more in depth question I asked him.

72
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take that

73
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's work with that one. Okay. And it may not be the way you're expecting

74
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We may get all the way to me, role playing different ways to do it. We may not

75
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's take what you just did what you want to ask is do you love me for my looks or for what

76
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.520
Nicole Roybal: We're who I am.

77
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Who I Am. Okay. Wow. And that radical acceptance exercise kind of brought this up.

78
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.490
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

79
00:08:51.450 --> 00:09:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're wondering what what is real. What's actually happening here. What does this man light.

80
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And love about me. Okay. All right. So can we start with

81
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Describe to me who you are.

82
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.380
Nicole Roybal: Say I'm outgoing

83
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, like

84
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.770
Nicole Roybal: What is the word for like

85
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.080
Nicole Roybal: Like

86
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.430
Nicole Roybal: A lot of energy. I

87
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.230
Nicole Roybal: Always feel like

88
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just

89
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just put a lot of energy.

90
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.780
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. Nice.

91
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Okay.

92
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:53.700
Attitude.

93
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: nice a nice attitude.

94
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.610
Nicole Roybal: No, I'm nice and I have attitude.

95
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's a good

96
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Attitude. Let me hear a little bit more about attitude, just for me. So I understand it.

97
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So attitude is actually a category in my world and behavioral health, it would be, what's the emotion. What's her attitude. What's like it's an actual category.

98
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So I, I know a lot of people use it in general terms like oh he caught an attitude. Why you catching that right. It's like catch that with me little shit so

99
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, but I'm going to play down for a second and see if you can give me a little bit more about what what you mean by attitude. So hold on. Remember it's you're telling me who you are so

100
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow way down. You don't have to answer right away really try and figure out what are a couple things that represent you. They fall into the category of I got attitude.

101
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.720
Nicole Roybal: Can be very blunt

102
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what

103
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.140
Nicole Roybal: About certain topics.

104
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.340
Yeah.

105
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.310
Nicole Roybal: Um,

106
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:25.470
Nicole Roybal: And other way I guess of attitude would be that I don't care what people are gonna think by what I say. I'm gonna say it. That's how I feel. Hey, I guess it kind of

107
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.360
Might be

108
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to be blunt, then you aren't preoccupied with caring about the reactions from someone you're still going to truth tell you're still going to tell the truth.

109
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to leave it at blunt, but I might come back if you're adamant. You know, there's another piece to this that at this point it's blunt, it's, I'm going to say what I have to say, and I don't care what you think.

110
00:11:50.310 --> 00:12:03.390
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, kinda. But not only that, but sometimes you know when it comes to like if I get to that point, like we're fine like fighting like like a debate, I guess I'm fighting for something. I believe in. Then I'll be like,

111
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe in it. Wait, let me find out. Because what you believe in a part of who you are or no.

112
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.910
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

113
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well what do you believe in

114
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.860
Nicole Roybal: Well, it depends on the topic.

115
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me see what they are. What do you believe in strongly

116
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.760
Nicole Roybal: Hmm.

117
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.350
Nicole Roybal: I don't know.

118
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:46.290
Nicole Roybal: I don't know what I think deeply believe in, like, to a certain point, I believe in others. I believe in other people and that they could be better.

119
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.150
Nicole Roybal: And I believe

120
00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:03.930
Nicole Roybal: I don't think I can think of right now, it sucks because it's been the only topic everywhere is I feel like I've been fighting everyone on the topic of this virus, like everyone is just that they joke about it and they act like it's

121
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Not it's not about. It's not about coven. The reason

122
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to do with um

123
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So take coven and you say,

124
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It is dangerous, right.

125
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So is a weapon.

126
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So a lot of things. So it's danger. So what's your value. What's the actual thing. You're valuing

127
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.640
Nicole Roybal: Guess what, I'm always looking for so little value my word.

128
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.370
Nicole Roybal: I never does. Like if I try so hard, but

129
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.940
Nicole Roybal: I guess what I need to believe in as myself, that's what I want to believe in, but I will. Yeah.

130
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopefully, okay.

131
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're looking outside yourself for that right now.

132
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.890
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I feel like that's the main thing like I want to believe it. And that's what I think I can't think of anything else. I believe in.

133
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.320
Nicole Roybal: What I want to believe

134
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to pull something up here to get some more vocabulary in because it might be just, you may have things that you're trying to articulate and it might be just the ability to grab some words.

135
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see if it falls into

136
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to see how I have it saved in here.

137
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Beliefs, I tried values that didn't work.

138
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

139
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's under belief.

140
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

141
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Come and a half to go old school here.

142
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The urge so on and I go over to a different place.

143
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: From somewhere else.

144
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what that is.

145
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: A sweet or salty or both.

146
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.850
Well,

147
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get a few that are nice and clear.

148
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Values. That's kind of clear

149
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's pull pull outside and instead, I want you to describe what you think I value.

150
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be wrong. I'm not going to be offended. What do you think I know you

151
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.210
Nicole Roybal: Like yourself.

152
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you

153
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.350
Nicole Roybal: Answer that

154
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You just did. He said I value myself. What else

155
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.110
Nicole Roybal: Don't do like you you value is what I was asking.

156
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me try again. Nicole want you to tell me, we're doing an exercise. Instead of focusing on you. I want to look out, I want you to look at me and I want you to guess right when you do it. I think you value is this this business. What do you think I value.

157
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.490
Nicole Roybal: Say something wrong and

158
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not. You don't know that yet. Nicole, but you can't piss me off. You can't offend me you are you are solar systems away. The only thing

159
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can do that would be in the category of inappropriate would be. Hey, one of your I've got a hit man after you. I want you dead.

160
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you, are you even close to that. That would it be offensive that that's hostile or you started calling me names like you F and C and you sleep play to the date they think leave and I'm going to

161
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Play. Okay, so are you anywhere near there.

162
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.820
You know,

163
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that you're censoring a lot. You're censoring because you probably don't want to hurt my feelings or something. But that's not going to get you in.

164
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So give yourself permission. You only have this little square and you have seen me in this little square time after time you see me in group.

165
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You see me talk to other people.

166
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You only have what you see

167
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you've heard

168
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: to base the best that you can, to see what I might value. I don't care. You don't know me I you don't even know how many kids do I even have kids like you don't know that. So how can you possibly be.

169
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: On so don't worry about it. There's all this room wants you to just use your perception your visual perception your auditory perception your interpretation. After a group after individual therapy. What is it that you think I value.

170
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.980
Nicole Roybal: I think you value.

171
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're censoring

172
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're frozen mostly

173
00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Client.

174
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be frozen like this.

175
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: She's back. Great. Okay.

176
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready.

177
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

178
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: My weight. Did it work. No, you're, you're clear to me. I can hear you and see you so little chunky, but mostly I can, I can see and hear you about, can you see and hear me.

179
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.740
Nicole Roybal: I just started to hear you.

180
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

181
00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what is it that you think my let's say core values are. Oh, we wanted to make it that hard just any values at all. And yes, take care of yourself so

182
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.430
Nicole Roybal: What would you

183
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.070
Nicole Roybal: Define value values as exactly because I think I keep going. Another way.

184
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me which way you're going because you might be onto something.

185
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:21.630
Nicole Roybal: I think I just keep trying to like you know me, I talk too much over explain. Oh, I think I'm just trying to

186
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.410
Nicole Roybal: Something you care about.

187
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.550
Nicole Roybal: So that's

188
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, that's right. Okay.

189
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.680
Nicole Roybal: Okay, then I guess I wasn't going the wrong way.

190
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.980
Nicole Roybal: Okay, so, um, I think some of your core values are your patience.

191
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.590
Nicole Roybal: And your family.

192
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.590
Nicole Roybal: Like to tell your mom.

193
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.180
Nicole Roybal: Oh, have a

194
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.700
Nicole Roybal: Good relationship.

195
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.810
Nicole Roybal: If you like it, and then

196
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.150
Nicole Roybal: I think you value.

197
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: My job. Okay.

198
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.200
Nicole Roybal: But I'm

199
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.300
Nicole Roybal: Your money.

200
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

201
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.570
Nicole Roybal: Who about all your patients to have money, um,

202
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.410
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. I can only

203
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:28.230
Nicole Roybal: I don't know you, you know, so it's hard for me to just say like the like main little things anyone probably value.

204
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, actually, you almost did a better job doing it with me. Then you did with yourself. So, how well do you

205
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:46.440
Nicole Roybal: Don't have much going on in my life. So I think that's why, like, I don't have a job to value. I just have basically my own life.

206
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.160
Nicole Roybal: And my family and I know

207
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me my own life. Are you saying, literally, I care that I live or die. That's what you mean by life.

208
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so we have life family, Daniel.

209
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.900
Nicole Roybal: Pretty much all I have in my life.

210
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so these are the things I heard, I heard

211
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: My outgoing I value my energy

212
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm nice

213
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And I like right I value that I can be at times blunt which catches that attitude piece.

214
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've heard you say this, which is a phrase.

215
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: People can be good. What does that. What does that word what captures people can be good.

216
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I value. People can be good. What does that mean, what

217
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Leaving and others, leaving and others. Okay.

218
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that people are basically fundamentally good

219
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.910
Nicole Roybal: No, but I believe they can be

220
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you kind of, you kind of have that whole thing that I did on growth mindset that people can grow and that growth itself that evolution that you can evolve. You can mentor you can learn something and change and grow you believe that

221
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:30.630
Nicole Roybal: Yes, I do. I think that's actually why like I started thinking that way. You put a lot of these ideas in my head and they honestly they stick. A lot of the time.

222
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.560
Nicole Roybal: Subconsciously don't even realize it but I start to like

223
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.410
Nicole Roybal: You guys teach me a lot.

224
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to put

225
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We're kind of still looking for a word in there. But what I was thinking about when you said it was personal growth. I believe the people can grow, they can be good. So I don't use the word, good, bad, except when you guys are using it, but they can change.

226
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And they know

227
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.420
Yeah.

228
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you believe

229
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That your word and I want to clarify word a little bit more word can be used in a lot of different ways. I want people to believe my word. So in that that sentence. What is word I want people to believe my or they don't believe my word. What's word

230
00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.220
Nicole Roybal: Well, not really believe, which is a value what I say. When I say it.

231
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:42.240
Nicole Roybal: Like I feel like when I say some people just think I'm just talking nonsense like don't

232
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.420
Nicole Roybal: Actually, listen to me, and I wish that people would actually value it and listen to what I'm saying.

233
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, if you were listened to, um, would you feel

234
00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Respect. If

235
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: They listen to

236
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Respect.

237
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:11.100
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, there's a lot of like a lot of time with Daniel my even my mom does it like I talk because I i over

238
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:20.790
Nicole Roybal: They use a lot of details and over talk a lot. You seen it with me, but I'm a lot of people. I noticed with me, they start to just kind of stopped listening.

239
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:30.480
Nicole Roybal: And just like I'll be talking and I'll be actually handed something important. And they just stopped listening to me. And so I block my place out and I'm just like, I'm trying to talk to you. I just started talking

240
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:35.940
Nicole Roybal: And you're already blew me out. So I just wish they would value more and listen to what I'm saying. Okay.

241
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back. Remember the original question is what, who are you, so let me just see if this is true. Do you respect what you have to say.

242
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.580
Nicole Roybal: Yes.

243
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.030
You do.

244
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You value what you have to offer for opinion.

245
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Perspective.

246
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: you value your opinion. I

247
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.590
Nicole Roybal: Feel like I do, I wouldn't get some people don't listen

248
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I agree to disagree on that one. I think it's the opposite.

249
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.100
Nicole Roybal: I don't even know. That's my point. Like, I don't know.

250
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're talking about. We're talking about who you are. This is a great place to start. This is like a foundation, isn't it.

251
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a great place to start. So it's, you said you do respect what you have to say, we'll do the psycho analysis later but

252
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You do value your opinion.

253
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.750
Yeah, you said you

254
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Were gonna go with that. We're going to go with that one. And you value family and I'm assuming you're talking about

255
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That when it, when there's a value decision you're going to choose family over not family. That's how you know probably that you value family, you're going to defend their

256
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: might somehow defend them in some way or whatever, they're all you're going to align with family, this time in this time in this time you're going to choose the value of family. Okay, and your own life. You've seen maybe yourself protect it when it's been in danger. You'll you want to live.

257
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, and Daniel you value, Daniel.

258
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What you see in here is patience.

259
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Family job and money.

260
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else you've seen

261
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It comes to mind as we over here on my side.

262
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.670
Nicole Roybal: I mean, I'm guessing you Bella, your kids, and all you have at least one

263
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So family separate than kids.

264
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.110
Nicole Roybal: Oh, no, no, it's not. You're right, you're right.

265
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:10.500
Now,

266
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.500
Nicole Roybal: I'm

267
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:21.900
Nicole Roybal: I am not sure I don't know much about us. I can't really put much insight into it because I don't know nothing.

268
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You have witnessed

269
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: me time and time again.

270
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: In group.

271
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Representing

272
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of opinion.

273
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't throw out my opinion. Every single time.

274
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.260
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that's true. So I'm guessing you value your opinion.

275
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.120
Nicole Roybal: Right.

276
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it just my opinion, is it just my opinion.

277
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.330
Not

278
00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:02.100
Nicole Roybal: Like not just your opinion but like the advice and the words that you're giving to people and how you're helping them out.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I finished school graduate school. I think that possible 92 and 92

306
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.860
With graduate

307
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: College. So it goes like this goes high school for four years, college for four years and then usually write about, then people kind of finally figure out what the heck they want to do.

308
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they do you could be an attorney that would take two years. You could be a therapist that takes two years. That's me. You could be, I think, a site colleges might have been for more i think i think i don't even know that just seemed daunting to me. I was like, I'm done, I'm

309
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoops.

310
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.020

Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds weird, but it's after college.

318
00:32:50.940 --> 00:33:00.150

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's let that word. I think you're going to find it, you're going to find it in here. Okay, I'm guessing, but it's there, it's probably not that one. So I'm bowl Ness boldness being bold so

357
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's somewhere in that same spaces blunt, isn't it a little bit.

Gwenevere Abriel: You say again.

366
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.500
Nicole Roybal: It's definitely something I value being cheerful.

367
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there you go.

Gwenevere Abriel: That's a value, isn't it.

371
00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:56.700
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, what's it like it's tough for Now scroll through everything you like small things like I promised I'd mop the floor today and I didn't like

372
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So your commitment right now today might be a little lower, but other day is that might be higher. And so

373
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, a value is community. You really want to make sure that they're involved with the community.

374
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Compassion. They want to continue to show people I care about what you're going through. And so they find ways to do that. I can see that in you, with your grandparents. I could see that.

375
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah definitely competitiveness, I like want to be set up in scenarios where I'm pitted against someone, it brings out the best

Gwenevere Abriel: In you, and you, you're like, Oh, well, if it's a challenge. Great. I'm going to be

377
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to put all my energy into competing so competitiveness, you might know that about yourself and say, oh, I'm kind of competitive. I like that feeling. How about here you ran into this one earlier. Do you value confidence.

378
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.860
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, definitely. I do I don't always have it when I do it differently.

379
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to go through them quickly. And then we're going to circle back to the original question so value just assume I'm saying that word consistency contentment.

380
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuous Improvement contribution control cooperation correctness courage courtesy creativity curiosity decisiveness.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: dynamism economy, education effectiveness, efficiency elegance empathy enjoyment enthusiasm equality equity excellence excitement expertise exploration. These words right here.

385
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, these are but a few

386
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the many, many values that people could have

387
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to go back and I want to say.

388
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Your original question to me was how do I tell Daniel does he love me for my looks or for who I am and I asked you. Who are you, you want him.

389
00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Again,

390
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: To feed you. What you don't even know about yourself. I think that might be a little unfair. Yes. True.

391
00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not. But you see it, it's like, how about you first.

392
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Fall in love with you.

393
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Get into you.

394
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at those words and we didn't barely get through any of them.

395
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:22.710
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I know. But if you read like stick out to me. I'm glad that you showed me that lives.

396
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So before you ask someone to fill that void.

397
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Know who you are. Before you say, How dare you don't love me for me girl. You can't even articulate who you are.

398
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's true. You know, I'm playing, you can do whatever you want to

399
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:50.130
Nicole Roybal: Were asked him if I wanted to actually talk to you about it. So I wanted to be sure that I wasn't

400
00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.110
Nicole Roybal: Approaching it before me to approach it, you know.

401
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So another way to look at this is

402
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel

403
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you value the same things I value in me.

404
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I hadn't thought about this question before I can tell you find me attractive. We have sex. You tell me. I'm pretty, but I never hear you say gang. You're funny. Dang. You're smart.

405
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been feeling really insecure recently because I ain't got no job and hanging on my parents house and this Copa thing got me locked up and I'm like starting to question myself.

406
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know myself.

407
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:40.440
Nicole Roybal: Oh my god.

408
00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know,

409
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You could tell him in real time how it feels when he says certain things to you.

410
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

411
00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: When you won't get off the video.

412
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: When I just told you that I have something important. I want to talk to you about. I feel unimportant.

413
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:19.590
Nicole Roybal: Well, I've tried that. When you do this, I feel, and he just gets irritated with it. So I keep doing it. And he's just like, I get it, you feel a lot of things.

414
00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are facts and call

415
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Also, a fact that you didn't that time you throw your hands up. You went outside and smoked a cigarette.

416
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.430
Yeah.

417
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You hope.

418
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That he will change.

419
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I doubt it, but you can if you

420
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:48.990
Nicole Roybal: Think that's what I get. So Max. I know he can, if he tries doesn't want

421
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: If he doesn't want to

422
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you fighting that fact and hoping it would be different.

423
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:01.680
I guess.

424
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:07.230
Nicole Roybal: We better a lot better lately have been really sweet but

425
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not either or there's very rare humans that are all one or the other.

426
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's work to develop your sense of yourself. Who you are sort of before. You say, How dare you not love me for me right because

427
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.120
Nicole Roybal: Like

428
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a hard time identifying who are you

429
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So things you didn't say, just as an example. You didn't say you know i'm glad i can tell you value humor.

430
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I don't I don't hide that.

431
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.260
Nicole Roybal: Put out right when you don't have time.

432
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice you didn't say these things. So it's not only that you may not have the words for them. But you, you missed a whole bunch of stuff that I think I represent every single time that you see me and that's Humor, humility.

433
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The authentic self courage, curiosity, don't I do that like all the time.

434
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:39.180
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I didn't think I didn't even think to even go towards that way of like those words like courage and curiosity. I didn't think about like traits. I was thinking

435
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Traits interesting but you were perfectly fine with blunt with you.

436
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.270
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, that's right. But I guess.

437
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:56.940
Nicole Roybal: Thinking like what does she have in her life that she really cares about. That's all I don't know. You know, I thought to think of what else

438
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I know you know i know you don't I meet you in the same place here and meet you right here. Right.

439
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.570
Nicole Roybal: Now, I think we talk more about me than we do, like you

440
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that you heard you got to see in real time. What do I show up representing over and over and over. Do I represent honesty assertiveness.

441
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the one I think you were looking for earlier safety. I think you value safety. I think you value health and life, like you said, I value humor I evaluate courage.

442
00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Courage insight I value psychological mindedness intelligence. There's humor again humor such a big one for me I value accountability. I show up here. And if I'm late. I apologize.

443
00:47:52.410 --> 00:48:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I send you guys tax, right, that's, that's it. That's you get evidence in the world to see does she do what she says she's going to do, or she flaky.

444
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she hold yourself accountable.

445
00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to see my values, don't you, you get evidence of it in the world. What if I talked about how much partying. I did in high school and college what values would you see me representing in group and individual therapy if that's what I talked about

446
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.840
Nicole Roybal: per year. Mm hmm.

447
00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I talk about that.

448
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.740
Nicole Roybal: Probably shouldn't be tying up

449
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be I would value your attention.

450
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And I do that too. Sometimes I'll look like I'm attention seeking so maybe I'm Ed that day, maybe I want to find

451
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: People I got a good audience here. You guys are laughing at me and I liked it. So maybe, maybe you you kind of maybe you're a little insecure when and so maybe that's what that is.

452
00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point is we show up in a particular way. So when you want to look within just kind of be like, wait a minute, what do I represent notice with coven you represent again and again, your core value health life safety over and over and over. You keep representing don't you

453
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's important to have that value. You want to be healthy. You want to be okay. You want a safe environment that might be a core value of yours, maybe

454
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You keep standing up for it.

455
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:39.570
Nicole Roybal: Okay, it makes more sense. I think I have more of an idea of what values right now from the beginning as our to now.

456
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a better right yeah yeah

457
00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.060
Nicole Roybal: Like

458
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.780
Nicole Roybal: I'm not sure if the word was that you use phrases like blink at words like just like

459
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.590
A category.

460
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.350
Nicole Roybal: Yeah. Yes. There you go.

461
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.600

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.340
Nicole Roybal: Don't know why am i know i care about and

Nicole Roybal: Mainly, just like my wife and I, how and everyone else's how

464
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly but but there's also things like harmony. Like, you will sacrifice clear communication.

465
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You will choose harmony between two people over speaking your truth because you don't want conflict. So you value you are manifesting you are representing I just want peace in this House, I just just want peace.

466
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it or not. You represent

467
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You represent what those core values are
