00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you at the end of your shift right now.

2
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.690
Fire Tablet: So I'm home.

3
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Your home and you worked earlier today.

4
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Are you are you pooped. Are you tired. How you feeling right now.

5
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.280
Fire Tablet: I'm, I'm okay. I'm, I'm a little stressed, but I'm okay.

6
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to open up a note, but I want to hear. Tell me about what's going on for you.

7
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.180
Fire Tablet: Um, my car got broken into last night or yesterday while I was sleeping side of the house.

8
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.940
Fire Tablet: And this is like the fourth time that it's happened and it just really bothers me.

9
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.660
Fire Tablet: I'm still very violating they didn't take anything of value, but they did take something of sentimental value.

10
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.920
Oh,

11
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.190
Fire Tablet: So, that sucks.

12
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.500
Fire Tablet: I had a

13
00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.780
Fire Tablet: St. Christopher travelers necklace hanging from my mirror and my mom gave it to me.

14
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:16.080
Fire Tablet: And it's for traveling. It's to protect you while you're traveling and it's not an expensive thing or anything like that. But it was important to me and now it's gone. Um, that really upset me

15
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.280
Fire Tablet: And then I just keep dealing with this fucking bitch at work and she's just stressing me the fuck out.

16
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.760
Fire Tablet: And to get me out of there.

17
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.290
Fire Tablet: She talked to one of our mutual coworkers and the mutual coworker approached me last night when I came into work.

18
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:58.080
Fire Tablet: And she said, can I talk to you. And I was like, okay, and she goes, I just want you to be aware of this, because I didn't want it to be turned around and just something that it wasn't. I just wanted you to hear it straight from me. She said that Stephanie.

19
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.480
Fire Tablet: came up to her and told her so. Chris is going to call you into the office. Chris is our head guy.

20
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.830
Fire Tablet: And when he does. If you could please tell him all the things that you've seen between me and Megan and what you've seen this going on and how you feel about it.

21
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.360
Fire Tablet: And

22
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.710
Fire Tablet: She said that she went into she got called into Chris's office.

23
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.210
Fire Tablet: And

24
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.570
Fire Tablet: She got the vibe that Stephanie's kind of essentially told Chris like

25
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:48.600
Fire Tablet: Just ask. Stephanie. Stephanie will work destiny destiny will tell you, but definitely just said I, I know that when he asked what's going, what do you know what's going on between Megan and Stephanie. She said that, I don't know what anything that's going on. They're not on shift together.

26
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.130
Fire Tablet: She goes, and I haven't seen anything and then she said,

27
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.960
Fire Tablet: That she likes both of us, and she doesn't want to be involved in it. And then she said that

28
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.780
Fire Tablet: Chris, however.

29
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:14.910
Fire Tablet: Stephanie did approached me before this meeting and and she told me that I was going to get cold in here to talk to you about this and I felt that that was really manipulative like she was trying to get me to

30
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.120
Fire Tablet: Speak badly about Megan.

31
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.370
Fire Tablet: And that was all but

32
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:32.880
Fire Tablet: She did tell me that and and I did a really appreciate her honesty and I told her, I'm sorry. You're stuck in the middle. And she's like, Well, I'm knocked up in the middle. I was like, Oh, I'm sorry. You got even got pulled in at all.

33
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she she she got herself out

34
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.580
Fire Tablet: Yeah yeah

35
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That was smart. So I like this Destiny's behavior like that she knows her own boundaries. I like to

36
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that.

37
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.830
Fire Tablet: Well, usually, she doesn't. So I'm surprised because

38
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.900
Fire Tablet: She's the one that does the shift trades with Stephanie to make her own schedule.

39
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

40
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:08.610
Fire Tablet: And Stephanie. Stephanie to shift trades to completely get out of the bid that we did, and I'm a buffering seniority and even I don't get weekends off, but she trades to get weekends off every week.

41
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.210
Fire Tablet: Oh, that sounds like a bothers me.

42
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.700
Fire Tablet: Oh, go ahead.

43
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I was saying that sounds like there's a real clear exchange she gets those weekends. Right, so

44
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.580
Fire Tablet: Yeah, and it bothers me because

45
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.860
Fire Tablet: It's not, it's it's bucking the system to be quite honest.

46
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.170
Fire Tablet: And it's not

47
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.200
Fire Tablet: Wrong.

48
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.350
Fire Tablet: By contract, but it's just morally wrong. Like it's fucking dirty.

49
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:50.130
Fire Tablet: Yeah, like I can totally get doing it every now and then we all need a break. I can totally get that. But every fucking weekend. So what was the point of doing a bit

50
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.190
Fire Tablet: Like I am ahead of you and I, I haven't gotten weekends. I've worked there for two years and I haven't gotten fuckin weekends off.

51
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so let me ask you again, I'm naive to pieces of this. So I don't mean to offend.

52
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's assume in some fantasy land that Stephanie would say yes, but could you just as easily switch with Stephanie and have weekends off to

53
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.890
Fire Tablet: Know,

54
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.590
Fire Tablet: Okay, because her days off.

55
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:30.780
Fire Tablet: Her days off or Tuesday and Wednesday. And so we're Destiny's but they're they're working doubles to get out of their schedule.

56
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can't do that.

57
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.000
Fire Tablet: Or don't want to know. I can do that, but I'm not gonna

58
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.480
Fire Tablet: Let the problem is. So there's one thing that can happen.

59
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:48.720
Fire Tablet: Okay, so when you work 16 hours, you are now kept. You cannot work anymore 600

60
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.350
Fire Tablet: You have 60 minutes

61
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.570
Fire Tablet: A day. Mm hmm.

62
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.370
Fire Tablet: Cap out at 16 a day.

63
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.360
Yeah, so

64
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:08.040
Fire Tablet: They do a shift trade and she works at 16 hour shift of her own volition, that she signed up for so that they could manipulate their days off.

65
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.800
Fire Tablet: Well, I call in sick.

66
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.140
Fire Tablet: Or James calls in sick, my coworker, he calls in sick.

67
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.780
Fire Tablet: She's

68
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:27.000
Fire Tablet: Let's say Stephanie's ahead of me on the mandate list right she just got out of being mandated because she already worked a 16 hour shift.

69
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:37.410
Fire Tablet: So she completely skipped what's rightfully supposed to be her mandate, because she's already worked a 16 hour shift over own volition.

70
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.060
Fire Tablet: So I get mandated because I'm next in line after her.

71
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to change that system.

72
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.990
Fire Tablet: I think that's dirty i think it's it's fucked up.

73
00:07:50.130 --> 00:08:00.120
Fire Tablet: I do if I could do if I could change the system, I would say, Let's limit the shift trades to twice a month. That's your cap. You do twice a month. That's it.

74
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:13.740
Fire Tablet: But or request the day off or call in sick do what you gotta do, but this this bullshit. It's not fair and AND IT folks everybody over that the only

75
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:32.340
Fire Tablet: That's the behavior that has bothered me since the very beginning with her. Is this that she's very self centered very anything all of her behavior seems very manipulated towards helping her and no one else right and it really bothers me.

76
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.300
Fire Tablet: But

77
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.560
Fire Tablet: It's out of my control.

78
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You have an interview, I think, on the first of June with Cornelio County.

79
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. How exciting.

80
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.460
Fire Tablet: I'm excited. It's a

81
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.480
Fire Tablet: Flower test.

82
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.360
Fire Tablet: Yeah, so I go in for four hours and I'm testing for four hours and

83
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.960
Fire Tablet: Then hopefully I'll find out within a month if I got hired or not, my gosh.

84
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And do they want any letters of recommendation, anything like that.

85
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:16.740
Fire Tablet: I don't know i right now. All I know is that I'm going in for the testing. So I already passed the first interview process. So I made it through like

86
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.990
Fire Tablet: qualifying for it.

87
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:40.470
Fire Tablet: Okay. Um, so now I have to test into it to see what if I can actually handle it or not, right, and then they go on to background checks letters of recommendation, things like that. Yeah, but it just, I don't know. I don't want to leave because I'm

88
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:49.410
Fire Tablet: Because I'm being pushed out. I want to leave because it's better for me because it's what's best for me and my family, but

89
00:09:50.040 --> 00:10:01.380
Fire Tablet: She's doing anything, anything she possibly can to get me taken out of there. And that's very obvious and it's all dependent upon whose as she's kissing, but

90
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:12.900
Fire Tablet: She really is doing, she skipped the chain of command and talks to people way above what we're supposed to she just does whatever she wants. And

91
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.670
Fire Tablet: It just bothers me because it's like, wait a second. I follow the rules and I get fucking dinged

92
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.700
Fire Tablet: She completely Livia slee like ignores the rules and nobody does anything about it.

93
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So that doesn't have anything to do with Stephanie, that has to do with an organization.

94
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.740
Fire Tablet: Exactly. Exactly. And that's not Stephanie's fault. I will point blank say that

95
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.340
Fire Tablet: Because chris chris will listen to anything Sydney has to say because he spoke earlier but

96
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:56.370
Fire Tablet: Anybody else it's a no, it's, it's no loss. It's like Josh, for example, my direct supervisor. He's really super

97
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.170
Fire Tablet: He's

98
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.690
Fire Tablet: Frustrated right now. Oh yes, he's a really

99
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:19.140
Fire Tablet: Yeah, and he's a good boss and he's really frustrated because his power is so unlimited and he can't make a difference and help his staff, the way that he wants to. He's told to handle your shift handle your employees, but he has literally no tools to do that and

100
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:29.910
Fire Tablet: He's training a new trainee. And honestly, she's just not meant to be a dispatcher it's not her training, it's not her field and she doesn't belong in the in the field, but

101
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:42.510
Fire Tablet: Yeah, and it's frustrating him and he's tried to tell Chris Hey, this girl does not belong in dispatch, she's going to get somebody killed or

102
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.530
Fire Tablet: Or

103
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.890
Fire Tablet: Or worse, and he's just like,

104
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.440
Fire Tablet: Well, let's try it this way. Let's try it this way. No, you're not listening to me.

105
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.180
Fire Tablet: And he even had me write an email of what I seen and art Burke other coworker.

106
00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.530
Fire Tablet: Because it's that bad.

107
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:07.290
Fire Tablet: It's literally that bad, like I would never want to get a call or to call 911 and speak to her. I would die.

108
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:21.120
Fire Tablet: So. She's a good woman. She's very kind. She's a very kind. Woman She's an older lady, but she's very sweet and it's very apparent that she's very lonely.

109
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:38.010
Fire Tablet: And she just wants somebody to talk to. So I talked to her and I always try to be very kind to her. I tried to show her ways of doing things a different way, perhaps because everybody learns differently, but she's just no no

110
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.090
No.

111
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

112
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.750
Fire Tablet: So, so God is my life.

113
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.750
Fire Tablet: And and I'm ready for em, Dr.

114
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's do it. Let the healing begin

115
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.440
Okay.

116
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me get my screen all set up here and you're on phone or laptop.

117
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.100
Fire Tablet: I'm on Kindle.

118
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's, that's like a like a like a Kindle size thing.

119
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

120
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.830
Fire Tablet: Yeah, there's like a tablet.

121
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we'll definitely going to need to tell objects because that's not to sound too wide probably wanted to pull

122
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Off.

123
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got options. We've got

124
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

125
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Basic Structure here is to identify

126
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of a negative cognition, that is connected to one of these distress memories and we can we can work with whatever you want to do more the more fundamental. They are

127
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: The upside is we're getting at at really emotionally activating history that we could get some desensitization. And we can move forward downside is

128
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be activating and there can be this increase wave of distress in nightmares and things like that so

129
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't I mentioned a couple of the ones I have and then you might say, Yeah, that one or, oh, I've got a better one. So you're going to tell me where to focus. Okay. So first one I see

130
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This was a distress of it was big with Brittany I wanted a rapper throat out beat the shit out of her. I wanted to grab her by the face and run it by a cheese grater.

131
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It was pure page I'm day I just just writing down which said

132
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You are, as they say.

134
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.470
Fire Tablet: These are like not used against me in a court of law.

135
00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, you are angry. So I'm emotion was Pure rage out of control out of my element I was close to losing it. And going back to jail.

136
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And how dare they hurt my mom kids got defensive me Andrew help guide. So those are little snippets and I'm not sure what all the pieces are but the quote was,

137
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Was Scott raped me. So there's something must have happened where maybe Brittany was something it be maybe okay to talk with Scott, possibly, I'm thinking that might be it don't know. But something was going on, you were very upset, obviously.

138
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.970
Fire Tablet: I don't, I'm not making that connection there.

139
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

140
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.760
Fire Tablet: But I'm not

141
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, so something. It was probably around maybe having him over and you not maybe wanting it not understanding why she would be still speaking on speaking terms with him, that's my guess.

142
00:15:53.700 --> 00:16:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's move on. Okay, it'll come up, if it will at the story. Let's just keep going. So, and of course we know the song.

143
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And we have also mom chewing with their mouth open.

144
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: We have my kids have been asking about brother.

145
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: They know about him because of mom and sister and that he's I put quote, No, no, like, I don't know exactly what that meant, but

146
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: They have wonder and curiosity about it. They kind of wonder then, I have at a 30 kids interrupt when someone's talking. They walk up and demand my full attention. Doesn't matter.

147
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are having an adult conversation the emotion is irritation, it's not their fault, their kids. I can't correct it move on. I have choice I pick my battles. So these are just little, little things here.

148
00:16:54.930 --> 00:17:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now down at zero, which is getting close to go and below. I don't know that you're ready to kind of have this, but this was

149
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This sex. This was no eye contact, flat affect absent hollow cave bodies disconnected I ignore the pain.

150
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be pain, but I'm ignoring it. I won't feel anything no pleasure. I'm not paying attention. Sometimes there's discussed. I don't like what's happening. I don't physically run away. I need to do this for the other person.

151
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I put myself somewhere else. I feel empty when I stay and I want to not be there. And actually, I put needs suds so I don't actually know what the distress level of that one was for some reason I put it down at the zero

152
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So those were intense you fix some heavy hitters here.

153
00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you and don't let don't imagine any kind of expectation on my side. What do you want to be less emotionally reactive to and it could be happening in your current life.

154
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.650
Fire Tablet: When you brought up the second one.

155
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:20.280
Fire Tablet: That you want to be emotionally less emotionally reactive to that I do and I also want to be a less emotionally reactive to other people's

156
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.580
Fire Tablet: antagonize ation of me. Okay.

157
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.640
Fire Tablet: But if we're just going based off of the list that you just read

158
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not, though.

159
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.500
Fire Tablet: We can one that

160
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.130
Fire Tablet: The one that popped up was the sex one

161
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.280
Fire Tablet: Okay, but like when we talked about the song. I don't think I was ready.

162
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.010
Fire Tablet: I got term because that one just fucked me up. Not gonna lie.

163
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha.

164
00:18:52.500 --> 00:19:01.590
Fire Tablet: And so I, I am concerned about going into it, but I do want to go into it. I don't know if we can like

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may be interested in going there.

171
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So, just so that I understand if if the topic has to do with I want to be less emotionally reactive. Could you finish that sentence. So I know what we're talking about.

172
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.590
Fire Tablet: When antagonized

173
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.770

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Before, during, what do you get a sense

191
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.370
Fire Tablet: Of it all of it.

192
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.100

Fire Tablet: Yeah, I want to experience it and

196
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:39.900
Fire Tablet: I don't necessarily want to experience it at the level that my husband does, but I do want to experience it.

197
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that mean, what does he have that you aren't gonna that's not in this universe of possibility for you.

198
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.260
Fire Tablet: Well, when I have sex with him.

199
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:54.270
Fire Tablet: He's

200
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:03.570
Fire Tablet: He just has this way of truly like being in the moment and

201
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.710
Fire Tablet: Making eye contact and

202
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.860
Fire Tablet: He genuinely looks like he's experiencing pleasure.

203
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.940
Fire Tablet: But I'm sitting there thinking, well, what if he's closing his eyes and thinking about somebody else or what if he's

204
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:28.020
Fire Tablet: imagining something else. What if he's not really enjoying this you know

205
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:36.390
Fire Tablet: I can. I'm always so worried. Number one, about what he's thinking and how he's going to respond to

206
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.710
Fire Tablet: Our sex.

207
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:39.540
Fire Tablet: And

208
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.870
Fire Tablet: Then after I get past that all the other shifters

209
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

210
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:58.140
Fire Tablet: All right, like afterwards to host it like why can't you just lay and be with me in the moment and cuddle with me.

211
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.110
Fire Tablet: And at that point, I literally just want to fuck him physically run away, you

212
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, now that one I have, I have an idea about why that part is just not working for you. I guess I

213
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.810
Fire Tablet: His way of showing

214
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.910
Fire Tablet: Love is physical touch.

215
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember that. Yeah, I remember that.

216
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is can we talk a little bit about the the

217
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The discretion of the going outside the marriage for a second.

218
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so when you're bored with him. And I've since forgotten his name. We haven't talked about him in a while. What was his name.

219
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.950
Fire Tablet: Joey

220
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Joey when you were with Joey I thought you were having some fun in there. But were you or was there just

221
00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I worry. Okay. All right. So, you know,

222
00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do it.

223
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.370
Fire Tablet: Yes, but even with that.

224
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:16.170
Fire Tablet: There was, it was still it was a completely different basis, you know, there wasn't

225
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.980
Fire Tablet: A desire to connect

226
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know exactly. I've got an idea of where I want to go with this. So don't digress. Just, just tell me

227
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What you liked about you remember flashes of it. I liked it when I did this, I liked it when I gave myself permission to say this and do this will do this distinction about this different kind of lovemaking with a husband versus fucking okay

228
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:46.800
Fire Tablet: Mm hmm.

229
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just for now just, let's just

230
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just since you already did it. I mean, let's talk about it. Let's talk about what works.

231
00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

232
00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.340
Fire Tablet: Do you think I'm a bad person.

233
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like I'm judging you.

234
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.740
Fire Tablet: Know, but I just thought I'd ask

235
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I don't think you're a bad person.

236
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you've got a body and I'm, what I'm actually excited about is that you actually it's and I'm about to hear from you. Maybe you do know how to have fun with it. So I want to kind of hear with with Joey what

237
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: moments that you liked that you were doing. And then we'll kind of see if we can weave that into don't know that will do we. I'm Dr. I think just defining terms right now might be useful. And because this other piece.

238
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I can get into why this would be harder the intimacy part. Okay, so if we just say just just sex just right here is just, just the sex part. Let's talk about joy. So when I said

239
00:25:52.710 --> 00:26:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your favorite part about how you caught a glimpse of the true self. The Passionate maybe excited turned on.

240
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.870
Fire Tablet: I felt desirable.

241
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.950
Fire Tablet: Okay, I felt desirable. I felt

242
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:14.250
Fire Tablet: Like

243
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.770
Fire Tablet: I wasn't forced

244
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.180
Fire Tablet: To do it or pushed do it or

245
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.970
Fire Tablet: Convince to do it or talked him to do it.

246
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.450
Fire Tablet: You know I made the choice.

247
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

248
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.180
Fire Tablet: I choose this it was solely a choice.

249
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.190
Fire Tablet: I had complete control.

250
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:39.720
I control.

251
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so those are, they are philosophical

252
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we can go into how you don't seem to feel philosophically that you have a choice with Andrew

253
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.480
Fire Tablet: I'm so no way to don't, to be honest.

254
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.000
Fire Tablet: Sometimes

255
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:20.100
Fire Tablet: I literally feel like I just do it because I want him to stop and I know that within a certain amount of time. It'll be over. And then I don't have to worry about it for the next few days.

256
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you want to stop is the pressure

257
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:30.480
Fire Tablet: I would love for the pressure to stop for him and I would love to be able to say

258
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.730
Fire Tablet: No.

259
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.880
Fire Tablet: Without feeling guilt.

260
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.470
Fire Tablet: Without feeling

261
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.100
Fire Tablet: Forced because I know he does, he says, Know.

262
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:49.770
Fire Tablet: When

263
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.510
Fire Tablet: Oh yeah, I know.

264
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:58.770
Fire Tablet: Especially right now because he's on a new medicine is causing problems.

265
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.760
Fire Tablet: And I think it's giving him a bit of

266
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:12.750
Fire Tablet: Anxiety and issues with it. And I'm not trying to draw attention to it. So it's kind of nice because I get a break on but

267
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:14.880
Fire Tablet: Um,

268
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.260
Fire Tablet: Oh, it was something I was gonna say it was important.

269
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: He knows he has a right to say no and you don't

270
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.700
Fire Tablet: Know what I do. I just don't. I absolutely have that right

271
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.850
Fire Tablet: Okay, but then I feel like I say it, and he still kind of gets pushy.

272
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:37.980
Fire Tablet: And

273
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.910
Fire Tablet: Still keeps touching

274
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.180
Fire Tablet: Tries to arouse me

275
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.420
Fire Tablet: But the thing about all of this is

276
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.020
Fire Tablet: Word.

277
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, that's a problem.

278
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, come on.

279
00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.910
That's where the fun comes. Yeah.

280
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:01.740
Fire Tablet: I

281
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.140
Fire Tablet: Take care of that myself.

282
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah so highly motivating when they get to have, you know,

283
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.900
Fire Tablet: But it's not just with him. It was everybody

284
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so with Joey to. That's what I wanted to check on was with Joey to

285
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.350
Fire Tablet: Yeah, my whole life.

286
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude. Okay, so, um,

287
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.760
Fire Tablet: But I can do it. I know it's K

288
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yellow. Yeah, I just can't.

289
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.650
Fire Tablet: Get it from them.

290
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so far.

291
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:35.610
Fire Tablet: Okay.

292
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's go back. Let's go back to Joey because it's you don't love him. I think that's over. So it. Yeah, I feel like it's, there's a little bit. There's only one

293
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.420
Fire Tablet: Time thing.

294
00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's less intensity around it. So let's go there for just a minute. What I heard is it was you fundamentally moving toward him

295
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When you wanted to move toward him that piece is important. And so the difference between that and Andrew is

296
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The

297
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you have said, I don't want to. I'm imagining Megan your hope is that when you say

298
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to however you say it.

299
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.300
Fire Tablet: be respected.

300
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And so that's where

301
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody's disappointment is that it's not just about sex. It's about

302
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.130
Fire Tablet: Everything.

303
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It is because we think

304
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If we say at one. Same with our kids. I've told you guys don't don't come busting in the door. It's a closed door already told you I meet with such and such. It's so and so time you guys keep us in

305
00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And they keep disrespecting your boundary. They keep disrespecting you

306
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And you keep getting maybe disappointed and angry or whatever it is.

307
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:12.120
Fire Tablet: And oh, it's all of that and I get that with him to with everything like

308
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.740
Fire Tablet: A tea in the refrigerator.

309
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I remember tease, is that still going on.

310
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.230
Fire Tablet: All it's always going on and

311
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.000
Fire Tablet: It all comes down to boundaries.

312
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.050
Fire Tablet: And I know it.

313
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.120
Fire Tablet: Yeah, my biggest

314
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:38.580
Fire Tablet: Boundary Center has always been and will I feel like always be and it confused me is sex.

315
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.640
Fire Tablet: And

316
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.570
Fire Tablet: I do enjoy

317
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:57.660
Fire Tablet: Being close to somebody. I even if I don't climax. I enjoy the touch of someone else. The desire of being desired

318
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.100
Fire Tablet: His smell.

319
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.930
Fire Tablet: Oh wait, that

320
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:06.750
Fire Tablet: Yeah, the way that

321
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:15.570
Fire Tablet: Because I know that his smell it safe. His smell is safe to me and smells are big thing for me.

322
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:22.050
Fire Tablet: And they're really big and they're all my triggers combined our smells.

323
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.280
And

324
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.550
Fire Tablet: His smell is safe.

325
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.070
Fire Tablet: And I feel that when I'm with him intimately

326
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.170
Fire Tablet: And so I'm getting more than just

327
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:43.740
Fire Tablet: The end result. I'm actually not getting the end result. But I'm getting other things right.

328
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

329
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:48.270
Fire Tablet: Yeah.

330
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't know you've got a lot of a lot of things that are working. Look what you have, you have like the touch.

331
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You like

332
00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:00.990
Because

333
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:02.400
Fire Tablet: You know,

334
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:08.280
Fire Tablet: When I permitted, but when I permitted and that's what it was there, which are we okay

335
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.460
Fire Tablet: It was permission. It was Otter permission.

336
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:24.030
Fire Tablet: When you get in. Exactly. I gave it I initiated. I said, Let's, let's do this. I am there and

337
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.450
Fire Tablet: I

338
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:38.400
Fire Tablet: And that felt so good. Having that back again after so long that I have the power to say go

339
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.510
Fire Tablet: And it is respected, if I say no.

340
00:33:47.880 --> 00:34:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So this power on me the details of this. I'm curious about. So in other words, it was that power was it like this, as in Joey basically played a bit of a one down position where he he would do physical things exactly he was waiting for your direction just all the way through.

341
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.420
Fire Tablet: Know,

342
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.610
Fire Tablet: So,

343
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.570
Fire Tablet: There was flirting like even just building up to that.

344
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.670
Fire Tablet: Rotation and

345
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.040
Fire Tablet: The communication, the

346
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.910
Fire Tablet: The what we would do us and

347
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:37.140
Fire Tablet: Like all those fun, exciting fresh things that, like all the interesting stuff.

348
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:44.070
Fire Tablet: And there was straight I shit you not straight. Are you okay with this.

349
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

350
00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.460
Fire Tablet: Like, and that was so

351
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.250
Fire Tablet: Wonderful.

352
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.620
Fire Tablet: Me because it meant more than what he realized

353
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.140
Fire Tablet: And and it was like fuck yeah fuck yeah, it's like

354
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Literally asked out. Are you okay with this.

355
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:23.040
Fire Tablet: Yes. And he was shaking and shaking and he asked multiple times. If I was still okay if I was comfortable

356
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Even during

357
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

358
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.070
Fire Tablet: And like

359
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.500
Fire Tablet: I felt

360
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.270
Fire Tablet: Good.

361
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:39.570
Fire Tablet: If I'm

362
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:50.280
Fire Tablet: Just, it was just there was just permission happening. The whole time and

363
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.920
Fire Tablet: How would you, what would you like this or what you like this and

364
00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:12.660
Fire Tablet: And the end the whole entire time that was happening and it was. That's the part I enjoyed the most is just being heard and being listened to, and being understood and being respected.

365
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:20.670
Fire Tablet: That my word carried weight and if I would have said, I know it. I would have said, we have to stop.

366
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:24.600
Yeah.

367
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

368
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just do some some analysis here for a little bit. Okay.

369
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the expectation that sex in this marriage be everything

370
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's, that's what our current culture asks it asks that marriage be he'd be your best friend that he'd be the best lover, you've ever had that he'd be the best parent

371
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It does.

372
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Our culture sets up that way.

373
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.290
Fire Tablet: And it does, it does.

374
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.000
Fire Tablet: But really,

375
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.460
Fire Tablet: It's, it's not reality.

376
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not. It's not. And I think now, I'm not a sex therapist. Um, so I'm coming a bit outside of my my specialty. So I'll share what I know.

377
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not. I'm not specially trained in it so

378
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what I understand.

379
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Women have been completely misunderstood.

380
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that our sort of patriarchal culture has said that we're timid and we want to be, you know, we want sit and just safe. We just want familiar and comfort.

381
00:37:50.430 --> 00:38:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But my reading is not that what I'm reading is we like new. We want it interesting and we want we want to want we want this.

382
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

383
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:15.900
Fire Tablet: Oh yeah, totally. I want that. That was the most like exciting thing about it is like I was totally into it like I was invested like I made the choice to get on board.

384
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.400
Fire Tablet: Right and

385
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.130
Fire Tablet: Yeah, go ahead, please. I'm sorry.

386
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm glad that one resonates. So that seems to be

387
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that not everybody knows about including men. They don't know that it were the message that sent out is that men like that.

388
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Were we get all they want something new. They want a new girl. They want younger, whatever. That's pretty socially normalized. But I don't think that the expectation is that women also they want

389
00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Strange different they want something that's not bitching and

390
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's true, if what you like is just this is going to it's exciting because I don't know what it's going to be like it could be amazing.

391
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not burdened with having to take care of this, ma'am.

392
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:24.720
Fire Tablet: Yeah, I don't have to worry about a fucking thing after this I can get up and I can fucking lean

393
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.610
Fire Tablet: And I'm golden.

394
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.230
Fire Tablet: Like we are good.

395
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. So if you just hold that that part right there. That's what just

396
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I you know what I was calling fucking like literally in its terms, meaning there's no emotional intimacy. That's what it gives you

397
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It gives you this space that you don't have to process. Anything later on about what happened. We don't have to talk about it later. It's nothing. It's just this was the act. I got to do it was fun. It was play it was isolated to this event. And I'm going to go on with my life and

398
00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.310
Fire Tablet: It's over.

399
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.590
Fire Tablet: And that's exactly what it was.

400
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:13.530
Fire Tablet: And I do carry guilt. I'm not gonna lie, but I also don't and I feel like bad because I feel like I should carry more than what I do.

401
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:23.010
Fire Tablet: But then I'm like sitting there thinking, especially during the ugly times where I'm like,

402
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:24.900
Fire Tablet: You know what

403
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:35.340
Fire Tablet: This was for me and it really had nothing to do with you and that's what my fucking life consists of is you

404
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.150
Right.

405
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.400
Fire Tablet: Right.

406
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so that it and it's probably not much more complicated than just those simple amount simple elements that you went way outside your normal moral compass right you have way outside and I know that our

407
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.530
Fire Tablet: Yeah. That is not my

408
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.900
Fire Tablet: Who I am, because

409
00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Desperate. I think for a little bit of you to show up in its raw authentic self. We all want that.

410
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.440
Fire Tablet: That sense if I didn't. Yeah.

411
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:19.080
Fire Tablet: Yeah, absolutely. And it's completely compressed and that's what everybody all my loved ones say about me in my marriage and Andrew is that I've just become this

412
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:25.200
Fire Tablet: Suppressed quiet subdued obeying

413
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:32.010
Fire Tablet: Woman that gets walked all over and trashed and hurt and

414
00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:38.070
Fire Tablet: Children get hurt, and nobody physically but emotionally

415
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:48.570
Fire Tablet: And that I've just lost me in this and it's been 10 years of this and

416
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.950
Fire Tablet: That moment I felt

417
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.170
Fire Tablet: A little bit more.

418
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.200
Fire Tablet: Like who I wish I could be all the time.

419
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're going to see if that motivation if having had that experience with Joey is something that you might risk.

420
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just stay right in here. If you're willing to, we're not going to go anywhere else not going to go into guilt not going to go any of those other moving parts about it. We're just going to go into this

421
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like to take that vitality that excitement that arousal knowing exactly what you want to say it again. What if you took the fact that you do know what you want. You do know what you like you took that

422
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had an expectation and we're just going to take one action and you took that that you already know is true and you turn it towards Andrew just one thing.

423
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And you asked of it, meaning asked him, Andrew, maybe not verbally, but you had

424
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The plan to have it happen with him. In other words, this is what I did with Joey. This is what I'm going to do with Andrew

425
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give you an example.

426
00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.590
Fire Tablet: Okay.

427
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:11.940
Fire Tablet: So here, please.

428
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:18.270

435
00:43:53.580 --> 00:44:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's like a core sort of that raw animal in us, you know that the sense that you have that's really awesome. So, and you initiate that

436
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on to that for just a minute does not go 10 steps ahead just I want to check in with my client and see what's happening to you when you imagine that you

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:15.240
Fire Tablet: Would be shredded by both

438
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Excited excited. Okay, so it's not immersive, it's not. You're not freaking out. It's just

439
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.100
Fire Tablet: Okay, you're in know it's like, oh,

440
00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.840
Fire Tablet: Yes and yes

441
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

442
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.160
Fire Tablet: Let's use the app and smell.

443
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it lets us ask you. Oh really.

444
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.640
Fire Tablet: beautiful, gorgeous, gorgeous that

445
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, you know, maybe kind of storing that in your head.

446
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.800
Fire Tablet: Yeah, well, you're

447
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're

448
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So actually, everything is is working justice planned everything's working right now. So what's happening is, is I believe you're giving yourself permission to be

449
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: a sexual being with Andrew without the, the, I've got to take care of you, the emotional intimacy.

450
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: All of the psychological meaning that that sex has. So what that in that moment means that was authentic. It was spontaneous.

451
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't part of my trauma history wasn't any of that it was in the moment and I wanted to find out if you had it liked it could do it. And it sounds like it's there.

452
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:39.390
Fire Tablet: Mm hmm.

453
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think

454
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is, this is like the 10 step forward part. Do you think that Andrew has the, let's say, you know, he wasn't having any kind of difficulty with an erection or anything, let's just say

455
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: He a directional orgasm.

456
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's say you didn't have to worry about any anything about cuddle anything about eye contact, where let's say you didn't have to worry at all that somehow there was this safe word

457
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Safe, whatever. And we're hey I want to whatever the word is I want to, I want to get laid or sign on what so I want to do this thing. I want to play.

458
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's more along the lines of more like

459
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be my role. This is going to be yours and

460
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If you deviate from it.

461
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I'm not going to do it. I'm just gonna say stop, I'm gonna not do it.

462
00:46:47.820 --> 00:47:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what would be the things you'd need to have happen in order for you to be able to just do sex with Andrew without having to take care of him. If you just use body and know that sounded my

463
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.780
Fire Tablet: Current state like if there was

464
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.350
Fire Tablet: Just how I am right now with all the trauma and shit on board.

465
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

466
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:10.380
Fire Tablet: Okay.

467
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:11.970
Fire Tablet: Um,

468
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:15.060
Fire Tablet: no eye contact.

469
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. So how would you pull that off because he's got eyeballs. Would you put some oversight.

470
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.810
Fire Tablet: Yeah.

471
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. Line fold. Okay, fine.

Fire Tablet: Touch

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.610
Fire Tablet: You can't touch.

476
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.040
Fire Tablet: I will leave legs loose.

Fire Tablet: And

480
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:05.640
Fire Tablet: You have to make sounds like you have to respond to the pleasure that I'm giving him. Okay.

481
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes like

482
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.520
Fire Tablet: He has to moan. He has to

483
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:23.640
Fire Tablet: feel pleasure. Like, like he has to yell or something. Cuz if you very vocal very vocal and running responsive to everything that I do. Okay.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.700
Fire Tablet: I get to do it upon

486
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:32.010
Fire Tablet: My own choice. I get to touch what I want feel what I want

487
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:35.850
Fire Tablet: But he can't

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, I got

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.060

494
00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:03.420
Fire Tablet: And I am in ultimate pleasure mode, like, but I made complete and utter control.

495
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay now.

496
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.100
Fire Tablet: You can't like

497
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:08.850
Deviate

498
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

499
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how are you feeling in the body right now is we're

500
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.400
We're talking, I am aroused.

501
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.900
Fire Tablet: I am I am thinking about

502
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:25.680
Fire Tablet: Doing all of those things to my husband.

503
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:27.300
Fire Tablet: Yeah, so

504
00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah

505
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that a much more exciting and pleasant idea.

506
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Than having to conform to what you think you're supposed to like

507
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead tuning into what you get excited by

508
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it's a completely different encounter.

509
00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:10.110
Fire Tablet: It is, but like, for example, sometimes I like aggression into that I like aggressive. Yes. I think it's hot like pull my hair. Let's do it. Like, let's get down and

510
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.240
Fire Tablet: Andrews, a much more delicate and gentle.

511
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.460
Fire Tablet: And

512
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:24.420
Fire Tablet: I know like he hasn't outright said it in these words but

513
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.330
Fire Tablet: That a lot of the things that

514
00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:35.910
Fire Tablet: I want or things about how I go things sexually are because of what's happened to me.

515
00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you think

516
00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.060
Fire Tablet: I think he's right but

517
00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.190
Fire Tablet: That's not for him to say

518
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Yeah. And so what like

519
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: We are not example, we do not control what our fetishes are

520
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What arouses us. This is a deeply personal and it is people get to decide when I

521
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.410
Fire Tablet: can't change it, it's

522
00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.060
Fire Tablet: not who I am.

523
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it doesn't make you bad. It's just there it is, someone might say that his approach is bad. I mean, so what

524
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:10.530
Fire Tablet: But that's

525
00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:20.970
Fire Tablet: Like he makes this team that way, like that. I like these things are want these things or deviate from these things because of that.

526
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.210
Fire Tablet: And I don't want that to be the defining factor.

527
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But Megan. Hi, I'm sorry.

528
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: At what point did I raise my hand and say let's do psychoanalysis about why you want to tie up his hands. I didn't. What I did was get into it. That's what play is

529
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly psycho analysis. I don't want to be analyzed why I want it this way. And what that shit.

530
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.460
Fire Tablet: I just wanted a joy.

531
00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun. Yeah.

532
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:54.330
Fire Tablet: Yeah, and I don't want to have to worry about your feelings.

533
00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:56.850
Fire Tablet: And hurting your feelings.

534
00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:59.640
Fire Tablet: And hurting my feelings and

535
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:10.710
Fire Tablet: Wondering if I'm going to be okay. At the end of this or if you're going to be okay. At the end of this or if I just messed up with this or if

536
00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.530
Fire Tablet: You know, I just sucks.

537
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

538
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:17.940
Fire Tablet: But that's happening all the time. Yeah.

539
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're already doing it basically

540
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: By diverting your preference and it's it's not. It's not pleasant. Now the only part I wonder about is only you can navigate whether there's enough that he has the ego strength, whether there's enough ego strength in him in this relationship.

541
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to trust him. If you were to say, Listen, I don't want to hear your psychobabble nice scrolling and like that. I don't want

542
00:52:53.400 --> 00:53:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: warm, fuzzy. I just, I wanted to be hot. And this is what I want, do you want to do it, yes or no, I don't want to hear your analysis of the BA BA BA BA BA. It's either yes or now.

543
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I already have a therapist for all that so

544
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.300
Fire Tablet: Like you tell him, though, by the way.

545
00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.040
Fire Tablet: Absolutely. Do I said we got that covered. Thank you.

546
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

547
00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now he has a right to say no. So you're going to need the ego strength to to be able to respect.

548
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:24.570
Fire Tablet: Except the know

549
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because he really may like this, this, this.

550
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: warm, fuzzy approach and that has that has to be okay too. And so maybe if it was both of yours. Okay, that, you know, some

551
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: night or day or whatever, it could be this look like this, another night. It could be okay. It'll be candlelit soft music, it'll be this nice slow kind of gentle and I'll try to have eye contact. I'll really really work on it.

552
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.880
Fire Tablet: And we have to wait till I approach you.

553
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right, right, of course. There'll be some compromise there.

554
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe that's how it goes. Is is he'll be able to say, well, I can do you know 80 90% of what you just described.

555
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to be able to have a safe word where I can do my hands, cuz I'm kind of freaked out with, you know, an hour of it and maybe you'll say, that's fine. And then we'll take a little break and I'll go have a beer and and you'll have

556
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you there's no I'm trying to say like even the yes

557
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.720
Fire Tablet: No, you're right.

558
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And with some modification could be exciting because it's like

559
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh gosh, we might actually do this.

560
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:46.950
Fire Tablet: Well, we have done some of that there. I definitely know that he stepped out of his comfort zone to meet my sexual needs.

561
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

562
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.970
Fire Tablet: He has done that. I'm not to say like over 10 years and he hasn't done that at all because he absolutely has

563
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

564
00:54:54.930 --> 00:55:04.140
Fire Tablet: But then I think it affected him afterwards. And it also, it wasn't something that was often repeated or done again.

565
00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:16.470
Fire Tablet: But like in something I just really, really enjoyed, and it was not quite the same for him but

566
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:22.050
Fire Tablet: I also do the same for him like

567
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.390
Fire Tablet: I just feel like it's more me

568
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.090
Fire Tablet: You know,

569
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, here's my guests and I don't know quite how to say it. And again, I'm recommending Esther Perel as a place to to read and YouTube just

570
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So generous with her information, super, super smart woman. And this is all she does is just sex, sex, sex, sex.

571
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.160
Fire Tablet: Oh, yeah.

572
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um,

573
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What sex gives you

574
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The same way that you can sort of have this orgasm on your own.

575
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't trigger

576
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The emotional trauma, the way intimacy does

577
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.420
Fire Tablet: Absolutely. RINGING

578
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:23.400
Fire Tablet: You got it.

579
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

580
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.120
Fire Tablet: How do I explain that to my partner.

581
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how few words. I just said, Say it back to me.

582
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.610
Fire Tablet: What you

583
00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:44.010
Fire Tablet: Okay, see if it's already there. It's I'm already like, what the fuck

584
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:44.910
Yeah.

585
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:48.750
Fire Tablet: Hold on.

586
00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.560
Fire Tablet: The emotional

587
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:01.560
Fire Tablet: connection that you get

588
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.730
Fire Tablet: I know. Can you say it again.

589
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So first of all, it's going to be, I guess it's very much and I think so it's

590
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I what what just straight fucking does for me.

591
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm and I enjoy it and I'm not

592
00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: second guessing myself and I'm not in my head what it gives me

593
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is great.

594
00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens for me when I do, what is love making will call it with you. Is it triggers the emotional trauma history of my past now.

595
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear that. But if that's true, then

596
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So what a that's happening and and be. It doesn't mean it's going to be like that forever and see

597
00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: He may have a like, oh, what does that mean, you know, I, I'm the one is traumatizing

598
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We, we don't know what the responsible but if that's true, that wouldn't be uncommon.

599
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:18.810
Fire Tablet: But that is exactly what's happening. Yeah, that and it's not just with the lovemaking and like the cuddling and

600
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.130
Fire Tablet: It's, it's the touching and

601
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:29.550
Fire Tablet: But it happens most during that time and I'm

602
00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:39.780
Fire Tablet: I like. Like I said, I literally want fucking run. And it's because of those words right there. Fucking for me.

603
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:54.210
Fire Tablet: I don't have to do the fucking bullshit and I'm gonna have to get an orgasm out of it. It's just fucking wrongness right it's raw sexual fucking and I don't have to feel anything for you.

604
00:58:54.630 --> 00:59:01.560
Fire Tablet: Right, I don't have to. I don't have to feel anything about you, but when you try to make love to me.

605
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.240
Fire Tablet: Or you try to connect with me in a sexual or sexual level.

606
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.910
Fire Tablet: I want to crumble up into a little ball.

607
00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:13.770
Fire Tablet: And hide.

608
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.240
Yeah.

609
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:21.150
Fire Tablet: And I feel guilty for that.

610
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, that's my next clients here don't run away, but that I'm just letting me know, because I want to kind of have like a smooth transition here.

611
00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This this trauma history that you have the irony is, is what Andrew was saying is it's that that aggression part he thinks is problematic.

612
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But what it is the other way around, right, what that does for you is it frees you up to not sort of be aware of other

613
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It just you back in your body gives you a chance to restart reboot and get into your own sexuality. It's not to say that later on. You're not going to be able to have that

614
00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not right now. Right.

615
01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:02.670
Fire Tablet: Yeah.

616
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That just for now.

617
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get back in your own body in contact with another human being because masturbation is one thing, but to be able to do this with another person, like, how about we just start with that, like how you know

618
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I already had because of the trauma someone messed with it. They already messed with what was supposed to be.

619
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The ability to feel safe to do that to do both. That got that you were robbed. But it doesn't mean that's the end of the story.

620
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So if this is just a restart where you get to get back in the body get to be this sexual being.

621
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Get comfortable with it being it without having to think of other because that right as in other thinking of other was dangerous. It's just this. It's just this

622
01:00:54.810 --> 01:01:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yuck. So instead, you just sort of staying in your own body doing that for a while, you read that he's comfortable with it and then later on, look at it again and say, well, maybe I'd like to try this other thing. How can I still be this this sexual being. And like what I like.

623
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And also love

624
01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This person cannot and

625
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, there's the other. Maybe it's a face like then there's this next step.

626
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.810
Fire Tablet: Like 29 years

627
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.190
Fire Tablet: It's a really long thing the hit the face.

628
01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you

629
01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.060
Fire Tablet: Able to meet him there.

630
01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.050
Fire Tablet: Are you

631
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:38.670
Fire Tablet: Okay, but I can't.

632
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:42.240
Fire Tablet: I don't know how. Yeah.

633
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, this is, this has its own specialty. So I'm not going to pretend like it's me.

634
01:01:48.810 --> 01:02:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm suspecting based on our conversations that this right in here that it be if it were okay for you to have some fun. This way, not be drawn in by sight, you know, analysis from Andrew. She's in the field. So he's got some some words and

635
01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:05.880
Fire Tablet: Yeah.

636
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:07.170
But

637
01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The old subjugation that you did when you were younger, that you continue to do in this marriage.

638
01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know it, it could be very traumatizing for you. So I certainly and I invite you to explore staying in that strength staying in that confidence and power that comes from doing the things that you enjoy. Because what's bringing back the trauma is not the hair pulling

639
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

640
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's certain things that are going on in these intimate movements with husband that are triggering

641
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.190
Fire Tablet: Mm hmm. That's exactly right.

642
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Very simple, right. It's that it's these things that I've been asking for. They don't trigger for me, please. You know, that's your analysis and I'm telling you.

643
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: These I can get out of my friggin head and I can have fun. The slow stuff this touch this, these certain things they trigger me currently

644
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do them because I love you and blah, blah, blah, blah. Whatever you decide, Is your truth.

645
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But just so you know Andrew don't don't come into my head space that's not true for me for me. This makes it possible for me to have fun in a sex life. And this one is more challenging but but just so you know it's not what you think Andrew

646
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:29.400
Fire Tablet: It's like I yeah

647
01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.560
Fire Tablet: Okay, it's my true

648
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.210
Fire Tablet: Next Friday. Right.

649
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.960

Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just looking ahead, just a little bit heads up. I have another training on
