Conall Pederson: You know, oh yeah, they noticed that I was like really aggressive and kind of confrontational, which I'm not normally

50
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.440
Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that was early March.

51
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.240
Conall Pederson: Yeah. And then, um, but the lack of known made me rehab Xanax

52
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.920
Okay.

53
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.810
Conall Pederson: Which I have is, I'm having di have separate treatment for that my psychiatrist is take care of that.

54
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.780
Belis Aladag: So yeah, I have. So in California. We have a system where we can see are prescribed like

55
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.950
Conall Pederson: For sure.

56
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.000
Conall Pederson: Right, the controlled substances. I'm sure they suck looks at it too.

57
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.320
Belis Aladag: So is it Dr.

58
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.100
Allison.

59
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.540
Conall Pederson: Yeah.

60
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.340
Belis Aladag: Yeah so. So you said she's your psychiatrist and she

61
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.990
Conall Pederson: I saw that she must read

62
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.870
Belis Aladag: Diazepam some value.

63
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.090
Belis Aladag: Yeah, okay. So, and she's, she's helping you get off of Xanax, is that right

64
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:57.210
Conall Pederson: Yeah, he's helping me get off Xanax, it's a he. Yeah, he recommended me to you guys. Cuz I I messaged him about really bad opioid cravings and he had said they you guys could help with that.

65
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.100
Yeah, absolutely.

66
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.520
Belis Aladag: Okay, so here's the deal. We can definitely help you with this. Um,

67
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:15.450
Belis Aladag: There is a medication that helps you with cravings for opioids. It's a partial opioid itself.

68
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.920
Conall Pederson: Okay.

69
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.340
Belis Aladag: You pronounce morphine is the active agent buprenorphine and

70
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.250
Belis Aladag: It's a brand name is like Suboxone you may have

71
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.240
Conall Pederson: Heard of it right

72
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.970
Belis Aladag: So, so that's kind of the, the gold standard of treatment for this problem.

73
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.770
Belis Aladag: And

74
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:44.640
Belis Aladag: You know, even though for you. It's, it's like two months. And you know, it's kind of a short amount of time, but it was a very intense amount of time and you're already

75
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.060
Conall Pederson: Feeling

76
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.940
Belis Aladag: Things again and thinking about relapse and stuff. So I think I agree that it's

77
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.040
Belis Aladag: Important that you get on medication.

78
00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:04.680
Belis Aladag: And then once time passes, I'm talking months, maybe, you know, we can see about, okay, how do you feel. Do you feel okay are you having any cravings.

79
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.390
Conall Pederson: Are you feeling like you're in a stable place.

80
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.210
Belis Aladag: And then we can slowly get you off of that.

81
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.830
Conall Pederson: For sure, that sounds great.

82
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.750
Belis Aladag: Yeah, okay.

83
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.180
Conall Pederson: Go. Yeah.

84
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.610
Belis Aladag: Okay, now

85
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.620
Belis Aladag: The thing with the Valium Xanax problem in the volume is because Suboxone

86
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.790
Conall Pederson: Is like

87
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.480
Conall Pederson: He warned me about that.

88
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.070
Conall Pederson: I've

89
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.210
Conall Pederson: Taken a lot of

90
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:49.470
Conall Pederson: Breath respiratory inhibitors. At the same time, and survived and not even come close to overdosing, so I think I'm going to be okay. Mm hmm.

91
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:58.710
Belis Aladag: Okay, so that's good to know. You know, but it's still a concern. Right.

92
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.130
Conall Pederson: So, and I also, I do have Narcan in my house.

93
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.420
Conall Pederson: You do in the event.

94
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.680
Conall Pederson: Of an emergency. Yeah.

95
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.510
Belis Aladag: So I was gonna say I could prescribe some nor can to have that around. But you have that

96
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.920
Conall Pederson: Yeah.

97
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.720
Belis Aladag: Okay, uh,

98
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.030
Belis Aladag: And

99
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.290
Belis Aladag: Your parents should be the ones that know

100
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.550
Conall Pederson: They haven't been there yet.

101
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.060
Conall Pederson: Yeah.

102
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:31.440
Belis Aladag: To spray in your nose. Yeah. Okay. Um, so the psychiatrist has you on the value for now.

103
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.160
Belis Aladag: Are you also on Depakote, or

104
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:42.600
Conall Pederson: That's just to maintain he's he's paranoid about me, seizing

105
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.430
Conall Pederson: From

106
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.760
Conall Pederson: From Xanax withdrawal. I've never had. But it's just you know like rather be so

107
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.190
Belis Aladag: The lactic okay cuz he's you told them, you're doing a lot of Xanax and

108
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.160
Belis Aladag: Yes, wanting to prevent you from going into a seizure from

109
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.660
Belis Aladag: Red, but he also has you on Diazepam so Diazepam would cover and

110
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.170
Yeah.

111
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.000
Conall Pederson: I think he's just doubling down to be safe. Okay.

112
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.370
Belis Aladag: So for now, you're taking the Depakote.

113
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.980
Conall Pederson: Yeah, twice.

114
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.540
Twice a day.

115
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.620
Belis Aladag: You do that and then and then that's it. And then the data pan five milligrams. How often are you

116
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:22.860
Taking

117
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.060
Conall Pederson: I take five milligrams in the morning and then I take

118
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.870
Conall Pederson: And then the take five at nine.

119
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.260
Conall Pederson: Pet three and 10 nine

120
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.550
Belis Aladag: got cut off there. I'm sorry.

121
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.260
Belis Aladag: See your regimen again.

122
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:50.070
Conall Pederson: Sorry. Yeah. So I take five milligrams at 910 milligrams that three and then 10 milligrams again at night. Okay.

123
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.200
Belis Aladag: 510 and 10

124
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.460
Conall Pederson: Yeah so 25 total. Okay.

125
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.650
Belis Aladag: And as he's going to be Taylor, we had

126
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.140
Conall Pederson: Taper you we have me on. We've already heard me for you down.

127
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.870
Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, good. So yeah, so we have to be very, very careful.

128
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.770
Belis Aladag: With this, and yeah. Dr l said should know that you're going to start the Suboxone you should

129
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.680
Conall Pederson: She actually gave recommended it.

130
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:30.810
Conall Pederson: He said, because he said the other option was methadone, which could really be dangerous with the Valium. Correct. But he said, because

131
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.340
Conall Pederson: Suboxone and there's only a partial editor.

132
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.650
Conall Pederson: It's a lot safer in terms of interactions. He's correct

133
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:53.940
Belis Aladag: Okay, good. So it sounds like he knows what's going on and you're aware, and you're on a tapering. So that's the understanding is that you're eventually like getting off this Diazepam as well which is for your benefit.

134
00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:01.110
Belis Aladag: Really being on sedatives like Xanax as a pan long term, not, not a good idea, you know,

135
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.530
Belis Aladag: How did you get started with that whole thing. Were you having anxiety when you were young, or you just

136
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:15.810
Conall Pederson: This one. Oh yeah, I have things it. I've always had anxiety it when we are undiagnosed until

137
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:35.550
Conall Pederson: About a year ago and I started, I mean on Xanax a cup junior year of high school I done Xanax, a couple of times, but not really. I was there, whatever, then the entire month of my senior year, I did.

138
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.980
Conall Pederson: And then I completely stopped doing them dearly like care for them. After that, then

139
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.850
Conall Pederson: I got a very large amount of them for free.

140
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.910
Conall Pederson: So I kind of was like, well,

141
00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:10.680
Conall Pederson: So it's an anxiety med I have anxiety. My doctor and I was. I wasn't seeing a psychiatrist at the time I was only seeing doctors. So my doctors weren't giving the proper anxiety meds. So I was like, I'm going to self medicate, but I did way too much. I see.

142
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:19.890
Belis Aladag: And I see. Were you in on anything else in the past like you were on like SSRI like sertraline and some oh

143
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.740
Conall Pederson: Yeah, those have not really worked for me.

144
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.480
Conall Pederson: Those have made me pretty depressed, to be honest.

145
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.310
Belis Aladag: Okay, wow.

146
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:35.700
Belis Aladag: Yeah obstacle. Okay, so they didn't really work well in the lower mood. Yeah.

147
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:42.990
Belis Aladag: Okay, so that hasn't worked so so for you. I think it's going to be important.

148
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.410
Belis Aladag: Actually if Thursday's

149
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:53.670
Belis Aladag: Work for you. Thursday 4pm we can keep meeting.

150
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.810
Conall Pederson: Sounds perfect

151
00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:02.370
Belis Aladag: On a weekly basis. And one of the things are grouped then. So it's a group and the therapist.

152
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.830
Conall Pederson: Was talking last time.

153
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:14.970
Belis Aladag: About like trying to find ways things that we think might help everybody anything anyone can use about like anxiety relief and things like that.

154
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:24.390
Belis Aladag: breathing techniques meditation techniques, things like this that you could use that are non medicinal like that are something you can do just no matter where you are.

155
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.730
Belis Aladag: Right. Um, so maybe that that Thursday group is a good fit for you.

156
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.400
Belis Aladag: Okay, so I'll put you in for the Thursday 4pm group.

157
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.430
Belis Aladag: So, so what I'll do is I can prescribe you the medication.

158
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.850
Belis Aladag: And

159
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:54.150
Belis Aladag: In terms of the amount. Now you've been off of everything the opioid since like march 3 or so.

160
00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:02.460
Conall Pederson: I'd say 36 that range. Yeah, six. Okay, let's just say the six. Okay. So since the six

161
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.920
Belis Aladag: So, and you're having cravings.

162
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:05.820
Yeah.

163
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:18.090
Belis Aladag: So why don't we start with because honestly, the smaller the dose, the better for you, because again, long term, we want to get you off of medication.

164
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.380
Belis Aladag: Need to be on it.

165
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:34.020
Belis Aladag: So we can try a two milligram dose right and and see how that goes. If you're like, you know, the two milligrams is good, but I think I'm still having some sort of cravings.

166
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.350
Belis Aladag: You know, then we'll go up.

167
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.670
Belis Aladag: For sure. Now I think just do the two milligrams. Keep it simple.

168
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.160
Belis Aladag: Take it in the morning, you know, drink something before because it's

169
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.710
Belis Aladag: A sublingual tablet or a film.

170
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.850
Belis Aladag: Okay, depending on your insurance. Are you medical

171
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.910
Conall Pederson: No, I'm a Anthem Blue Cross.

172
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:05.250
Belis Aladag: Blue Cross. So then I think tablets would probably be covered fine either way if they both dissolve under your tongue.

173
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:05.880
Conall Pederson: Okay.

174
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.100
Belis Aladag: Have you ever taken this before.

175
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.750
Conall Pederson: Not okay

176
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.700
Belis Aladag: So yeah, so drink water. So your

177
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:29.790
Belis Aladag: Your moist. Right. And then you put this under your tongue and you let it melt and that's how it gets into your bloodstream. If you chew it or swallow it, it bypasses your system and you don't feel the effect. So you really want to put it under the tongue. Let it melt. I'm

178
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.300
Conall Pederson: Sure.

179
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:37.260
Belis Aladag: And then whatever's left over. Obviously you can swallow, but really keep it in there for like a few minutes, five minutes.

180
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:43.440
Belis Aladag: Um, so yeah do that first thing in the morning and then let's see. Let's see how it goes.

181
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.520
Belis Aladag: Do you have any general concerns about your health, like do you normally

182
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.270
Belis Aladag: Have fatigue or gastrointestinal problems or

183
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.770
Belis Aladag: Chest pain or shortness of breath.

184
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.570
Belis Aladag: None of that stuff.

185
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.800
No.

186
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.580

187
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:09.780

188
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.630
Belis Aladag: In there and stuff. So, you know, it's just something we can work on if you want to

189
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:17.280

Conall Pederson: I tried a couple times. I'm okay on that for now. For now. Okay. Yeah.

192
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:37.710

Conall Pederson: None that I'm aware of. Okay.

211
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.890
Belis Aladag: Okay, cool. So we bought all of that.

212
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.680
Belis Aladag: And you already have our can

213
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:55.470
Okay.

214
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.100
Conall Pederson: What else, what else. Okay, so should I take that

215
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:11.580
Conall Pederson: When I take that in the morning. Should I take that with like after I take my Valium or before I take my valley. Um, is there an order I should do that in that

216
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.010
Conall Pederson: I'm like safe.

217
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:21.030
Belis Aladag: You know it's gonna be in your system. It's a long acting substance so

218
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.490
Conall Pederson: Because the value is extended release extended release.

219
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.050
Belis Aladag: I mean, I would probably, I don't know. I would say take it before.

220
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.070
Okay.

221
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.770
Belis Aladag: You know, take it before and then continue regimen with the Valium.

222
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:45.390
Belis Aladag: And then keep the Narcan handy if you start falling asleep or it's like making you very sedated.

223
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:46.770
Conall Pederson: So that's

224
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.940
Belis Aladag: Not a good sign.

225
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.390
Belis Aladag: You know, and be around people, when you're

226
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.410
Belis Aladag: Taking it

227
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.220
For sure.

228
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.070
Belis Aladag: I just want you to be safe.

229
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.100
Belis Aladag: So, okay. And then, how often do you see Dr. Elson

230
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.270
Conall Pederson: Oh, once

231
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.710
Belis Aladag: Also once a week. Okay, are you seeing in virtually

232
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.710
Conall Pederson: Yeah. Right now I am because of that covered

233
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:24.270
Belis Aladag: Well, okay, great. Okay, doing that. Um, and then recovery activities. Have you ever, like been involved in anything like na or a or

234
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.060
Conall Pederson: Not okay

235
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.030
Belis Aladag: So we can talk more about that later.

236
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.750
Conall Pederson: When you get into a

237
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:36.570
Belis Aladag: group setting, I think, I think this is a good start for you getting on medication and then meeting a cohort of

238
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.410
Belis Aladag: People that are struggling with opioids mostly opioid problems.

239
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.320
Conall Pederson: And then, and then we will give you resources as we go on. For sure.

240
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.260
Belis Aladag: Especially with what's going on. I mean, everything is online because of what's going on so

241
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.920
Belis Aladag: There are meetings and things you can check out online but

242
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.080
Belis Aladag: For now, like if you can stick to your

243
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:10.110
Belis Aladag: Weekly, Dr. Elson visits and weekly visits with me and the group. I think that'll be good for you. And then there is a therapist, you're assigned to. So one on one with her as well. You could do

244
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.500
Belis Aladag: To help with the anxiety issue as

245
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.990
Belis Aladag: As your tapering off the data, Pam.

246
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:22.410
Conall Pederson: I think I'm good on that just because I have Dr. Allison. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

247
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.960
Belis Aladag: Alright so let me do that.

248
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:34.740
Belis Aladag: Okay, so I think I have everything I need in here in terms of your pharmacy.

249
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.440
Let's see.

250
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.530
That a prescription

251
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:49.560
Belis Aladag: Just throw in our candidates for kicks and see if it goes at Walgreens on Castro Street. Yeah, okay.

252
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:58.110
Conall Pederson: Is there a way you could see if there's a version of Narcan that's covered by my insurance because the last time it wasn't

253
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.800
Conall Pederson: $140 out of pocket.

254
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:10.680
Belis Aladag: Whoo. Yeah. So, so when you go I ORDERED, I ORDERED THE KIND that that's I would assume is covered

255
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.120
Belis Aladag: Okay, and so I ordered it. You don't have to buy it.

256
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.410
Conall Pederson: Trisha, but

257
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:24.120
Belis Aladag: When you go there, say, look, she ordered a nasal spray. I'm hoping it's covered. Can you check and it's actually the pharmacist that can really

258
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.390
Belis Aladag: Navigate that for you and see

259
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.560
Conall Pederson: If

260
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:39.780
Belis Aladag: They can say, oh, you know what this there's a different brand. I don't know of any but if there's a different brand or something that actually is covered, they can send a message to us, or you can call us right then and there, called a

261
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.700
Conall Pederson: Virtual clinic and say, Hey man, can you

262
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.970
Belis Aladag: Ask to ask the doctor to send this particular one.

263
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.560
Conall Pederson: For sure. Okay.

264
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.900
Conall Pederson: Sounds good. Okay.

265
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.370
Belis Aladag: So for now, we're going to do the tablet for you.

266
00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:04.410
Belis Aladag: OK, so the data, Pam is a major risk, but we know that we're taking this risk we know it. We're gonna monitor you closely.

267
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:12.990
Belis Aladag: And you're going to be as safe as possible to understand that there's a risk of overdose. This

268
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.370
Conall Pederson: Yeah.

269
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:23.310
Belis Aladag: But, you know, like you said, I know. I mean, I know you're not alone in that people are like, oh yeah, oh you should do the things I've done and it's like, oh god I don't want to. No.

270
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:30.150
Conall Pederson: No, I, I'm kind of I think this might be on the lower end of risk of overdose for things

271
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.130
Belis Aladag: Okay, so

272
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.390
I'm

273
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:35.400
Conall Pederson: Not super worried

274
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.860
Belis Aladag: Please be safe, you know,

275
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.330
Conall Pederson: Glad you're doing this and

276
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.020
Belis Aladag: Getting help

277
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:53.280
Belis Aladag: And whoever you are getting these things from for free or what all your connections. I mean, that's one thing housekeeping item you're going to have to kind of hold yourself accountable to and just cut

278
00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:04.620
Belis Aladag: Off contact. It's really hard to completely cut off with social media and all this stuff now but do your best and remember that it's no matter what. It's a business for people

279
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.950
Belis Aladag: Yeah, depending on your, you know, whatever. But at the end of the day it's a business people just want to make money. So you

280
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.160
Conall Pederson: Know, I've been. I've been on both ends of it. I understand how it works. Yeah. Okay, so one

281
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.630
Okay, so we're going to

282
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:36.360
Belis Aladag: Try this, and see how it helps you. You could also see if you find the one is really intense. You could try having it and saying one milligram in the morning and one

283
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.410
Conall Pederson: milligram later in the

284
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:45.510
Conall Pederson: Day. Okay, for sure. Okay. Should I take today's dose when I pick it up, or should I just wait till tomorrow.

285
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:46.860
Belis Aladag: Um,

286
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.970
Belis Aladag: I would just wait till tomorrow.

287
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.620
Belis Aladag: If you want to get into the routine because you want to have a steady amount in your bloodstream.

288
00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.180
Belis Aladag: Right. Um, so wait till tomorrow morning and then start your routine.

289
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.490
Belis Aladag: See, let's see how it goes.

290
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.380
Conall Pederson: Sounds good. Okay.

291
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.840
Belis Aladag: Do this now. Okay, so I'm doing this for you.

292
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.810
Belis Aladag: You should be able to go there.

293
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.690
Belis Aladag: Now, and get it.

294
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.000
