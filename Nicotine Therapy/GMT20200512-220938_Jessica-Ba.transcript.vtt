Misty Moncada: I think good

14
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.410
Misty Moncada: And you can be proud of me. I did that pause thing that you told me to do. Um, I

15
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.080
Misty Moncada: Was mad because I started work.

16
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.720
Misty Moncada: The first time and I had was it like battery. The Onion rings right and

17
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.700
Misty Moncada: I messed up, but I do the

18
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.820
Misty Moncada: Better way, not knowing I had to reuse it and

19
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:51.810
Misty Moncada: I get mad easily like its own clouds. I mean, it's funny at so like they were laughing and I was like the managers are like you through that shit away and they're like laughing The workers and they're like, they're like, Did nobody tell you. And usually I was like, kind of get

20
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.650
mad. I was like, oh,

21
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Man, I just

22
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.400
Misty Moncada: Paused, and I thought about it and I took it as a joke.

23
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I mean it. There's so much significance in the PAS

24
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes. So what did you think after that.

25
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.040
Misty Moncada: Um,

26
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.840
Misty Moncada: I feel better because me. I probably lost my job because I told him to fuck off.

27
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.080
Misty Moncada: And like I just, I don't think before I asked.

28
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:30.660
Misty Moncada: So after I told them that and then like when I got off work. I was like, wow, that felt really good to take something and not take it bad.

29
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

30
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.690
Misty Moncada: For me, I was a big step for me.

31
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good, good.

32
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I'm happy to hear that. So, so the pause was allowing you to not have an exaggerated emotion, but to really pause and see like okay see that perhaps they're just joking with me.

33
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.370
Misty Moncada: Yes, and she like me at first I was like okay I didn't get

34
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.880
Misty Moncada: Funding because my fish. It's not cool. But then I got to thinking like exactly what you said like costing you know

35
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.180
Misty Moncada: stop for a minute, and then I just laughed with them and I saw nobody did teaching. So, you know, I, I'm

36
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.640
Misty Moncada: That was a big step in it. Like I said, it felt really good like hours later I registered it

37
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.840
Misty Moncada: Not immediately.

38
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.840
Misty Moncada: I was still angry at the moment so I

39
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.260
Misty Moncada: Was trying to trying to get out of my head.

40
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.970
Misty Moncada: Hours later I realized that I didn't do anything. So

41
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.050
Misty Moncada: It turned out good.

42
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good. And even if you didn't notice in that moment, the fact that that cause still helps you to not

43
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Show an outward response that, like you said, kind of costume your job or major be looked at differently. It's still good. So I think that's excellent.

44
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any other moments.

45
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.360
Misty Moncada: No, I know moments. I'm kind of happy that my daughter came

46
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.650
Misty Moncada: Home and I'm she's been here since Mother's Day, and I've been like her stay in the room with her boyfriend.

47
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:06.720
Misty Moncada: She saved here. So I was really excited about that. And she's been helping with the baby a lot more. So I had my grandson, so I think

48
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.450
Misty Moncada: I was just really happy about. That's another thing.

49
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.680
Misty Moncada: Just made me feel better.

50
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.940
Misty Moncada: Yeah, I don't have much stress and anxiety right now because I'm worried about what

51
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.240
She's

52
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so you used to live with your mom and now you're in your own space right yes I'm in New Mexico.

53
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.320

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, yes.

55
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, good. Well, what feels important to discuss today during session.

56
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.750
I'm

57
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.400
Misty Moncada: Like

58
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.970
Misty Moncada: There's nothing really bothering me today. I did talk to mental health today and told him I

59
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:57.540
Misty Moncada: Was I was also very respectful about that I wasn't disrespectful. I said I would like to withdraw from mental health services because I have another therapist.

60
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:12.090
Misty Moncada: And the care coordinator was like, well, can I still stay with you meet with you and every need me. And I really liked her. So I said, Yeah, she's I just kind of concerned for you out here. So, um, I did agree to that, but I would respectfully.

61
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.960
Misty Moncada: So, um, that was a good thing, but

62
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.920
Misty Moncada: Other than that, there's nothing really bothering me. Like, I feel so content right now and I feel happy and

63
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.310
Misty Moncada: I had two days off from work. I had put in like 38 hours and six days.

64
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I personally wouldn't have crazy schedule.

80
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:54.150
Misty Moncada: I feel like things are things are gonna be able. Hey, but I just got stopped like what you said like, you know, you know, these last last we spoke to each other and you told me things about myself like

81
00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:03.480
Misty Moncada: Now I realize those, you know, so it's like now I'm kinda like, okay, I need to get into. Oh, I really want to work on that. No, no, I want to work.

82
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:13.770
Misty Moncada: On how to talk to people and I don't know how to talk to people. Right. And that's a big thing for me, too. So I've been trying to work on that, like how I speak to people or, um,

83
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.380
Misty Moncada: Doing good, though this week.

84
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good any triggers red flag thoughts, relax.

85
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.570
Misty Moncada: No, not really. I'm not really, not this week, I think, cuz I don't have it in time.

86
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:40.920
Misty Moncada: Like since I've been working. I don't have idle time on my hands. So I haven't really had time to think about it.

87
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:50.730
Misty Moncada: And then these last two days that I was off of having the kids here, it just that crossed my mind if they were you know I wouldn't do it around them so

88
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I do have a question with

89
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:04.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The New Mexico place that you were going to, you start with the therapy. But is that going to impact your because once you get a medication from a psychiatrist.

90
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.690
Misty Moncada: I was I was that like, um, I was getting anxiety meds and then they were like,

91
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:19.170
Misty Moncada: They were like telling me. Okay. I was diagnosed with bipolar and i was i have circle, but like, for me, I'm

92
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:26.820
Misty Moncada: I love the anxiety, that's going to work. Like, I still have anxiety. After last year, I've been on these methods. Last year, they don't work.

93
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:32.220
Misty Moncada: My anxiety saw you know here and there, but, um, I just thought to thinking like

94
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:40.680
Misty Moncada: Last week, how you said like policy for, I think, and I think a lot of things I did. Maybe I can be by for, I don't know. I get angry over a lot of stuff and

95
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:51.480
Misty Moncada: But if I just like you pointed out something to meet. It was kind of new to me like if I just pause and think about maybe that will not about me, it's not. I want to depend on it to the rest of my life.

96
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.670
Misty Moncada: I feel like

97
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:10.830
Misty Moncada: If it gets Dad, I feel like it's definitely care coordinator know and you know she can send me appointment immediately if it does get that, but I'm going to start. That's my goal is to kind of work on state off meds.

98
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.210
And

99
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.570
Misty Moncada: Time.

100
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:29.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's good. As long as if you notice that okay this is becoming unmanageable. And I need the additional support of the medication, you know, you still have access to that resource and she can connect you with any

101
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reports that you need. How often do you meet with that person.

102
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.020
Misty Moncada: And I have a quick tomorrow on the

103
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:50.970
Misty Moncada: Phone usually her and I used to meet at the library, show me January, she'll come to my house. She'll read Reichel comfortable so I don't have to go to the office, but she's basically here for me if I

104
00:09:52.650 --> 00:10:03.510
Misty Moncada: Need doctors appointments or I don't have a right to call safe carriers, they fry for me to get to doctors appointments. She'll give me three bus passes every week, so I can have rights to from where I need to go.

105
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:04.830
Misty Moncada: Or juice.

106
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.110
Misty Moncada: If I'm not capable of doing it, or I'm not my right mind to do it. She'll take care of it for me. So

107
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:21.570
Misty Moncada: Um, she just said she for a little while she's kind of concerned because, you know, she just wants to be there, make sure I'm okay or and I think that's kind of a good thing. But yeah, I'll meet with her every week.

108
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you think her concerns are.

109
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.030
Misty Moncada: Um,

110
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:43.980
Misty Moncada: Well, I don't know, like maybe because a lot of things I was going through and I was explaining to her. I think for the whole prone of I was saying like i into like I had relapsed I had told her I was stressed out of me. My daughter fighting so many things and

111
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.290
Misty Moncada: She probably feels like

112
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:57.330
Misty Moncada: I maybe I do need minutes, maybe, but like what you pointed out to me just made me feel like maybe if I just stop and pause up

113
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

114
00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

115
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.760
Misty Moncada: I'll work on both I'll work with you and work with her.

116
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:16.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Yes. See, you're very in tune. And I'm glad that our conversation last week sparked hoping you that, you know, I can do this. You know, I'm self sufficient. I can be able to manage my emotions.

117
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:27.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And maybe I don't need the extra support, but you also are intuitive with your body and your responses of knowing that, hey, I might need some additional support so

118
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:38.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How would you, how would you know that the therapy alone just you and i is enough in that you don't need the medicine. And then also, how would you know if hey I do need the medicine, actually.

119
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.450
Misty Moncada: And see, I don't know. I don't well

120
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.020
Misty Moncada: I'll be honest, I haven't taken like two minutes.

121
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.910
Misty Moncada: Okay, have it.

122
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.310
Misty Moncada: No, not yet. Like I'm

123
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.280
Misty Moncada: I really haven't, I haven't taken them. I just

124
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:10.800
Misty Moncada: I don't know, I just simply me like I got to thinking, I don't want to be dependent on this whole life. So I just go take, you know, one day, and I, I didn't tell her that she was just concerned that I know and

125
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:29.370
Misty Moncada: I'd be more concerned. But all I told her tomorrow that I did. I just like talking to Samantha. She wasn't very comfortable inviting feeling like you could talk to you and I will pay and that's the way it is Samantha. As for like the issue. I had with a doctor or or

126
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:45.240
Misty Moncada: how I felt about my therapist telling me with my PO I just felt like I didn't trust her even though I signed a release. You know, I, I just felt like I couldn't trust your life. How am I supposed to providing you right away you're quick to say something like that.

127
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're putting out with drew me from her. Yeah.

128
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, well I'm going to trust your instincts, you've been doing this long enough. You know what works for you. So as long as

129
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:05.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know that you have the resources available to you, whenever you need it. And you know how to access that I support you. Okay.

130
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:18.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, let me know if there's anything that I should look out for that might be a sign like Hey, let me encourage you, or my view of this reports. So how do you know when you're overly anxious

131
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's manageable for you.

132
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.320
Misty Moncada: Um,

133
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:29.070
Misty Moncada: I get like excited like pumped up like I want to start doing so many things.

134
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.690
Misty Moncada: Like when I get excited. It's like

135
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:39.060
Misty Moncada: I just want to do stuff like just out of nowhere and but then I have. I'm like, naturally just hyperactive.

136
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.380
So,

137
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.900
Misty Moncada: That's when he finds it like I will be able to sit down, I might not be ready.

138
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.090
Misty Moncada: To start a job for

139
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It and then just sleeping get impacted to

140
00:13:52.710 --> 00:14:03.600
Misty Moncada: Yes I suffer from sleep deprivation bad for anxiety I explained to the doctor helps twice about sleep deprivation and she

141
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:18.030
Misty Moncada: She will it's just pulled out a little bit longer. So the last, like I said last meeting we had she was like, well, you don't think like Suboxone like messing with you like your sauna substitute was just kind of rude. So they're finding want to see her, and you more about it.

142
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.350
Misty Moncada: You've never rude.

143
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:39.210
Misty Moncada: But like I try to explain it for like to have it and I can't sleep so um I like I'm taking the therapy to help me sleep, but lately. Since I've been working this whole week I've been really tired so soon as I get off of work. I'm tired and I'm able to sleep now. So maybe I'm just like,

144
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.900
Misty Moncada: You know, that's good for me. Yeah.

145
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:53.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But so it sounds like what you described is like a manic episodes. So the manic episodes with the bipolar disorder is when yeah it's hard for you to sleep.

146
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:04.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, you're very busy hyper active, you might do some impulsive things that you normally wouldn't do just because of the fact that you have so much energy that you want to release so

147
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's something that you'll look out for. All right.

148
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right now I'm

149
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:16.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Looking at your band survey and you haven't had much sleep issues, which is good.

150
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Low on the an hour and depression.

151
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good, yeah. It has been a good week for you craving withdrawals or attitude.

152
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:34.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it seems like the week before those that are one. So it went up a little for you this week.

153
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.550
Misty Moncada: Um, I guess it did because like I

154
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.290
Misty Moncada: Was drinking last week.

155
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:49.440
Misty Moncada: But I told you I drink. And then when I heard last week before the week before. Okay. So, whenever I came off the off the off the phone was more my drugs.

156
00:15:50.280 --> 00:16:00.990
Misty Moncada: And heroin knows a lot. I used to like to mix them a lot so dangerous. Um, well, when I come off of off the hook the cravings are unbearable for days.

157
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.330
Misty Moncada: Where I felt like

158
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.190
Misty Moncada: Felt like nervous.

159
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.880
Misty Moncada: All last week. It was just like, like I was

160
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.010
Misty Moncada: Nervous.

161
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.840
Misty Moncada: But I just kept telling myself. You don't need it. You don't need it like

162
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.490
So,

163
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:26.280
Misty Moncada: I see how it goes. I hope he remains I get because I'm scared. I'm going to open up doors to go back to that.

164
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:36.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Yeah. Have you spoken to you. I'm your primary doctor or Dr element about some of the alcohol use as well. Maybe they can offer some support.

165
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:51.210
Misty Moncada: I did talk to him about the alcohol use. I did admit that I was drinking, so he can't be down for might give me two weeks scripts to more counseling. He thought it was best night. See you every week. And so I got

166
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:57.240
Misty Moncada: So I got, you know, stable and he said, just kind of keeping an eye on me right now so

167
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:02.310
Misty Moncada: Which is OK. But he was just kind of conservative I did tell him that I didn't have a dream all week.

168
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.350
Misty Moncada: And so I was in group on Friday. So it was like a data store.

169
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.370
Misty Moncada: But I struggle with the cravings. All right, so

170
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah and

171
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:27.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The alcohol cravings will probably be more intense because alcohol is so much more accessible right and you see it everywhere. Like, you know, because it's socially acceptable and so having that recognition.

172
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:41.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Recognition that the alcohol is like that gateway for you to use heroin. So if you can just identify. Remember I talked about using that imagery sense if you identify alcohol.

173
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:47.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just like heroin not giving it a distinction, then that will help you

174
00:17:47.790 --> 00:18:00.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To not see that it's socially acceptable or give you that little inch of let me compromise because once you start the negotiation phase be addicted brain is already taking control. So if you can just imagine that all

175
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:15.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is equal to the heroin, then that perhaps can change that mindset, so that you won't have the cravings as intense and you won't use the alcohol, which then turns into the

176
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That makes sense.

177
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.630
Misty Moncada: Yes, yes.

178
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:34.530
Misty Moncada: Yes, it does make sense. And it's a big trigger for me because when I started drinking right away. I like my whole thing was mixing the alcohol and the heroin together and and getting that effect like that was messed up a bit. So once I started

179
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:36.960
Misty Moncada: Out, you know,

180
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.580
And so

181
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:47.160
Misty Moncada: Yeah, I really got to work out soon. I haven't relapsed on heroin, but I'm scared a little

182
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:58.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes. So tell me what has been helpful for you this week. What was your coping fat whenever you had those cravings. What did you tell yourself.

183
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:10.470
Misty Moncada: I was like, I have a job. Oh, I didn't tell you this Mother's Day. My dad came to visit me

184
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.230
Misty Moncada: Give me just drugs.

185
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:31.650
Misty Moncada: Okay, well I didn't tell you I did there was an engineer. Okay. So he comes in the house, and it comes to visit me from Texas, really excited. Kids are here and stuff and he pulls out his neck bowl and it's like, and I get this in here. And I was like, no.

186
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:40.620
Misty Moncada: It's not like, no, I got this House for me in the baby and like I don't want to smell in here and you know

187
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.770
Misty Moncada: Now that yes on Sunday. I told him.

188
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.070
No.

189
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Feel

190
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.560
Misty Moncada: It felt good, because like

191
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.360
Misty Moncada: He was like a serious

192
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.350
Misty Moncada: I made me on their phone call him I was

193
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.990
Misty Moncada: I was just like a really proud of myself because I was able to say like

194
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.190
Misty Moncada: He's

195
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.010
Misty Moncada: He tried to offer me something. I was like, I don't

196
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.660
Misty Moncada: Know,

197
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:17.250
Misty Moncada: So that was a big step for me. But then again, that wasn't my choice of drug, but it was a big step. And it was a good feeling decide

198
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:27.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, yes, that is definitely a milestone to celebrate because even though it's not your drug of choice. You know that typically

199
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's replacement Ross can't get access to your drug of

200
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:37.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Choice in something else. So the fact that you are able to say no increase that hard boundary

201
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:38.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's good.

202
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

203
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.680
Misty Moncada: Yeah, I'm really hoping I say

204
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.810
Misty Moncada: Yeah.

205
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was that he broke up.

206
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.570
Misty Moncada: I know I'm listening to the coconut

207
00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:04.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know the copy of I have a job and then also attachment with the distraction that you mentioned men been so busy so that that helps because

208
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:15.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What you did in that quick moment of him offering you the money and you probably didn't realize it is that you thought of, like, in the past, probably what you would have done.

209
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:23.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so that's your old coping strategy, you probably thought, well, you know, a few weeks ago I did it say no, I didn't create this foundry.

210
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:35.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then what happened was I relaxed. I felt terrible after the fact. And then I had to give these disclosures to the doctors and therapists, I had to do this and it's like I had to start all over again. So

211
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.930
Misty Moncada: Yeah, that is one thing. And then another thing.

212
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.590
Misty Moncada: I work so hard to get like this House and get a job like if I do that, I'm not going to have a job right.

213
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.080
Misty Moncada: Now another thing that I

214
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.160
Misty Moncada: Immediately thought

215
00:21:51.840 --> 00:22:00.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. So this is what you did you created without even knowing intentionally you develop your coping strategy.

216
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:17.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, you were able to assess very quickly what the consequences consequences are. When you relax and then identify what are the positive outcomes you choose not to use. And so in bed. No.

217
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: right quick.

218
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Analysis. That's what you did.

219
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And because I think

220
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A better place this week.

221
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.300
Misty Moncada: Right.

222
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:39.090
Misty Moncada: And I felt like it was just a big step for me to and then also working like I know that I'm tired. So I don't have a lot of time to think about things.

223
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:51.900
Misty Moncada: Like that I kind of like that right now. Like I like knowing that, like, I'll be ready to wake up at three in the morning and I'm already ready. I got my work clothes ready. Um, I know once I get home. I'm tired. I'm exhausted.

224
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.870
Misty Moncada: And I just want to sleep or rest so

225
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.040
Misty Moncada: You know, it's just

226
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.460
Misty Moncada: I think it's be having a job sleeping at home.

227
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:13.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, good. So identifying that the job is really part of your coping strategy that the pause effect is just want to be very key to managing the emotions.

228
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:29.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I would say that the parallel of you identifying the power of the pause and really recognizing okay let me look at this all the way around and not just with filtered lens helps you to make that wise choice to say no.

229
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:40.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is like so simple, like I said last week of just pause it sounds very simple but it's so powerful. The know it's a simple word but yes so powerful.

230
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:54.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's why, whenever we start if you notice, x you like what are small victories. What are those things because sometimes we're just going through the motions and we're not realizing the small things that we're doing really very significant.

231
00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:11.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I want to assist you with more skills on how to set boundaries because it may become harder and harder because you still have attachments to people that are in an active addiction.

232
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:25.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And because they have CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO YOU WITH PEOPLE DO LOVE you might find yourself having to say no more often until you're able to find a way to just distance yourself all together.

233
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:35.250
Misty Moncada: Right. And usually, I'm the kind of person like my teacher. Oh, like I would hear that you do it, and I just don't care to go ahead, but for me.

234
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:47.010
Misty Moncada: I know it sticks on walls. I know that I got this place for me. My grandson, and he plays a lot and I don't want him to have that in plus is in the house like that really

235
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:56.430
Misty Moncada: pissed me off, but at the same time, I didn't get angry about it. I didn't yell at him. I just said, No, you cannot. Like, I worked hard to get. And so that was a big

236
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:12.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Smile.

237
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.310
Take that immediately back into school because they use their

238
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:42.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is the belief that a boundary is telling the other person what they need to do. So let's take a better look at how to set boundaries in a way that actually works.

239
00:25:50.730 --> 00:26:00.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: setting boundaries is about taking action within your realm of control if you're trying to change another person you're focusing on changing something that you have no power over

240
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:10.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It creates a sense of powerlessness, and I think that's why a lot of people feel frustrated about boundaries. For example, you can't talk to me that way. I mean,

241
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:19.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that true, I mean of course they can talk to you that way. Now there might be consequences for them doing it, but they can talk to you that way.

242
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:33.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A real boundary is saying what you're going to do in response to their behaviors. Let's use an example from my treatment center experience. So I once had this client who arrived in treatment and for three days. She didn't talk

243
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:41.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Eat were take her medicine. Now, after a couple days we were all feeling pretty worried and the staff came to our weekly meeting.

244
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:48.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Basically, you know, in a panics and you have to do something you have to make her eat now. What were our options right

245
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:54.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We couldn't force food into her mouth and move her jaw up and down like that's not going to do anything.

246
00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:04.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We could threaten her say if you don't eat. Then we're going to punish you later. Or if you don't eat bad things are going to happen to you. Where are other options.

247
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:10.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We could throw a little fit, you know, I could scream and yell make a big scene about it.

248
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:22.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But again, she would always have that that choice of whether or not she eats. Now, the more anxious, we get, the more likely we're going to be doing things that aren't intentional and try to be more and more forceful

249
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:31.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the problem with that is if the deeper problem with most people has nothing to do with the surface behavior. It's a deeper problem is about anxiety for

250
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:40.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: self worth than the harder we force the bigger the problem is going to be so with this client. She was feeling really scared and looking for some control in her environment.

251
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:52.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the more we forced it upon her, the less likely she was going to be able to resolve that need for safety and self control. Now remember all these different options that we could talk about in that staff meeting.

252
00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:00.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're probably going to make the problem worse. Why is that, well, the more we push on someone else, the more they're going to push back.

253
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:13.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The harder we try and make our child to do something, the less likely they're going to want to do that on their own in the future. Now, I'm not saying that we just give up and let our kid or our employees do whatever they want.

254
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:24.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. Research shows that loss, a fair parenting meaning just kind of letting kids run themselves is just as harmful for kids as authoritarian harsh parenting.

255
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The type of parenting that creates the best results is high love high boundaries so you have high expectations.

256
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:41.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you're also fostering that in this environment of love and support. So how do we set boundaries. If we are focusing on telling someone else what they need to do boundaries are about saying what you will do

257
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:52.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So they often involve an if then statement. Like if you don't eat your food, then you can't have ice cream later I'm not necessarily saying that this is the only approach or the best approach.

258
00:28:53.310 --> 00:29:05.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To the not eating the situation, but it is the basic idea behind it is we have to think of boundaries as being about saying what we are going to do and the action. We are going to take in response to a situation

259
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:13.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And part of this is just acknowledging that everyone around us has their own agency, they have the ability to choose what kind of decisions, they're going to make

260
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:21.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And trying to force them to change is going to backfire. When adults interact and try to set boundaries. They often try to convince someone else debate with them.

261
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:28.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or change how that person is treating them perhaps they demanded that the other person treat them differently.

262
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:38.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Regardless of the exact approach, all of these different styles are attempts to getting the other person to change, which creates a powerless feeling for the person who's trying to set that boundary. So

263
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's talk about a few steps to setting good healthy assertive boundaries. This topic is continued in the next video how to set boundaries part to

264
00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:55.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Check it out to hear what happened with my client and learn specific steps to setting boundaries in different situations. I hope this was helpful. Thanks for watching, and take care

265
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:00.720
Misty Moncada: Because

266
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:10.560
Misty Moncada: Remember how like last week and I told you that my when I got angry because my therapist is like, Okay, did you did your P O know about this and I got angry because I was like

267
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:17.520
Misty Moncada: Did she tell me yes but I like Texas is like you're going to say what they want to see, they could do it. They want to do you know they're gonna do it.

268
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:18.780
Misty Moncada: And change that.

269
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:30.720
Misty Moncada: I guess it's just how I react to situations. I need to learn how to do that because i don't think i i mean i did not know how to learn. I don't know how to react to certain situations. I just blow up.

270
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:39.900
Misty Moncada: So that's what that pause comes in, but I really like that because I feel like putting the pause and that together really helped me

271
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:53.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The past allows them to realize okay because what what we've noticed in on the pattern is that when you feel the lack of control. That's when

272
00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:06.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's when you usually go off. That's when the emotions are unregulated and you get an intense response. So when misty pauses, she is able to exert internal control.

273
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:25.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what we want to focus on is not seeing how powerful we look to people on the outside right of letting the setting the tone that people know they can't try you, but inside having that internal control that misty is powerful enough to about her emotions.

274
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:34.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She's probably not powerful enough to even be vulnerable and so in the upbringing, that you have in the trauma that you experience.

275
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:45.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: BEING VULNERABLE was not phrase, it is something that's look back as a weakness. And so what I heard about the situation that happened that work is and people were laughing

276
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:57.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was almost like you were getting upset, but maybe some tinge of embarrassment that are they making fun of me. I'll be laughing at me or are we just, we're going to laugh together.

277
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:12.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so when you were able to pause you were able to see that. Okay. This isn't about me. This isn't them trying to make fun of me and then even the follow up statement that you share with them to say, you know what, no they didn't tell me that

278
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's allowing yourself to say, hey, this is something that I did not know.

279
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:27.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so it's allow yourself the grace to realize I, how could I have possibly know and so that takes down your defense.

280
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:38.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your defense is so strong, because of the trauma and being incarcerated and dealing with drug dealers and the violence, you had to be an accent so people know, not for trying

281
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:52.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To show makeup. Don't take work nicely, but you're already doing the work you're already doing a good job with just that simple. Pause and the power of your know to your eggs.

282
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.760
Misty Moncada: Yes, thank you. And that's

283
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.200
Misty Moncada: Probably my my care provider Mitchell.

284
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:13.230
Misty Moncada: Airport eaters concerned about is because I have there's sometimes I get to teach life feelings were all like want to stay in the house and knock him out for days and I know she was concerned about that.

285
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:23.850
Misty Moncada: Concern and that doesn't happen a lot, but when it does, I don't care about me. Like, I don't care. Like, I will make an appointment I will talk to anybody. I will isolate myself, my mother and my kids anybody

286
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.940
Misty Moncada: And I explained that to her. So I think that was what

287
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.920
Misty Moncada: I did. That's one of her main concerns.

288
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:29.970
Misty Moncada: You know,

289
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.470
Misty Moncada: She said, if that ever happened for me to just contact her and like

290
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.300
Misty Moncada: She, you know, just at least call her text her, let her know she'll do the best to talk me out of that.

291
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.070
Misty Moncada: So I don't have those feelings.

292
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:43.800
Misty Moncada: And and

293
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We come what's going on with that.

294
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.650
Misty Moncada: That I still can't recognize because I was told that there has to be some type

295
00:33:52.650 --> 00:34:05.250
Misty Moncada: Of trigger that causes that and for me I kept telling it like I've been doing this since I got out of prison and sweet teen and like I still can't tell which are which right now. She even

296
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:15.420
Misty Moncada: Clarify what's bothering me at that moment, but I just know that when I get like that i don't i don't care about in my phone good reading my

297
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.160
Misty Moncada: My mother could be calling me worried

298
00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:32.340
Misty Moncada: Sick. It's text me I will ignore anybody and I will isolate myself like you know just isolation and like I need to figure that out. I need to figure out an answer. I think that little journal that you told me to keep up my feeling or no libretto

299
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.340
Misty Moncada: You told me about my feelings with the chart. You know, I need to recognize that I have

300
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:39.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Certain days that

301
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:43.770
Misty Moncada: I need to focus on that because I'm trying to figure out, I want to know what causes that

302
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:58.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. And because of your diagnosis with the bipolar. It's from one one extreme to the next. So you go from just, you know, depression, wanted to isolate not be around anyone

303
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:14.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To hyper after social engaging and so make sense of that will be confusing as, like, what exactly is my trigger. So yeah, the journal and emotion chart to be good for you to keep that journalists keep track of exactly what is going on. I

304
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was gonna ask you something.

305
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:21.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My mind.

306
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

307
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:39.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, I would call, um, because I remember I did your bio psychosocial but that was so long ago. So in those moments where you are the press and isolate. Are there any thoughts of wanting to harm yourself or harm anyone else.

308
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:49.800
Misty Moncada: No, not myself but there's times that I've got really angry and I'm just like, oh, like, like my anger on my boss like this person or

309
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.150
Misty Moncada: This person or whatever.

310
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.740
Misty Moncada: But I have not acted out on those, like, like in the past when I used to think

311
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.410
Misty Moncada: And act on immediately. Yeah.

312
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.090
Misty Moncada: I haven't acted out

313
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.060
Misty Moncada: Or hit anybody since last year.

314
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.310
Misty Moncada: Like I have

315
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.540
Misty Moncada: I've got a theory.

316
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:12.270
Misty Moncada: That haven't yet hitting but always I fought with my daughter and I hit her. I was mad.

317
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: At him and that was maybe like last month right

318
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.440
Misty Moncada: Yeah. Yes.

319
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would I have with

320
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:24.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Go ahead.

321
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.800
Misty Moncada: No, no, not unless the job was done.

322
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, I said, that's, that's why I was thinking out

323
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:51.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the boundaries, watch the video with her with your daughter being there now thinking of what boundaries and you're going to put in place to help keep that relationship healthy. So remember we talked about high love and high boundaries.

324
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.920
Misty Moncada: Yes, I told her that

325
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.940
Misty Moncada: There's going to be roles. You know, I told her if this is

326
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going to be rules in this House.

327
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:08.490
Misty Moncada: If I'm doing everything I can to become better and I expect you know and

328
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.010
Misty Moncada: I hope that those rules remain

329
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:11.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

330
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.370
Misty Moncada: It when I go to work. I hope you're still intact.

331
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:14.940
Misty Moncada: You know,

332
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:20.220
Misty Moncada: Because I've not. I know that I'm gonna get angry about it, but at the same time, I think I feel happy.

333
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.330
Misty Moncada: She's okay and I'm not stressing

334
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:37.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But you use that powerful statement, you know, if I'm working on myself and my sobriety, then these are my expectations.

335
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:44.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Remember the video highlight those if then statements are kind of like that template of how you set your boundaries.

336
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:56.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But there's a situation that's occurring, and I don't necessarily know how you want to communicate that this is a no for you to start off with if if fill in the blank, then

337
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:10.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This will happen. So you're already saying if this occurs, this will be the consequence, so that there's no negotiating in that, but right are you know you are strong person so you won't have any issues with that.

338
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:29.700
Misty Moncada: I hope not, because, like, like I said, you know, there's some days I'll just alternate you like misty all over again. The oldest like I'm trying to work on that. Like, I really, that is my main focus like right now the thing for me because if I can change.

339
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.800
Misty Moncada: That then I'm not going to change and

340
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:46.290
Misty Moncada: So a lot of things that I did like this, you know, now you don't see no are seeing risk losing everything I just felt good, because I never said that before. I've never, I was just like a lot of like I've had jobs and

341
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.030
Misty Moncada: You know I never cared, and now

342
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:52.560
Misty Moncada: I didn't even notice about it.

343
00:38:52.590 --> 00:39:00.690
Misty Moncada: I was just like, No, I don't. I don't want you and I wasn't like. Usually I get that and talk crap I didn't see him. Ideally,

344
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:13.410
Misty Moncada: owe it to myself like I need this. And so to me, that was a big step not raising my voice.

345
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:29.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, it's, um, lots of work, but I know this is something that you really want to work on. So you've already identified that this is your goal.

346
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:40.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so you already identified some of the steps that will take to get to that call right to say staying busy with work reaching out to the support the to identify me the

347
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:51.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The case manager that you're working with. What about within your family who are some supports that will hold you accountable and that you can kind of bounce thoughts off and ideas with

348
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:55.860
Misty Moncada: Right now.

349
00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:00.720
Misty Moncada: Um, I mean, my mom can be like, I expect my mom what happened the other day.

350
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:11.700
Misty Moncada: And my mom was like, oh, run and start the ship, but my mom, she can be supportive of me, but she can also be not and right away as soon something

351
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.340
Misty Moncada: So therefore, like, and then

352
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:15.210
Misty Moncada: My son.

353
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:27.360
Misty Moncada: My son always some up to no good. So right now I think stepping away from my family right now okay because it's always judgment.

354
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.860
Misty Moncada: Like, well, not always.

355
00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Layton.

356
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:31.170
It's been judgments.

357
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.390
Misty Moncada: Show.

358
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.540
Misty Moncada: I don't know, maybe just my therapy right now.

359
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:57.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so, and then the last from the spiritual component because you had you were doing really well at the church, but now there's been a conflict in that dynamic. So have you. Are you still going to that.

360
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:01.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Church and become a new church, what has been the replacement for that.

361
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:13.140
Misty Moncada: No, I haven't. And I won't lie like I really missed her, but I really want all the pastor of my church, friend.

362
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:18.510
Misty Moncada: He came on here the other day, he was like a pasture ecology, the pastor probably night or the phone call.

363
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:31.950
Misty Moncada: And like I shouldn't have because I really good saturates I pastors, a great pasture. So when my friend. He was like, maybe you just need to have a one on one with pastor, not his wife will sit tight to explain what's going on.

364
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:43.380
Misty Moncada: What's bothering you. So I think like the next day that I have some free time, I'm going to do that because I really enjoyed me being an artist.

365
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:54.480
Misty Moncada: Let you know and and I was helping to celebrate with every, every Monday night, and I was I was helping in the kitchen. I'm serving the meal, helping them in the kitchen. After

366
00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.770
Misty Moncada: Every meal.

367
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.030
Misty Moncada: And so like

368
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:05.430
Misty Moncada: Yeah, I was doing every Monday. Then, after all this happen. I just didn't want to church and like I shouldn't allow things to take

369
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:17.250
Misty Moncada: Away from me. And I do that a lot, like all i sabotage good things in my life, all the time. I'm like, Oh, forget you. I don't care, you know. And so for me, like, I shouldn't allow that I

370
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:25.230
Misty Moncada: Don't need that. I need to be like, Okay, you know, I'm working on you. Whenever not not peaceful for today.

371
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.310
Misty Moncada: But I'm working on that.

372
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, because

373
00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:42.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You are. But I'm really happy that you identified like that that process of self sabotage because that's why I say, Okay, what's the replacement, because if you look at it.

374
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:49.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right. Right now you have that the external support the therapy. The case manager.

375
00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:59.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Family right now is conflict. They're not supportive. So that's, that's an internal support that's taken away, you have a support of the church, and it's gone.

376
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:08.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So finding that replacement because then what happens over time is you isolate yourself and then you're in that room that space that you

377
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:18.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Said, where people are calling don't want to put the phone at the care less. Because over course of time, all of those support have already been going away.

378
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:33.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there's been no replacement so you become a customer to just being alone and not having anyone. And what that does is that triggers the depressive state the isolation and the addicted brain thrives on isolation. It thrives on feeling

379
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:45.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. There's no one that understands you there's no one that can help you. And then the addicted brain convinces you that heroin alcohol, whatever the drug is is that resource for you.

380
00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:58.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's why would I talk about the support so much because the alcohol. The drugs, they all serve a function as a support for you when others are lacking.

381
00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:04.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even if it's not this church because I understand the offense, the pastor's wife was

382
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:21.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: out of line with what she did, you know, if that's not a source that you want to go back into, you know, find another one. But if you feel like, and that's what we talked about last week. If you feel like there's a way to amend this situation and and restore it the value

383
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.530
Misty Moncada: Chain.

384
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How does that conversation look like

385
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.230
Yeah.

386
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.920
Misty Moncada: I think it'll be okay with you can

387
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.520
Misty Moncada: See, he's a very good man. He is a very wise.

388
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:55.050
Misty Moncada: Like I really, really enjoyed in church and everything. It's just, um, I noticed a lot of

389
00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:12.570
Misty Moncada: Laws within his life. Like, I'm not saying I'm perfect. But at least I don't hide my laws like for me. I just kind of felt like, wow, but you're just messed up as I am, you know I'm saying like it and and she tries to hide it from her husband, like your pastor's wife.

390
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.890
Misty Moncada: Like what I should have like one of my old friends stay there and like

391
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:29.190
Misty Moncada: She stole like an X Box. For some people they try to help out a lot of people. And so she calls me late at night. She's like, don't have this conversation with you, would you know where to find

392
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.350
Misty Moncada: Like

393
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:33.450
Misty Moncada: Make you know she just

394
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:39.390
Misty Moncada: There's just some things that she does. It's just not, I don't agree with but I don't want to be her husband.

395
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:52.050
Misty Moncada: So that's what kind of pushed me away more tools like like I see a lot of things in user dark to, you know, and I like but I mean not everybody's perfect. I'm not trying to be

396
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Judgmental with your been

397
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.370
Misty Moncada: I just don't feel comfortable speaking

398
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:01.680
Misty Moncada: In other words, like I don't feel comfortable because I see two sides of her I

399
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:10.560
Misty Moncada: I feel comfortable talking to her husband and I never had a one on one pastor, but my friend Sean was like, maybe you need to because

400
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:31.680
Misty Moncada: He said that he was having issues one time and he will talk to him. He said he kept himself never spoke of it. So a shuttle is like if you speak to him. It'll probably happen to you. So I think I'm and I'm over the I'm over the anger, like I'm not angry anymore over it. I'm not frustrated

401
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.440
I just

402
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:42.240
Misty Moncada: I think I'm ready to talk to you. I just got to find a day off. So I have a maybe a one on one.

403
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:55.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, no, prepare yourself if there's a face to face encounter with the pastors. Why do you feel that you're able to manage that. So won't be a trigger and anger trigger for you.

404
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:58.560
Misty Moncada: Well, yeah.

405
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:01.320
Misty Moncada: Like I don't

406
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.400
Misty Moncada: make it worse. But like

407
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.280
Misty Moncada: I just don't look

408
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.380
Misty Moncada: Like

409
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.530
Misty Moncada: And I got nobody to judge, but like

410
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:21.060
Misty Moncada: I just don't act like you're two different people like okay one minute you're you try again where you sit in that crap.

411
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:28.890
Misty Moncada: And so, but it's not my place to St. Lucia. I'll see how it goes. I mean,

412
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.010
Misty Moncada: I don't, I can't honestly say how I'm going to feel

413
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:36.960
Misty Moncada: I haven't been biker but like when I see her. I guess I'll see how I feel.

414
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

415
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:50.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm just, I'm just concerned because it's inevitable, like you said, She's the pastor's wife. So, opening up and being open to the possibility of returning back to the church means

416
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:58.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really doing the work to get those emotions together and being in that place of forgiveness and realizing on the dark side that I saw.

417
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:14.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I see that I know everyone has that dark side. I happen to be exposed and witness her dark side. So how do I move forward with this. How do I make this about my school to journey and kind of separate from what her her journey was

418
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.120
Misty Moncada: Yes, yes, what exactly I was thinking

419
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:28.860
Misty Moncada: I was like, I like like I explained, I cannot allow people out of that power, where I allow people to take something or they do something and I take it for myself because I open my mouth.

420
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:43.080
Misty Moncada: And I don't take the I take it for myself because I allow them to control my emotions. I need to stop allowing that because I do a lot. I'll be like, Oh, let me just stop. I need to learn that. Okay, you know what I will do the song.

421
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:51.090
Misty Moncada: You know, or, you know, just I need to. I need really need to learn on that pause and just kind of like, okay, whatever, like do you

422
00:48:52.530 --> 00:49:01.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Yeah, good. So now, now we're adding on our next level we're working on the pause. We're still doing that next week.

423
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:09.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But after that pause. I want you to come up with a self affirming STATEMENT LIKE YOU JUST SAID, YOU KNOW YOU'LL reflect this day.

424
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:16.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They do them. I'm going to do me. Maybe that's your opening statement or whatever it is, I want you to use that in context.

425
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:29.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Throughout the week so that we can continue to build that foundation and that platform for misty to get to that goal of developing these communication skills, but even in situations that trigger anger out of misty

426
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:47.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She does not just allow it to come through flowing out her mouth, she pauses reflects and uses a firman statement so that she can feel make a negative situation not yield a negative outcome for her. Okay. Yes, that's what that's what we're working on for next week.

427
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.480
Okay.

428
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:55.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's see. Want to keep the same damn time

429
00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.060
Misty Moncada: Sure, sure.

430
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:01.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes.

431
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:11.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, I'll see you. Take care.

432
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.100
Misty Moncada: Thank you just have a good night.
