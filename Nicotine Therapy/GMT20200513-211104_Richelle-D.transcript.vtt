00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.759
Crystal Gatwood: Hello.

2
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.390
Crystal Gatwood: Can you hear me okay

3
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.410
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I said, boy, she has saved by the bell, because I'm like, I know she

4
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.550
Richelle Direny: Said 510

5
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.900
Richelle Direny: And then I'm like,

6
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.910
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, I've actually been in the waiting room. So it's like 503

7
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.720
Crystal Gatwood: Well, really. Okay. I apologize.

8
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.670
Richelle Direny: Um, so

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.410
Richelle Direny: This is a good point. Then a time, I should say, to kind of stress this point so

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.290
Richelle Direny: I know that it's been, I know it's been a while since we've had our individual I know you've been to we've seen each other groups, a few times.

11
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.620
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and I know your signal is not always the greatest but

12
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.960
Crystal Gatwood: I'm hoping I got that six

13
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.230
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, so one of the things that

14
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:22.470
Richelle Direny: From, from an agency standpoint, um, they are the rules. Kind of have always been there but they're becoming a little bit more stricter in terms of like social policy and they're checking policy and every

15
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.920
Crystal Gatwood: Staff

16
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.060
Richelle Direny: I wouldn't say

17
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.160
Crystal Gatwood: That I'm gonna be kicked out.

18
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.860
Richelle Direny: No no no no no you not kicked out. But, um, they're kind of probably

19
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.110
Crystal Gatwood: cringe or something. Yeah.

20
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.140
Richelle Direny: No, no, not kicked out not suspended.

21
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.650
Crystal Gatwood: I know

22
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.270
Crystal Gatwood: Me Down or something, make me like every week and so

23
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.980
Richelle Direny: With your scripts.

24
00:01:44.100 --> 00:02:02.610
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, they're going to cut that they'll cut that back yes so and i and i think you know trying to help that process, not to happen or not process trying to assist you know the people, the patient that I work with, to not let that happen or not let it affect you.

25
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.830
Richelle Direny: I'm just kind of doing my part.

26
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.460
Richelle Direny: We get a reading stress to the point delivering on the point is that if you can

27
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:23.880
Richelle Direny: Check in early so like you have the appointment today at four, so like the minute I send you the text and I said you know your appointment is at five, six, whatever time

28
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.570
Richelle Direny: On to virtual clinic and just go ahead and check in and they'll give you the number. Oh, you

29
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.330
Richelle Direny: Have for me. You could get the number early

30
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.380
Crystal Gatwood: I did not know.

31
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.350
Richelle Direny: Yes, you could get the number early all you would have to do at your appointment time at that point we'll

32
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.760
Crystal Gatwood: Just

33
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.360
Richelle Direny: Okay, for groups.

34
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.180
Richelle Direny: You may not, you're not going to get the number

35
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.610
Richelle Direny: Early but still check in.

36
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.710
Richelle Direny: Because what they will do is send you the message, the weather by phone number by email, whatever they will send you the number

37
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:14.970
Richelle Direny: So once you get that number. All you have to do is just come straight to the group. You don't have to go through that long process because like right now, what's happening, what's happening right now is that I don't know your central time or Eastern time, right, is it 528 where you are.

38
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.830
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay.

39
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.270
Richelle Direny: What's happening right now.

40
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.280
Richelle Direny: A flood of patients are coming into the

41
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.640
Virtual

42
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.170
Crystal Gatwood: Right.

43
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.670
Richelle Direny: groups and individual. So then you're in a long line waiting

44
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:41.760
Richelle Direny: So if you check in early then you won't have to be. You don't have to deal with that because if you have to do a a whatever it is that have, you have to do, you wouldn't have to worry about that. At that time, because you

45
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.480
Crystal Gatwood: have room for I usually do like my normal group is tomorrow at

46
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.430
Crystal Gatwood: Noon.

47
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.150
Crystal Gatwood: But I usually do my little survey thing. I started at like 11

48
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.560
Crystal Gatwood: And then

49
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.050
Crystal Gatwood: I check in and I wait. Sometimes all that time, you know, half hour 40 minutes sometimes

50
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.480
Richelle Direny: Yeah, good.

51
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
Crystal Gatwood: Number until I get the survey done. Mm hmm.

52
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.050
Crystal Gatwood: But you said they send you the number

53
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:25.410
Richelle Direny: If you check in early. So if you so maybe at 11 o'clock when you're doing it, you know, maybe because they're different times that a lot of groups are going on.

54
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.980
Richelle Direny: Totally probably one of those times, and a lot of any if you've come to our 12 O'clock group, you can you see how full that group gets

55
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.460
Richelle Direny: So there's three people in our group think about 20 people is in line.

56
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.740
Richelle Direny: And that's what slows down the process. So if to let's say tomorrow in the morning, you get up 910 o'clock and you

57
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.510
Richelle Direny: At 910 o'clock you call in, you're getting all of that out of the way.

58
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.590
Richelle Direny: As I thought at 1130 when the number becomes available. They're sending it to you.

59
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.410
Crystal Gatwood: So they sent a text message. I've never gotten a text message.

60
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.620
Richelle Direny: Either a text or email, how, how do they communicate with you.

61
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.020
Crystal Gatwood: Normally text.

62
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:22.800
Richelle Direny: Well, you remember, you also change your number. And I did go in and I did update your phone number because I remember us you usually sit know email because I know that you had been trying to get in contact with me and you sent Jamie an email.

63
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.100
Richelle Direny: And then you send that email you sent your new number

64
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.400
Richelle Direny: So I went in your number was updated so maybe they'll send it through text. I don't know how they send it if

65
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.620
Crystal Gatwood: At this time this week, they might. Yeah.

66
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:44.220
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So I would suggest, like if you know if you're up by 910 o'clock, just call it call in and just say you're checking in, for your group your noon group.

67
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:54.330
Richelle Direny: And then they'll you take care of whatever survey, whatever it is that you need to take care of. You'll do it that early and then just come to group of 12 Bill. Bill send you the number you just come up with one

68
00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.550
Crystal Gatwood: Is that group still like getting getting really full or has some people went to the Monday or

69
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.360
Richelle Direny: So, so I thought like a large

70
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.110
Richelle Direny: Number of people come to the Monday and they didn't

71
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.890
Crystal Gatwood: So I guess Monday, that's fine. All I just

72
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.130
Crystal Gatwood: Do

73
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.090
Richelle Direny: A lot of people come to the 12 into the six

74
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.620
Richelle Direny: Because that's been the consistent group for a while now.

75
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:23.280
Richelle Direny: Right.

76
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.500
Richelle Direny: Now we just started the Monday group this past Monday and a whole lot of people didn't come to that group.

77
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.330
Richelle Direny: And so they kind of wipe it

78
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.320
Really

79
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.410
Richelle Direny: That group is at 12

80
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.030
Richelle Direny: But they liked it because it's like there's not enough. There's not a lot of people. I love it. But then

81
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.060
Richelle Direny: You know, um, yeah. Not a lot of people come to that group.

82
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.420
Richelle Direny: Well, given that it's the first group. I'm going to be that's

83
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.510
Richelle Direny: Given that given them the benefit of to that.

84
00:06:49.080 --> 00:07:07.110
Richelle Direny: First group. Yeah. A lot of people didn't show. So, which is fine. But yeah, if it's better for you. But this is the thing. Crystal, you have to be consistent with the groups now they want a minimum of twice a month. So how does doctor or miss Austin fill your medicine medication.

85
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.670
Crystal Gatwood: Every two weeks.

86
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.350
Richelle Direny: Are you on a two week attendance for group.

87
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.570
Crystal Gatwood: Was that

88
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.360
Richelle Direny: Do you come to group every two weeks. Are you coming weekly

89
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.650
Crystal Gatwood: I don't Wednesday.

90
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:30.870
Richelle Direny: Okay, so if you're coming weekly then um yeah so if you now if you switch to the Monday groups, she will have to kind of work to adjust it so you get it. Every Monday.

91
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:42.990
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah okay some for somehow some reason like even when she like on my Thursday group and she sends it over, but

92
00:07:43.800 --> 00:08:00.390
Crystal Gatwood: When they switched me pharmacies, for some reason this pharmacy is like a little bit different on how they distribute or do their Suboxone, I don't know, but I do. I can't even get them filled until it's normally like Friday or Saturday. It really depends on pharmacist, I swear.

93
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:03.990
Richelle Direny: I'm

94
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.690
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I, you know,

95
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.240
Richelle Direny: Some people were having

96
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.940
Richelle Direny: Some people were having issues with their

97
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.770
Richelle Direny: With the pharmacy. Do you, where do you go to get your menstrual

98
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:24.420
Crystal Gatwood: I go to the Kroger, and you Lexington, which I live right beside the north side pharmacy.

99
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:38.640
Crystal Gatwood: And I guess like it was all good. At first, and then I guess one day they were like, um, what other pharmacy, would you want to go to, because we've been having trouble. And I'm like, oh, okay.

100
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.870
Crystal Gatwood: Oh, I had to go to them pharmacy.

101
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:45.780
Richelle Direny: Well,

102
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:54.960
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so like I mean if you're having issues and you need to get switched or what have you. Because if you can't get in out in contact with Natalie, you can always just do

103
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.170
What

104
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.820
Crystal Gatwood: I know

105
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.140
Crystal Gatwood: Somebody else like a girlfriend of mine.

106
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:13.260
Crystal Gatwood: I got her on to this program as well and and she loves it and everything. And we live in the same town. She goes, the north side pharmacy as well. And she has no problem.

107
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.710
Crystal Gatwood: With the head

108
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.230
Crystal Gatwood: So I'm going to ask

109
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.880
Crystal Gatwood: You to do. I asked, Natalie.

110
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.380
Richelle Direny: You're going to ask Natalie, or if you when you're in virtual clinic, you could speak to Daniel

111
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:26.940
Crystal Gatwood: Okay.

112
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think, I think. Yeah.

113
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.850
Richelle Direny: Feels the scripts to, I think, yeah, that's part of her role.

114
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.660
Crystal Gatwood: Okay, because I don't have a car right now. So less than 10 is highlight. I don't know 10 miles away.

115
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.860
Crystal Gatwood: Whereas I

116
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.290
Crystal Gatwood: Walk to North side. You know what I mean.

117
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:52.170
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Yeah. Don't talk to them and see. But, you know, I've see I've heard some people getting their medications delivered

118
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.120
Crystal Gatwood: Really

119
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.090
Richelle Direny: Are being I don't know where they are, but I don't

120
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:05.340
Crystal Gatwood: See it depends on the pharmacy some pharmacies do deliver on your site is one of them. But Kroger's unfortunately is not

121
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.360
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah, and they're not going to live with their red cross the street right

122
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.940
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, there's no sense in it.

123
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.490
Crystal Gatwood: Live from him.

124
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.690
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. I think there's some pharmacies that

125
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:28.020
Richelle Direny: Deliver so but yeah just just just if whatever issues you're having, you can definitely either, whether it's you speak to Natalie, or you speak to Danielle.

126
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:35.370
Richelle Direny: Just kind of share whatever the issues you're having and seeing how they can best work with you to help you along with the process. Okay.

127
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.550
Richelle Direny: But it's been a while. First though,

128
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.990
Crystal Gatwood: I know

129
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:47.130
Richelle Direny: How is everything going even with the little one that are little I'm the one that shows his face and says, hey,

130
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.380
Crystal Gatwood: Yes.

131
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.200
Crystal Gatwood: Things are going, Okay, I just ran into some

132
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.770
Crystal Gatwood: very surprising things over the weekend.

133
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.980
Crystal Gatwood: Which is not not good. Really, so

134
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.660
Richelle Direny: So what happened was, with

135
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.810
The so

136
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.960
Crystal Gatwood: The tires on my car really bad and

137
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.120
Crystal Gatwood: MY SON'S FATHER WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW,

138
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:38.910
Crystal Gatwood: I seen some tires laying over. There's a car lot I'm not too far away from us, but they always stack, like the tires that come off of the cars, you know, they come in and get new tires on

139
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.710
Crystal Gatwood: They stuck them out of the dumpster.

140
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.430
Or whatever.

141
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:43.920
Crystal Gatwood: Well,

142
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:53.220
Crystal Gatwood: We went over there and went through them, or I didn't get out the car. He just went through them and grabbed a couple of them and

143
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.300
Crystal Gatwood: We even had like patch them like they weren't

144
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:05.490
Crystal Gatwood: Like special tires or anything. Right. And literally got them out of the dumpster beside the dumpster.

145
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.770
Crystal Gatwood: And the next day I had the

146
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.990
Crystal Gatwood: Police knocking on my door.

147
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:34.890
Crystal Gatwood: And they come in. I'm like, You know what, what's up, what's going on, how can I help you, and he's like well I got good news and bad news. And I was like, okay, he's like, the good news is I'm not taking you to jail. The bad news is you got, like, I have three charges which is

148
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.730
Crystal Gatwood: Criminal trespassing theft.

149
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:40.830
Crystal Gatwood: And child endangerment.

150
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.320
Richelle Direny: Oh, yeah.

151
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.430
Richelle Direny: So explain

152
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:59.100
Crystal Gatwood: It. Unlike one he's like the tires that you took from everywhere. And I'm like, oh my god, I said, this is just a big misunderstanding. I said I would never do that.

153
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:06.150
Crystal Gatwood: I guess I i was wrong to assume I guess that they were trash or not wanted.

154
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.030
Crystal Gatwood: Um, but

155
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.630
Richelle Direny: So was it like a card you went through to get tired.

156
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:23.880
Crystal Gatwood: It's like the like there's a little a small, very small car lie like mechanic shop that's like two streets over for me.

157
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:33.240
Crystal Gatwood: Mm hmm. Well, behind the shop where the dumpster is they had my entire stack back there literally right beside the dumpster.

158
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:40.380
Crystal Gatwood: And I even like look I parked right in front of the office building, because I seen there was an open sign

159
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:58.320
Crystal Gatwood: And I get out to knock on the door to even ask if everything if it was okay and then I noticed that the door was locked, so on okay they're not open, but I guess I just assumed to be okay. I mean, to me, they look like junk partners.

160
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.120
Crystal Gatwood: Um,

161
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:11.490
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, I know many times that I've picked up stuff nice stuff from like nice nice houses or something that had been out by the trash and

162
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.170
Crystal Gatwood: I thought once it was like out in the trash or whatever it was.

163
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:23.340
Crystal Gatwood: I'm not sure how to say it like not really anybody's property but like

164
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.430
Crystal Gatwood: Do you know I'm trying to say.

165
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.850
Richelle Direny: So it's so you went to, you need a tire. So you need a tires for your vehicle.

166
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.370
Richelle Direny: And so you went

167
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:46.800
Richelle Direny: To get tires. You saw the tires and you thought it was like abandoned property or whatever in your that was there a sign anywhere that says, Do not trespass.

168
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:57.540
Richelle Direny: Was like, is it like this abandoned property didn't have like some kind of make sure shift like rat shock house broken down whatever was there anything like that. There

169
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.540
Crystal Gatwood: No, as I say, they're

170
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:09.450
Crystal Gatwood: Like where they have the cars for sale is like one little building and then they have this tiny little office building.

171
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.100
Crystal Gatwood: I'm about 500 feet like

172
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:15.690
Richelle Direny: Pretty

173
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.110
Richelle Direny: I'm sorry. Was anybody on the property.

174
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:20.400
Know,

175
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:27.780
Richelle Direny: So then, so and and so the child endangerment piece comes in because your child was with you.

176
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.710
Right.

177
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:30.810
Richelle Direny: So,

178
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:38.130
Crystal Gatwood: Which that right there tells you. I mean, what kind of mine would take their child to go steal something intentionally like

179
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.930
Richelle Direny: You'll be surprised.

180
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.170
Crystal Gatwood: I obviously didn't

181
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I know you weren't thinking, yeah.

182
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:56.400
Richelle Direny: You'll be surprised. You'd be surprised. You'd be surprised by the stories I hear you will be surprised, but this is the thing. I mean, so clearly someone was there because if the cops were called and they

183
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.050
Crystal Gatwood: Can run

184
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:07.350
Richelle Direny: And so even though it didn't look like much of anything to you the camera picked it up. They watched you do all it all and then

185
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.220
Richelle Direny: They

186
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:15.360
Richelle Direny: And given that they came to your house. The camera picked up that your, your son was, it was your son. Right.

187
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:27.150
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, which I live in a very small town. I mean, I live right beside the coffee shop as well. So like they know me. They know my car. They know my son.

188
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:35.550
Crystal Gatwood: They know where I live. You know what I mean. So, once he seen that he was like, oh, I know who that is.

189
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.630
Richelle Direny: So, so what ended up becoming

190
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.570
What ended up becoming

191
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.700
Crystal Gatwood: I got

192
00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.040
Crystal Gatwood: Me and him were both charged with the St George's but like

193
00:16:52.770 --> 00:17:00.930
Crystal Gatwood: Because the tires. He took the tires and put them on the vehicle my vehicle got impounded for evidence

194
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.580
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

195
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.990
Richelle Direny: So what's going to end up happening now. Did they in. When did this happen.

196
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.760
Crystal Gatwood: Over the weekend.

197
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:18.570
Richelle Direny: So what's going to what's the the plan going forward today tell you when you keep come back together.

198
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:25.020
Crystal Gatwood: No, I haven't heard anything back from that and my court date isn't even until like the end of May.

199
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.130
Richelle Direny: Womb two weeks because the enemy is like in two weeks.

200
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.290
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, it's a quarter to seven or something.

201
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:40.650
Richelle Direny: Yeah, to two weeks to the day action. Today's Wednesday right to two weeks from today. Um, and

202
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.280
Richelle Direny: Is it that you said where they don't tires or just regular tires for your vehicle.

203
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.640
Crystal Gatwood: That they were regular tires that like even one of them. We had to like

204
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.820
Crystal Gatwood: plug a hole. So it's not like they were like in perfect shape anyway.

205
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.010
Crystal Gatwood: You know, I mean,

206
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.290
Richelle Direny: I guess they're just going on it, of the principle of it, like you said, you know, you just assumed

207
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.760
Richelle Direny: Because of

208
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:16.050
Richelle Direny: You know, the look of things, or what have you just assume then you went and got it. So even if they were, they weren't good yes or no.

209
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:25.710
Richelle Direny: It's just the principle of it all. I mean, I know that overwhelming. Because then that's your time and that's money that you have to pay into getting your heart out of

210
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.810
Crystal Gatwood: Like, it's not even going to be worth it because like I paid

211
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:42.630
Crystal Gatwood: Like $200 for the car and I know the impound fee and everything by then it's going to be way more than even pay for the car. So it's like I was just chalk that up. Yeah.

212
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah that is

213
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.410
Yeah.

214
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.920
Richelle Direny: What did you buy the car from someone

215
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.160
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, I just bought it like

216
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.360
Crystal Gatwood: And April March.

217
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.220
Richelle Direny: Yes, I think I remember you saying that you were working on you wanted to get a car.

218
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:02.970
Yep.

219
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.260
Richelle Direny: That's what it all.

220
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.360
Hold on.

221
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.380
Richelle Direny: Let me review once

222
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.160
Crystal Gatwood: And so I'm actually

223
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.160
Crystal Gatwood: In the process of writing.

224
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.580
Crystal Gatwood: An apology letter.

225
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.820
Crystal Gatwood: To

226
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.900
Richelle Direny: A part of your thing that when you go to court. You have to give them an apology letter.

227
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.090
Crystal Gatwood: No, no, I'm doing this voluntarily.

228
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.300
Richelle Direny: Individual appointment.

229
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.400
Crystal Gatwood: Forever. I was like, No, I don't want this.

230
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.970
Richelle Direny: Last time was in March.

231
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.480
Richelle Direny: So I'm

232
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:28.950
Richelle Direny: Now, I think the last time we talked you were in the process of breaking up with your father, son. Right. I mean, WITH YOUR SON'S FATHER.

233
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:30.480
Crystal Gatwood: Yes.

234
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.250
Richelle Direny: How has that been

235
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.800
Crystal Gatwood: Well Lissa.

236
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.020
Crystal Gatwood: Virus and everything on we actually decided that

237
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:49.890
Crystal Gatwood: He could stay during the quarantine to that when I had to go to the store, or what have you. I didn't have to drive my son out with me.

238
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.330
Crystal Gatwood: I didn't realize the quarantine or less.

239
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.990
Richelle Direny: You're biting your tongue every day.

240
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.420
Richelle Direny: For let's hope I will pray with you. That doesn't ask two more months.

241
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.570
Richelle Direny: So how has that been for the for the long is how long has it been been

242
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.890
Crystal Gatwood: I think it was like

243
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.580
Crystal Gatwood: Well,

244
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:28.680
Crystal Gatwood: In the

245
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.490
Crystal Gatwood: Beginning of April, it's business to be in April.

246
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.840
Richelle Direny: April, May.

247
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.670
Richelle Direny: So look, a month and a half.

248
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.510
Richelle Direny: Almost two months.

249
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.460
Crystal Gatwood: Yes, it was like in turn again.

250
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.160
Crystal Gatwood: Well,

251
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:49.380
Crystal Gatwood: I'm even more mad because it's like, how could he get me into this. How could he do this.

252
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:57.000
Richelle Direny: What. So how have you been coping with it in terms of

253
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:05.730
Richelle Direny: What was going on. Prior to the quarantine and how you're coping in dealing with it and why you kind of want

254
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:18.300
Richelle Direny: Multiple your separate ways. And just the kind of the toxic relationship between you and how it was being reflected in front of your son. How is that now because now like y'all are kind of on lockdown. So it's a little bit different.

255
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.340
Crystal Gatwood: Well, you know, it's

256
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:30.570
Crystal Gatwood: You know, it's weird how it goes. When you want somebody they don't kind of want you. But when somebody wants you. You're like,

257
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.340
Crystal Gatwood: I'm good.

258
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.020
Crystal Gatwood: Mess.

259
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.250
Crystal Gatwood: With us now.

260
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:42.360
Crystal Gatwood: Now he wants to be this person that I wanted him to be eight years ago.

261
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.490
Richelle Direny: So the roles has shifted

262
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.590
Crystal Gatwood: Yes tables have turned

263
00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.490
Richelle Direny: And the feelings for you has kind of went through and no

264
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.450
Yes.

265
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:53.910
Richelle Direny: And

266
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.340
Richelle Direny: So,

267
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:04.620
Richelle Direny: So I thought about this kind of concept of what you're saying for a long time. How long has it been for you.

268
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.760
Richelle Direny: Um, that you wanted him and he kind of wasn't where you wanted him to

269
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:18.330
Crystal Gatwood: I feel like I tried and tried and tried for good. Eight. Eight years

270
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.540
Richelle Direny: And so here comes quarantine. Here comes Miss Rona

271
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:26.130
Richelle Direny: Miss

272
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.810
Richelle Direny: So many Rona has invited herself into our lives.

273
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.940
Richelle Direny: Yes, and Rona says he got to stay for a bit.

274
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.320
Crystal Gatwood: At a time, though, I thought it would be a good idea.

275
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.290
Richelle Direny: Why did you think it was going to be a good idea.

276
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:55.320
Crystal Gatwood: Because I didn't know exactly what was going on with the virus, like how bad it was. I just heard about all the deaths. You know what I mean.

277
00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:04.800
Crystal Gatwood: And he was like, you know, in case one of us gets sick, I could say Memphis or blah, blah, you know, and I could be there to help you or vice versa.

278
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:13.380
Crystal Gatwood: And I didn't want to take this out to stores and blah, blah, blah. And I would have to if nobody was here. You see, I'm saying

279
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.190
Richelle Direny: So now it's just the three of you in the house, or you, you also have an otter, right.

280
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.920
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, but she resides with her.

281
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.140
Richelle Direny: So it's just the three of you.

282
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.510
Richelle Direny: And so he said, because

283
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.140
Richelle Direny: The big bad Ronan is here and she looked like she wants to take who she can with home.

284
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:38.040
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

285
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:45.300
Richelle Direny: You said he kind of recognized Rona, and says, you know what, this is serious.

286
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.350
Richelle Direny: Let me help you out with Memphis.

287
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.130
Yeah.

288
00:25:51.420 --> 00:26:04.500
Richelle Direny: You still have to do what mommy's. Do you still gotta go out. You still gotta, you know, till the garden you so that's all that. And so he's saying no, I'll stay with Memphis because one of us have to be here for him.

289
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:15.600
Richelle Direny: To you think that this big bag Rona has kind of made him see life in a different way.

290
00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:25.320
Crystal Gatwood: Um, I do. Plus, you know, the time, the little time that he was in jail.

291
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.200
Crystal Gatwood: No march force.

292
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.400
Richelle Direny: Works. Works.

293
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.100
Richelle Direny: How long was he in

294
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.040
Crystal Gatwood: 18 days, I think.

295
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:49.470
Richelle Direny: I'm

296
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:51.390
Crystal Gatwood: Was he

297
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.770
Richelle Direny: Released because of Rona

298
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.240
Crystal Gatwood: No.

299
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.340
Richelle Direny: He was due to leave anywhere.

300
00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.440
Richelle Direny: So,

301
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:04.740
Richelle Direny: Out of incarceration for 18 days you're in a new type of incarceration, because

302
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:06.660
Crystal Gatwood: Yes.

303
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.600
Richelle Direny: When he's in a different, but his this incarceration is better than last incarceration.

304
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:14.940
Crystal Gatwood: True.

305
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.560
Richelle Direny: And so

306
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:23.460
Richelle Direny: What hasn't that conversation and I want you to follow the pattern in which I'm taking

307
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.940
Richelle Direny: What has that conversation been because he left from incarceration with a bunch of boots.

308
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.720
Richelle Direny: Now he's in an incarceration with you. M Memphis.

309
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.200
Richelle Direny: People who maybe while for those 18 days he recognized like

310
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.550
Richelle Direny: You think the life that I really want, but this

311
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:47.640
Richelle Direny: Like so it gives him. So it's kind of like he was in time out for 18 days and he had time to really think

312
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.260
Richelle Direny: What is that conversation been like since he's been home.

313
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.890
Crystal Gatwood: He's been that's when the tables kind of turn

314
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:08.100
Crystal Gatwood: Like he's although you know I didn't realize how important your word to me and stuff like that.

315
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:16.830
Crystal Gatwood: But to me, everything I've been through. I'm like, I'm sorry. I'm like, done.

316
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.910
Richelle Direny: You guys eight years under your belt.

317
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.180
Richelle Direny: Eight years. So now that you

318
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.260
Richelle Direny: So now that you've had a come to Jesus moment I would it

319
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.670
Richelle Direny: Is basically what you're saying.

320
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.480
Richelle Direny: I come to Jesus, which you

321
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.110
Richelle Direny: You got it.

322
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.820
Crystal Gatwood: Yes.

323
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.100
Richelle Direny: So,

324
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:42.780
Crystal Gatwood: This

325
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.800
Richelle Direny: Is reality.

326
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.870
Richelle Direny: And the reason why I said look I've been thinking about this because I see this very concept of what you're saying.

327
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.330
Richelle Direny: Yeah, especially in

328
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:51.960
There.

329
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.800
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like you

330
00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:03.660
Richelle Direny: You've been pining after this relationship with this person that you've been in for years you're hurting you're broken, you're

331
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.160
Richelle Direny: You're just feeling so emotionally abused and mentally abused and just kind of

332
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.390
Richelle Direny: Where you are

333
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.520
Crystal Gatwood: And you have allowed yourself for years to

334
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.420
Richelle Direny: Go through this

335
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.040
Crystal Gatwood: And then at some point they had this moment.

336
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:17.820
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

337
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.960
Richelle Direny: And they've seen the light. Oh. Hallelujah. I have seen the light

338
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.960
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and I recognize that you want is what I want to be with

339
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.280
Richelle Direny: In those years bitterness setting.

340
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.000
Richelle Direny: Yes, setting hatred set in

341
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.210
Richelle Direny: Every resentment all of its setting for you. It's very hard to

342
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.820
Richelle Direny: Understand your come to Jesus moment.

343
00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.080
Crystal Gatwood: Yes, it is.

344
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:48.660
Very hard.

345
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.210
Crystal Gatwood: And he's just like, how do you not understand. And I'm like, how do you are saying

346
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.490
Richelle Direny: Before is because, listen.

347
00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:07.740
Richelle Direny: A woman can understand these things. A man can understand what they understand we understand where the disconnect is is one of the two opposite sex tried to have this conversation.

348
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.960
Richelle Direny: Because you're speaking

349
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.770
Richelle Direny: From your eight years of hurt.

350
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.830
Richelle Direny: Your years of emotional abandonment.

351
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.210
Richelle Direny: Eight years of all of the things

352
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.330
Richelle Direny: That made me cry myself to see

353
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.240
Richelle Direny: Me for the whole thing's

354
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:39.210
Richelle Direny: You're coming from that place of not to say that you're 100 reason at the hundred percent reason of my addiction. But you add to some of that you

355
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:46.200
Richelle Direny: All of the different things that I've gone through and many times, all I needed you to was just be my partner.

356
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.980
Richelle Direny: To just support me. I just need you to do that.

357
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:53.040
Richelle Direny: And you were so caught up in all the things that you were caught up in

358
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.470
Richelle Direny: Well, now that you had 18 days.

359
00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.370
Yeah.

360
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.610
Richelle Direny: I've been in it for eight years.

361
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.560
Richelle Direny: It's very now I'm ready to throw in the towel.

362
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:15.780
Crystal Gatwood: Huh, you know, it's like, now that I'm ready to throw in the towel and I'm exhausted.

363
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.960
Richelle Direny: Right when I'm about to throw in the towel.

364
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.950
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Right. Right. When I'm starting to recognize that

365
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.160
Richelle Direny: I shouldn't love shouldn't hurt like this.

366
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.280
Richelle Direny: Right love shouldn't make me feel like this.

367
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.410
Richelle Direny: And you've got to that point.

368
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.570
Richelle Direny: Where you kind of want to walk.

369
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:35.790
Richelle Direny: Question is,

370
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:45.570
Richelle Direny: Are you allowing your emotion just emotion, because remember like relationships comes with its ups and downs.

371
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.190
Richelle Direny: It has this big bad storms and everything.

372
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.450
Richelle Direny: Are you allowing your emotions.

373
00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.960
Richelle Direny: To lead your continuous decision or are you for a moment.

374
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:13.230
Richelle Direny: Looking at those eight years and seeing how much of those eight years was really just tainted with hurt and pain or how much was there really truly if I stopped to allow myself to think

375
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.750
Richelle Direny: That there were a lot of good moments.

376
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.100
Crystal Gatwood: In

377
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:31.170
Richelle Direny: And what's going on right now is a, it's a, it's a reflection of some of the things that did happen, those eight years what my hurt is relying me from that.

378
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.210
Richelle Direny: My bitterness.

379
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.130
Richelle Direny: Is blinding me from that.

380
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.720
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, and and that's what I told him you know I

381
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.730
Crystal Gatwood: I tried to

382
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.470
Crystal Gatwood: forgive him but

383
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.220
Crystal Gatwood: I have trouble with forgiving.

384
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.370
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know why.

385
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.830
Crystal Gatwood: Part of me is because I feel like you know I treated him so good. How can you do that.

386
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.480
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

387
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.970
Crystal Gatwood: So,

388
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:15.570
Crystal Gatwood: And I told him you know you shouldn't have to apologize, every day for those things. I don't want you to have to do that and you should not live with me being bitter and being spiteful to you every day.

389
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.720
Crystal Gatwood: You know what I mean.

390
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:27.960
Richelle Direny: But now, take it back for a moment because there's one thing that she said, I have an issue with forgiving.

391
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.510
Richelle Direny: Your issue with business.

392
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:38.880
Richelle Direny: Really doesn't have anything to do with him because anybody else that comes into picture and does something to you to you, you're still going to have an issue with forgiving them as well.

393
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.190
Richelle Direny: So that's one thing. The other thing is what you just said.

394
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.900
Richelle Direny: You treated him so good.

395
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.210
Richelle Direny: Well, based on you're treating him good.

396
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:02.880
Richelle Direny: Was he in a place to be appreciative accepting all that you gave him because it sounds

397
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:04.800
Richelle Direny: Pretty

398
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.580
Crystal Gatwood: People here.

399
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.500
Richelle Direny: You had your past.

400
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.240
Richelle Direny: Because

401
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:10.890
Richelle Direny: How many children.

402
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.310
Richelle Direny: Or how long were you in a relationship with your, your daughter's for

403
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.620
Crystal Gatwood: Eight years

404
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.190
Richelle Direny: She's got an eight year track record, my friend.

405
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:24.270
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

406
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.810
Richelle Direny: Think about you as with him for eight years and eight year is our. Is it the same your two kids and a father.

407
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.000
Crystal Gatwood: No different fathers

408
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.610
Richelle Direny: Prior to your daughter. Did you have another long standing relationship.

409
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.830
Crystal Gatwood: And all my relationships have been

410
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.800
Crystal Gatwood: well over a year.

411
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.920
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. And

412
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:58.770
Richelle Direny: In all of your relationships. Do you feel like you poured into them all of the love that you can give all of the care how

413
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.710
Crystal Gatwood: Did you feel like you

414
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.490
Crystal Gatwood: Because it's rare for me to give a man all my trust.

415
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.640
Richelle Direny: Is it because your point.

416
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:16.800
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry.

417
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:18.810
Richelle Direny: Did your father disappoint you.

418
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.200
Crystal Gatwood: assistance from my childhood. Yes.

419
00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.120
Richelle Direny: All of these men who come in your life.

420
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.660
Richelle Direny: Not to say they didn't bring their own share of issues.

421
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.910
Richelle Direny: But

422
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.780
Richelle Direny: Every last one of them had to contend

423
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.290
Crystal Gatwood: With

424
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:42.750
Richelle Direny: All of this hurt that you have dealt with since childhood. That's part of the reason, like you said,

425
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:49.140
Richelle Direny: It's hard for you to forgive because of your travel trauma that you're still trying to work through

426
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.030
Richelle Direny: And learn how to deal with. So

427
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.970
Richelle Direny: Some of that bitterness. Some of that resentment, some of that all of those things.

428
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:01.530
Crystal Gatwood: Is

429
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.280
Richelle Direny: A direct relation from what he's brought to the relationship but

430
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.830
Richelle Direny: A lot of it goes back to

431
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:14.760
Richelle Direny: Your childhood, because what you feel for him. I'm sure you are all these other men that came in your life.

432
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.130
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

433
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.110
Richelle Direny: Because you also said you don't have a relationship with your mom right

434
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.790
Richelle Direny: Because your mom didn't do anything to help you through every anything that you went through as a child.

435
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.180
Richelle Direny: Starts with working on you.

436
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:55.290
Richelle Direny: Because it sounds to me and granted the the intricate details of

437
00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:04.290
Richelle Direny: Why you are, where you are right now as far as it's related to this relationship, but it also sounds like if you were, were you in group on Thursday.

438
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.740
Crystal Gatwood: No, actually I I called in and said I would be in the evening group, but

439
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.360
Crystal Gatwood: Ok so Kim up to an interview and ended up

440
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.950
Crystal Gatwood: Being up there.

441
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.930
Richelle Direny: The reason why I asked you, because in our group on Thursday we talked about

442
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.240
Richelle Direny: Four things

443
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:36.990
Richelle Direny: What which one resonates with you in which one is meaningful and it said one of them was life is short.

444
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.140
Richelle Direny: One was jobs or temporary health as well.

445
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:52.200
Richelle Direny: And we need to survive, based on what you're saying to me, his come to Jesus moment was he recognized life is really short family who is what's important and that's

446
00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:52.740
The

447
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.800
Crystal Gatwood: ELYSEE, that life is short.

448
00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:03.690
Richelle Direny: Life is short, but then here it is that he's sounds to me like he's living that life is short hair color.

449
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:10.830
Richelle Direny: Is causing all this havoc in this work now. No, not a nation. She shut down.

450
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.750
Richelle Direny: And he is reality here is this

451
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.090
Richelle Direny: And this young

452
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.940
Richelle Direny: forbid something happens to one of us.

453
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:28.770
Richelle Direny: This is not how I want it to go down that we're at odds with each other. And so he it sounds to me in the little that you said about him.

454
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.210
Richelle Direny: That's where he's at.

455
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.150
Richelle Direny: You can appreciate that right now.

456
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.020
Richelle Direny: Because I have eight years of hurt and pain with us.

457
00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.150
Richelle Direny: I can't really see what you're seeing

458
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:40.530
Richelle Direny: And understand what you're seeing

459
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.420
Richelle Direny: Because I have eight years.

460
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:52.860
Richelle Direny: Of everything that's going on. So it's very hard for you to understand where he's coming from. It's very hard for you to see where he's coming from. So all of any could also be

461
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:59.700
Richelle Direny: A part of it could also be like if I leave, where am I going to go. How often am I going to is this is only child, he has another child.

462
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.600
Crystal Gatwood: This is Joe. Yes.

463
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.680
Richelle Direny: I go, I'm not this relationship with my son. And so they could be a whole lot of thing.

464
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:15.180
Richelle Direny: I was in stone for hurt you in the past but

465
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.020
Richelle Direny: Probably TAKING EIGHT DAYS OF timeout.

466
00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:27.330
Richelle Direny: He probably had time and all of that. Maybe that's part of the review so apologetic right now you can appreciate that.

467
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.580
Richelle Direny: Because you are just the epitome

468
00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:40.080
Richelle Direny: Of a man like my dad in my childhood or every other man that has come into my life I given I given I give, I love it, I love it, I love, I care. I care. I care.

469
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.850
Richelle Direny: And all you guys to do

470
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.440
Richelle Direny: Is turn around it hurt me.

471
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.830
Richelle Direny: And that's the part that is was hard for you because

472
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.910
Richelle Direny: What you're doing or could be doing

473
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:59.100
Richelle Direny: Is running to all these men in your life.

474
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.030
Richelle Direny: That love and affection and care.

475
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.220
Richelle Direny: That you want from that.

476
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:14.310
Richelle Direny: And when they're not. And no matter how much you do, no matter how much you want that validation, no matter how much you you you give

477
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.920
Richelle Direny: They are not bad.

478
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:27.120
Richelle Direny: So they are constantly disappointing you because every time you enter to every single one of these relationships.

479
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:37.470
Richelle Direny: You set the standard high for them and they go meet it. You said it high for them. They already coming. They came into the relationship failing and didn't even know they were failing.

480
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:50.820
Richelle Direny: It's really truly hard for you able to accept his apology.

481
00:40:51.870 --> 00:41:01.380
Richelle Direny: Here and understand what it's apologies that he's trying to give. And even if he says I will do whatever it takes to make it right for

482
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.420
Richelle Direny: For the sake

483
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:12.510
Richelle Direny: You what you're hearing is bitterness resentment everything that you're hearing

484
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.120
Richelle Direny: This is like, I'm not trying to hear

485
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.030
Richelle Direny: Because now your heart has already turned

486
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.070
Richelle Direny: 18 days of being away for your turn.

487
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.630
Richelle Direny: My friend, and she showed up my friend showed up.

488
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.740
Richelle Direny: If he asked me, Why are you crying.

489
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.130
Crystal Gatwood: I'm honest okay

490
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.200
Crystal Gatwood: I mean,

491
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.960
Crystal Gatwood: We, how does one forgive

492
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.660
Richelle Direny: It starts with you. Learning to let go.

493
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.410
Richelle Direny: Because

494
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.750
Richelle Direny: The Forgiveness is not for them.

495
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:09.480
Richelle Direny: Happen.

496
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.570
Richelle Direny: We can talk about it. We can process it.

497
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.840
Richelle Direny: We can talk about how it made you feel and how wrong it was

498
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:16.680
We can't

499
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.430
Richelle Direny: To be undone.

500
00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.920
Richelle Direny: Working through understanding what it means to let go.

501
00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.800
Richelle Direny: What it means to forgive

502
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.760
Richelle Direny: And let them go and not letting them.

503
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:36.780
Richelle Direny: All

504
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.070
Richelle Direny: in bondage.

505
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.480
Crystal Gatwood: Your emotions anyway.

506
00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.890
Richelle Direny: So the question is,

507
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.340
Richelle Direny: Does your dad still alive.

508
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.050
Crystal Gatwood: Yes.

509
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.080
Richelle Direny: Do you have a relationship with him.

510
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.660
Crystal Gatwood: I try

511
00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.230
Richelle Direny: And what what hinders that for you.

512
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.460
Crystal Gatwood: He works a lot

513
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.850
Richelle Direny: Able to see him.

514
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.440
Richelle Direny: Is it that

515
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.110
Richelle Direny: Just a little bit. If you're able to give in your you know where you are.

516
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:20.520
Richelle Direny: What is it

517
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:30.900
Richelle Direny: That is most hurtful for you from your childhoods that keep that get you. You remember that every time you see a man, it makes it very hard for you to forgive. Some of the hurtful things that they do.

518
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.020
Richelle Direny: As we made it to your dad, not so much to your mom.

519
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:35.580
Richelle Direny: Needed to

520
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.560
Crystal Gatwood: So much. My God, if I mean father figure. It was actually my

521
00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.970
Crystal Gatwood: Step Dad, I was molested by stepped out for a few years.

522
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:54.300
Richelle Direny: And so when you said that you have a relationship. So do you know your biological father, as well as your stepfather. They both in the picture.

523
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:05.220
Crystal Gatwood: My Bible biological father is in the picture. Yeah, but I don't talk to my mom so

524
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:07.800
Crystal Gatwood: I know

525
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:14.280
Crystal Gatwood: my step dad, but she left him when I was like eight

526
00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.840
Richelle Direny: Well, after he found out what he was doing, or features mark.

527
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:23.880
Crystal Gatwood: She just left. I honestly to this day. Don't know if she even knows

528
00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.720
Did you ever tell her.

529
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.640
Richelle Direny: She doesn't really know what transpired.

530
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.770
Crystal Gatwood: My dad news. So I'm assuming Michael knows

531
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.630
Richelle Direny: And when your

532
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:46.200
Dad.

533
00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:02.010
Crystal Gatwood: Go out there.

534
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.040
Crystal Gatwood: Oh, thank you.

535
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:11.400
Crystal Gatwood: Thank you.

536
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:18.420
Richelle Direny: When your when your dad knows what was his response and kind of what happened when he found out

537
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:28.350
Crystal Gatwood: Well, he didn't really say much to me as actually my step mom that asked me about it because I guess my sister.

538
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:37.440
Crystal Gatwood: Which caught some of it too. But she's older than me. So I think I caught more of it.

539
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:39.600
Crystal Gatwood: You know me.

540
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.040
Crystal Gatwood: Younger, yes.

541
00:45:43.080 --> 00:46:00.390
Crystal Gatwood: And I went quiet and just never slept around and or anything like that. And my sister went the opposite way. She just went wild, you know, and which I hear is pretty color.

542
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.610
Crystal Gatwood: So she

543
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.490
Crystal Gatwood: Got into addiction herself.

544
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.510
Crystal Gatwood: And she used it against my father.

545
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:20.160
Crystal Gatwood: A crunch, like, you know, to get money or things like that.

546
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.460
Crystal Gatwood: She wallowed in it, whereas

547
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.890
Crystal Gatwood: I just been quiet.

548
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.200
Richelle Direny: So a lot of it was you. Did you

549
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:45.090
Richelle Direny: start blaming yourself for you personally did you blame yourself a lot. And did you ever feel like it was your fault. It's something that you did or didn't do. Like was. Was any of those thoughts or emotions and

550
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.930
Crystal Gatwood: I never really felt that it was my fault. Mm hmm.

551
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.050
Crystal Gatwood: I just

552
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.070
Crystal Gatwood: As I grew up, I just realized, you know, the

553
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.640
Crystal Gatwood: Person in

554
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.950
Crystal Gatwood: He wants. Yeah.

555
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.150
Richelle Direny: And often times, and this is what was happening, which is

556
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:07.380
Richelle Direny: Also very common.

557
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.580
Richelle Direny: Become an abuser was once against right

558
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:21.990
Crystal Gatwood: I understand that. I don't know. I don't understand it to a point, but understand, you know, I've read that, but

559
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:23.790
Anyway,

560
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.500
Crystal Gatwood: I mean like my situation. I was too but I can never imagine

561
00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.700
Crystal Gatwood: Doing that hurting somebody else like that.

562
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:46.740
Richelle Direny: You know, to say what goes on in the mind of a person. And if that person was supposed to come back and say, everyone will have a different reason. What they share

563
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.190
Richelle Direny: And what goes on in that their minds.

564
00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:59.370
Richelle Direny: To say, which of it is true, it's just basically calling with the consistent census of what everyone says, and

565
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:01.980
Richelle Direny: It's

566
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.080
Richelle Direny: It's some sense.

567
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:10.920
Richelle Direny: Of power and control and

568
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.920
Richelle Direny: I remember thinking it was after a while.

569
00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:25.680
Richelle Direny: Have this thought in your head that maybe it was the power in control that they have control over someone that was

570
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:32.550
Richelle Direny: weaker than them and less or. So this is how you were going to show that you are in control, you have the power.

571
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:55.470
Richelle Direny: And maybe part of the reason why they convince themselves of such. And why do you think that they do you understand, like you said, you may not understand. It's kind of like, like you said your sister who experienced the same thing. And she was one direction with it, which is quite

572
00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:56.310
Richelle Direny: Difficult

573
00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:57.630
Crystal Gatwood: And then

574
00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:59.490
Richelle Direny: We'll kind of another direction with it.

575
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:18.750
Richelle Direny: Maybe she got into addiction much heavier than you did because of how she dealt with the mistrust of a man or the abuse and just what it did to her, emotionally, mentally, it's what it did to her. It didn't do the same to you in terms of

576
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:29.160
Richelle Direny: The physical aspect of it, but your ability to still maintain some degree of self control, emotionally, mentally, and go about it was just

577
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.090
Richelle Direny: A little bit different.

578
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.610
Richelle Direny: And so, like you said, for you you struggle with forgiving.

579
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:49.200
Richelle Direny: And just not understanding. Like why if he just happened to you. Why would you do it to me if it made you feel like this. Why would you do so now you understand how I'm feeling. So why would you do it. That is the question.

580
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:55.350
Richelle Direny: But we can like I said we could talk about that all day. You talk about that for months, my thing to you.

581
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.340
Richelle Direny: For giving him.

582
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:12.210
Richelle Direny: Or for her. Just, just the concept of forgiving. What makes it hard for you. That's the question. What is it that makes it hard for you to forgive

583
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:18.720
Crystal Gatwood: Me.

584
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.810
Crystal Gatwood: I feel like you ruined my life.

585
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:34.470
Richelle Direny: He ruined your life and I want you to kind of go, we're going to walk through it slowly.

586
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.930
Richelle Direny: When you think he ruined your life.

587
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:47.100
Richelle Direny: In what for you in what aspect do you think that he ruined your life. He did, because what he did was a horrible thing. By no means. But I want you to just prophecy

588
00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:55.920
Crystal Gatwood: Well, I mean I suppressed it for

589
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.220
Crystal Gatwood: 20 years. I mean, to the point where

590
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.740
Crystal Gatwood: I didn't even know if it was real.

591
00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:06.390
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

592
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:14.280
Crystal Gatwood: It to my daughter actually turn the same age. I was

593
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.930
Crystal Gatwood: She just looks

594
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.800
Crystal Gatwood: She's a Mini Me, though she looks just like me.

595
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.970
Crystal Gatwood: That's what I started

596
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:30.120
Crystal Gatwood: In just

597
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.280
Crystal Gatwood: Finding out that it was real.

598
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.440
Crystal Gatwood: I find myself having a relationship with my daughter that I should

599
00:51:49.590 --> 00:52:00.360
Richelle Direny: Because you just looked at her as you at that age as one that was being abused and what and I think we talked about this prior when you look at her. What do you see

600
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.050
Richelle Direny: Because we're looking at yourself, you're looking at a reflection of yourself.

601
00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:08.130
Richelle Direny: What is it that you saw in your eyes. What is it that you saw on her.

602
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.460
Richelle Direny: That made it hurt so much. What is it that you saw

603
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:24.780
Crystal Gatwood: Not even sure it was just like, look at her in certain ways. Either chief looks just like me and it just triggers me and it puts me right back into where

604
00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:34.980
Richelle Direny: Did you see a girl that was just really beautiful and talented and educated

605
00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:38.280
Richelle Direny: Or did you see a girl that was like, that's what I'm saying is

606
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.690
Richelle Direny: That you saw

607
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.920
Richelle Direny: puts you back in that, like, is this what he saw. Is this why he ruined my life instance, why he

608
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.260
Richelle Direny: In my childhood from me when I

609
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.120
Crystal Gatwood: asked myself this very same question. Yes.

610
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.580
Crystal Gatwood: But

611
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:09.390
Crystal Gatwood: See the way he he he did it was by manipulating me. I was young, you know,

612
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.230
Crystal Gatwood: I you know I trusted him.

613
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:17.370
Crystal Gatwood: And so

614
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:19.470
Crystal Gatwood: That's why.

615
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.550
Crystal Gatwood: For me to have to give somebody trust.

616
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.990
Crystal Gatwood: Me wrong. It's just how can I forgive you.

617
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:30.030
Crystal Gatwood: Know,

618
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:35.850
Richelle Direny: So you saw in her when you look at her. You saw her innocence.

619
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.920
Richelle Direny: You saw her purity.

620
00:53:38.580 --> 00:54:01.320
Richelle Direny: We saw someone who at that age was maybe could have been easily manipulated and why would you have taken advantage of a child who doesn't really know much and who gives you all their love and respect. Like why would you ruin that yeah

621
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.820
Richelle Direny: And he probably even couldn't answer that question.

622
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:07.200
So,

623
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:17.550
Richelle Direny: That's the sad part because a person who was abused as an abuser. He couldn't even answer that question probably could probably can.

624
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:33.240
Richelle Direny: He doesn't even know why he did what he did or understand, to what degree based on whatever distorted thing that was going. Was he the monster. Yes, he became the monster someone made him.

625
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:35.670
Richelle Direny: You understand

626
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:43.350
Richelle Direny: That he says he became a month. Someone made him a monster and he became that monster.

627
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:47.370
Richelle Direny: And he

628
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.450
Richelle Direny: Looked at

629
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.000
Richelle Direny: Maybe I can have control.

630
00:54:52.980 --> 00:55:01.620
Richelle Direny: She said, I see how much she loves it, she trusts me. I see this glimmer of I can have control over her.

631
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:02.910
Richelle Direny: And this is

632
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.580
Crystal Gatwood: Like this. Like he already had control.

633
00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:06.510
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

634
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.190
Crystal Gatwood: Why even go that far.

635
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.550
Richelle Direny: Why, again, he probably couldn't even answer that question.

636
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.310
Crystal Gatwood: I wasn't a bad kid.

637
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:16.140
Crystal Gatwood: You know,

638
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:25.980
Richelle Direny: Could you put you remember the categories that I gave you your beautiful, talented smart girl and how old. How old were you

639
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:34.830
Crystal Gatwood: I believe it started when I was so possibly three, but I remember, for sure. For until I was about eight

640
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.470
Richelle Direny: So complete manipulation. Think about a child. Think about your son right now.

641
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.780
Richelle Direny: How much you can

642
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.100
Richelle Direny: No matter what you do if you yell at your son.

643
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.280
Richelle Direny: And you say, baby. Come here. I'm sorry, what is he going to do

644
00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:52.860
Richelle Direny: Crying it all, he's gonna come right back to you.

645
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:53.550
Right.

646
00:55:54.930 --> 00:56:12.120
Richelle Direny: Because of how innocent, he is at that age in their innocence is unreal. They're pretty unreal. You get you. There's an age where you come at all that because what they who they are at that age. Anyone that shows them the love and affection.

647
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.020
Richelle Direny: That's what hey you know what you're showing me love and affection.

648
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:23.820
Richelle Direny: For this, this is what happens. And you're right. He had that degree of control and he abused it

649
00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.600
Richelle Direny: Has and even at that age.

650
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:34.710
Richelle Direny: You're probably so afraid of him because your soul shaken by it that you're not going to tell anybody.

651
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:40.230
Richelle Direny: Just so distorted like I can't believe something like this happened, why would he do this.

652
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:42.930
Richelle Direny: Because you know what

653
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:51.300
Richelle Direny: Some of the monster was taught to become this monster because of something that happened to them.

654
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.940
Richelle Direny: And so here it is.

655
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:55.650
Richelle Direny: He probably sat

656
00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:57.120
Richelle Direny: And try to figure it out.

657
00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.510
Richelle Direny: And what he came up with this distortion.

658
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:15.270
Richelle Direny: distorted sense of view or how can I control and then he did what he did and he held back control and then depending on the involvement of your mom. And he did it for both you and your sister development or your mom.

659
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:25.290
Richelle Direny: She really involved. Well, she always leaving guys whatever she was whatever was going on with her. Maybe in that time back then.

660
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.080
Richelle Direny: It was free reign

661
00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:39.840
Richelle Direny: Because maybe the love and respect that you and your maybe had for him. Maybe how he came on the scene. So your mom relinquished her all of our trust to him. And here is that he put

662
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:40.830
Richelle Direny: In this way,

663
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.830
Richelle Direny: Yeah, he probably

664
00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:50.820
Richelle Direny: I think what we have to work on is like you said it's learning how, how do you forgive

665
00:57:51.750 --> 00:58:02.280
Richelle Direny: How do you work on forgiving, so that I can release myself because emotionally that emotional trauma is was taking taking captive

666
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:10.110
Richelle Direny: That it's so hard to forgive work generally trying to be there for you and help you and not harm you or hurt you.

667
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.650
Richelle Direny: Like I've had relationships come with all of its set of issues.

668
00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:23.790
Richelle Direny: But there are certain things you're unable to get past simply because you don't know how to

669
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:37.890
Richelle Direny: let things go in the end. And I don't want to say let it go like forget it, like it never happened because it did happen, but it's not allowing it to have domination over you.

670
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:46.470
Richelle Direny: Because the combination that is having over you. It's affecting all these other aspects of your life.

671
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:51.000
Richelle Direny: It's holding your mind captive where you're not able to see past certain things.

672
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:57.540
Richelle Direny: Simply because of this hurt and pain that happened 20 some odd years ago. It's hard for you.

673
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:07.800
Richelle Direny: It's hard for you to just kind of get through because you still hold on to the memories and the hurt and the pain of everything that happened to you when you were younger.

674
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:10.230
Richelle Direny: Now,

675
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.320
Richelle Direny: He's nowhere.

676
00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:22.740
Richelle Direny: He's not so he came out of your life at what the age of eight.

677
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:31.200
Richelle Direny: Was it ever recorded. Oh, you said that you don't think your mom but your dad knew. Did your dad reported or your set mom report it.

678
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:33.930
Crystal Gatwood: So,

679
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:35.910
Richelle Direny: You don't think

680
00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.650
Richelle Direny: It mean for you.

681
00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.820
Richelle Direny: Just for a moment. I want you to think what would it mean for you if you

682
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.200
Richelle Direny: If you relinquish that

683
00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:50.670
Richelle Direny: If you say, I forgive you.

684
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.590
Richelle Direny: Use the words what it would be good for you.

685
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.020
Crystal Gatwood: What it would mean for me.

686
01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:05.700
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Or how do you look at forgiveness. Let me ask it that way.

687
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.240
Crystal Gatwood: It's simply, it's very hard for me to, it's a it's a

688
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.750
Crystal Gatwood: I don't want you to get there with me because I don't know how to do it.

689
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.750
Richelle Direny: When you mean

690
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:25.560
Crystal Gatwood: Like

691
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:32.940
Crystal Gatwood: I don't want people to get to where I need to forgive them for something

692
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:41.310
Richelle Direny: But in your mind when you think about forgiveness. What does it what does that mean for you personally

693
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.010
Richelle Direny: Not what the word forgiveness me but for you.

694
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:50.340
Crystal Gatwood: You're not really sure I'm not good at it.

695
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.370
Richelle Direny: Means that

696
01:00:57.810 --> 01:00:59.190
Richelle Direny: We're giving a person

697
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.490
Richelle Direny: If you feeling like you're telling them it was okay.

698
01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:09.900
Crystal Gatwood: Maybe

699
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:12.690
Crystal Gatwood: Maybe

700
01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:19.530
Richelle Direny: If that's what it is. That's one part because you tell you

701
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.080
Richelle Direny: That's why it will be hard because you are

702
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:38.340
Richelle Direny: Thinking that by saying I forgive you. You are saying to them that it's okay or not okay what they did. So you're not gonna, I'm not gonna tell you that I forgive you.

703
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.340
Richelle Direny: Because it means that telling you it's okay what you did put stuff that's not

704
01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.350
Crystal Gatwood: That's not what you're doing.

705
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:52.230
Richelle Direny: And that's why it's hard for you to forgive, because in your mind. You feel like

706
01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:04.200
Richelle Direny: You should be punished for what you did. You should have retribution for what you did all of these things I want to see you suffer and if I tell you I forgive you. You're not going to go through that you're not going to feel how I felt.

707
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:11.790
Richelle Direny: And so maybe could be hot dogs my car. So it's understanding why forgiveness is so hard.

708
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:16.200
Richelle Direny: If I come in I step on your toes.

709
01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:18.690
Crystal Gatwood: And I see. I'm sorry.

710
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.790
Richelle Direny: You're not going to say I forgive you.

711
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.320
Richelle Direny: Because you feel like

712
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.670
Richelle Direny: I did it intentionally did it on purpose. So why should I forgive you for it.

713
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:30.960
Richelle Direny: It's how you look at the situation is your perception of it.

714
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:34.290
Richelle Direny: The perception of the word. And what does. Where do

715
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.450
Crystal Gatwood: I have to check it.

716
01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.430
Crystal Gatwood: Out that way, but

717
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:58.740
Richelle Direny: I forgive you for being

718
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.870
Richelle Direny: And not so great friend.

719
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:07.350
Richelle Direny: I forgive me, because

720
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:13.080
Richelle Direny: Maybe you never really understood what it meant to be a good friend. I forgive you.

721
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:17.340
Richelle Direny: Because maybe I set the bar too high for you. I forgive you.

722
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.490
Richelle Direny: And me seeing all of this is making me feel better because now

723
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.750
Crystal Gatwood: I'll

724
01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:24.780
Give you

725
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.080
Richelle Direny: And because I forgive you.

726
01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.720
Richelle Direny: I know that we can't continue.

727
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.690
Richelle Direny: Doing what they're doing, because I'm not. I'm no longer going to give you have that power.

728
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.940
Richelle Direny: Walking away.

729
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.120
With forgiveness.

730
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.190
Crystal Gatwood: Very

731
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.630
Crystal Gatwood: Definitely something I need to work on.

732
01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:07.980
Crystal Gatwood: That it's not like I'm angry. It's not like if somebody would step on my toes. Not like I'd be like, you know, all you did that purposely if you're like if I'm disrespected

733
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:11.130
Crystal Gatwood: I might have one thing

734
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.110
Crystal Gatwood: We're

735
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.350
Crystal Gatwood: Taking for full or

736
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.120
Richelle Direny: Fat

737
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:25.980
Richelle Direny: And so even though I give you that example in your mind, you need to conceptualize that

738
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:28.080
Richelle Direny: I didn't intentionally step on your toes.

739
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.120
Richelle Direny: And so if you know that I didn't intentionally do it you will forgive

740
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.950
Richelle Direny: In a disrespectful way.

741
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.470
Richelle Direny: That's when so it's based on how you see it.

742
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.840
Richelle Direny: Right. How you feel about it.

743
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.340

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.480
Crystal Gatwood: Okay.

752
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:37.650

Richelle Direny: And understanding the depth.

770
01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:14.160
