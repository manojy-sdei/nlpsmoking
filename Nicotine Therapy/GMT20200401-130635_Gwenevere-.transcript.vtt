Ariel Mirabal: I know I really, it's another goal. Actually, I need to quit smoking.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll put together a plan. OK. OK.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.290
Ariel Mirabal: I keep saying it, but it's

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.650
Ariel Mirabal: Well,

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it really on purpose. Let's really market and will do will do some real specific thing.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.340
Ariel Mirabal: Okay. Sorry, I'm trying to situate me okay I'm outside today.

14
00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh that's GORGEOUS THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL LIGHTING just beautiful. Alright.

15
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so how some how's the tension in the house, house a little girl has your anger. How we doing

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.450
Ariel Mirabal: It's really good actually no tension in the house. It's been really nice getting along with everybody.

17
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.440
Ariel Mirabal: Usually in that way here. Everybody is super sweet. And I'm always very helpful. I try to be as helpful as I can in any way.

18
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.330
Ariel Mirabal: As a matter of fact, as soon as we got off the phone last week.

19
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.210
Ariel Mirabal: I immediately started working on those breath exercises and I showed my daughter a couple of times she actually tried to do it. It was really cute.

20
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.690
Ariel Mirabal: Cute.

21
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.170
Ariel Mirabal: But

22
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.440
Ariel Mirabal: He just thinks it's more like it. She thinks it's funny, you know,

23
00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:01.140
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah. Well, I did do it, you know, and I do it, and I realized, too. After even in just a few days. I wasn't really sometimes I wouldn't really use the breathing exercises, but just really

24
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:16.140
Ariel Mirabal: I was able to just call my thoughts and I've been really calm and gentle with my daughter. You know, when it comes to the discipline and my voice. Okay, and things like that. So I've noticed the difference and myself. I've been doing really, really good. That's beautiful.

25
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You do seem quite different. I will say, I mean if you could sort of flashback and sort of picture how

26
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: If you felt sort of emotional emotionally air regulated and what was going on when you first came in.

27
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: As opposed to the way you're talking the way you were able to catch a thought that you didn't want to have or this calmness this access to choice that you can kind of shift the way your body's feeling

28
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds really different than the way you were talking earlier.

29
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.170
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, I do feel a lot different than I did last week I definitely do I feel better. I feel

30
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.970
Ariel Mirabal: Like a little more, a little lighter. I don't feel as heavy with my thoughts and things. That's fantastic.

31
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what thought you used to counterbalance a negative one. So sometimes we get into negative thinking this is a negative thought about self other the future of the world. What did you counter it with it seemed to neutralize a negative thought would you use

32
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.710
Ariel Mirabal: I stopped and thought about the previous outcomes which my gets super angry, you know,

33
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.020
Ariel Mirabal: In the past I remember a couple of times. My daughter even covering her ears because my voice was out

34
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:45.150
Ariel Mirabal: And that broke my heart so bad, like it made me feel like I actually scared her. You know, trying to discipline her I scared her. And that's not what I want. And it really broke my heart so bad. So

35
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.670
Ariel Mirabal: That's something that I've actually carried with me for a long time since she was really, really small. I mean, she was probably like two but

36
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.880
Ariel Mirabal: I just now, that like, I'm starting to really think about

37
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:14.880
Ariel Mirabal: Like the reactions and things that that causes. So that's kind of what I did. I'm like, What do I want to see happen when we were like, afterwards, you know, what do I want her to feel like afterwards so

38
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:26.760
Ariel Mirabal: And I told you before, like in the past, I get so upset. Sometimes, and even in the moment I'll tell myself, okay. Don't get so mad, but then she'll keep screaming about the same thing. And I'm like, Okay, stop. You know, and then I end up

39
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:38.400
Ariel Mirabal: snapping at her that I don't want to do that. Last time I was able to just, just stop for some some reason I was just, and she did. She had, she had a couple of little bits and

40
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.590
Ariel Mirabal: What I've been doing was there's this little cartoon that she watches. It's like a little clip cartoon she sees sometimes come every now and then.

41
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:56.250
Ariel Mirabal: There's this little boy named costly and he's it showed he's not nice. Sometimes he's can get sometimes kind of mean and bossy, with his toys.

42
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.120
Ariel Mirabal: And then his friends don't want to help him anymore. His friends didn't want to play with them anymore.

43
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:11.280
Ariel Mirabal: So I was using that like a couple of times. She threw her fits. And she kind of has a temper. I'm feeling like she saw me a couple of times. Like stubbed my toe or something and call it a name because she gets mad at her toys and she'll like

44
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.820
Ariel Mirabal: chopping it down on something and I'm like, oh, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Don't get so mad at your toy. You know, so

45
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.870
Ariel Mirabal: Oh yes thing.

46
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's a fun thing to

47
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about the breathing was really cute. Wait till you see this is we say, well wait a minute, what about that stuffed animal. Let's see if we can get that stuff down and I'll do some belly breathing. Let's see if we can teach it.

48
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.670
Ariel Mirabal: And see

49
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How we have a little, little yoga session with with the bear and the lion and and right and they breathe through their nose. They've got a tiny little nose, you see their belly going out. There we go. And it can be game.

50
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.050
Right, right.

51
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, instead of

52
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Law. She's learned that's how she might feel hammer hammer bad toy toy. And so no, now we can start this new thing and make it a game and we can be teaching and as she's teaching it. She's rehearsing it herself. How to do it. It's immersing and

53
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: narrative that

54
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting to see it. It's all just this adorable thing.

55
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.710
Ariel Mirabal: That's a good idea. Yeah.

56
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.770
Ariel Mirabal: It was really cute though. I love that. I love that a lot, but I've been able to just kind of tell myself like Okay, calm down. It's, you know,

57
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:38.160
Ariel Mirabal: Like I said, What do you want to see after after that. So I'll tell her, things like that. You don't want to be like pinky Petunia, you know, Pinky Petunia, kind of like the story I just told you.

58
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about pinky Petunia, what ends up happening to pinky Petunia and when she doesn't solve her emotions. Very well. What happens to her.

59
00:06:48.810 --> 00:07:00.060
Ariel Mirabal: So her friends kind of stop helping her and she's a pinky Petunia, she's beautiful pink flower and she needs her friends I guess to water her help her grow and

60
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:11.910
Ariel Mirabal: Water her and help her grow, you know, just like us and our friends, you know, water, the grass. So she needs her friends help, but when she starts being so mean to her friends. Nobody wants to help her anymore. So that's what I'm still thinking

61
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.580
Ariel Mirabal: So I always and she saw that story she started on her own. So I always I just remind her

62
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.970
Ariel Mirabal: Sometimes when she's outside and she'll throw a fit or

63
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:30.600
Ariel Mirabal: Something and she'll know Mom, stop. No, don't you know she'll get really upset about something and I'm not doing anything but trying to help her, you know. So I say, come down. Don't get too upset I'm just trying to help you.

64
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.010
Ariel Mirabal: Then she'll keep going and getting more upset that you're even in her way or something.

65
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's talk about that for a second. Let's talk about I'm trying to help her.

66
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: My ears are bad. So this isn't about you.

67
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.430
Ariel Mirabal: Know you're fine.

68
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You just have to keep reminding my new clients. My cuckoo bird thing I do here. So, so notice. Let's just see.

69
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're trying to help her. Is it because you want to play with your daughter or she's doing it wrong. Like, tell me about why you come in there and help her.

70
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:12.540
Ariel Mirabal: I'm like, Just yesterday, when we're in the backyard when she's she has this is what I'm so sad about it because I feel like it's a little bit of me and her dad because we both have a little bit of a short fuse.

71
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:19.860
Ariel Mirabal: And I see in her all the time she gets so upset with something so fast. I mean, quickly.

72
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:29.610
Ariel Mirabal: And it's not just like you see a little kid going, Oh, well, her, her shoe fell off and I can't get it to go back on you know the Barbie shoe. It's like

73
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:40.380
Ariel Mirabal: Oh, like she gets really mad at the shoe that won't go back on. You know what I mean. So it's like oh my gosh she gets she's she goes from one to 10 within like two seconds.

74
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:49.410
Ariel Mirabal: But so yesterday in the backyard. For instance, riding her bike. She's doing really good. She's, she's just learned this past summer, how to ride her bike.

75
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:57.420
Ariel Mirabal: So she's over here, riding a bike and she gets mad when she kind of like, she'll get stuck on something and she needs help, and my

76
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:12.930
Ariel Mirabal: Mom, and then she'll start screaming like she wants me to help her. So I'll go over to help. And I'll give her like a little push, and then it's really like is short and then after that. I'm like, in her way she's like, okay, Mom get Stop, stop, yet yet, you know, so

77
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in there right in that moment, what do you do with the very next thing you do.

78
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.410
Ariel Mirabal: Um,

79
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.680
Ariel Mirabal: After helping her or after she gets mad.

80
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I finished, she says, Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

81
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:39.990
Ariel Mirabal: So now I've been able to just, that's what I call giving her her space. So I will just try to give her her space and okay, like, go ahead. Mommy's gonna leave you alone.

82
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:46.680
Ariel Mirabal: So what's been working a little bit too is just telling her like when she throws fits like that. I'll tell her. Okay, you know what

83
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:59.610
Ariel Mirabal: I'm not going to play with you if you're going to throw a fit. And so before it was like, ah, like, don't do that. And I would get so upset at her for for doing that now it's like okay, you're gonna act like that. I'm just going to walk away.

84
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I, can I say something. Yeah.

85
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about what adults do. And you'll figure out what what's missing in here. If you remember, I'm not giving advice you do it, don't do it. That's up to you. I just, I love

86
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.020
Ariel Mirabal: I love advice.

87
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just as you were saying that I was like, there's a little recipe, a little missed opportunity for some shaping. Guess what, if I'm

88
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said you know what Arielle what I've done is

89
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been sort of keeping out on my schedule a place to kind of have timing during the week that really works around your child care really works around your sleep schedule your food prep and all those things. What would you say

90
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.070
Ariel Mirabal: Where I'm sorry, what's, what was the question if you

91
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Know wasn't a question. Let me try it again.

92
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If I gave you the perfect medicine that the next day you no longer had an urge to smoke. What would you say to me.

93
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing would you think of just now.

94
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.700
Ariel Mirabal: If you said you no longer had an urge or if I woke up and no longer have. I'm sorry. I'm like, missing it. I'm sorry.

95
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't be sorry. Just listen. Here we go. Ready.

96
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.330
Mm hmm.

97
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll try another one.

98
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I just bought you a car. What do you say to me.

99
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.500
Ariel Mirabal: Oh my god, thank you so much, but I can't accept this.

100
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the first thing he said to me.

101
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.110
Ariel Mirabal: I said, Oh my gosh, or thinking

102
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What was the second one.

103
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. Okay, let's rewind.

104
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: To your daughter and you

105
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: She asked for help. You did what

106
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.720
Ariel Mirabal: I helped her

107
00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And she did what

108
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.440
Ariel Mirabal: She got upset.

109
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's missing.

110
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.020
Ariel Mirabal: Um,

111
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.500
Ariel Mirabal: I think, oh,

112
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you.

113
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.650
Ariel Mirabal: Thank you. I thought about that. But I don't know how it sounds. How it would sound in the middle of that.

114
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. You want me to play with that a little bit. Do a little role play

115
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So we're always. I mean, I don't know what the family rules are in your home, but for some homes, not only are we shaping, you know, starting to extinguish negative behavior we're trying to reinforce positive behavior. So this could be an opportunity

116
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: For shaping behavior.

117
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.660
Ariel Mirabal: You know,

118
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So it could be, you know what, sweet pea. This is what we do when someone comes and helps us the very next thing. And as quickly as an end as generously as we can. We say thank you mommy.

119
00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wonderful, this would be a great time for you to say thank you mom. So I know that the help is done. It's a nice little sign and to help this done. That's a way to sell it to her.

120
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But really, it's also this very sweet thing we just do this little volley. That way it's back and forth. Then she has an option to get

121
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Overwhelming. It's just thank you mommy and off she goes, then we are showing sort of that interdependence, she can still ask for help. She has a really neat way.

122
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Of kind of taking the help that she asked for and you're not going to intrude to give more it's done, it's over, and nobody's mad. In fact, it creates space for the next time.

123
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And nobody's going to be upset over it. You're happy to give it and then you're Oh you're so welcome. Let me know if you get stuck again and off you go look like you're having fun. So we'll be

124
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this is what we do, you know, or right but it's going to take probably 15 times it's going to take a few. So then you say this to be a good time for. Thank you.

125
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So much

126
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: All play. That's the language of a child's play, play, play. That's how they communicate is through games.

127
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:29.340
Ariel Mirabal: Sounds about right. Actually, I'm sorry. My phone is going to be a little dizzy. I'm just gonna walk inside really quick and peek on my little baby she was supposed to be asleep, a little bit longer than I thought this morning, but she woke up early, so

128
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.610
Ariel Mirabal: Make sure she's okay and

129
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:43.110
Ariel Mirabal: I think grandma just left to so I'll be here with her today, you know, Hey baby, yeah. Okay.

130
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.270
Ariel Mirabal: She's just watching cartoons. She should be okay.

131
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.100
Ariel Mirabal: Alrighty.

132
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What does this make you think about just this little, little exchange, we're having here.

133
00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.080
Ariel Mirabal: What is it I'm like the conversation. What does it makes me think about

134
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:16.470
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, I guess my daughter. I'm always thinking about my daughter. And that's why she's like always, the number one thing that I'm always talking about she means so much to me. She's my number one. Go away. Dude, my dogs on my face.

135
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:27.240
Ariel Mirabal: But always always always thinking about my daughter and how ways that I can just be better all the time always ways I can be better.

136
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So this idea of

137
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: My bringing some you didn't ask for anything right. I, I sort of put it out there.

138
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens to be something you said you were interested in, but

139
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: For some would be like, well, who asked you, I didn't say I already know what to do.

140
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.590
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, well,

141
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's kind of what I'm checking in on is there.

142
00:15:53.730 --> 00:16:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there an interest in continuing like I feel like I don't know what to do. Sometimes, this was so why don't we cross check to what the modeling was in your childhood.

143
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Where, where, how were you taught about how to accept help. And there's different kinds of health. There's how to accept help that we asked for.

144
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone forcing help when we already feel capable. In fact, we want to feel smart ourselves and capable and it's forced on us and it's like it doesn't feel like help it feels intrusive.

145
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:36.030
Ariel Mirabal: I think that over my time and like my adult years i've i've grown with that a little bit more than what I was raised with because now I am a little bit more open minded and accepting for help.

146
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.730
Ariel Mirabal: Different sorts like emotional health as well as

147
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.170
Ariel Mirabal: Like

148
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:55.500
Ariel Mirabal: I guess just emotional health and you know what I mean, things like that. But my mom has she's always been the person, my parents, my dad.

149
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.380
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, not so much. But my mom basically instilled in us that

150
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:11.850
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, just don't ask for help, unless you absolutely have to. It was one of the most you know if you want things done the right way you do it yourself and don't ever ask help

151
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:21.660
Ariel Mirabal: Ask for help, unless you absolutely have to. And so I mean all of my life growing up. I've as soon as I was out on my own. That was it. I've never

152
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:33.060
Ariel Mirabal: I've been through struggles in my life, but I've never called my mom or dad and said, hey, I need 20 bucks. You know, I was raised to never do that. So there's never been like, hey, I need help, you know, it's been

153
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:47.460
Ariel Mirabal: Shit, this is my life. I'm on my own now, this is I gotta do this, you know, so that's kind of how when it comes like advice and somebody like offering their help and the lending hand and things. It's also hard for me to accept somebody to help

154
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I saw a little bit of that in here, it wasn't, it wasn't like grievous, but it was sort of clunky like like not really sort of intuitively knowing

155
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Oh my gosh, came first, like shock.

156
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:12.570
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, like taking back by something and not being able to accept it because it's too too much, you know, or

157
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:19.320
Ariel Mirabal: You know, I don't think I've ever been given and something that I've had to like declined, but

158
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:32.580
Ariel Mirabal: I've, I've, I've said no to offerings of help before you know and then even sometimes when there's people that are like sometimes, you know, everybody needs help sometimes and it's okay to ask for help and

159
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.800
Ariel Mirabal: I've heard that a million times, but it's not something I can do. I just can't ask people for help.

160
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's going to show up in here.

161
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I've learned at this point that typically if we have a particular dynamic elsewhere, it'll show up in really sort of even microscopic ways in the therapeutic relationship, it'll show up in here.

162
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.450
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

163
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.840
Ariel Mirabal: I'm definitely that person.

164
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can stack me up on maybe some books like something up. So you and I can see each other I level. Do you have maybe like some Tupperware or

165
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:19.710
Ariel Mirabal: I do or something, but I'm just and you know what my daughter is the only person care. So I can actually sit

166
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When she knows where you are.

167
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:24.450
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

168
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.640
Ariel Mirabal: He's in the living room watching cartoons. Let me see here.

169
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's fantastic. That's nice, nice high level.

170
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.550
Ariel Mirabal: Is that better. Okay.

171
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.450
Wonderful.

172
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So as I was saying, there will be a dynamics that are probably familiar to you. It will play out in here too.

173
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.330
Okay.

174
00:19:49.890 --> 00:20:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to invite you to go outside of what's familiar to stretch to grow, you can ask for help, meaning, and I don't really see it as help. I see it as more like just information you're asking someone's

175
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: professional opinion actual experience no clinical understanding what's the, what's the physiology behind that that that doesn't speak to a deficit of yours because I happen to have a different skill set, it doesn't

176
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: make you weak because I have a strength, it doesn't work. Inversely, like that. It doesn't, you know, this happens to be a very unique relationship. It's not quite as reciprocal as our typical ones you're going to remain the taker for 99.9% of it.

177
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So it might, it might feel a little uncomfortable for you. So tell me what's going on with your shoulders.

178
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.450
I

179
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.240
Ariel Mirabal: I slept a little weird or I don't know if it happened just this morning. But when I was like

180
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:05.670
Ariel Mirabal: rolling over and trying to get out of bed. I think I pulled something and why like shoulder and it hurts so bad. So I've been sitting here all morning like trying to figure out why it's hurting so bad.

181
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:14.670
Ariel Mirabal: That it's like it's like nerve somewhere that I've never felt before. And it's Oh god, it's so uncomfortable. So I'm going like waving my

182
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

183
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well keep keep paying attention to it. I want you to take care of yourself.

184
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.330
Ariel Mirabal: Weird, but it's. It'll be all right. Just a pinch or something.

185
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.220
Ariel Mirabal: So like

186
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It to the degree that you can kind of do this with me. I'd like to do a little bit of, see if they put it in here for me.

187
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to do some of this preparation work.

188
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: See how much time we have half hour.

189
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right, let's do a couple of things that are what I will call preparation and resourcing okay

190
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Put that will put that up in

191
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm putting the plan that's not in there.

192
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do this. I'd like to work it, work with imagery

193
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I want to do a few exercises. One of them is a container and emotional container. One of them is a distancing metaphor and the other one's a little bit longer. Not sure we'll have time for it, but I'm going to try and it has to do with three resource characters.

194
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That I may incorporate in some of the work that we do other types of techniques. But it's nice for me to kind of know where your go to Resources are so I can bring in some imagery, some sort of the way that you say I need to think about the outcome.

195
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can shift the neural network fisherman and you can focus where you want to

196
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If I kind of know where your resources are, I can say that my can remind you if something's going on. I can say them out loud, it'll be in a section. The plan section.

197
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Where they're going to be there. They're going to follow us all the way through treatment. So I can bring us back. And instead, I don't have to keep asking you, it'll be right there.

198
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, you have. I don't think you've had a lot a lot of therapy. So if you want to laugh at me, you

199
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.750
Ariel Mirabal: You're more than welcome to but

200
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, you know, firstly, if it seems totally ridiculous plenty of people have said this is just to cookie can't. But everybody ends up doing it once you get past the giggle um

201
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's fun. So, let's say, let's start with the first one. Let's do a really, really easy one.

202
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sure, or I imagine you've probably said, oh, you know, I know how to compartmentalize I know how to push off to the side, this memory. This spot and compartmentalize me that's a term that I think I'm mainstream psychology offers people I know how to block it out.

203
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right right blocked it out for the day.

204
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Painter is so we're going to actually get an image of it. So let me give an instruction. Let's develop an emotional

205
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And painter. Here are the instructions and this is the right side of your brain right now. It's not literal. This is metaphor. This is imagination. Okay, so let's go to I

206
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to think of a container and here are the requirements.

207
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That is big enough.

208
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong enough to hold and contain all of your emotional stuff can be anything. Try not to censor yourself. You can just try to track was your first idea was big enough strong enough to hold all your emotional stuff, what comes up for you.

209
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.840
Ariel Mirabal: The first thing that popped up was a library.

210
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

211
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And what, what's the library made of

212
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.880
Ariel Mirabal: brick walls. Okay.

213
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of how big is it

214
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.570
Ariel Mirabal: I'm

215
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.650
Ariel Mirabal: A cathedral. That's my daughter, she's right here.

216
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:09.420
I figured

217
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.490
Ariel Mirabal: Maybe

218
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so Cathedral. So I'll say

219
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: A theatrical size library made of brick walls. Am I getting that

220
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. Beautiful. So I have a sense, a sense of its size. I have a sense of its material. And now, how will all of that stuff. Let's say you decide to put it in there for a day.

221
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Or even for an hour and we want to compartmentalize me. Let's say we're running out of time. And we've only got five minutes left in the session and something really

222
00:25:46.650 --> 00:26:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Significant came up for you and I might invite you, let's let's take what's coming up for you right now and let's put it in this library and let's make sure it stays. So my question to you is, how is it going to stay in there.

223
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:11.520
Ariel Mirabal: Like an if it's like an issue or something problematic coming up right now that I'm thinking about

224
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: How I'm going to keep it in there.

225
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.060
Ariel Mirabal: As well, of course, trying to

226
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.150
Ariel Mirabal: Block it out, trying not

227
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're just so go back to metaphor. We know we know the size and we know what is the material. How you gonna keep that stuff in in the container.

228
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.090
Ariel Mirabal: lock the door.

229
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go with my, like, I like it out. Be specific.

230
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.140
Ariel Mirabal: Lock it with the key.

231
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The key.

232
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.620
Ariel Mirabal: I do

233
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what kind of key is it it's

234
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:50.790
Ariel Mirabal: A metal key.

235
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just your regular like nothing, you know, just like

236
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll SCHLAG

237
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:57.870
Yeah.

238
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that you're the only one that has the key.

239
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.180
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, my the one key.

240
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. You got it. I would have gotten you there eventually. If you hadn't come up with that.

241
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:10.470
Ariel Mirabal: So,

242
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to say it like this and this just utterly confused. Most people about some interesting. I got some interesting answers from it. Typically, I would say this. What's going to make that stuff, want to stay in there.

243
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a different answer. I've gotten different answers for that.

244
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Some people said, Oh, there's a disco ball. There's velvet pillows. It's like genie in a bottle.

245
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to stay because there's a whole lot more fun in there than it is coming out here. One person said, I don't give a flying all that stuff, you just stay in there and have a pity party ain't coming out anyway misery loves company can stand now care.

246
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.080
You know,

247
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Like just, I was like, Oh, such a cool. So although it's a really fun, fun question um

248
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This one really gets to the metaphor of it's a container. It's lockable there's a, you know, there's obviously a door. There's a locking system you have the one key. So then you decide when you want to open it and take a peek and take

249
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.000
Ariel Mirabal: On what you want.

250
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.340
Ariel Mirabal: So what's going to make it want to stay in there.

251
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.060
Ariel Mirabal: That's a really good one.

252
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.130
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, that's really cool. The first thing I could think of when you said that was

253
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:39.060
Ariel Mirabal: I did not really like I really wrap my mind around it. What's going to make you want to stay in there. So I would say the

254
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:46.140
Ariel Mirabal: Remembering remembering how bad it felt to be in that time.

255
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:54.390
Ariel Mirabal: Or you know how bad the outcome was just remembering the negative feelings.

256
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:55.950
Ariel Mirabal: Is going to

257
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:05.370
Ariel Mirabal: Make me want to keep them in there, but it's not. I don't know if it's kind of what's going to make them want to stay in there as a different question.

258
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:06.240
So,

259
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: With that

260
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.140
You've got something so

261
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.580
Ariel Mirabal: Okay.

262
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.170
If we stay with metaphor.

263
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.150
Ariel Mirabal: Say this

264
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm the

265
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason why you're carrying in this

266
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.150
Today, okay.

267
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: All the behavior associated

268
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:38.640
Ariel Mirabal: Here.

269
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.560
Ariel Mirabal: And assuming

270
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative outcome.

271
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

272
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch this.

273
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Is right outside the door. So watch if I leave it inside locked up. Wait, wait, I'm going to stay in here because if I open up the door and go outside.

274
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm unleashed.

275
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And here.

276
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.720
Ariel Mirabal: Remember that outcome you started today with

277
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: There's all these outcomes. I felt about the outcome. So it net must know as it sits inside the cathedral. If I go outside.

278
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to blast the world with negativity. I'm going to have loss of money job respect.

279
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: guilt, shame, I don't know what your outcome stories are you just said a lot about the negative outcome. You didn't give me a lot of stories about it. But do you see that that might be what will keep it inside. Well, if I go outside.

280
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All this, I'm going to really lay flat this this woman and her core values. So maybe it will want to stay inside. Maybe there's a poster on the door. Push handle only when

281
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: emergency exit only, like, I don't know. That's how we stay with metaphor and it forces us to really see it forces the mind to really take a look at causal relationships, two things.

282
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of an interesting thing.

283
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.240
Ariel Mirabal: There.

284
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about

285
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.390
Ariel Mirabal: This

286
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.250
Ariel Mirabal: She's like, well,

287
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.710
Ariel Mirabal: I'm it's just it's a really interesting question.

288
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.730
Ariel Mirabal: What would make it one to stay in there.

289
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do some more of these. I think it'll, it'll come on its own. Watch. Let's do the next one. Watch this. That wouldn't that when we're done. That was gorgeous. Let's do the next one. It let it come organically it

290
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Just goes, Oh my gosh, those are those are the keepers. So let's do the next one. I think you're gonna like this one, next one is a distancing one for to not only is this concept of container as cathedral like that is not a little box that's like right

291
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Profound right, in a sense, that's my impression and it's made it sort of this brick.

292
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: solid material to now I want you to

293
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a distancing metaphor.

294
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So for some people, it'll look like this. I'm on the riverbank and

295
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a memory of something and I place it on a leaf and I watch it.

296
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of be pumped up and down as it goes down the creek and hit the rocks and sort of move and

297
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And I watch it, but it moves further and further away to the point that oh I can't see it anymore.

298
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But I stay grounded on the riverbank

299
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I might also Stephen inside a balloon right and

300
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Get some helium in there and make a little think food and let it go and it just goes into the atmosphere and I watch it. In fact, I can't distinguish it anymore from the blue. Like, I can't even tell a corn. It's gone.

301
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But it drifted off sort of slowly for some people is a rocket ship. They're like, I need this out a year now.

302
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And off it goes. Shooting Star.

303
00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's a sailboat, as they say, on mature and it slowly sales away and they can see it people. It's a ship for some people, this one.

304
00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm driving in my car and I'm heading in this direction as my arms are and I see coming towards me girl and it passes by just so briefly and I see it only for a second and then I watched it in my rearview mirror

305
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And I keep my eye on my destination and I look in the rearview mirror and then

306
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't even see it back there anymore, but it's certainly going in the opposite direction. I can't even see it. So you notice how they're all or this one also train

307
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun. One of the cars and, you know, maybe you can even picture the wording of it and it moves.

308
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.090
You can hear it clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, and it moves further and further away.

309
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can no longer hear it distinguished from the sounds around you and now you can't even tell you can't hear it. You can't see it.

310
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're allowed left grounded right here okay and fine. You get the idea.

311
00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. What is

312
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:39.510
Ariel Mirabal: Like you just start forgetting, not necessarily forgetting about it, but you're not necessarily remembering it. It's you've you've locked it away for such a long time that that bad memory or whatever it was just starts to fade away.

313
00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So that is the reason, what's sounds like that might be a reason for you to use it. But I am being literal. You remember that you actually told me the image of the container.

314
00:34:51.390 --> 00:35:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to hear from you what will be our distancing metaphor that if I see you in distress and I invite you to use a distancing metaphor to get some distance from the intensity of an emotion, a thought or a memory, we can put it in this metaphor.

315
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.820
Ariel Mirabal: You are

316
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What metaphor came up

317
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I can write down

318
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.220
Ariel Mirabal: I don't even know.

319
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.940
Ariel Mirabal: I really liked if we're

320
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.220
Ariel Mirabal: I mean those

321
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.250
Ariel Mirabal: The very first question that you asked.

322
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.540
Ariel Mirabal: I already forgot what it was. My mind is like dancing around me right now. I'm thinking too hard now.

323
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You are so so Arielle you have a therapist. That's me. You get a break. You use your analytical mind in a really beautiful way, but you can take a break.

324
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you can let this therapeutic process unfold, you can relax and receive help

325
00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You can let me do that part. I'll do all the psychoanalysis, I'll do that. That's why I'm here.

326
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Use you can free up your mind to have a first response you have them and then you analyze

327
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one's the right one done it all these things. I don't know what's going on. But you don't have to do that. That's what I was saying. Early on, try not to censor. Let me just see. As I was giving you those examples which one. If you go wow I'm stupid or oh hey I kind of, I like that.

328
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:41.130
Ariel Mirabal: One that I just can't remember what the question was, but it was the one that I last one, the one that I was like really stuck on that was really an interesting question. Um, I think it was

329
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:48.360
Ariel Mirabal: What would make it what would make them want to stay in there, your memories want to stay in the

330
00:36:49.230 --> 00:37:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Base. You know, is it so that you stay kind of stuck on that. And even though I get like five examples of distancing metaphors, you kind of tuned out a little bit. Is that possible.

331
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:09.270
Ariel Mirabal: Um, possibly. I'm not sure. But I think that I was just thinking entirely too hard.

332
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because this is a completely different tasks we were done with container. We've moved on.

333
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To another one. And I gave you some examples of distancing

334
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.590
Ariel Mirabal: Metaphors

335
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember either one. Let me just check and see if you remember any of the little things. I just did in front of you right maybe distancing metaphor. First, let me make sure you you know what a metaphor is so I'm not using the wrong word.

336
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.310
Ariel Mirabal: Thank you. Okay.

337
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's no way. There's no way for you to do this wrong.

338
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way for you to do this wrong.

339
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.980
Ariel Mirabal: So you don't have to

340
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Worry that you're doing this wrong. All you have to do is just lean in to the next question.

341
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.790
To the next invitation.

342
00:37:50.520 --> 00:38:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just start just want to check and see how where your mind was because I did like five different examples. I want to know if you're kind of remember any of them have a distancing

343
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What it for you remember any of the little roll the little metaphors. I did just five minutes ago, two months ago.

344
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:20.280
Ariel Mirabal: Not specifically. I mean, I was listening and watching. It's kind of like one of those you're listening, but you're not hearing. I mean, I'm so tune in to what you're saying but i just i don't know i

345
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. So, you know,

346
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.830
Ariel Mirabal: Maybe I was thinking I think I'm still because I was still like stuck on your last question, trying to like explain to myself.

347
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:38.880
Ariel Mirabal: Oh my gosh, I think I was literally thinking about that still while I was trying to listen to what you were saying. So I don't specifically remember all or any of those

348
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not any

349
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the neat thing. So I'm going to put a little pin in this right now. Number one, I want to give you some some props for hopefully not getting offended or hurt because I'm focusing in

350
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: On I'm trying to see where your mind goes kind of how it works.

351
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you really stay quite interested in this particular question and you weren't done yet. You wanted to kind of keep processing it and I had moved on with the next activity.

352
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of hear sound coming out of me and see my little hands moving up but you weren't processing what I was doing. And so that it really didn't get started.

353
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:19.200
Ariel Mirabal: Right.

354
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We have, we have only so much. It's like our, our desk it. That's our working memory. We don't have we can have everything on it, we can only be thinking about

355
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of one thing. So I invited that container to be done if you weren't done. So let's go back to that one. You seem very interested in this enough, if that's as far as we get today that's okay too. I told you no wrong way to do it. We've got to do it on your face.

356
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.430
Ariel Mirabal: And that's okay. I'm just, I think that I was really just

357
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.570
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know why. Honestly, I just was really stuck on that question, it's

358
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.080
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

359
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:12.060
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know. I mean, that was still I basically can't even I'm still trying to and there is something you said that was I was still thinking about to I was picturing the whatever person had said the

360
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.910
Ariel Mirabal: There was cool things in there like the leather chair.

361
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:26.640
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah so funny. But I mean I'm literally I'm still thinking about what would really what would keep

362
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.490
Ariel Mirabal: Them in there, what would

363
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.940
Ariel Mirabal: What would make them want to stay in there. What I'm trying to say. I literally I'm still so stuck on that question.

364
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, then we'll spend time on it, why don't we do this. I love metaphors. Why don't we stop calling it them. And let's give it a list. What do we really

365
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: As I labeled an emotional container.

366
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But what are you thinking specifically

367
00:40:53.670 --> 00:41:00.060
Ariel Mirabal: There's good and bad memories. I guess I, of course, everyone's got both good and bad are we talking about both

368
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe that's the problem.

369
00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:02.760
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

370
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that we really want to put in there. The good ones.

371
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.770
Ariel Mirabal: Right, because we're trying to keep them in there. We're not trying to put away the good memories, right, just the bad ones.

372
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: About we say a negative emotional container. Now let's get

373
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative

374
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative anything memory.

375
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Physical pain emotional pain right

376
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative self appraisal. It can be anything.

377
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.550
Ariel Mirabal: There's just a thought. Okay.

378
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going to make it want to stay in there.

379
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:03.420
Ariel Mirabal: Gonna make a mistake in their cars. That's such. I don't know why that's so hard for me to

380
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone, that's why I stopped asking it because it's so difficult.

381
00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.270
Ariel Mirabal: To think

382
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know well I've got what we can come at it we can again. What if we had that if you trusted the unconscious, a little bit and just let it come organically, the answer will come. Now I gave you one, actually, I gave you this poster.

383
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.890
Ariel Mirabal: I gave you something.

384
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't stick it didn't work for you. But that was when you thought that good memories to work in there.

385
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.910
Ariel Mirabal: Right. Yes.

386
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's shift for just a second. Let that sit in the back in the in the unconscious let it sit back or see if you have any self trust, just to let the unconscious sort of let let black come up with one phone you can focus on that I'm about to introduce something else. Do you remember

387
00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember the first day we met after the bio psychosocial that I said I kind of think I distinguish the addict voice from the authentic voice. I kind of take the self and split it down. Remember that

388
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:08.850
Yes.

389
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we did that. And we said, What would keep the attic in the Cathedral.

390
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.250
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, that's a better way.

391
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there we go. What's gonna want help that addict stay in there.

392
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll shut up.

393
00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:41.340
Ariel Mirabal: That's okay. I'm just thinking about my mind positive actions. I'm still really I don't think I'm thinking too much too far outside of the box yet but I'm just thinking about what how the way that you just asked

394
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:51.360
Ariel Mirabal: I mean my positivity my my happiness my positive actions to things or actions or reactions to things would make

395
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.190
Ariel Mirabal: I guess that's more of still would make me want to keep those things in there.

396
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's all that's the problem. So when we get when we step out of we we say, okay, I'm going to characterize these because it obviously know it's all you. But for this to work. We got it, take it out and you got to use symbols and we

397
00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:11.010
Got

398
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to pull them apart.

399
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad guy good guy devil angel, you know, we pull them addict and Arielle

400
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to help Arielle whoops, or else the white one obviously a cliched

401
00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Can help it. So this is you, the authentic self.

402
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This is right. This is the one that we want to keep in the in the

403
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In the, in the library.

404
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it going to survive in there. What is it going to feed off of what will sustain it. What will happen if it stays in there.

405
00:44:54.900 --> 00:45:10.170
Ariel Mirabal: Is what's going to make it want to stay in there is being surrounded, probably by all of its continuous negativity. Those are all the negative thoughts. So it's going to be, it's going to want to be surrounded by all of its negativity. So it's going to be

406
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.290
Ariel Mirabal: It's going to want to stay in there.

407
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you know what fuels.

408
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.450
Ariel Mirabal: The edit going to need

409
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:38.250
Ariel Mirabal: Off of those emotions those cravings for the alcohol or the substance, the addiction itself, it's, it's going to feed off of your cravings there and the negativity, I guess. Okay, and that's going to make it want to stay in

410
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:42.960
Ariel Mirabal: Itself.

411
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:44.580
Ariel Mirabal: Oh,

412
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Say we say that this is this is addiction. It's addict voice is addiction is the addict, as many new ways and unfortunately this field really struggles with its own name, actually. But anyway, so we'll call this the addict.

413
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Will will how they want to stay in there is when

414
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You get a craving.

415
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Craving, and there will lock it up.

416
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: When you have a negative thought. You can see this with a negative thought and good luck with them.

417
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would add

418
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: One more thing.

419
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I would add that what fuels.

420
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict, the most

421
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.980
Ariel Mirabal: Say that one more time.

422
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What heals the addict is shame.

423
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So as soon as you dip into I'm a bad person. I'm a bad mom I did bad I am bad even a fraction of a second, the second to catch one of those, and I am

424
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Not smart enough good enough.

425
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not enough, stick it in there and addict. Just gonna just love it.

426
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell you what it does absolutely nothing.

427
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Games.

428
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Which I haven't gotten into which is a really important distinction that I invite people to play with, um, but I imagine that you're still really trying to work that first question, what will be what will the attic want inside the library.

429
00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So that it doesn't want to come out.

430
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.680
Come up with some things

431
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:53.910
Ariel Mirabal: Continue feeding it with my negative thoughts get it once know put them in there and don't let them out. And of course, when you're feeding it what it wants. It's not going to want to come out.

432
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.500
Ariel Mirabal: So,

433
00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: The Burger King. So one concern. I don't want to take a chance that what feeding looks like as you continue to think of them.

434
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.740
Ariel Mirabal: Right.

435
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And that concerns me because when I know about

436
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.720
Ariel Mirabal: If we continue

437
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what creating typically is for people. They won't know where that first thought came from. It was a smell it was

438
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Something I saw it was

439
00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So frustrated with a relationship. They're not really aware of the proceedings stimulus there sure where have

440
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A picture of pills a picture relief. The and then it continuously keep adding a lie might still know someone. Why would feel really good. Keep feeding that thought.

441
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's my concern, not what I'm wanting. I'm going with your metaphor, because I haven't done this with anyone quite the way we're doing it together. My concern has to do with the verb.

442
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I like the

443
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.230
Ariel Mirabal: Way like feeding it and putting it away.

444
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:53.640
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

445
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: As in, you had this thought you love you put it away. You did not

446
00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Find more of his buddies.

447
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

448
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:09.480
Ariel Mirabal: You're not like, okay, I see what you're saying. You're not feeding it, you're just exactly you're you're putting it away.

449
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:11.250
Ariel Mirabal: Lock it up.

450
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.680
Ariel Mirabal: Walking away. Yeah.

451
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't get to you.

452
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:18.660
Ariel Mirabal: Right.

453
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are the you're the authentic self. You're the woman that loves her daughter wants to do the next right thing wants to move another generation forward with loving kindness communication compassion growth, development.

454
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.180
Right, yeah.

455
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:37.860
Yeah.

456
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:40.890
Ariel Mirabal: Are

457
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:42.390
Ariel Mirabal: You

458
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So I think, I think we're good on that. I think I feel better about I don't want you to keep thinking right

459
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.140
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, yes, absolutely.

460
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, we really got deep into that metaphor. And now we've got two minutes. One minute.

461
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.490
Ariel Mirabal: I was so stuck in that for such a such a while.

462
00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It might have quite a profound impact when you and I, we might have really solidify it to the point that when you and I are doing other work.

463
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And something's going on. I can quickly redirect and you will know just what to do now, because you spend so much time with it. And I would say now when you get a craving.

464
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a negative self appraisal appraisal. Like I could have been here in my life, or look what I did when you have one of those you immediately.

465
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know if there's like a little drop in the top of the ceiling, open it and just drop it in.

466
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When you don't even have to open the front door. Don't know what your system kind of me really getting into that before it's locked up can't get out it satiated with more negative, right. More shame sting field in there and then eventually, maybe you and I will talk about

467
00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: History

468
00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.310
Ariel Mirabal: Yes.

469
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.110
Ariel Mirabal: That sounds like a plan.

470
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Long term, maybe we don't want to feed it anymore.

471
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:09.870
Ariel Mirabal: Yes.

472
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I think you're getting it.

473
00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:14.760
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, absolutely.

474
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That was fun.

475
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got one minute left here, why don't you kind of kind of go inside for little self reflection just sort of as if you know this movie was rewind from the beginning, you see, how we started and how it progressed and how we are

476
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:33.750
Ariel Mirabal: Into the session.

477
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see what you're coming away with

478
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.740
Ariel Mirabal: From all of what we've talked about today.

479
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:45.300
Ariel Mirabal: Is that what you mean. Yes.

480
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: open ended question. Yes.

481
00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.690
Ariel Mirabal: Um, well, first of all, that question.

482
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.240
Ariel Mirabal: Um,

Gwenevere Abriel: Wide open question. What are you noticing about you.

486

Ariel Mirabal: I'm just noticing a lot I'm noticing a lot of change about me.

487
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.910
Ariel Mirabal: I'm definitely being able to

488
00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:22.380
Ariel Mirabal: Do things I can even say a little bit more openly. I'm like,

489
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:32.880
Ariel Mirabal: I'm a lot more calm. I'm able to keep myself calm when I'm you know when something's happening instead of getting all worked up right away.

490
00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:48.600
Ariel Mirabal: It seems like my patients is a lot better with my daughter. And like I said things around around here. I just feel like a, I feel like a calmer person I know that I'm the same person and you don't just change overnight, but I feel

491
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:57.180
Ariel Mirabal: I feel at peace. Right now I feel totally okay. And I don't think that I could have said that a week ago.

Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, absolutely. It feels really good. I'm intense i'm i'm content. Excuse me.
