00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.980
tracy jackson: Can you hear me.

2
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.750
tracy jackson: Hi, can you hear me.

3
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.100
Alcatel 7: Yes. Yes. Hello. Can you hear me.

4
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.600
tracy jackson: Yes, I can. And do you go about Timothy

5
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.870
Alcatel 7: Yes, yes. Timothy, or Tim

6
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.440
tracy jackson: Okay. Hi, I'm Tracy Jackson. Nice to meet you.

7
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.410
Alcatel 7: Nice to be here. Sorry about that. I think would be one in front of the number

8
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.960
tracy jackson: I see. Okay.

9
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:18.540
tracy jackson: And how is your internet connection, it looks like it is a little weak here. Can you hear

10
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.020
Everything.

11
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.790
Alcatel 7: I can let me see if I can get over here and see if it gets a little better.

12
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.060
tracy jackson: Okay, if, as we continue to

13
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.570
Alcatel 7: Get better

14
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:40.860
tracy jackson: Yes. If, as we continue the connection gets poor, we can turn off our videos and that up to help with the connection. Okay.

15
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:43.230
Alcatel 7: Perfect.

16
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:51.750
tracy jackson: Okay. Well, Tim. Tell me something about yourself that doesn't have anything to do with pain or health just who you are.

17
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.290
Alcatel 7: Um, let's see. I'm, I'm just a basic family man.

18
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.440
Alcatel 7: Married with I used to have three children. Oh, I have to my daughter passed away.

19
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.180
Alcatel 7: I got sick about 10 years ago.

20
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.660
Alcatel 7: I was still working trying to hide everything I have epilepsy.

21
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.850
Alcatel 7: Heart disease.

22
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.460
Alcatel 7: I've had reconstructive surgery on my right shoulder twice.

23
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.080
Alcatel 7: Now needed on my left shoulder.

24
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.420
Alcatel 7: I spend most of my time. I mean, art, and I love oil painting pastels.

25
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.590
Alcatel 7: Anything has to do with art anything creative

26
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.670
Alcatel 7: And now nowadays.

27
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.680
Alcatel 7: I've been out of work with my snapper, a couple of years.

28
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.710
Alcatel 7: With trying to get through disability.

29
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.300
Alcatel 7: So most of my time I spend with my son, which is 19 now.

30
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.170
Okay.

31
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:09.090
Alcatel 7: They'll between my wife and my son getting into little bits here and there that I can do. I'm kind of limited so I let him do most of the work.

32
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:31.200
tracy jackson: So I hear that you you value your family and your ability to create and to to paint and and about 10 years ago is when you really noticed a change that has sort of lead a change in your health that has led you here.

33
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.820
Alcatel 7: Yeah, exactly. I was able to hide my health.

34
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.360
Alcatel 7: Especially my seizures for

35
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.760
Alcatel 7: Quite a few years.

36
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:42.810
Alcatel 7: Up until a few

37
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:44.190
tracy jackson: Years.

38
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:52.080
Alcatel 7: And started to come on, just without notice at all. Okay. And I averaged a seizure every other day.

39
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.770
Alcatel 7: That I couldn't hide it anymore.

40
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:05.700
tracy jackson: So so 10 tell me in your own words. I know you've received a lot of diagnoses from the healthcare system and everything through the years. But what do you think

41
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:16.020
tracy jackson: Having lived with yourself for 24 7365 your whole life. Like, what do you think are the different things that are contributing to your pain.

42
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.570
Alcatel 7: Um,

43
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:25.110
Alcatel 7: Think with my shoulder when it, when when it. Well, I lost most of my ability.

44
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Alcatel 7: I lost about 40% to 50%

45
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.550
Alcatel 7: And I guess going back and forth to the doctors

46
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:44.370
Alcatel 7: And I have deteriorating nerves that the the general nerve variation in my legs.

47
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:50.190
Alcatel 7: So my SOMEONE'S hitting my legs with a hammer at all times.

48
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:58.050
Alcatel 7: I think the biggest thing with me is just is is just being able to get around.

49
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:04.380
Alcatel 7: Not being there, like I should be for my wife and my son. He

50
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:18.360
Alcatel 7: And going back and forth with different doctors and having them try you know medicine medicine and for medicine, the doctors that I've been seeing in the past, up until now.

51
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.610
Alcatel 7: All they want to do is just throw me on medication.

52
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:24.510
tracy jackson: You know,

53
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.780
Alcatel 7: Vice that it will current that I've been on an MS cotton in Norco

54
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.760
Alcatel 7: It really in a way that I function.

55
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:41.850
Alcatel 7: I don't like to be we're not in control and I my head's not clear.

56
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:51.180
Alcatel 7: And that though that was a big part of the medications and they were they based off of working

57
00:25:52.980 --> 00:26:01.590
Alcatel 7: So I will basically just take them as as the maintenance slowly wouldn't get their bed. I was laying in bed, most of the time.

58
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.770
tracy jackson: Mm hmm. So are you still there. Oh, and

59
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:18.540
Alcatel 7: Then it's, I mean the depression is what really got got into it, anxiety and depression.

60
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.560
Mm hmm.

61
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.860
Alcatel 7: So you got to a point right I

62
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.780
Alcatel 7: Think so.

63
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.460
tracy jackson: So you've been seeing pain doctors off and on for about 10 years

64
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:32.880
Alcatel 7: Of what

65
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:38.430
tracy jackson: You've been seeing pain. Doctors often on for about 10 years

66
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.610
Alcatel 7: Yeah yeah

67
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:54.540
tracy jackson: I'm going to try to stop my video and see if that helps. Maybe you can stop your video and see if we get a better signal.

68
00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.670
Alcatel 7: Oh, let's see here.

69
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:01.710
Alcatel 7: Video

70
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.390
Alcatel 7: There, you guys are better.

71
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.540
tracy jackson: It seems to be better. Can you hear me.

72
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.150
Alcatel 7: I can, I can

73
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:34.080
tracy jackson: Okay, and so it sounds like for about 10 years she's been seeing various pain doctors mainly to get medications to treat this pain. It's not really certain exactly where it's coming from. But it's nerve pain in your legs and potentially associated with the seizures and pain in your shoulders.

74
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.640
Correct.

75
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:50.250
tracy jackson: And through this and you've really developed severe feelings of desperation not not desperation so much as just depression feeling unable to

76
00:27:50.670 --> 00:28:03.180
tracy jackson: Do the things that you would like to do and be there for your family in the way that you can because of this pain and because of the difficulty coming on and off the United side effects of the medicines for instance.

77
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.790
Alcatel 7: Yeah, exactly. And also with my seizures, my, my body.

78
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.650
Alcatel 7: Because I I have seizures about once a month on a minimum

79
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:19.410
Alcatel 7: And my my body itself just tenses up so much that good.

80
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.410
Alcatel 7: And I fall in everything else. And so the pain with that as well. It just

81
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:34.170
Alcatel 7: It just adds on to it right and unwanted me go through this and he remembers how I used to be.

82
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.790
Alcatel 7: And I can see the you know the disappointment, you know, not that he doesn't understand but you know he's

83
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:48.480
Alcatel 7: You know he he really feels bad for me. But there's not much I can do, and he can't

84
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:49.410
Know,

85
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:50.940
tracy jackson: Right.

86
00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:10.530
tracy jackson: And it's frustrating for everyone and tell me when you first used opioids for any reason, and sort of the history of your opioid use the medicines, you've taken how much you've taken what your current uses that sort of thing.

87
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.350
Alcatel 7: Um, it's been about 10 years

88
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:19.470
Alcatel 7: I first started having seizures and I would sort of falling down and stuff, they would give me Norco

89
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.480
Alcatel 7: I would go through Norco like pretty much aspirin.

90
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:35.430
Alcatel 7: It was just something that one or two didn't work. It stopped working. So then it would take more while that would stop working out with a war.

91
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:43.200
Alcatel 7: They tried me on methadone, but I was allergic to it. I broke out in hives and then my throat started closing up

92
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.930
Alcatel 7: So I couldn't take that and then I got on MS continent, about four years ago.

93
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.310
Alcatel 7: In the nation. They started that at 50 milligrams, two times a day.

94
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.940
Alcatel 7: With an within a short period of time, two weeks they brought it up to three times a day.

95
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.190
Alcatel 7: With four to six darcos for the breakthrough every single day.

96
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:22.890
Alcatel 7: And so that's that's currently how that's all that's been going when I was growing up and stuff. I, I never really took medications.

97
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.970
Alcatel 7: I always figured they were for when you got say

98
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.170
Alcatel 7: I've had surgeries in between.

99
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.070
Alcatel 7: But really nothing that required me to take him for a long period of time.

100
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:47.760
tracy jackson: Okay, and then your current refugees, I saw, I think I saw. Have you been getting some just Tramadol the past couple of months or

101
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.520
Alcatel 7: Yeah, yeah. My current primary she does not give out any types of narcotics.

102
00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:00.240
Alcatel 7: referred me to pay management, she does not like me. She doesn't refer

103
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:10.440
Alcatel 7: To them, like she can give me because I don't offer the MS continent and I got off of the the Norco

104
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.790
Alcatel 7: Which I'm still feeling backer effects, but

105
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.010
Alcatel 7: She was it will until I was able to get to pain management to give me the Tramadol

106
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:29.100
Alcatel 7: Which then again, she would give me like two a day for 30 days supply and I would go through those in

107
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.430
Alcatel 7: We can have

108
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:42.450
tracy jackson: Okay. And so what have you been doing now for. Are you currently taking any opioids are you just cold turkey white knuckling it at the moment, cold.

109
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.100
Alcatel 7: Turkey right now. Okay.

110
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:45.930
tracy jackson: When was your last opioid does

111
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.490
Alcatel 7: I finished my last dose of the Tramadol

112
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.920
Alcatel 7: week and a half ago.

113
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.300
tracy jackson: We can half ago. Okay. Are you still experiencing any withdrawal symptoms.

114
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.090
Alcatel 7: Yes. Yeah, okay.

115
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.280
tracy jackson: And tell me what those withdrawal symptoms are

116
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.710
Alcatel 7: The cold chills.

117
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:06.480
Alcatel 7: I'm

118
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.300
Alcatel 7: See my body aches.

119
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.570
Alcatel 7: I can't sit still, the nerve damage my legs. Anytime that I do go through withdrawals.

120
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:16.860
Alcatel 7: I can't sit

121
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.420
Alcatel 7: Okay, I have to keep

122
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.890
Alcatel 7: I can't. It's like I'm really restless.

123
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:31.200
Alcatel 7: With those two seconds. I can't sit still, I have to continue to move my legs. Okay. It's like sitting with my legs back and forth.

124
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.750
Alcatel 7: Right and the lead with the my legs. Is it just adds to it.

125
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:43.830
Alcatel 7: Will get sick hard to hold her down, and I don't sleep. Okay.

126
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:57.240
tracy jackson: And then tell me in your words. Do you feel like you've had any consequences from your opioid use, whether that's to your health, your relationships job legal any kind of stuff like that.

127
00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.150
Alcatel 7: Oh yes yeah definitely with my family.

128
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:00.930
Mm hmm.

129
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:07.740
Alcatel 7: I mean they notice the difference that I'm not okay. Unless I'm on them.

130
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.780
Alcatel 7: But when I am on them.

131
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.430
Alcatel 7: Especially the MS cotton.

132
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.660
Alcatel 7: I'm just really not there.

133
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:16.530
Right.

134
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.480
tracy jackson: And have you have you tried Suboxone before keep her nursing

135
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.890
Alcatel 7: I have, I have a dog old years ago.

136
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:37.770
Alcatel 7: I went through a surgery on my leg to find out what was going on. They cut three inches out of my leg to find out the nerves and the tissue interview and find out about the

137
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:55.470
Alcatel 7: The nerve damage and say gave me the Norco but back then it was Viking in that 800 800 milligrams and for a month. And one of when I went back, they gave me one or two of the

138
00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.590
Alcatel 7: The orange pills.

139
00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.840
Alcatel 7: Of Suboxone

140
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.430
Alcatel 7: And they got me through the withdrawals.

141
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:13.680
tracy jackson: Okay. And then because you still continue to have pain. You went off the Suboxone and then started back on the regular a few weeks after that.

142
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.600
Alcatel 7: Yeah, at that time, I didn't know that you can use Suboxone for pain.

143
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.320
I'm

144
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.580
Alcatel 7: Just coming with open

145
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:24.780
Minds.

146
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:33.570
tracy jackson: And and then you mentioned that you paint a lot or in you're applying for disability. Have you ever worked or what was your work before

147
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.060
Alcatel 7: Oh, I was an electrical engineer.

148
00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:41.820
Alcatel 7: Okay I designed electrical while I used to design electrical systems for your high rise buildings.

149
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:48.540
Alcatel 7: Mean San Francisco and all brand new buildings or building remodels okay

150
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.260
Alcatel 7: And I did that for my whole whole career.

151
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.630
Alcatel 7: I do my art just for you know the past time. I mean, just for fun.

152
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.810
tracy jackson: And the pain or the appeal us prevented you from continuing the work as the electrical engineer.

153
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.880
Alcatel 7: With did, yeah.

154
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:06.990
I mean that's open

155
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.570
Alcatel 7: I couldn't work overhead.

156
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.980
Alcatel 7: If I worked for about 510 minutes I would have to sit down.

157
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.520
tracy jackson: So that's been 10 years as well that you have not been able to work.

158
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:27.630
Alcatel 7: Um, I actually, I was able to hide it and say, I'm taking a break. You know or have a co worker, you know, some stuff like I was training them.

159
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:33.540
Alcatel 7: I had been out of work for three and a half years fighting with this ability

160
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.810
Alcatel 7: So all that other time I've been working

161
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.490
tracy jackson: And and what are you doing for income at the moment.

162
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.100
Alcatel 7: Right now it's my wife, she's on SSI.

163
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:57.840
Alcatel 7: I've been kind of living with her with that and just struggling with what we can get from, you know, the county and

164
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.660
Alcatel 7: It's not a good situation.

165
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.560
Alcatel 7: Okay, self esteem. It just, it's bad.

166
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:17.160
tracy jackson: ALL RIGHT. DO YOU FEEL, DO YOU HAVE insecurity around food or your house and are you able to eat and have shelter and all that kind of stuff.

167
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.600
Alcatel 7: Oh, yeah.

168
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.870
Alcatel 7: Yeah, yeah. I live with my wife, my son, so

169
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:32.160
tracy jackson: Okay, um, how about any other substances that you have used in the past, anytime in your anytime in your life. I'll just kind of go through them.

170
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:33.990
tracy jackson: Alcohol.

171
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.050
Alcatel 7: Oh yeah. Yes, I'm an alcoholic.

172
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.490
Alcatel 7: Uh huh. But I haven't drank in 14 and a half years.

173
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:48.060
tracy jackson: Okay, and what was the what. To what do you attribute your sobriety.

174
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.910
Alcatel 7: My daughter when my daughter got

175
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.130
Alcatel 7: My three she passed away.

176
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.430
Alcatel 7: That was it, cut it off. No more.

177
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:03.660
tracy jackson: And just did that you've never been to inpatient or outpatient rehab for any kind of substances.

178
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.910
Alcatel 7: No, no, I went in.

179
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.070
Alcatel 7: With detox.

180
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.280
Alcatel 7: Going into seizures and whatnot.

181
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.780
Alcatel 7: Never, never touch it again, never went into rehab.

182
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.770
tracy jackson: Okay. Do you go to na na or any of that.

183
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.050
Alcatel 7: Dumb I go to a

184
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:29.160
Alcatel 7: I start to feel the urge my winter a replay justly for five and a half years.

185
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.750
Alcatel 7: And I still work with my sponsor and

186
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:41.040
Alcatel 7: He kind of coaches me through things, but I really haven't had the urge, it's been so long. Okay.

187
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.790
tracy jackson: And how about an alcohol, tobacco.

188
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.210
Alcatel 7: I do I smoke a half a pack a day.

189
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.640
Alcatel 7: I used to smoke a pack a day and I'm down to half back

190
00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.790
tracy jackson: Okay, and for how long have you been talking

191
00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.250
Alcatel 7: About 30 years

192
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.960
tracy jackson: Okay, and any desire or motivation to work on that.

193
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.260
Alcatel 7: Oh yes definitely. Okay.

194
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:08.670
I've been putting

195
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.520
tracy jackson: Okay.

196
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:18.330
tracy jackson: Yeah, and then how about, um, any stimulants, whether that's Meth, Cocaine.

197
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.140
tracy jackson: Adderall, any of that.

198
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.710
Alcatel 7: No, no, I was on I'm

199
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:33.060
Alcatel 7: Just trying to think. Now when I went blank. Oh, I was on for my seizures. I was on Ben's of

200
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.780
Alcatel 7: I was Xanax value and Klonopin

201
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.520
Alcatel 7: And I quit. Those and stop those three and a half years ago.

202
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:48.390
tracy jackson: And okay and and how about

203
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.790
tracy jackson: Have you ever used heroin.

204
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.650
Alcatel 7: No, no, no.

205
00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.240
tracy jackson: I can ever

206
00:38:55.530 --> 00:39:00.480
tracy jackson: Crush snorted taking the pills any other way than just ingesting them by mouth.

207
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:08.130
Alcatel 7: No. No. Okay. No, I, if I took more, I would just take more but I I never did it any other way.

208
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:13.950
tracy jackson: Right, and then we'll have you, have you ever accidentally overdosed on medications.

209
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.480
Alcatel 7: No, not that I can remember.

210
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:24.750
tracy jackson: Okay so never had to receive them, nor can or any of that kind of stuff.

211
00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.940
Alcatel 7: No, no, not at all.

212
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.160
tracy jackson: All right and and other than when

213
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.840
Alcatel 7: I was on muscle relaxer I just remembered back within

214
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:43.740
Alcatel 7: I'm going back about about same time about 10 years ago when I had my surgery.

215
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:44.460
Mm hmm.

216
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:51.720
Alcatel 7: And that I did end up in the hospital for by why we take them and forget that I took them.

217
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.200
Alcatel 7: And I did end up in the hospital for that.

218
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:55.950
Okay.

219
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:12.750
tracy jackson: So switching gears just a little bit, other than your seizure disorder and the neuropathy in your feet and your shoulder pain and any other medical issues.

220
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.590
Alcatel 7: Um, I do have a mitral valve prolapse.

221
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:17.610
Alcatel 7: Which they're

222
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.680
Alcatel 7: Not to see if it's morphing disease.

223
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.000
Okay.

224
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.820
Alcatel 7: I also have Addison's disease.

225
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.410
Okay.

226
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.300
Alcatel 7: And again, that's it.

227
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:39.090
tracy jackson: And then other I heard an allergy to Methadone while you were talking clear any other allergies to medications.

228
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.790
Alcatel 7: Penicillin

229
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.330
tracy jackson: Penicillin and what happens when you take penicillin.

230
00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.760
Alcatel 7: My break out in hives.

231
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.960
tracy jackson: This year, well, we're

232
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.090
tracy jackson: Talking

233
00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.000
tracy jackson: At first, I don't want to

234
00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:03.150
tracy jackson: Want to make sure to end, then, can you give me a list of the medications that you're taking now.

235
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.080
Alcatel 7: Oh, yes, yes. Let me go back inside here.

236
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:09.720
Alcatel 7: Sorry about that.

237
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:17.700
Alcatel 7: Can you hear me.

238
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:21.300
Alcatel 7: I can open my mind Capra

239
00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:28.500
Alcatel 7: I take that three times a day two in the morning, two in the afternoon to at night.

240
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.670
tracy jackson: And it is

241
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.370
Alcatel 7: 500 milligrams

242
00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.310
tracy jackson: In case you take 1003 times a day.

243
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.770
Alcatel 7: Again, correct.

244
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:38.760
Okay.

245
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.410
Alcatel 7: And I'm also on am a tripling

Alcatel 7: my right shoulder.

270
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.380
Alcatel 7: And I thought I had it done to

271
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.530
tracy jackson: That's it. And you hadn't done twice.

272
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:32.580
Alcatel 7: Yeah yeah with my head twice, once and then a year later I have gone again.

273
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.390
tracy jackson: Other surgeries that you've had.

274
00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.590
Alcatel 7: I my leg surgery.

275
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:48.000
Alcatel 7: Were three inches out of my tissue muscle to find out about my nerve damage.

276
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:54.540
Alcatel 7: My

277
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.930

Alcatel 7: Um, no. That's all right.

279
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.110
tracy jackson: And then

280
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:13.680
go far.

281
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:17.280
tracy jackson: And then in terms of

282
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:22.290
tracy jackson: Your family history and are your parents both living

283
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:27.570
Alcatel 7: Oh, what was that

284
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:32.640
tracy jackson: In your in terms of your family history or your parents both living

285
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.620
Alcatel 7: Of your yes

286
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:39.840
tracy jackson: Uh huh. And any any health issues or addiction issues and either mother or father

287
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.250
Alcatel 7: Um, no, no. On my mother's well no, let me take that back on my mother's side to have her brothers.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:56.520
Alcatel 7: My father side. He has one brother that he died from alcohol.

291
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:05.790
Alcatel 7: My mother and my father both they do not have problems they abstain from from everything. Okay.

292
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.770
tracy jackson: All right. And I'm just going to go through sort of a

293
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:22.830
tracy jackson: List of questions here. So you mentioned that you struggled with depression. Have you had any suicide attempts in the past.

294
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.750
Alcatel 7: I'm twice.

295
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.420
tracy jackson: Okay. And when was the most recent one.

296
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.890
Alcatel 7: Maybe

297
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.780
tracy jackson: 2005 29 years

298
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:36.570
tracy jackson: Old, okay. And since that time you've never been hospitalized for depression.

299
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.370
Alcatel 7: No, no.

300
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.520

Okay.

303
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.960
tracy jackson: And how about the anxiety. Do you suffer with panic.

304
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:50.700
Alcatel 7: Yes.

305
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.280
tracy jackson: Okay. And when was your most recent panic attack.

306
00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.190
Alcatel 7: I'd say within the last two weeks.

307
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:04.200
tracy jackson: In the past two weeks I'm. What do you do to manage your anxiety and panic when you feel it.

308
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.550
Alcatel 7: I just kind of let it go through

309
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.400
Alcatel 7: Okay, walk around the block.

310
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:20.100
Alcatel 7: Do anything to keep my mind, you know, on focus on other things.

311
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:29.250
tracy jackson: Right, so you've developed some coping skills. It's not ideal. You're still suffering and then you've developed some ways to deal with it without medications. It sounds like

312
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:30.780
Alcatel 7: Yeah.

313
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.620
Yeah, okay.

314
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.170
tracy jackson: And then

315
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:49.260
tracy jackson: You don't have to give details if you don't want. Have you experienced anything that you would consider and the death of your daughter is traumatic and any other traumas or anything that results in flashbacks nightmares that kind of thing.

316
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:56.730
Alcatel 7: Oh yeah, definitely. Um, when I was a kid. When I was a child I was sexually abused.

317
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:04.830
Alcatel 7: In my teenagers. I was locked up in juvenile hall.

318
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.340
Alcatel 7: For a couple years.

319
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.510
Alcatel 7: Never been in trouble sense. But when I was teenager.

320
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.990
Alcatel 7: The death of my daughter and my the death of my father in law.

321
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:32.130
tracy jackson: So, so quite a bit of trauma and any kind of specific counseling or trauma related therapy that you've that you've had.

322
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.290
Alcatel 7: No, I did this counseling.

323
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.520
Alcatel 7: About 10 years ago my daughter passed away.

324
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:42.360
Hmm.

325
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:52.620
Alcatel 7: They really didn't help me didn't really want to talk on the subject. It was other things beyond that, that would have contributed to it.

326
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.460
He

327
00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.270
Alcatel 7: And I just got frustrated and at that time it just, it wasn't working.

328
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:10.530
tracy jackson: Okay, so you did make an attempt to have some counseling, but it was a really it was not a good experience for you and you did not. Did you did not find it helpful at that time.

329
00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:22.980
tracy jackson: All right, and another kind of laundry list of questions. I'm sorry for this just because it's the first time getting in the system. I just have to go through some things with you. Okay.

330
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:30.900
tracy jackson: So it's just a list of symptoms and just say yes or no. So, fever, chills, or night sweats.

331
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.320
tracy jackson: And which ones.

332
00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.810
Alcatel 7: God, both

333
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.750
tracy jackson: All. And how long has that been going on.

334
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:43.980
Alcatel 7: About two weeks to

335
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:48.690
tracy jackson: Okay. Are you up to date on all your cancer screenings and everything as far as, you know,

336
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.440
Alcatel 7: being screened right now for leukemia.

337
00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.310
Okay.

338
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.970
tracy jackson: And because of those symptoms you just described.

339
00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:58.590
Alcatel 7: The correct

340
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.010
tracy jackson: And any blurred vision, double

341
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.340
Alcatel 7: My vision gets blurry but that's just from old age.

342
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.420
Alcatel 7: That's where my

343
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:11.520
tracy jackson: You, me, but

344
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.810
tracy jackson: Um, any ringing in your ears.

345
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:18.570
tracy jackson: Know hearing problems.

346
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:25.770
tracy jackson: Whoa, any issues with your mouth, throat voice swallowing any of that kind of stuff.

347
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.990
tracy jackson: No. Okay. And any lumps or bumps in your neck.

348
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.140
tracy jackson: Any neck pain.

349
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.020
tracy jackson: Oh, yes. Okay. Um,

350
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.080
tracy jackson: any difficulty breathing.

351
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.460
tracy jackson: Shortness of breath, wheezing.

352
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:49.020
Alcatel 7: Yeah, I had for his breath from or wheezing from smoking.

353
00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:57.030
Alcatel 7: Okay, since I think my doctor gave me an inhaler. Beautiful. I forgot to mention that I'm sorry.

354
00:49:59.370 --> 00:49:59.940
tracy jackson: It's like a

355
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:10.920
tracy jackson: Chest pain or you mentioned that you're being worked up for no more more fans any known aneurisms or enlarged heart rapid heartbeat, you

356
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:20.820
Alcatel 7: Know, I have an irregular heartbeat and and I do I check protest means, but that's from my heart disease.

357
00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.430
tracy jackson: And tell me about your heart disease.

358
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:27.630
Alcatel 7: And they said, I have mitral valve prolapse.

359
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:37.380
Alcatel 7: As your was a child. Okay, well with my cardiologist. He says the man is diagnosed it in. It may be more morphing disease.

360
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:40.320
tracy jackson: Okay, so he's that's being followed by specialist

361
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.850
Alcatel 7: It is, yes.

362
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:49.230
tracy jackson: And I know with your withdrawal you're having some gastrointestinal symptoms. Any other kind of long standing problems with your gut.

363
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.450
Alcatel 7: And no, no.

364
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:57.510
tracy jackson: And in the knowledge is also for which you take this. Oh, Fran. What is that from

365
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:00.750
Alcatel 7: I'm

366
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:06.840
Alcatel 7: It's I guess for the medications that I've been on especially with the MS cotton.

367
00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:14.610
tracy jackson: Okay. All right. And any burning when you pee difficulty peeing blood in the urine, anything like that.

368
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.230
Alcatel 7: No, no.

369
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:22.260
tracy jackson: Um, any kind of sexual dysfunction or issue genital issues at all.

370
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:23.730
Alcatel 7: So,

371
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.000
tracy jackson: Yeah. Okay. Have you had your testosterone level check

372
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.080
Alcatel 7: I have played it was about 1012 years ago.

373
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:42.330
tracy jackson: Okay, that might just be something to keep in mind when people are on opioids for a long time and also with Addison's disease that you can get really low testosterone levels, which can really affect your

374
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:51.300
tracy jackson: Libido and oftentimes ability to orgasm and things like that. So testosterone replacement, she can talk about with your doctor.

375
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.460
tracy jackson: But just having that

376
00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:53.820
A

377
00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.010
tracy jackson: Reasonable thing. Yeah.

378
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.220
tracy jackson: Very common with long term if you would use.

379
00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:05.040
tracy jackson: That's good.

380
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.570
tracy jackson: Yeah, right. And any skin rashes.

381
00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:11.730
Alcatel 7: A mill. No.

382
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:18.630
tracy jackson: Other than your shoulders, your neck and your legs any pain anywhere else in your muscles are joints.

383
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:28.380
Alcatel 7: My hands when I wake up in the morning, my I can't make a fist, and I, I can't open my pill bottles.

384
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:38.820
Alcatel 7: So basically in the morning. I can't use one hands and I sometimes will follow over. It'll be okay and then follow into the afternoon. Okay, and

385
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:39.570
Alcatel 7: What I do

386
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:45.900
Alcatel 7: With this on it. I have a pain that shoes. I mean, all the way up my my arm.

387
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:58.350
tracy jackson: And he, you said you've been worked up for leukemia, any, any other none blood related issues. Easy bleeding or bruising.

388
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.840
Alcatel 7: No. Okay.

389
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:07.800
tracy jackson: And anything else you feel like I should know to be able to understand your story.

390
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:14.490
Alcatel 7: I've been on opiates for a long time.

391
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:22.770
Alcatel 7: In the beginning, yeah, they helped a little bit as much. So I can function.

392
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.570
Alcatel 7: What they destroyed is

393
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.130
Alcatel 7: Killing me

394
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.270
Alcatel 7: More so than what my whole quiz. Okay.

395
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:46.830
tracy jackson: And so I never kind of told you anything really about about me but I'm actually, I'm an anesthesiologist by training and for a lot of years at Vanderbilt, I was doing

396
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:54.690
tracy jackson: interventional pain procedures. I was writing big doses of opioids are doing all the things until after I started to

397
00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:01.410
tracy jackson: Realize that I really now believe that the system hurts people more than it helps people and

398
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:16.800
tracy jackson: And so I become a yoga instructor and an acupuncturist and a health coach and I have been doing telemedicine. Now for a couple almost a year and a half, because I really like this opportunity, even though I can't see you on the video and

399
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.570
Alcatel 7: Go me through back on.

400
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:22.170
tracy jackson: Well, maybe we can try and we've had good connection so far. Let's see.

401
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:28.290
tracy jackson: But at least I can

402
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:35.700
tracy jackson: Yeah, I can at least that can take some time to get to know people and really figure out a lot of what's going on and

403
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:51.180
tracy jackson: The issue with the opioids and is when you receive them the opioids and the steroids and all the other things, you know, your body quits making its own and it does take a while for you to

404
00:54:51.900 --> 00:55:03.930
tracy jackson: Get that new normal back you know for your body to start reproducing those medicines and so it's not uncommon what you're experiencing now you know you're 10 days out

405
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:14.190
tracy jackson: From the Tramadol but still this could be like multiple months, which is why it's often very hard for people just to go cold turkey off of all of their opioids.

406
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:30.690
tracy jackson: Because the opioids are tied into your sleep your sexual function, your mood, you know everything that's critical and central to being a human is tied into the abuse system. Right. And that is, like you said, not to mention the side effects.

407
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.990
tracy jackson: That people have in terms of can you still hear me, or should we turn our video back off.

408
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.170
Alcatel 7: Well, I can hear you.

409
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:51.600
tracy jackson: Okay, good. And so the benefit of something like Suboxone is it works a little bit differently than traditional opioids do. Okay.

410
00:55:52.020 --> 00:56:14.550
tracy jackson: It really bonds more along the opioid receptors in the spinal cord and not so much in the sedating respiratory depression part of the brain. So the risk of overdose is much, much less on Suboxone and it's the strongest abuse it is stronger than fentanyl

411
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:24.510
tracy jackson: In terms of its binding to the receptor. So, meaning that once there's Suboxone in your system. You could take heroin and you could take bike it in

412
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:36.060
tracy jackson: It's not going to work. Okay, it's not going to work on your pain receptors, because that Suboxone there. By the same token, if you're not completely in withdrawal so

413
00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:52.050
tracy jackson: After 10 days, this should be out of your system enough. But if you if any Tramadol is still in your system and you take Suboxone it will bump all the Tramadol off and you will go into withdrawal. That is very, very uncomfortable and hard to

414
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.940
tracy jackson: Reverse

415
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:54.930
Alcatel 7: Yo,

416
00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.540
Alcatel 7: I know I've been criminal in my system.

417
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:08.130
tracy jackson: So, so what this is about. Some will have, we have like an induction protocol that will give you so when we hang up from here.

418
00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:24.090
tracy jackson: And I will call in a prescription for just a week of this Suboxone to your pharmacy. Okay, when you go and get the Suboxone you will call back the virtual clinic, which is that 408 number. You were just talking to Jamie in the virtual clinic.

419
00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.210
tracy jackson: You'll call back that virtual clinic.

420
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:38.880
tracy jackson: And they'll describe to you what to do. Okay, how to take the medicine this clinic is open 24 seven. Okay. Anytime you have a question.

421
00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:45.900
tracy jackson: You may not be able to get in touch with me, but you'll be able to get in touch with them. And that question includes if you're starting to feel suicidal.

422
00:57:46.290 --> 00:58:04.860
tracy jackson: If you feel like you're having side effects. Anything call them. Okay. It should typically it should typically I would really like to start you on the very lowest dose, because the very lowest dose of the Suboxone is still much more than what you were taking in terms of Tramadol

423
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:07.260
tracy jackson: And

424
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:22.920
tracy jackson: Suboxone does relieve pain. There's no doubt about it. And like most pain if you try to chase it so that you keep increasing the Suboxone to cover every piece so that you have zero out of 10 pain.

425
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:30.750
tracy jackson: You're probably going to end up having side effects. So the goal is, we want to give you the lowest possible dose. So you're not having craving.

426
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:43.470
tracy jackson: So that you can function, your pain is controlled well enough. And then we also offer groups that bright heart health that allow that teach coping skills, other way that I teach

427
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:50.760
tracy jackson: Other ways to manage pain that you can do from your house at no cost. And that's everything from

428
00:58:51.360 --> 00:59:07.950
tracy jackson: You know, mindfulness to chair yoga to nutrition stuff to whatever but we not everything works for everybody, but we want to continue as you get on this Suboxone to have tools in your toolbox right to get better.

429
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:23.730
tracy jackson: Okay, so yeah, so we'll start out at the beginning. And over time, if you want to try to tie trade off the Suboxone that's fine. But right now, let's just get you stabilized for six months.

430
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:43.350
tracy jackson: At least you know and then we can talk about it again. But in the meantime, when we start on it will watch you really closely up front, just giving you a week prescription at the time making sure you're the right dose. You'll come in and see me in a group, once a month.

431
00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:53.730
tracy jackson: And then if things get better we can increase your prescription interval and that kind of thing. Bright heart.

432
00:59:54.450 --> 01:00:08.280
tracy jackson: is committed to keeping you safe and helping you on recovery. So, do not be afraid if you quote fall off the wagon right be very honest with us. Nobody's going to kick you out of the program.

433
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:16.260
tracy jackson: The idea is that if you're having difficulty we might want to see you more frequently. So if you're missing appointments

434
01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:24.150
tracy jackson: We might shorten your prescription interval, but just because we want to make sure that you come back into the fold so we can see what's going on.

435
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.850
tracy jackson: But we're not trying to kick you out or punish you like honesty is really important.

436
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.100
Alcatel 7: Oh, yeah.

437
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:44.790
tracy jackson: I'm with you there. Yeah. So after this out. Like I said, I'll write a prescription and you'll call the virtual clinic, they'll walk you through everything you need to know.

438
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:54.990
tracy jackson: Also, they'll, they'll have you feel fill out some baseline surveys and put you in a group to see me every Wednesday. Okay.
