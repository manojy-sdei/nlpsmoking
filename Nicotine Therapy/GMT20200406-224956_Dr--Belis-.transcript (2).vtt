00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: It was a one milligram. Uh huh.

94
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.880
Vicky French: Anyway, and on that.

95
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.200

99
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.940
The doctor had prescribed

100
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

101
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.930

Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I think.

106
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: So here's the deal with that.

107
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:13.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: So clonazepam um I know it worked for you before, but it is it is a habit forming medication and it's a benzodiazepine it's not really good for long term use. Um,

108
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:24.570
Vicky French: Do you think maybe a 30 day just to get through this virus everybody in the house together so I can get some sleep and smile at everybody is like cook every single meal.

109
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.720
Vicky French: Because I ain't doing well.

110
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.210

113
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.180
Vicky French: Yes, um,

114
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:53.220
Vicky French: It's really, really hard on me right now, even if you know just try it for 30 days. If you don't want me to have it after that then. Fine.

115
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.360
Vicky French: But I got to get some sleep at night. I can't turn my head off.

116
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.800

Vicky French: Okay, thank you.

141
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:55.920

Vicky French: But those in my mind anyway. I think that's what it is, but it makes me get up and have to use the restroom like five times a night when I take those

145
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh that's odd. Know this, should that

146
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.090
Vicky French: Be okay it's me.

147
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.810
Vicky French: I thought maybe it has some kind of diuretic.

148
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't think so. But, you know, everyone will

149
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know that shouldn't be happening. I don't know. But this definitely doesn't

150
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.630
Vicky French: So it shouldn't do. Okay, good.

151
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.560
Vicky French: Oh yeah we're good.

152
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:51.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then for sleep hygiene. You say you have bad sleep for hours a night and stuff do you try to go to bed at the same time every night. Do you have like a ritual with some tea or some calming stuff.

153
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.720
Vicky French: Like what do you usually do have green tea when I go to

154
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:05.310
Vicky French: Bed. But the thing is, my husband has to get up early. So when he comes into bed I make sure the TV's off the lights off. And if I'm not ready to sleep, which I never am

155
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:19.080
Vicky French: I just read stuff on my phone, you know, go through Google and that kind of stuff. And I'm usually a wait till good 1112 o'clock, and then when I wake up I pray, it's at least four

156
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:27.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: So can we try. It's difficult. It's very difficult with the, you know, everything is on our phones but

157
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:36.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: They say that the blue light. The light from the phones is very disturbing to sleep patterns. So, if possible, could you try to find

158
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:48.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Magazines old school books. Things that you meant to read, but you haven't read yet or something and put them by your bedside and try to reach for that with a low lies.

159
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:53.070
Vicky French: The problem I have to have the light off, I have to have all the lights up. So my husband can sleep.

160
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.280
Vicky French: No, I have to get up golden living room.

161
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you have like a little itty bitty life thing like you know like a

162
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.650
Vicky French: Reno, but I can buy one.

163
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, just buy one from, like, you know, Amazon or something you know those things that you just turn on.

164
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.120
Vicky French: Little LED light.

165
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:17.280
Vicky French: Know, Amazon is a bad word in my house. You can't see Amazon because my husband works for ups and now they put all the shipping off to ups.

166
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh boy.

167
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.420
Vicky French: He's very angry with Amazon.

168
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.810
Vicky French: I mean, yeah.

169
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know what I mean. Yeah.

170
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:35.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so you know those little lights. If you could get that. I mean, it's an investment for for a future kind of habit that maybe would be better for you.

171
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because I know what you're saying. We all do it, you know, just go down the rabbit hole and follow Google and this and that but

172
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:57.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think actually can be more stimulating. I mean, you get tired because your eyes get tired, looking at it, but it's, I think it might be better if you try to do old school, you go to sleep a lot faster you'll be bored. A lot

173
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:17.670
Vicky French: You know what I love reading I read like a fanatic and but the reason why I don't read my books and I have millions of books but threes and I read them over and over and over. I mean, I can recite books, but I can't at night because like I said, Yo, yo, cuz the lights on.

174
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:18.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

175
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.770
Vicky French: So anyways,

176
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I do have lots of books. So yeah, that's a good idea. I'll just buy my

177
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:24.510
Vicky French: One of those nightlight

178
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, like you need a reading lamp.

179
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: A little

180
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Reading light. Okay, just

181
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Give yourself.

182
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.670
Vicky French: You got to find one.

183
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's a good idea. Okay.

184
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: That'll help me sleep. That's great.

185
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:51.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, yeah. So let's do that. And then, um, yeah. So you try working on that sleep hygiene, be a bit of like exposure to the phone and trying to like put that away and doing more old school reading

186
00:15:52.140 --> 00:16:02.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, um, and then they say, also, I don't know how reasonable. This is for you. But they see if you are up and you're tossing and turning,

187
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:13.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: That it's better to get up out of your bed to the living room or wherever, put on a soft light and do some light reading there and then go back when you get

188
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:26.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Up because they want your brain to associate sleep with the bed. And so if you're having a miserable time in bed, you kind of associate that so that's another sleep hygiene technique.

189
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:37.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so it may not be the worst idea to actually get up if you're really like having trouble just just get up, go to the next room read very soft light and then go back to sleep again.

190
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:43.260
Vicky French: I used to do that until I gave my. Well, I have a back then with the big TV and everything.

191
00:16:44.250 --> 00:17:04.980
Vicky French: But I had to date that off because my sister who moved in with a dog wants to eat my cat. So I have to keep him in the VAX so now she has the TV in the back and the whole backyard and her room back there. So I'm kind of like confined up to the front to my bedroom, you know, and my

192
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.680
Vicky French: front room, but I don't have a TV. That's kind of sucks.

193
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

194
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.240
Vicky French: Okay, get rid of her.

195
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.570
Vicky French: No, I would never do that.

196
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: We'll figure something out.

197
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.680
Yeah.

198
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:34.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. So Vicki. Okay. So, good thing we're going to work on sleep hygiene. We're going to try a new medication that might help you actually get get in, get some good sleep in.

199
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:42.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then we're going to get you back on the Suboxone so you are on the film once a day.

200
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Were you taking you there.

201
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Can you hear me.

202
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:54.720
Vicky French: Yeah, you know what I was trying to break them in half. Okay, I don't want to. I just want to take one a day.

203
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: One A Day and see how it holds you, it should hold your cravings or thoughts about using

204
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know and and just keep you safe that way. Uh, yeah.

205
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:22.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: So let's do it. Let's do that. And let's be consistent about it. Just like the sleep and you wanted to kind of go to bed at the same time you want to wake up at the same time you want to take your medication, same time so that your body kind of is like clockwork. It's used to it.

206
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.060
Vicky French: Okay.

207
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.290
Okay.

208
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:34.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we'll do that will reinstate that now what have, have you been using like hydrocodone oxy codeine other stuff. Like, what have you been using

209
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:45.450
Vicky French: My time I took one painkiller which was a Norco and one volume cuz I couldn't sleep. My sister had it and otherwise. That was it.

210
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

211
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.870
Vicky French: Don't really want it is the thing you know when I mean they don't want it.

212
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:52.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

213
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: We wanted some type of

214
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.640
Vicky French: Just like whatever I just need to go to sleep.

215
00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:58.890
Vicky French: Yeah.

216
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I'm hoping it look good. So I

217
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:10.470
Vicky French: I told her to, you know, just keep your stuff in your drawer and she's got all kinds of crazy medication because she's way out there.

218
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see.

219
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.210
Vicky French: Your friends in the family here. I don't know.

220
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:21.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, okay. So yeah, it's very important that you stay away from your sister's stuff and then she doesn't

221
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:31.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Give you anything you should talk to her and say, Look man, I'm starting my medication. Again, I can't do this. So if I asked you just remind me and tell me to go away.

222
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:31.860
Vicky French: I did tell her.

223
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:41.160
Vicky French: I said, I'm calling the doctor again today. So please, just keep the shift put up kill know come out here with a handful of pills in the morning, taking them looking at me while you're putting them in your throat.

224
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:56.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right. Yeah. Yeah. That needs to not be in your face and you need to do whatever you can to avoid that and it's not a solution, as you saw, it's not a solution to your problems. It's not sustainable. It's not, it doesn't make you feel good. It's not good.

225
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:05.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: So let's try the Suboxone again so so if that was a while ago hasn't been a couple days, then at least or when did you take that

226
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.770
Vicky French: It's been probably a week.

227
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or a week. Okay.

228
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:16.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: So good. So it's at least should be out of your system and you should be good to take your medication starting like now.

229
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.610
Vicky French: If you wanted to good

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.010
Vicky French: Good. I get

235
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.720
Vicky French: Called into CVS Londo, California.

236
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, CVS and Mondale

237
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.570

244
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Boulevard. Yeah, I haven't. Okay, I'll make it your favorite now.

245
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and we'll wait

246
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: A pharmacy for some other stuff but CVS is

247
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:37.050
Vicky French: Okay, yeah. Normally I like to sell a pharmacy, but for drive through right now. I prefer that

248
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:45.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, drive through is the way to go. Okay, so you want to take one full film each morning. Let's do that.

249
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.320
Okay.

250
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:53.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: And that should, you should, you know, just psychologically know like I have this in my system.

251
00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:08.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: There's no need for me to reach out for Norco or anything. It's not going to give me any relief. If anything, this is stronger on my receptors. So if I tried to use a Norco on top. I really wouldn't feel much anyway.

252
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:18.270
Vicky French: Know someone I know I have the Suboxone. I don't know why I thought. But anyways, when I know I have the Suboxone oh crave anything

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, awesome.

254
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.470
Vicky French: I'm really good that I don't know what that

255
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:29.160
Vicky French: I mean, I've looked it up and read about it, but it is really for me a miracle saver a lifesaver.

256
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Amazing. Okay.

257
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:40.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wonderful. So, okay, I have some options for you, Vicki moving forward. So do you have any allergies to medication.

276
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Say,

277
00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:08.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, virtual clinic and you say, Okay, I'm here, I'm supposed to group with Allah DAG Allah DAG and then they'll say, Okay, here's your group number. Here's the survey for you about any sort of drug use or whatever and then

278
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay.

279
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Great. Okay. So we're going to do that.

280
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let me do that.

281
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then

282
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then. Yeah. And then after we're done here. You just need to call the pharmacy or like go there.

283
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.160
Vicky French: Okay.

284
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.570
Vicky French: CVS now.

285
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:46.800
Vicky French: If something should go wrong at the pharmacy, like she doesn't have it, or she doesn't have that strength. Can she changes like just to make up to what it should be. So she doesn't say no, I can't. I can't fill it. I only have four milligrams

286
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:52.650
Vicky French: Right had him do that before. It's like, well, then give me the four milligrams and I'll take two of them.

287
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly right.

288
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Adjust the medication.

289
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.580
Vicky French: But sometimes, some of the pharmacists just won't do that.

290
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:05.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: I know it does. It is a little bit on to their discretion, but really

291
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:15.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: It could happen. What you do what my recommendation is always call it don't leave the pharmacy call right heart call the 800 number or the virtual clinic.

292
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:24.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: And tell them what's happening. So I'm at my thing I find a fill, but they don't have this they have this one, and they're saying they can't change it unless they get permission.

293
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:42.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: So bright heart. The team has my permission. As a physician, they have my permission to change. There's somebody named Danielle on the team, Danielle has my permission to change the prescription as necessary if if necessary to adjust or whatever. If there needs to be a little

294
00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:46.530
Vicky French: Adjustment. Thank you. That's wonderful. She's

295
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.540
Vicky French: Not the only one who's had this problem.

296
00:25:49.020 --> 00:26:00.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know there's people that have those kinds of things happen, or like they say oh no you're not covered if there's any problem with pharmacy stay there and call and ask to speak with Danielle.

297
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, the person that would try to solve the problem for you.

298
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wonderful and they should be able to help out there.

299
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: So thank

300
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.460
Vicky French: You so much

301
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're welcome. Um, I'm

302
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:14.760
Saying

303
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Go ahead, I'm sorry. I cut you off.

304
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.920
Vicky French: I just to be safe out there.

305
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:31.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thank you. Oh, thank you. Yeah. You too. And I'm going to give you something else. I'm going to prescribe it. You don't have to pick it up if you don't feel you need it but

306
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:38.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's just California law, whenever we give any medication that's like sedative or opioid like

307
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:47.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: We we we prescribe Narcan it's a opioid overdose reversal agent. So like God forbid.

308
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:55.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's say you took the Norco and the volume from your sister, something happened and you overdosed and you've passed that and you're not breathing.

309
00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:08.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your husband or whoever in the house could use this to spray in your nose to bring you back from an overdose. It's a temporary thing is something that like emergency personnel have on them.

310
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:18.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you still need to call 911 and get help, because it's temporary the reversal only is good for like half hour and then the person could slip back into the overdose. So

311
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:25.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just something to know it's not. It's just a spray in the nose. It's not harmful. So let's see someone has passed out your sister.

312
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: God forbid, your sisters passed out and you're like,

313
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:29.010
Vicky French: Oh, there you go.

314
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:39.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: I can't wake her up. I don't know what happened. Could it be opioids. I don't know. Let's spray this to see if it'll wake pro ball we call 911 you could do that, it won't harm her

315
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:48.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so it might be good, just for that to have on hand, but just see if it's covered it should be covered.

316
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.500
Vicky French: The insurance cover that.

317
00:27:50.280 --> 00:28:00.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: They should they really should. It's a life saving medication, but, you know, check if it's super expensive and you're like, I don't think I'm going to need it. You don't have to buy it but I'm going to prescribe it. Okay.

318
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.120
Vicky French: Okay, great.

319
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:13.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Alright, so we're going to do that. I think I got all my questions answered. So when you first started this stuff. Um,

320
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: How old were you like, How long ago did this problem start for you.

321
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.460
Vicky French: It started

322
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:30.990
Vicky French: Quite a while ago I had gotten hurt really bad at work and I needed surgery but I was on workmen's

323
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.120
Vicky French: comp

324
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:39.840
Vicky French: Had to go through workman's comp because or I had insurance.

325
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:48.960
Vicky French: I had to go through workman's comp, but everything is no they send you to a doctor because I had to go get a lawyer because my

326
00:28:50.370 --> 00:29:02.700
Vicky French: Employer wouldn't let me go to a doctor. My doctor won't touch me, because it's at work. So I had to get a lawyer. I had to go to a doctor. Yes, I have to have surgery and I have to have a discrete place.

327
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:21.000
Vicky French: And workman's comp sent me to 40 million doctors trying to say differently. I mean, if they probably paid more than the surgery cost. So every doctor said no, you can't have it replaced so it was four years before they

328
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.730
Vicky French: Finally, gave me

329
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:35.250
Vicky French: The BK for a surgery. And during that entire time they did nothing but give me every to every two weeks.

330
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.370
Vicky French: They gave me painkillers.

331
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.930
Vicky French: And well until they got a yes from the Workman's Comp and that was

332
00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:53.010
Vicky French: You know, it was like, I didn't even have a really the last year there was really not a good quality of life, because I was dragging my leg. Because of the back

333
00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:07.530
Vicky French: And, you know, and I was never one to really be in drugs. I don't drink. I do spoke, you know, but I was never one that did that. I was the goody two shoes that said, I'm not doing that.

334
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:13.170
Vicky French: Everybody said I was the party pooper. Yeah. Then the next thing I know, I'm hooked on

335
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:19.920
Vicky French: It, you know, when I didn't have it. It was like, I didn't even know what I was going through it. First, I said. She said, I think you're going to withdraw.

336
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:33.390
Vicky French: Maybe opening you talking about. She goes, you know, and I just was like, Oh, crap. I said, I don't know, but I could kill, kill for one right now, and she'll yeah you're going through withdrawals. And so I had to get help.

337
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. So

338
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:41.370
Vicky French: And then every once in a while. Now that's a coping mechanism because that's how I coped for so long.

339
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: It was that for years. You said

340
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.800
Vicky French: No, it was probably closer to five years ago now. Now,

341
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, five years ago, but how long was the period where they made you wait and but

342
00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:06.150
Vicky French: It's just I was on Suboxone for so long with my doctor and everything was within my husband changed her insurance tizer. And they will prescribe it

343
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:07.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: What

344
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.290
Vicky French: I was two years.

345
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:15.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh my god. Oh, I see. Well, they okay and

346
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: I was gonna say, Yeah, I actually just just stopped working for

347
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Kaiser myself. I will

348
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.060
Vicky French: Last you I'm sorry.

349
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I was gonna set

350
00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:41.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Up Kaiser will not cover it. If you say it's only for pain if you say you're a didn't you have opioid use disorder.

351
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.120
Vicky French: Told me. No, we don't prescribe Suboxone

352
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.530
Vicky French: Hmm.

353
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.780
Vicky French: Didn't get a new

354
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:59.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: So now you're going to be getting care here. So, that's fine. But just so you know, Kaiser has Addiction Medicine services.

355
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: So if you were to say, I have an addiction to opioids.

356
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: They would prescribe

357
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.310
Vicky French: I called them, they're the one that told me no

358
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's very odd.

359
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:25.770
Vicky French: I, well, you know, that was a person. I talked to Toby know so I waited into November and got my insurance change back to a PPO so that I could get my insurance back and do what I needed to do.

360
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:27.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: I say

361
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, well, what a story. I'm so sorry I have to go through all that

Dr. Belis Aladag: You're going to take care of yourself, because this is important, and I see how this developed as a problem for you. You didn't intend for it to happen. It just kind of happened because of all the descriptions, you were given

364
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: For so long.

365
