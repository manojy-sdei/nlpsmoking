00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm opening up my eyes will be kind of off.

2
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To the side here for a minute.

3
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Any changes that work for you or

4
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: work hours the same

5
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nice. I'm happy for you.

6
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

7
00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyone in your family, you know, experiencing any challenges with health or your everybody's kind of stay in. Okay.

8
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.530
Yeah.

9
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Glad to hear that.

10
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see. We need to

11
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to take a peek at goals do a review and let's take just a moment at least make a little statement about, well, this one set for, you know, December, but we can still make a little comment about it. Find a good place to live.

12
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's about savings. So just a little comment on how you assess how you're doing around saving

13
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.430
Shaun W.: I will do. I bought a car. No.

14
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.800
Okay.

15
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

16
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's been a little bit since you bought that car. Are you noticing more money seems to continue after you bought it. Just keep having to pay for things somehow with the car.

17
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.150
Shaun W.: No, I run good. No, that's more than just putting things into, like, you know, you get a new card.

18
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.900
Shaun W.: There's like little things like, oh, I don't have my phone with Bluetooth to my radio. So I got one of those little radio very good to see you. Radio

19
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's what I was saying was whether money was still going to the car and it sounds like is

20
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.070
Shaun W.: Yeah, we gotta buy new tires.

21
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you said

22
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: need new new tires and something about the windows.

23
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.040
Shaun W.: Yeah, typically. Oh.

24
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: new tires and need to 10 windows.

25
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What is, what is the tinted window do. Is that because it's like a case the sign out

26
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.540
Shaun W.: So not use a cooler.

27
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.120
Shaun W.: Live in a bit more, you know, remember I know

28
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, hot steering wheel seats get hot.

29
00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, I will then. So what you're saying is, this is the priority is really getting this car just the way you want it. How far away financially just maybe a rough estimate how far away, do you think you are from monetarily from getting just where you want it.

30
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.240
Shaun W.: For about three $4

31
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.080
Okay.

32
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.200
Shaun W.: So far it's a really good car, except for that overkill. The oil. They claim that lead ID. I missed

33
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.860
Shaun W.: Kelsey, they keep you around here working on it and all boiling it although I didn't

34
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.700
Shaun W.: Give me my money back, love, love, love is patient

35
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:50.580
Shaun W.: That's, you know, that's what kept crossing my mind. I don't get my money back. I'm going to go over there and blow up his shop. That's what I kept thinking, Man, this guy. Very good. I thought. See, that's what got me in prison.

36
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

37
00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.080
Shaun W.: I think I was thinking about you and I'm thinking that I was thinking, Man, this guy, don't get my money back. I'm are going on lowish it up a story.

38
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So right at the that point so you thought of me and what might I have said if I was a little voice in your head. What might I have said.

39
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.000
Shaun W.: No, I just, I just thought, I gotta go back to prison. I hate to tell her about what I was thinking.

40
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.000
Shaun W.: I was really thinking I'm gonna go do that. Like, that's for sure. I'm dead guys get a piece of it. Okay.

41
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:31.560
Shaun W.: But then I thought, I kind of stopped this violent behavior just behavioral thinking that, but still fortunate dollars home. I was just let that go.

42
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so do you really want to see what the rest. And this is just an imagination, but you kind of want to know how the rest of the world thinks about it.

43
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the only person in the room. So do you want to know another way to think about it.

44
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay I my ears are really bad. Today, my last morning it's it's so bad that I can't. I can hardly even talk. So I'm terribly sorry

45
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's walk it back.

46
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you're going to want to respond to this part right away.

47
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But the experiment, the behavioral experiment is sitting with the discomfort of this idea being out there for even five seconds. So I'm just going to do this.

48
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to say it, and then you and I are going to sit, because I hate it to what I'm about to say.

49
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm with you. I hate it. So,

50
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do one for me.

51
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I will both do one. I'm not perfect. I make mistakes.

52
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You made a mistake.

53
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay.

54
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't know

55
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The differences if you were more comfortable with that, like you're not less of a man. You're not less of an intelligent man. You're not less of a person, you don't less intelligent

56
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: He didn't know what you hadn't learned. You think I or 100,000 other people wouldn't do that oil exactly the same way with what we knew

57
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I had a 78 Subaru I did what a 78 I would do with a 78 Subaru. I'm going to do with another car I did what I've learned. How can I possibly be responsible for something I haven't learned yet.

58
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But not you

59
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the exception.

60
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Your standard for yourself is unachievable

61
00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's cruel this expectation, you have for yourself. And so when I say, how would someone like me.

62
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: How would someone else that doesn't automatically because you have all your whole lifetime has been

63
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Survival in a violent environment, not just president, it's you're homeless.

64
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, really bad. So I don't I don't look at you like there's something wrong. I look at it like you don't have this rehearsal of this this way of thinking, which is in a different family system, you would have been raised with with this.

65
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh shit, I'm fucking idiot.

66
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys, look. What a fool. Last thing I just did.

67
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you don't have that and they will go oh my god I did like I did like that with with the blah, blah, blah. And we let each other off the hook.

68
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we go oh shit that's going to be an expensive mistake.

69
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we facilitate

70
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The intolerance for imperfection. My guess is, I don't know if you were in group and I think I might want to bring that article up if you didn't see this. It doesn't take too long to read, um,

71
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, not know this has to do with perfectionism. This has to do is how we value ourselves that if I'm not right.

72
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because notice with with this whole oil thing in the car. It's a beautiful example.

73
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Of how intolerable. It was for you. I'm imagining to the thing kind of wrong.

74
00:08:42.330 --> 00:09:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it was so intolerable. You didn't sit with it, like, not for the five seconds. But you'd be willing to take someone's property and life played all the way out. Just that's how intolerable and I respect that. Because it can feel life threatening to you.

75
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and I get that.

76
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's a way out. There's another way

77
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine that years down the line, you're in prison. You're sitting there in jail. And what was it 1500 dollars or whatever the amount was and you added it up, and you're like 1500 dollars. Are you kidding.

78
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.660
Shaun W.: Yeah, why did I do that.

79
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, I don't know how much that is a month. Really, I gotta kill this guy for this dumb ass shit. I can't just say I'm a fucking idiot. I can't just say I'm a fucking idiot. What an idiot.

80
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

81
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What Sean

82
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing now. I'm sitting here and I'm doing something probably kind of weird, like you're sitting with the discomfort and you're okay.

83
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

84
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: These are skills that were not taught to you.

85
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm sorry that happened, and it's too late. We can do them. It just means that in here in this therapeutic relationship when you notice this, like I

86
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, that one catch it.

87
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: On it as quick as you can.

88
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I was late. I was, I don't know what your things are going to be. But when you catch one where you realize, hey, I made a mistake after. Let me check something out trying to catch them as quickly as you can name them.

89
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can say, this feels really uncomfortable. I really just, I really just want to log off. I just want to talk to you. You know that that would be in the moment you sitting with the discomfort of not being perfect. One more piece.

90
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason why it can feel so life threatening.

91
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: For someone like you with that particular upbringing.

92
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Your value in your family.

93
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Was diminished when you were wrong.

94
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not saying that that's the truth, the way the universe works. I'm saying in your family.

95
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have gotten hurt hit not gotten privilege. If you were wrong.

96
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it's developed. I've got to be right, I've got to be. I have to be right.

97
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: My Ass Kicked or something else really bad happens, we confuse our value with having accurate data. What does that got to do with it. I don't know, a shift on a stuff doesn't make me a bad person. I'm still a valuable person. I just have a lot to learn.

98
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to shut up now.

99
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know what you're thinking about what's happening well

100
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:56.430
Shaun W.: I just, I just thought to have right away. My mind went to violence, like right away. I wanted to go. I thought

101
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:06.270
Shaun W.: It took a long time to see that money. I thought I should split the car works fine. There's inside. He drained the oil. It runs good like nothing

102
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

103
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:20.370
Shaun W.: But read the first thought that came to my mind was like he's not getting Elena. And I started thinking about to risk my life. He just over 1400 dollars because I don't want to let him get away with it.

104
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the, that's what trips you up. A lot of times it's

105
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A silica. See the sticky.

106
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.200
Shaun W.: For

107
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This is it. Simply put, but it's a hard concept. So let me play it out. It's when people are using emotional reasoning. Do not infer intense so

108
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say my hand is someone I'm talking to. Right.

109
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

110
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel

111
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Stupid.

112
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch emotional reasoning. If I feel small. If I feel angry. The inference is

113
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotional reasoning. If I feel something, then your intent must be true. In other words, I'm working backwards. I'm saying, well, it's my feeling so most people do. They're like, Well, I was hurt so and you made me hurt and you're an asshole. That's how most people work, you know,

114
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I've done it. You've done it. We've all done it. So we've do this thing. So it takes really being aware that we're just using emotion, if I'm feeling

115
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Scared. Like, I can't gather up another 1400 dollars anytime soon. I feel threat. I'm in danger. I'm feeling it. So they're threatening me must be real.

116
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you put time in between here and there. Do you want to talk to your mom first

117
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.390
Shaun W.: Laws. My niece. She put a mouse going

118
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.450
Shaun W.: That's, I don't want to look at it is

119
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, telling you doing something in your

120
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.220
Shaun W.: Sheila. She was wonderful. She put a mask on.

121
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cute. So this is a hard concept. Notice when you're looking at the words that structured like you know normally think of it like, do not infer intent from outcome. So

122
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Normally what we do, is we're only aware of how we're feeling right we feel angry. We will threaten likes he's about to take my resource which is my car, my money. I don't have a lot of it. So there's a sense of threat.

123
00:14:47.400 --> 00:15:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We assign that he's threatening it, but we haven't taken the time to find out if there's more information. So what you really need is just some time in here. So no matter what.

124
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That breathing not making a decision is your best friend.

125
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.170
Shaun W.: Right.

126
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:19.590
Shaun W.: I learned a thing before I speak. That's the best thing to do to always keep on what you're going to see to see. I know smart people are intelligent people they don't answer questions right away they wait a second.

127
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.910
Shaun W.: Family was trying to teach you to count to five for answer.

128
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.610
Shaun W.: counterparty three answer.

129
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.080
But

130
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take this concept a little further. What about when someone calls you, I'm

131
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: calls you a name.

132
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you know, right.

133
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: there ever been times when someone's called you a name and you really just

134
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a full and so it doesn't matter what's coming out of their mouth and it didn't bother you.

135
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:59.520
Shaun W.: Well know those guys work is. Matter of fact, that's long we got fired. But he, uh, he said something about punky like directed at me and I said,

136
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:08.370
Shaun W.: I said, Hey, let me move forward to talking to you. Like I said, I said little friends will talk to brands like that he's old man, you're not in prison were just chill out. I saw care. You don't talk to me.

137
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.360
Shaun W.: So we're going to be getting a fight.

138
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:19.680
Shaun W.: And ever since then, we haven't called me a copy of punk like you'd like directly to like a little comic

139
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:21.810
Shaun W.: Books.

140
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:35.580
Shaun W.: That he was all telling me you're not a reason why that's my staff here, right. I'm not in prison was I kind of blew it off because if I was out had to fight that guy. He did you don't have the fire.

141
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because you didn't have power down position and you can afford that. I get that.

142
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:48.750
Shaun W.: disrespecting me. And if you walk away. They do the job. So that's one thing. A prison if you don't fight, they're gonna conjunct you have run you out. Yeah.

143
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Out here.

144
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Strength looks like this.

145
00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just poise, isn't it, it's the stoic

146
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Is being able to sit

147
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: In quiet and not react quickly right it's different out here. It's NOTICE HOW YOU SAID THOSE intelligent people how they just sit there thinking

148
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they come up with some cool thing to say. How do they do that.

149
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: They create time they inhibit the impulse and for you if you like those five seconds. Your mom suggested, go for it. If you like the belly breathing. Go for it. But both of them give you time

150
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You need that time to think with this part frontal part of the brain that's the thinker part that's, you know, when you think

151
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember yesterday, I did this thing, or I remember 20 years ago I did this thing. That's the thinker part of the part of the brain that thinks about it's thinking

152
00:17:50.250 --> 00:18:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes us human. My dog doesn't think about it's thinking doesn't think what was I thinking about my dirty, but it doesn't do that. It doesn't think about it, thinking it just goes a. Oh, look at that. Hey, look at this. It just looks

153
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.810
Shaun W.: You want me to you in this situation that's going on my life right now. Check this out.

154
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

155
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:15.540
Shaun W.: Here's a bowl years ago when I was in prison. It's kind of a little story was years ago when I was in prison. I had a CEO picking up a bunch of eat for me and drop it off in prison. Right.

156
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:28.650
Shaun W.: My friend, one of my best friends. I picked up a half pound of weed and then I sent my friend have much money he takes off with the money disconnects his phone. He thinks I'm never getting on prison. You know, I was accused those murders.

157
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.490
Shaun W.: Well,

158
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:41.100
Shaun W.: I get out and I asked him. I asked him, I said, Hey, where's that money and vibrant already ran off with, and he's all I didn't run on no money. He was only when they pick it up. So I thought, Okay, I'm gonna fuck his wife, I thought. All right.

159
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.140
Shaun W.: So I ended up packing his wife and we end up falling in love and moving in together.

160
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.750
Shaun W.: Okay, and then

161
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:59.250
Shaun W.: Know, watch. So check this out. Hold on, he gets all the beds. He's a federal prison he gets out the feds and he's telling me hey don't dispute over to a chick. He's telling me you know and then

162
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:08.310
Shaun W.: I end up leaving her for she'll be back with the with the kids. And I mean, so I told her. Hey, it's over. You don't mean she goes back to him, or he messes it up. He runs off.

163
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:16.530
Shaun W.: Well, now she just came back. Yeah, the CNN years she just came back the other day from Haiti. Now, and the body son now they want me to. He wants me to go over there.

164
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.040
Shaun W.: Cuz I know it's on do is you know i mean

165
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.470
Shaun W.: He just called me. I know it's kind of a bad situation. And I'm thinking, I don't know. You want to get

166
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.870
Shaun W.: I shouldn't do it. But I thought you don't have a penis to backfill with Tim, are not about money.

167
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.940
Shaun W.: And I could have kept me

168
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you using the criminal logic thinking

169
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. With that, is that just going to be forever I execute revenge. And then he will probably and then I'll get to do mine and then she'll get to do, or is it going to be forever revenge revenge revenge revenge revenge. Oh.

170
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.370
Shaun W.: It's all I told. Oh, sorry. What I did, and I'm

171
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.690
Shaun W.: Sorry if I first started out, I was sitting, get it back in, in

172
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.490
Shaun W.: The nightmare.

173
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.230
Yeah.

174
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that I'm sorry, that's an interesting one, that that's new for me.

175
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.640
Tell me about what you

176
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the I'm sorry to your friend because you could have held on to criminal logic thinking would be, you know, screw this guy. I'm in it for the long revenge.

177
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:37.710
Shaun W.: I just couldn't believe you did that to me. I was like, wow, you're fighting for my life. And this guy. We had you're picking up all kinds of weird, I had a half how the bloody myself at one time in myself.

178
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, Sean.

179
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're telling me.

180
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:41.970
You can't

181
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't try on the thought Sean don't need the 500 I do

182
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me you can't try that on like

183
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.340
Shaun W.: I don't, but I can eat. Yeah, where

184
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Are in custody time right he's thinking this guy don't need it.

185
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.600
Shaun W.: That's all same 500. That's a lot of money and policy.

186
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. OK, so maybe he was thinking

187
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I can get away with it. It's not a big deal. So this phone disappeared.

188
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:13.860
Shaun W.: Yeah.

189
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess my point is

190
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where the skill of empathy would come in. That's where it because earlier saying I can't figure out why this guy would do it. Yeah, she can you come up with 10 different reasons why he would do it.

191
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: His Nana needed some kind of surgery down payment up and that's just off the cuff. We can all come up with something

192
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was, what's this showing guy. I don't want you know man. I care about my Nana and did it in there, a decision was made. Now, did it affect you. Now watch

193
00:21:48.990 --> 00:22:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That can be happening right then, this guy's trying to piss me off. He's disrespecting me we infer his intent from how you feel you feel disrespected

194
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So we assign intent to someone you don't disrespect you don't respect me. But that's coming from your head, your creative head. That doesn't mean it's true.

195
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you may actually respect people that you because you have this particular pattern of a way of speaking that you've cultivated over the years.

196
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You may end up offending people when it wasn't your intention to

197
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So it works the other way to you might get accused of bad Melissa sent intention when really

198
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: They just felt a negative emotion, but your intention was to be like What's up, but you may have a way of a turn of a phrase or something about an effect.

199
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That is uniquely yours, and it just, it just offend somebody, but it doesn't mean that was your intention. So that's what empathy allows it allows this. That's what makes us

200
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: social creatures and we've got to be able to have this where we're constantly moving and flowing with

201
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder what that would feel like in their shoes. And then you come back to the self and you go and how I feel. What does. That's how he's feeling. That's what empathy is it moves like this.

202
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: How did it make this other person feel how am I my mother feel how my, my daughter feel how my, my son feel if I was in their shoes and you constantly are kind of moving back and forth like this in your mind.

203
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can do that with the guy with the car shop to

204
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What is a possible assumption that you're assigning him that was negative, that really, he's trying to sell a car right he's, he got a reasonable amount of money and and and that was maybe his intention and maybe

205
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's a miss, understanding, literally, miss. Like if

206
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.110
Shaun W.: This room is broken.

207
00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There was also, guess what, there was a miss, understand if you didn't know about the oil that is a miss understanding

208
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all. And if we create time and watch empathy. If instead you assume what if you assumed a positive intention.

209
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm sure this guy means well I'll because watch what happens if I assume a positive intention of a person.

210
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to, I'm going to be more open my brains going to work better. I'm going to be able to remember some more open ways of communicating. Am I continue asking questions like,

211
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know I noticed this car. It's this visit it up, and this is these are the standard things that I do for for upkeep on it.

212
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been a minute since I've had a car. Is that basically what people do. I might have been able to say something like that, if I'm feeling kind of chill and not defensive. But if I'm defensive and I have to be right and smart and the best. I ain't saying shit.

213
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.720
Yeah.

214
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to look dumb.

215
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot

216
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.710
Shaun W.: Of time zone where there's times sounds on the ski slopes. The group, but I don't

217
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:13.110
Shaun W.: And then I thought when I made the comment about a teacher here. I thought it was funny, but I shouldn't I shouldn't do that guy should because I was just, I didn't, I didn't try to like this perspective. I started

218
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.730
Here with all crazy

219
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So wait, maybe you had a little moment where if you are the recipient, let's use that. Notice that I didn't continue it right. I didn't

220
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Say yellow got some clarity looking hair. I didn't continue it because, well, wait. Now, why are you bringing it up now. Did you go into imagining what it would feel like to have someone comment on a bad hair day or

221
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.120
Shaun W.: No, I thought about it like, awkward. I thought

222
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.570
Shaun W.: Maybe what if that's nice. I don't know.

223
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, maybe he likes his hair that way. Maybe this is best hair day. We don't know.

224
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:54.450
Yeah.

225
00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you're close you're close to it. Not that he's a sensitive guy but empathy would look like, what if empathy would look

226
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:09.210
Shaun W.: Look like either. I know the feeling that I'm trying to express

227
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What my. So try it on right now. How am I going to have felt when you commented on his hair. Try it on for a second.

228
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.800
Shaun W.: I don't know him. That's why maybe he would allow thought was funny.

229
00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But Sean I'm doing an exercise with you didn't quite do it in jump in. You want to do it right on what it would feel like.

230
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had made a comment about hair just try it on for a second. It'll only take about three seconds. Just try it on what it would feel like to have someone make a comment unwanted unsolicited comment about your hair.

231
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.510
Shaun W.: Yeah they do it all the time because I'm bald not

232
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not doing it right now you're avoiding an empathic response, you're scrambling around. I'm not unlike

233
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:57.660
Shaun W.: What what I'm seeing is that people have done it all the time. People are not doing it, you're still not doing it now you're using humor.

234
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Try it on. If you are a teacher and you cared. Right. What's another there's 100 million different responses, but try one on notice how you brought it up how my he have felt just trade on per second.

235
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.240
Shaun W.: That's what I'm saying. I don't know how you don't know

236
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to. We're human. We have a special sort of set pre programmed range of emotions with

237
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.310
Shaun W.: What what he could have thought that was funny.

238
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Your social. And just so you know you are avoiding it and you you're an intelligent man and you can do it the whole time.

239
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You walk into it.

240
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But the lesson will come and you sit in his shoes. Watch, just go there for a second.

241
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Go there for a second, how he felt and come right back to you. Just for a second. How could he have felt

242
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.390
Shaun W.: Like oh my keys on the spotlight. Goodbye.

243
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so feeling words. That's nice. You worked really hard just now, Sean. How about I'm

244
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Small embarrassed.

245
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.140
Shaun W.: Yeah.

246
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of ashamed, almost like maybe I should have spent more time. I just kind of showed up doing my thing. I'm glad I'm here. He works a night shift right so this is this is the end of his shift.

247
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you don't know that. So that's the point is that's where time comes in. And notice how you brought I didn't bring any I didn't bring up a tape today.

248
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You did so something. Yes. So Sean nicely done. You did it. We don't have to know the person's story because you are a human, you have something in common.

249
00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is, you have emotions. We have some fundamental emotions. We have anger everyone on this planet, probably has some familiarity with that one doesn't matter what religion you got

250
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We have this concept of

251
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Attraction and love like we have this moving toward

252
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's either they're running right is there is not their narratives, so it ain't there. Now I gotta go.

253
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We go right

254
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We know we know this. Yeah.

255
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to say.

256
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You sell it pops out around the corner with a big old sound good or hard hands come up. We don't have to think, hey remember hands to come up and protest protect your internal organs. We don't have to remember that we just right.

257
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:56.100
Shaun W.: Is it is it crazy that they see your mind before I even moved this finger, my mind is like 13 milliseconds or something before I move this my brain says the Buddhist finger my I'm already going to do it like my brain knows

258
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your fingers telling your brain movements.

259
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.540
Shaun W.: No, no, no, no. What I think is

260
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.890
Shaun W.: Not is not weird though before I even tell it to move. It's already going to move it.

261
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

262
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.790
Shaun W.: It's almost like you something else running me like it already knows what I'm gonna say

263
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is. You remember I was talking about the thinking brain.

264
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So guess what here wrap your head around this one and then we're going to go back to a tee as uncomfortable as that is

265
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know you are the one thinking what part of you. Does the thinking, How do you know what's you versus. Wait a minute. Is this thing, this is me right now.

266
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the ability to reflect back over itself to know itself. And that's why I was saying, What's unique about us humans is we can

267
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We can be obsessive we can be neurotic. Well, lucky us

268
00:30:50.370 --> 00:31:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But it means we have access to this spirituality. If we right well now I want answers. Now I'm thinking about thinking, well, now I know. Maybe I'll die and then what okay so lots of big things happen with this concept of being able to think about itself animals don't do that.

269
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to a tee. You don't have to know a tick story. I don't have to know any y'all stories. I'm not going to talk about what you're wearing

270
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to talk about things that are are sort of preferences. Let's say your style. I might talk about, um, let's everyone remove hat. Let's everyone

271
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Remove sunglasses. Let's everyone not in just mood altering substances, because let's treat this all it's all agree that this is going to be

272
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A setting to be taken seriously, much like an office, let's all agree to those norms start right not wrong, but let's all agree on them that way. There's no question. We can all sort of be here and try to connect as best we can, through this telemedicine stuff. Um,

273
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.550
Shaun W.: I used to go to that wall stealth and it wouldn't let me take off when

274
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.250
Shaun W.: You click a link to it.

275
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about it take for a minute. Notice, or you wanted. You wanted to know, well I don't know his story. But really, is that what it takes, or are there some norms, where you might say, well,

276
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.180
Shaun W.: I don't know, maybe I will maybe I will

277
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe right maybe

278
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe not. But the question has to do with this sort of social piece which is now i don't really typically crack a joke with someone, unless I have this earned

279
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Trust. So yeah, trying to say.

280
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:35.370
Shaun W.: Yeah.

281
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah we earn it.

282
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.830
Shaun W.: Because you learned, don't do that. If you don't know somebody you don't really joke with my people.

283
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

284
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's that's you caught it. You catch yourself in the right bottom I thought about it after add

285
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.000
Shaun W.: Maybe I shouldn't

286
00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.870
Shaun W.: But I got that girl that was all sad that are brother died, she was laughing She's here.

287
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.390
Shaun W.: She got her to smile.

288
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.460
Shaun W.: Better day

289
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

290
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

291
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.700
Shaun W.: Yeah, she smiles. What else could start laughing

292
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.780
Shaun W.: I thought that I thought, well, that's cool. She's having a really bad day.

293
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

294
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.410
Shaun W.: Maybe it was a nervous look on somebody else's expense.

295
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Nicely done. That's what you need.

296
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.520
Shaun W.: That's the park it

297
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Out here is going to serve you.

298
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you need is time and time millisecond.

299
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a deep breath and look how much so much goes on and those, like you said, like

300
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Be thinking about this finger moving. I already had the thought I'm going to be including that in. Think about the finger moving

301
00:33:51.930 --> 00:34:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I had already kind of been I had that in my mind that this is going to be part of it. My hands already up here. I'm going to be doing this so so much goes on in those milliseconds. If you create it with

302
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A breath before you respond and counting. If you want to add that love it about every anger management program that's out there is going to have you count to 10. So who am I to change it. Go for it. Do your counting

303
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I like the breathing, because I like the physiological changes that it does.

304
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.200
Shaun W.: But what do you do it.

305
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you need time

306
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Time to inhibit the initial impulse doesn't make you broken or wrong, and it might end up being that your first impulse was spot on.

307
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But you get time

308
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Media to teak really likes is Harry might get offended if there was time

309
00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe this woman that giggled was giggling because she was nervous and really

310
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't feel better, but she's embarrassed herself for a teak. We don't know what the giggle is I never checked it out and check out a tweaked and check out YouTube and check out girl. Look what time does

311
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to think about a couple other different versions of our initial impulse. So you create that time you can create it by getting in the habit of 345 you know just sort of

312
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: This doing the breathing counting to 10 five, whatever works for you, let your mind work.

313
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to have this also.

314
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You are not expected to know things you haven't learned

315
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

316
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to make mistakes like the rest of us. It doesn't diminish your value.

317
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.510
Shaun W.: Yesterday, my field called Little you

318
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I want to hear.

319
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:06.120
Shaun W.: My field called me yesterday during the group and I answered it. We had a nice chat. Real quick, definitely send back on. Yeah. Tony, you're doing really good man is I want you to know that I'm really proud of you.

320
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.710
Shaun W.: I thought, I thought, Man, I think you bring

321
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.100
Shaun W.: Up to yesterday.

322
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

323
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.120
Shaun W.: I'm aware.

324
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Know there's a lot more than that, Sean, you get up, you go to a job, you have to face interactions with people that what you probably impulsively.

325
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to punch him and in your rent. You're inhibiting them you're actually working very hard.

326
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably want to be taking three to sub sub scripts. A day you're showing up and you're doing the one you're doing a lot. You're listening to me.

327
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I come at you with all kinds of stuff that you're like, oh, what is the use of this. Well, that's what the park looks like and you're trying to

328
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.210
Shaun W.: I get. I get scared that if I get also box a little bit back to everyone.

329
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

330
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.240
Shaun W.: I get scared about the

331
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.430
Shaun W.: And I don't want that because I don't want to go back to that my

332
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:18.390
Shaun W.: Slides, as long as I have that some alternative or more. Right. But I want to do. That's why you're like, Damn, I used to get three of you, and then also know I'm not one to do

333
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So shine.

334
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think this parts for just step away back from it. Why doesn't display some bright heart health, just give you a sub and say, Have a nice day. Why do we do this part.

335
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.080
Shaun W.: You turn it off course.

336
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but with what

337
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:39.720
Shaun W.: You get off.

338
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a metaphor, get off drugs. You don't need me for that you could just start tapering. What is this for

339
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.050
Shaun W.: Hopeless.

340
00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't pay maybe your PO just a pat on the back of a once in a while. Maybe that's all you need.

341
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.010
Shaun W.: Well, see, I could go. I could go to this other place where they give me my whole script for a whole month

342
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.350
Shaun W.: And and and as

343
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:19.080
Shaun W.: I can go to, but I don't. I just would rather do my calculations over the phone and get done because this helps me with my probation, parole to so this counters. My counseling. So I'd rather do this then.

344
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.610
Shaun W.: You'll get it for once, because I can get a whole script once a month.

345
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not

346
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How it helps you stay clean that helps you hit a hit a mark that helps you through probation. That's not clean. That's not a life of sobriety keep keep trying. What do you, what do you think counseling is for. Why have the whole field of psychology, why bother what's

347
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.510
Shaun W.: Still be changed your life right

348
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to change your life.

349
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.150
Shaun W.: You know, it's up to me.

350
00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.910
Shaun W.: So just, you're just

351
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.660
Shaun W.: You're just here to help me, give me advice. Right.

352
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I take

353
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I take a lot of giving advice, actually.

354
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.530
Shaun W.: You give advice, a job.

355
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. You tell me. You tell me when I've said, Here's my advice for you.

356
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.820
Shaun W.: It is easy to do these these breathing. You're giving me advice, all the time.

357
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay advice and teach. Let's see how those are different.

358
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.600
Oh,

359
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I cannot tell you how to live your life and I promise you this. There is no way if I walked in your shoes, I would know exactly how to navigate your home.

360
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Better than you.

361
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that I could do it.

362
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You have adapted. I don't give advice. In fact, I am really careful about make sure these things you want to do.

363
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Or because you want to do them because you see the value all push right up to the edge and say,

364
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you thought about these other ideas and I'll try and teach some skills, not get up here and I'll do some fancy dancing and I'll sell you on some ideas. If you want to buy them try and play with them. Go for it.

365
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The difference between just a medication assisted treatment program with. Think of a methadone clinic where they just say hey how you doing, here you go to buy. Hey, how you doing, here you go to buy

366
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.270
Shaun W.: Always going to get on that too. And I thought, Man, I keep on that bad. I was like, oh,

367
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason I'm going to say it a few times. So there's a real clear understanding the reason that you picked up to begin with.

368
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Was because it was your solution to a problem. I'm going to say it again. You picked up along the way.

369
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Neither and if it's because

370
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't enough of a happy party or it was I'm anxious. I'm nervous. I'm sad and angry. It was a solution, a chemical solution.

371
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: To a perceived problem.

372
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.050
Shaun W.: It was a quick fix.

373
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

374
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a physiological dependence that is not a moral decision.

375
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason behavioral health. So in circle back to my original question, why are we here today.

376
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do not start to see other so loosens

377
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.670
Shaun W.: You'll continue

378
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll continue to think that escape is the only solution that numbing out is the only solution to I want to fucking kill this guy.

379
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When you only have I can't afford to have this thought and you cannot go to this list over here, the stuff I'm selling all these ideas.

380
00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a way to to love the self, even when other people are criticizing a way to have value and hold on to self compassion when other people are saying you screwed up.

381
00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: The many things the obstacles that you're going to face when you do not see that there are other choices.

382
00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be afraid to that I relapse, because you don't have anything to replace it. You don't have a new repertoire of solution of problem solving skills.

383
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think that people do on this planet.

384
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: When they don't reach for a mood altering substance. What's the, what's the rest of the planet doing that hasn't developed a chemical dependence, what, how the heck did they survive trauma and abuse and horror. They do things. Those are the things I want to go over with you.

385
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the things are behavioral and a behavior is a thought, believe it or not changing your thinking.

386
00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Second, I noticed I have a perceived threat tight throat stomach turning shoulders up, hands up. The second I perceived threat my new behavior is going to be

387
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder how this guy might be thinking something other than he wants to piss me off. That's the new thoughts. I was something that was said don't infer intent from outcome. I want to frickin kill them.

388
00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

389
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What

390
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.730
Shaun W.: Are you going rouse degraded. I want to kill

391
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever. So I'm here, I'm going. That's my first thought. I can't stop it. There it is.

392
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:33.360
Yeah.

393
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let me do that thing. What's the thing she said don't infer this guy's intent from how I feel. I feel rage.

394
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel anger. I feel threatened this little bit of resource. Oh, I found it. He wants to take my stuff my little money, my little car, my little privilege. My something he this guy's coming after it.

395
00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, right. So I sit here with a little longer. And then I do that I do the trick. What's, uh, what's something else, he might be thinking, what's a positive intent, he might have

396
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This guy might just be a friendly guy. Or maybe he wants to sell me a good car. I don't know.

397
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: She tried on what's a positive intent that this guy might be thinking

398
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:30.000
Shaun W.: I thought he came to my house to fix it. That means he he did, he did. That's what I thought, well, maybe he didn't notice because there's not that much because he came all the way out to my house for way. That's all. Though it

399
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.850
Shaun W.: Was like there should be nothing wrong I cards in the car.

400
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:33.720
Yes.

401
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

402
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So use that Sean. This can be a reference point it'll happen again short order Maven happened today you use this history.

403
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I have been incorrect about my initial assumption. I was about this dealer this car. Maybe this guy at work. Also, if I give it a little bit of time a little bit of patience and I asked a couple clarifying questions.

404
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be wrong again about my initial assumption, doesn't mean you're bad or wrong, it just means

405
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I was before I could remember that. And again, I could check myself on my initial assumption I can check myself.

406
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I assigning negative intent to this guy before he even find out some facts. Maybe I'll get my facts. Let me get some more information.

407
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's up with that. Tell me about today. Well, how did you come to that conclusion. What's the feedback for and I sit with it a little longer before I say I want to kick this guy's ass.

408
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Your solutions are have been escape for drugs and alcohol and violence.

409
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: There are other ways that guess what, then guess our day went like this. Hey, we're a little dull. There was no high drama. There's no police nobody got a bloody nose.

410
00:45:49.980 --> 00:46:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're like, oh my god, I was wrong. I look forward to when I'm wrong, like, sit down. My first assumption. I was so wrong because i was i completely missed the mark.

411
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we have a good day.

412
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.020
Shaun W.: Sometimes I think I'm a mind reader.

413
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We all do that that's natural we all try to, that's the brain trying to predict the future. Try and keep you safe. But that's only one part of the brain. This part of here. It's the one you've got to get on board the one that takes it takes the longest for your

414
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.490
Shaun W.: Frontal cortex.

415
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it.

416
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.740
Shaun W.: But guess what it takes the longest

417
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: To get there. It takes the longest to get there. So you've got to create that that time that happens that initial impulse. That's why this

418
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You want a little technique that I think works, you're welcome to it, use it. Don't use it up to you.

419
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: When someone says something to me and I noticed for me. I get. I get very anxious right here. I can feel these little pinches I do this, I have smile. I don't say a word and tell him to through it looks a little awkward bound care.

420
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds really important. And I'd like to give out some time I'll think about that.

421
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I do is a buffer. I didn't say anything didn't promise to do anything didn't label it.

422
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: DIDN'T SAY IT'S ALL OF IT DIDN'T SAY

423
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Fix it. I said, that's important. That sounds important to you because you brought it up. So obviously it's important you it's a little trick I have in my head.

424
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And all that time it took me to breathe means my body's more regulated and even saying this, I'm going to give that I'm going to give that feedback some thought and I mean you're bothering say it's probably pretty important to you. See how I'm doing that I'm stalling.

425
00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It gives me time

426
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: They get to feel heard, I get a second to collect myself emotionally

427
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You need time

428
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So just picture being at work, someone saying something to you. How do you think you could get time to onboard all the parts of your brain. What could you do

429
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.540
Shaun W.: Stop and cow.

430
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Something. Hey,

431
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.500
Shaun W.: Read

432
00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:06.060
Yeah.

433
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:08.070
Shaun W.: I like the breathing, too.

434
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.220
Shaun W.: Me too, me too. I'm done.

435
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you something, when someone is coming at you with a snide snarky insulting remark.

436
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it's smart to have a quick sharp cutting comment fast. Wait, wait for it, what do you end up actually doing coming back really fast with something, or is it sharp to

437
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess you got something to say. Okay. All right. I'll think about

438
00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:49.170
Shaun W.: That now that I'm older. I can do that. But it's hard for me that's hard for a man to walk away.

439
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:52.020
Shaun W.: Really hard for them to walk away.

440
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This stuff I talked about earlier. I mean, I didn't get to share the article with you around perfectionism.

441
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See if I can

442
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.520
Shaun W.: Maybe say, Do you know anybody to write stories that writes books.

443
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.490
Shaun W.: Or finds a way to write my story.

444
00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

445
00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.980
Shaun W.: There's a book out on it, but it's the

446
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.320
Shaun W.: It's, it's their story. I want my story.

447
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:17.850
Shaun W.: Of what happened to me.

448
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's a

449
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:23.730
Shaun W.: There's a book on the keys. My friend wrote it. He's a copter through the years. He's one that really

450
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.310
Shaun W.: Know,

451
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

452
00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:38.160
Shaun W.: Yeah, so I want to know if you know anybody that writes books or maybe some way in college will be there. That's bc like beginner right or something. I want to write or read a story, a real john Grisham

453
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.920
Shaun W.: Real I had the number to 48 hours 20 2060 minutes and all that and my lawyer typically do

454
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.830
Shaun W.: Not write them. He said, just let it go and move on with your mic.

455
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:54.120
Shaun W.: Is on. I said, I WANT TO SHOW YOU PEOPLE ALL CROOKED cops are I want everybody to know what it's called.

456
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

457
00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to be your, your in

458
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's

459
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, let's let's set up another appointment together, or are you still kind of

460
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling good about the bi weekly thing. So maybe may 12 at nine.

461
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.330
Shaun W.: o'clock at night.

462
00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a Tuesday. Two weeks from now. I think that's two weeks.

463
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that feels right.

464
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So Sean

465
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Your challenge, maybe in the split second after you perceived threat which means someone says something rude, I'm minimizing route, but you know what I'm talking about.

466
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:41.700
Yeah.

467
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Your natural inclination

468
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to be to meet that hostility with hostility, it will happen instantaneous

469
00:50:52.410 --> 00:51:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But just know that incrementally. The sooner you catch it. The quickest way is the body. Your body is going to register that threat before you think of a word or phrase a comment.

470
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to get activated, if you can catch it in the body. You're going to feel so much more empowered because our body perceives threat before it's going to catch a word. Okay. You're going to feel it somewhere in in a stomach turning tight chest, shoulders up

471
00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: This heart pounding short breath. I don't know where it is for you. But if you can catch it there. Then take the breath.

472
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright man, that's cool.

473
00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing about what you just server that's right and then by the time by the time you've done caught it in your body, you did your breath. You did your accounting

474
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're like why do I even want to comment to this full and then you probably not even going to bother.

475
00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, so what, sometimes you will if it's, if it's a mother. If it's someone, you actually have an investment in a relationship, then you're going to hang in longer and that will give you the time to go.

476
00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about what you're talking about. I don't want to make any assumptions. Right. We can even say it. I don't want

477
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To make any assumptions about it, trying to work on, you know, kind of slowing down and getting my facts straight before I give a response. So tell me more about what you just said.

478
00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another approach.

479
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but you'd make it your style, not the way I talk, obviously.

480
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see

481
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.090
Shaun W.: You soon. Okay.

482
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You too. Bye bye.
