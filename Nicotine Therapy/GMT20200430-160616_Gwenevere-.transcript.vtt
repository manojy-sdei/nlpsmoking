Cynthia We: Rap. It's called breath.

16
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.270

18
00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.520

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.300
Cynthia We: I was confused.

22
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.860
Cynthia We: I thought that the arm.

23
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:38.460
Cynthia We: The personality testing was cool, but then like I got these emails from life thrive, like literally 30 minutes later, that sounded totally like sales emails and on it was like Cynthia, tell us what made you reach out to us. Why did you want me to reach out

24
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.080
Cynthia We: A

25
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird

26
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:56.100
Cynthia We: Yeah, well, yeah, considering I job. I was just doing something I was supposed to. And they gave my email address us I proved it gave permission but um

27
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.950
Cynthia We: It was just, it was like a perfect example of the wrong tone of email.

28
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.480
Cynthia We: He should not have been selling somebody you know that just came that that

29
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.590
Cynthia We: Is involved with the organization's through a different organization like it felt like sales.

30
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.390
Cynthia We: He's gonna try and sell me something. So they're going to spam know even though I felt like it was interesting and maybe I could use some of the information they started sending me

31
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.830
Cynthia We: Email. I can't deal with any more emails I get many. I can't even get them new I'm overwhelmed with them. So I'm just like,

32
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess you I guess I'm trying to figure out how to I feel like I say blocks this one and then there they are, again, I'm like,

33
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.530
Cynthia We: If I a

34
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Bath and Beyond. One more time. I'm like your online know you're on my block.

35
00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm like, so then I dig a little YouTube. I'm like, No, seriously, how do you do it. And so now I'm trying this other thing. It's like a little deeper. And so now I'm trying, but it's my effort. I've got it.

36
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.640
Yeah.

37
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:16.890
Cynthia We: So many it is totally a lot of effort and and you have to be at your computer in order to label them spam. I can't do it from my phone and I most of my email from my phone.

38
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.630
Cynthia We: So,

39
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.750
Cynthia We: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

41
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:36.720
Cynthia We: A lot of them aren't, aren't spammy, they're there, you know, for the kids, things that they have to do, but everybody feels like they have to write this law. I'm the same way I start talking and I can't stop.

42
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.710
Cynthia We: In an email. Um, but, but, but I can't read them. I don't have time to read all these paragraphs.

43
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm in what tell me what was interest. Well you we can talk about whatever you want to. But if you want to say what was interesting about personality piece. Once you find

44
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.600
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah. So, um,

45
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.410
Cynthia We: Let me see.

46
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.910
Cynthia We: If I can find my results. I just sat down and told my computer to go ahead and update

47
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no.

48
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.490
Cynthia We: It had to restart. To do that, it me, it would be nine minutes.

49
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.590
Cynthia We: I know better than to do that right before my therapy.

50
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.460
Cynthia We: Except it's ready. It's done.

51
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.460
Cynthia We: Um,

52
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.860
Cynthia We: It said like that. I'm I'm necessarily a leader, but I'm more of

53
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:44.640
Cynthia We: Like independent creative like to do my own. It was all about work, which I thought was good, since I don't really work.

54
00:05:45.180 --> 00:06:00.600
Cynthia We: Um, as I started answering the questions. I said, Okay, I'm just gonna pretend that I'm back at Leo Burnett, and I'm me answering the questions relative relative to Leo Burnett because because they wouldn't have it any other part of your life only at work really

55
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.850
Cynthia We: Um,

56
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.090
Cynthia We: And it said that I follow the rules. I'm, I'm not necessarily a rule breaker. I am a

57
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.700
Cynthia We: I'm not necessarily a rebel I follow the rules and nice. I

58
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.580
Cynthia We: Think that's what it said.

59
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.540
Okay.

60
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.780
Cynthia We: Why are you years to stop.

61
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Said a lot

62
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Of it. Last thing last sentence again.

63
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.550
Cynthia We: Why is this computer taking

64
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:37.740
Cynthia We: 100 years to start. Why is it setting up my Mac. That is weird. That is scary.

65
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So it sounds like it's doing that read. Oh.

66
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.940
Cynthia We: I just don't understand why it goes through all that tough day doesn't make any sense.

69
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.220
Cynthia We: But I can't pull up any results because it's taking too long.

70
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

71
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.990
Cynthia We: You go there.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.510
Cynthia We: I'm on the phone. I've got my computer in front of

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how about this. You could see if we can. Well, let's just commit to the phone. It actually has better connection than

82
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.700
Cynthia We: I got

83
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.590
Cynthia We: Here it's taken me an hour to get through it because I updated my computer.

84
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.950
Cynthia We: So,

85
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.790
Okay.

86
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.130
Cynthia We: Okay.

87
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.090
Cynthia We: See you.

88
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.030
Cynthia We: Zoom.

89
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.740
Cynthia We: There we go. Okay.

90
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.510
Cynthia We: This is

91
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:49.050
Cynthia We: My score. My behavioral style. Is that enough

92
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.170
Cynthia We: Followed by applying

93
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.980
Cynthia We: Followed by influence

94
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.570
Cynthia We: And then dominance is way, way down.

95
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.430
Cynthia We: And, um, it's how I respond to rules and procedures and how I interact with others.

96
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.500
Cynthia We: And

97
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:28.170
Cynthia We: I'm good at being supported friendly and optimistic in most relationships interacting with others with ability to enjoy each person's uniqueness and I use balance judgment and brings to the to the entire team.

98
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.390
Cynthia We: To outsiders. I normally appear as someone who is cordial but modest and conservative

99
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.200
Cynthia We: When under stress. I may appear to hold a grudge if others dropped the ball.

100
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.340
Cynthia We: When I am anxious. It is normally in the midst of conflict which may cause me to lose face.

101
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:56.880
Cynthia We: Um,

102
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.120
Cynthia We: I think what's funny.

103
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.580
Cynthia We: Is, uh,

104
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.710
Cynthia We: Um, as I was answering the question, I started getting confused like

105
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:29.880
Cynthia We: They seemed a lot of the things seemed very similar to me. So I had trouble like putting them in order, because it seemed like oh that says exactly the same thing is that, so what do you mean you want me to put them in order. They're, they're exactly the same thing. So

106
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:39.990
Cynthia We: Yeah, I'm not really clear. I don't know actually I would do with this i don't i don't know if i know anything new about myself.

107
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.670
Cynthia We: It's kind of

108
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting maybe

109
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.100
Cynthia We: It might be helpful.

110
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's yours right

111
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:06.930
Cynthia We: Well, your theoretical mindset is not irrelevant. You will normally focus on other aspects of your life, which often take precedence.

112
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.140
Cynthia We: Right.

113
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.320
Cynthia We: So,

114
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.120
Cynthia We: It's got my mental approach here and

115
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.160
Cynthia We: Where will I go from here I can click that and probably buy something.

116
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.910
Oh,

117
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:38.580
Cynthia We: I really like Jocelyn. Oh, I think she's very nice and she's um. She's very cute like

118
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.010
Cynthia We: We talked today about a plan like a about

119
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.990
Cynthia We: A

120
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.200
Cynthia We: A schedule which we all my, my whole family dinner schedule because

121
00:11:53.550 --> 00:12:03.630
Cynthia We: We've been talking about doing it for a month. And we finally got around to doing it. And, um, it includes exercise and it includes family time and it includes time

122
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.250
Cynthia We: I'm

123
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.490
Cynthia We: Teagan we just found out has not handed a bunch of this, the sense them.

124
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.100
Cynthia We: So we

125
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.600
Cynthia We: He's struggling. He's struggling with

126
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:36.000
Cynthia We: He's struggling with sitting down and doing instead. And so we have to help them with that and on I forget my whole my whole point was that we came up with a Schedule A Jocelyn. And I did that, that

127
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:48.060
Cynthia We: I'm includes yoga and exercise and getting up early and go to bed on time, like all the things that I know I need to do. Eating regularly.

128
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.750
Cynthia We: I told her that you and I do more important things than that. So, so it's good that we're doing that on the side.

129
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:03.570
Cynthia We: Again, because we're working on, and my shame response and other things that are going to definitely hold me back.

130
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.550
Cynthia We: So it's good that we're coming up with the schedule. I'm in a different meeting.

131
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to try to see what you see when I go into pulse and look at it.

132
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.700
Cynthia We: Oh, is that where you're connected

133
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:27.900
Uh huh.

134
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Recognize I'm working on.

135
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And personality.

136
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think that programs open. I must have closed it a minute ago. Go back in

137
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You are holding wraps.

138
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.420
Cynthia We: Rap with w right

139
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.410
It is

140
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's right. You search there.

141
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So plan evaluation re evaluate new daily routine. So you have

142
00:14:52.170 --> 00:15:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: My new daily routine will help to improve my quality of life. I will wake up at 9:30am I will setting up an alarm if able to sleep early

143
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:21.870
Cynthia We: Oh, the whole thing was falling asleep. The whole the whole film is falling asleep at night. I didn't have a trouble last night though because I really got a lot of gardening done yesterday and exercise. I had no trouble sleep last night. So I think that's the key.

144
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.930
Cynthia We: To make sure I'm getting enough exercise.

145
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:37.680
Cynthia We: Because if you fall asleep at 4am it's not smart to get up at nine if if you don't have to, you know,

146
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So then you eat meals on time. Drink more water. I will do activities. Okay. Danielle activities daily living. Make a specific plan for the day to be able to do more in a day.

147
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: exercise daily to include yoga and meditation advise to do walking exercise in the morning and do yoga and meditation at night.

148
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: daily routine continue with gardening she plans on

149
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: structuring the gardening advice to do it on an installment and give her children.

150
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: With the planning and organizing the garden involve her children to the daily chores and activities at home, such as gardening cleaning walking advise to start first with attending online church services and once

151
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:26.400
That

152
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody can tell me if

153
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.520
Cynthia We: I'm laughing because she suggested church. And I was like,

154
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

155
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So physically, emotionally, and spiritually maybe attend an actual church service.

156
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: daily routine of sleep early to be able to wake up early sleep at around 12 I'm assuming she means

157
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.810
Cynthia We: Midnight.

158
00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh, read earlier than usual, to be able to sleep early do some yoga and meditation at night.

159
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

160
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Pandemic she has more stress due to some conflict arguments with her teenage son and husbands and he is currently doing some meditation, but expressed that she would like to do more.

161
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Take this

162
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Next to

163
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.300
Cynthia We: ordered a hot tub cover.

164
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.630
Cynthia We: I can't tell you how excited I am that we can actually fill our hearts out

165
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.750
Cynthia We: It's gonna be awesome.

166
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When we find

167
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Another activity that's around the house and right

168
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:11.100
Cynthia We: Totally. Yes. And we've had this Gatto, hot, hot tub cover for it's probably been here for 25 years like since the thing was bought

169
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:21.960
Cynthia We: And so just taped it together, cheap to together every last year, I tried to fix it and I take there was there was double sided tape on it and it's got all over it and

170
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:40.140
Cynthia We: I took covers are literally like, if I were to replace this one, it would be $600 which is a lot of money to spend on something that you don't even own and I'm Scott farm one for 329 and it's going to take them four weeks to get it here, but it's okay.

171
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.860
Cynthia We: It will be here before we leave.

172
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:52.260
Cynthia We: And help him to, I think, calm down. He's very angry.

173
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you mentioned a little bit of that in group. I don't know if he had you want to continue that.

174
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.170
Cynthia We: Call yeah I wasn't liking him very much.

175
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that experience like for you.

176
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.880
Cynthia We: Oh, I, I loved it. Um, I totally felt

177
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.570
Cynthia We: I so identified with what Wayne said, just because that

178
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:27.300
Cynthia We: Used to happen all the time was March, all the time. And then I would walk around feeling like I was an idiot like I overstepped and I shouldn't have said that.

179
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.400
Cynthia We: Um,

180
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.690
Cynthia We: It was really struggling, it just

181
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.190
Cynthia We: I liked it. I was really glad that he brought it up and it really made me feel like

182
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:56.100
Cynthia We: Wow. Other people have exactly the same response and exactly, you know, the same struggles going on inside and that that always feels good. And when somebody else you can identify with someone

183
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:05.460
Cynthia We: And Wayne always strikes me as someone who's got a shit together. So, um, I think he's been in the program, maybe a little longer than me.

184
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:22.470
Cynthia We: So, so my perception of him is that he's progressing AND HE'S DOING GREAT JOB, AND I'M to see him fall apart a little bit felt very human.

185
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:23.880
Cynthia We: You know, like

186
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.610
It was good.

187
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:43.710
Cynthia We: I missed the people in our group, like the last time I went to group. Let the time before this. It wasn't my regular people, none of the people were my regular people and that feels uncomfortable.

188
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.510
Cynthia We: I like going to group.

189
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.640
Cynthia We: I see the people that I know and

190
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.190
Cynthia We: I feel like I can, I can talk a little, little easier.

191
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.940
Cynthia We: I guess everybody isn't in group anymore though or everybody is like

192
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.250
Cynthia We: Skin scaling back maybe their therapy in their group session.

193
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

194
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: There are a lot of versions to why

195
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of versions on why they wouldn't be there.

196
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of them include what you just described. Sometimes it's because they don't have insurance, and it's for really expensive out of pocket.

197
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.240
Cynthia We: Bad it's $50 my insurance.

198
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.930
Cynthia We: And for somebody, and imagine

199
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people. It's that they have

200
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There's alternating weeks and you may be missing them, they might be flip flopping with you, much like you, you're attending every other week they might have dropped out of the program, they

201
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What else would be a reason

202
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Mr group or something.

203
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's there's lots of different reasons why.

204
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there was. It was a the closest to what is a process group. I've had a few of them, it's I don't get to do them very often.

205
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Where people actually get to talk about their current experiences and then other group members get to sort of vibe off of that and share what's going on for them. But yeah, I've got. I got some messages via text about that group to that it had a more meaningful impact then.

206
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep, they're just regurgitating information and I am acutely aware of how much more useful it is to have a process group and it's an open group, which means some weeks are going to be comprised of five people and

207
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically, it's that experience that you just described, which is

208
00:22:52.890 --> 00:23:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know these people. And so then the sharing kind of pulls back and nobody wants to sort of share their truth and we keep it light and fluffy and nobody's willing to talk about that vulnerable stuff.

209
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of reasons why this isn't a process group number one process group is supposed to be 90 minutes

210
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.890
So,

211
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I come from, this is a farce.

212
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. This is like

213
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you've got a morsel of benefit from it speaks to how much you're putting into it, how much you are very present for it and you are, you're ready to take this information in

214
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Because really, these are the way it's structured. They're very long there learn hour and a half. And that will go by like this because it's that exchange the whole time.

215
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.540
Cynthia We: Now wasn't going to do

216
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, for you, for you, for you and it's

217
00:23:49.650 --> 00:24:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It goes by very fast, but that last half hour is typically talking about how it felt to share to not share on to do that, processing and all I get is, okay, Cindy. You have 20 seconds to tell me

218
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What your truth was, and it's not enough. So it's

219
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.260
Cynthia We: Always something from group.

220
00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.840
Cynthia We: So I, I, I feel it's like it's very rare that I've

221
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:30.810
Cynthia We: Always get something you always have some good information to share, even if it's necessarily connecting with the other people. I always feel like I learned something.

222
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.240
Cool.

223
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

224
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We have about a half hour. What would you like to do, what would you like to experience today.

225
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.260
Cynthia We: Is there a dog barking.

226
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a small church.

227
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.670
Cynthia We: Here hearing something

228
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: He, um, he is speaking his mind.

229
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.940
Cynthia We: Oh yes, I hear

230
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:03.930
Cynthia We: And buddy.

231
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not getting his do attention. I do believe, but I think it's alerting us that there's someone walking by.

232
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.870
Cynthia We: Oh, of course. Of course.

233
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: windows are low. So he's little body he can actually see

234
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so his little notice

235
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So he's on point he's protecting the family.

236
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.610
Cynthia We: That's awesome.

237
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.510
Cynthia We: But I thought

238
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:39.300
Cynthia We: When I was when I am well I guess it was my parents when I was away at college used to lay on my bad, my bad was in them.

239
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:51.210
Cynthia We: I had the front room with the big window in the front and the dog would lay on my back and I you know I never went back to live there. So, so it was actually the dogs but bear

240
00:25:51.720 --> 00:26:02.940
Cynthia We: And bear with lay there and then anytime anybody walked by, he would shred like like go crazy and freak out and and shredded my bedspread

241
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.530
Cynthia We: On the bed like

242
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.820
Cynthia We: Because he was so he was a German Shepherd Collie mix and

243
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:14.550
Cynthia We: I just thought it was really funny how crazy. He was walking by.

244
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:28.950
Cynthia We: Imagine like yeah your dog is probably lose in it, but it's easy alerting you because there's so many people walking in my neighbor.

245
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

246
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.690
Cynthia We: Um, I don't know what I want to do. I, I

247
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.050
Cynthia We: I

248
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Will have been having some trouble.

249
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.500
Cynthia We: Reacting to

250
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:53.940
Cynthia We: God, I'm, I'm trying. And I catch myself every time.

251
00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:13.200
Cynthia We: I had some progress with love, my response to like last week we talked about, um, I feel like I she was right before you came on and I responded in a way that I would like to respond. Nice.

252
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.420
Cynthia We: Not, not getting

253
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: She wanted time with you or she wanted to come in right before

254
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.380
Cynthia We: She just wanted to grab the I pad out of here.

255
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:35.100
Cynthia We: And then she realized that was on the phone or on computer. And she was like, oh no, and she was scared and I, oh no, it's okay. Go ahead. You can come in and I'm

256
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.350
Cynthia We: Surprised that response. So it wasn't pitching.

257
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.450
Cynthia We: And

258
00:27:44.820 --> 00:28:03.000
Cynthia We: I responded every day when she asked me for the vanilla milk at night. I feel like I'm doing I'm really conscious of how I'm responding like I'm not acting like I'm you know flustered and bothered. I'm really making a conscious effort to respond the way

259
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:12.660
Cynthia We: I want to be. I don't want her to like annoying me. That's an awful.

260
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.840
Cynthia We: Breaks part

261
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I know and it's neat Cindy in very brave of you to bring us back to where we left off last time. That's what you just did.

262
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Very brave of you and you sort of found your way here.

263
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It was very powerful that work you did.

264
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking at some of the iteration statements.

265
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a phrase that you you used

266
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's right at the end and I had said, hey, maybe let's let's keep this going. Let's not abruptly and maybe you could do some journaling.

267
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know if you ended up doing it, but it doesn't mean that the processing didn't happen. But she said, I can see her doing mental gymnastics trying to avoid offending Me and you.

268
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Were sad. Your face looks at

269
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And

270
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's what you're talking about, again,

271
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:37.260
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's I feel like I spent my whole life doing that, trying to figure out how to approach. My mom so that she wouldn't get mad and I was ever

272
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.290
Cynthia We: And, um,

273
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:47.880
Cynthia We: And I, yeah, I saw the most feats that shoes like trying to figure it out and

274
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.800
Cynthia We: How I don't understand, like, how

275
00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:02.070
Cynthia We: I wanted to not give that kind of like I did not want to do that to my kids. How is it that I end of exactly the same thing my mom.

276
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.810
Cynthia We: I hated it so much, and I don't understand. Like why I was like

277
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.430
Cynthia We: Okay.

278
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can get to the

279
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:13.800
Cynthia We: Always be

280
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.960
Cynthia We: The even partner for life is experienced me like this.

281
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:26.880
Cynthia We: That I caused her to have such a feeling of being a pop

282
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychology will give you stories and explanation.

283
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Just make contact right now without intellectualizing without just sitting with

284
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the truth.

285
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.770
Cynthia We: You forget it's

286
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.810
Cynthia We: A very, it's very painful.

287
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.310
Well,

288
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.940
Cynthia We: Imagine it's like 17,000 times we're paying for

289
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:02.400
Cynthia We: It.

290
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's be brave and sit with it.

291
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:06.330
Okay.

292
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When is your mom head on back then and had seen you,

293
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You just saw your donor.

294
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

295
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

296
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

297
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit there with that.

298
00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what it feels like to accept what is to not wish, it's something else.

299
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not run away from this reality and wish for an image.

300
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Other than what is there it is.

301
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Either run away, we sit here with it.

302
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And it gets gets

303
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you already did it differently because you were able to do it last week you were able to

304
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like catch yourself more frequently and you were intentional about your response. I'm conscious literally like awake conscious, it's, it's not just my irritation. It is how will my irritation affect another

305
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And and how does her response affect me. And so it's interpersonal. It's not just Cindy's irritated and frustrated

306
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Is existing and I care deeply about it.

307
00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an and, and it has an effect.

308
00:32:52.620 --> 00:33:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And we get the US folks in families us folks that are humans, right, because we're interacting with people. That's the deal.

309
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be just one thing.

310
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It has an effect. And if we have the courage to not go to right, wrong with it. This is the key just right. Hold on tight.

311
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Except that it's happening not going to. How could this be, this shouldn't be I intended it to be something else, since I was a little girl can't go there.

312
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it is

313
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's right there. She's doing I recognize that that tiptoeing around and being afraid of me. I see it in her face. I know it myself.

314
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So how are you doing, tell me how your body's doing with this.

315
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:53.910
Okay.

316
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:56.790
Cynthia We: Okay.

317
00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know the end of the session. Do you know what you said right as a closure to the whole thing.

318
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is going to surprise you. I bet I was like

319
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You said

320
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

321
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't have to be so angry.

322
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: My mom isn't even like that anymore.

323
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens when you have kids, it seems overwhelming. I don't need to be like that.

324
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: They will appreciate it if I am more myself not flustered because I'm angry that I am failing miserably.

325
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Jim Shaughnessy doesn't feel that way.

326
00:34:46.080 --> 00:35:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The part about the mom you did that all by yourself. We were was this I cheese. I'm angry at myself for fucking up and being so disorganized right and then right because I had, I stopped the EMT ER and I moved to

327
00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The sort of inner, inner, inner, inner child piece and you were speaking to boys. Oh invoices to cheese. I was 20 years ago. You don't have to feel bad about that anymore. And then you on your own went to my mom isn't like that anymore.

328
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't say anything. Wait, sit with that try and do your own analysis and see wonder why I said my mom isn't even like that anymore. Is that meaningful. So if you can kind of sit with that question a little bit

329
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.750
Cynthia We: Why, I would say that

330
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't like why mom isn't like why

331
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.730
Cynthia We: Isn't all flustered and angry.

332
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:05.550
Cynthia We: With me

333
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're still responding like a little girl.

334
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not flustered and grab mother.

335
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So all it takes is you already have your good wisdom inside

336
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Punches be me. I know my family wants it.

337
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that amazing how

338
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of already had the information yourself and it spontaneously came out.

339
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:49.710
Cynthia We: Yeah.

340
00:36:50.160 --> 00:37:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the next week you stopped being that mother and you're this new version. It's not as flustered. It's more awake. It's more conscious and there was

341
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.510
Right.

342
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: A better outcome. I'm assuming

343
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.290
Yeah.

344
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.800
Cynthia We: There was a practice.

345
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.310
Cynthia We: from Loyola she's surprised.

346
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.940
Cynthia We: And happy. I mean, she smiled and

347
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.470
Cynthia We: Really

348
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: hard thing to see. Isn't it

349
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.270
Cynthia We: Is so hard.

350
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I can feel this one.

351
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Very strongly. This one is a

352
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.300
Cynthia We: And then I start going to, well, what have I done to get like

353
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.800
Cynthia We: I just stop right there.

354
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that's the jacuzzi. A SHAME right there isn't.

355
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:00.930
There.

356
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.570
Cynthia We: Ready to jump in.

357
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But she's look what you're left handed just went

358
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I need.

359
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have choice you can get in or not.

360
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's there. If you want to give yourself a dose of punishment.

361
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If you really truly are.

362
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.830
Cynthia We: Going to help me change though.

363
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:29.820
So,

364
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.520
Cynthia We: I think change is the most important thing in this case. So

365
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.520
Cynthia We: I have to do something different.

366
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And behavior experiments and you did some all by yourself all by yourself.

367
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you like to come. Now, my guess is, there's more to come.

368
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, more so that same skill that it took for you to sit with the discomfort of seeing

369
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The pain in your daughter's eyes, the fear in her eyes that you're the thing she's afraid of you have this one and you may have to sit with other really difficult things

370
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You up for the task.

371
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.090
Cynthia We: By now, yeah, totally.

372
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so. It's just this

373
00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are, you know, what's on the other side of that just thoughts.

374
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:33.690
Cynthia We: Yeah.

375
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may we're doing this hundred times in a particular day. Oh my gosh. You're relentless

376
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just go write it down. Okay.

377
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now for some people, I'll get into the whole scheduled worry time. Another time, but I'm

378
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm impressed.

379
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You played small and I can't do this home.

380
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.010
Cynthia We: Think

381
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:22.320
Cynthia We: I've come to think that a lot of this is about taking care of myself and making sure I get enough sleep like we're very, very simple things.

382
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:39.510
Cynthia We: Like eating on schedule. You know, making sure my blood sugar doesn't get low, it's, it's, like, very basic human stuff. And, um, and it's the first thing to go when I get stressed.

383
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.900
Cynthia We: When I get worried about things.

384
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:50.280
Cynthia We: Like that just goes out the door and I'm certain that that that they're related. I mean,

385
00:40:53.010 --> 00:41:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So for you, you need having maybe let's not downplay the elegance of halt.

386
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:02.370
Cynthia We: Yeah.

387
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.940
Cynthia We: Are great angry lonely tired.

388
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.860
Cynthia We: Totally

389
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.380
Cynthia We: I totally identify with.

390
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.360
Cynthia We: Every single one of them. Yeah.

391
00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: They're there for a reason.

392
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get angry at an oversimplification of how complex our interest psychic world is I'm more complicated than that. Give me a break. You can get angry and real against it. Or we can just resign ourselves. We've got to sleep.

393
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Eat and feed this machine, right.

394
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right feel this sense of deeper connection with other humans as a spiritual connection, you know, there's just some fundamentals about us creatures that are you can want to be better than it but it will smack in the face again it

395
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.800
Cynthia We: all comes down to hurry.

396
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, am I hungry.

397
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right into this encounter already angry and resentful, and my lonely that kind of encapsulate a lot of in my disconnected.

398
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I tired. No.

399
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Least check there and and then address those things. So yeah nice

400
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

401
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I say there's going to be more. It's the stuff over there on the other side of this

402
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you pull it down. It's like, oh, look at what I've done to Teagan but that phrasing is problematic. It's more like

403
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just use this when you have tolerance that I am growing with

404
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Lola.

405
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I see reflected back at me, my own impatience.

406
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Other things that I find ugly about myself. I'll use that same skill and I will use it. Scott, and it will you visit with Teagan and I will use it with every but same skill different person. So what do we call that skill you have to do in order to see Lola sphere.

407
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.700
Cynthia We: I had to

408
00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.790
Cynthia We: Be open to it, I guess.

409
00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.040
Cynthia We: Perceptive

410
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So unconsciously, you are proceeding it all along. I'm going to tell you

411
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's just

412
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.630
Cynthia We: It's just a became a willing to accept it.

413
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the word

414
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.460
Just

415
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:52.050
Cynthia We: Yeah.

416
00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And all next week. I've decided I'm going to do the whole every group. If I can less it turns into something yummy like a process group.

417
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be on radical acceptance.

418
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning

419
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The big ones I have abuse someone

420
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I have betrayed someone I have cancer.

421
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this disease.

422
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I had a shitty childhood.

423
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I was assaulted those this man I with his mean this child is hurting. I eat, how I just was five minutes ago. I'm talking about the ones that are psychological

424
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Rounding just

425
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: says do not do it don't you do it don't you accept, you know, don't look at that.

426
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, what radical acceptances

427
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the victor Frankel of turning lemons into lemonade. It's our core. How does Viktor Frankl have a right to be happy in a concentration camp. How dare you.

428
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How

429
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.710

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.210
Cynthia We: I love that. I love that because

431
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.800
Cynthia We: Of all places. I can't imagine being happy like that would be miserable and and

432
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.200
Cynthia We: I think it's the size of a very spiritually evolved person.

433
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.560
Cynthia We: That can be happy in the face of that.

434
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.150
Cynthia We: Happy in spite of being there.

435
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

436
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:54.270

437
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:56.850
Cynthia We: Inspire inspired despite

438
00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to be spiritually evolved.

439
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.480
Cynthia We: Oh, totally.

440
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

441
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the downside of being spiritually evolved.

442
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:14.970
Cynthia We: Don't know.

443
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: They're there.

444
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: She's a picture if you were involved.

445
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be some attributes of someone who's spiritually evolved.

446
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.920
Cynthia We: Um, I would say maybe

447
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:43.800
Cynthia We: Very connected to the people around them. I'm conscious of the world around them happy.

448
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:47.970
Cynthia We: Healthy

449
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:49.980
Cynthia We: Loving

450
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:00.300
Cynthia We: Nice.

451
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So I did ask what's the downside.

452
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:14.100
Cynthia We: Yeah, I can't imagine the downside, except that, yeah, I can't, I can't think of

453
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Wealth and why on earth are you not already thinker.

454
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:19.830
Cynthia We: I know

455
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.260
Cynthia We: How to work.

456
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Work. What's the actual work. It's not picking up a heavy object is it

457
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.100
Cynthia We: No, it's let it go.

458
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it

459
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.110
Cynthia We: Really thing, um,

460
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.290
Cynthia We: Except it's a cook.

461
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering what the relationship would be like with Scott, if you just accepted what was going on right right in the moment.

462
00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:04.230
Cynthia We: I've been wondering that myself and I have a book, we're

463
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.890
Cynthia We: Loving, what is

464
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.650
Cynthia We: Is the name of it.

465
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Which reminds me of Byron Katie is probably oh my

466
00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.730
Cynthia We: God, it's totally her photo.

467
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:23.370
Cynthia We: Okay, I was reading it. I wasn't sure.

468
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:29.190
Cynthia We: If I should really like by this theory.

469
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

470
00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.210
Cynthia We: I just heard it's her book.

471
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, she is the one that came up with the phrase, and I use it all the time. I probably use it in that group, which was what would love to.

472
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.820
Cynthia We: She's the author. Oh, yeah. Oh, totally. Yes.

473
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.940
Cynthia We: I didn't make that connection.

474
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.840
Cynthia We: I haven't read the whole thing. I'm only have like the first chapter, I started reading it and then I got sidetracked.

475
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she um I you know I tell people, I'll say, I can't hear you. What you're saying because of how you're saying it you know someone's yelling at us or game.

476
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: She's one of those people unfortunate for me. I was listening to an audio book of hers, and I couldn't do it because I can't stand her voice.

477
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.050
Oh,

478
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, whatever. The doctor says this Byron Katie. I'm like,

479
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.030
Cynthia We: Oh,

480
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.100
Cynthia We: So funny.

481
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.410
Cynthia We: But if I ever want to know what it sounds like.

482
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:49.890
Cynthia We: The idea. Um, I think that the idea of just accepting

483
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Read. Yeah. Reading

484
00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:53.280
Is great.

485
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.170
Cynthia We: It's

486
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Good stuff.

487
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.870
Cynthia We: Good stuff. That's funny. Interesting.

488
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.850
Cynthia We: But there and I

489
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.440
Cynthia We: Go to the library, you know, to drop low off and they have dollar books.

490
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:19.320
Cynthia We: I just can't turn down a book if I if I even remotely want to read it at some point in the future I will pick it up and it's great because you can spend like $20 and come with big stack of books.

491
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.380
Cynthia We: There's just pissing Scott on. He's like,

492
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:31.560
Cynthia We: Because with all these books. You just got rid of all your books. Why do you have something more. I'm like going to the library bookstore every day.

493
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You like her work. I think you will. Um, let's take take these last few minutes, and let's

494
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some reflection.

495
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, being this spiritually evolved person that

496
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: being something that you want and that part of me is this accepting what is

497
00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe taking a moment and thinking about your relationship to those

498
00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Lofty concepts.

499
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: what that might mean to you.

500
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.850
Cynthia We: I just think that that would be so

501
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:52.920
Cynthia We: Liberating

502
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.820
Cynthia We: Because just picks up

503
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.890
Cynthia We: picks up the facts.

504
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:09.660
Cynthia We: Rather than wishing them different because that doesn't do anything. It doesn't make any sense.

505
00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:22.020
Cynthia We: And it just sets you up for disappointment and frustration. If you don't just accept what is right in front of you.

506
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So you didn't mention it, but the caution.

507
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Reality is

508
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That you may be the only one going on that path.

509
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:47.910
Cynthia We: Oh,

510
00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You might change.

511
00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.760
Cynthia We: Oh, OK.

512
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:54.870
And other people

513
00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll accept that.

514
00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.190
Cynthia We: Yeah.

515
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You must

516
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:05.310
Cynthia We: Be accepting everything and and that would be accepting Marwan

517
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right where you get mad.

518
00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:08.760
Cynthia We: When I come to it.

519
00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, constant it. That's what this means. It means. Oh, look at me, expecting something

520
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I gotta, like, oh God, like a, like, oh,

521
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I just did it again huh

522
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it's going to be there again and again and again there's another layer of it, you'll discover another layer and another layer until this concept of just this groundless newness.

523
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you will flow to

524
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Be superhuman

525
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:50.580
Cynthia We: All right.

526
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know how you do it, too, because I want to do that.

527
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do that.

528
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.460
Cynthia We: You know all the spire

529
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we good for doing this again. Same time next week.

530
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.530
Cynthia We: Yes, yes. Again,

531
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.950
Cynthia We: Today, okey dokey. Have a good week.

532
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Teacher. Be good to hear.

533
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.500
Cynthia We: Thank you, you too.

534
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:17.790
Cynthia We: I
