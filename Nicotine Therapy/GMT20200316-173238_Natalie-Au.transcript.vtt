Zalan Rippeth: Hold on one second.

13
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.450
Zalan Rippeth: Okay.

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.050
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah, most people don't get it right.

15
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.970
Natalie Austin: Wow.

16
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.190
Natalie Austin: I'm not most people

17
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.210
Natalie Austin: Have you been in training before

18
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.360
Yeah, I'm currently

19
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.800
Zalan Rippeth: I'm currently going to a local place here but

20
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.280
Zalan Rippeth: I would like to change places. It's not a very, very good place.

21
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.330
Okay.

22
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.850
Natalie Austin: Um, and your prescription prescription is still good right now.

23
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.410
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah.

24
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.870
Zalan Rippeth: Couple more days or so or i go i go back Wednesday to get it refilled. As for the group.

25
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.200
Natalie Austin: Okay, it's 12 milligrams daily

26
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.460
Yeah.

27
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.900
Natalie Austin: Okay.

28
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.240
Natalie Austin: That's an odd dose.

29
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.810
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah, I know.

30
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.130
Natalie Austin: Yeah so easy to do 888 twice a day, or once a days I don't work.

31
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:24.360
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah, I tried to get them to increase it because I still have cravings through about midday, maybe later in the day, but

32
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:37.380
Zalan Rippeth: It's a, it's a really weird facility. I think they mostly deal with people going through court and people that are being forced to go through there through, you know, the legal system. So they're

33
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.460
Zalan Rippeth: They're super. I don't know how to describe it, but

34
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.200
Zalan Rippeth: Very weird

35
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.900
Natalie Austin: I'm room.

36
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.400
Natalie Austin: To hold the phone. I don't

37
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.430
Natalie Austin: Even go in there.

38
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.870
Zalan Rippeth: It's only been a couple

39
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.440
Zalan Rippeth: weeks now.

40
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.800
Natalie Austin: Okay.

41
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.320
Natalie Austin: Thank you.

42
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.660
Natalie Austin: I'm a couple weeks. Okay. Did you go anywhere. Prior to that,

43
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.930
Zalan Rippeth: Though I've been getting

44
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.050
Zalan Rippeth: off the street before that.

45
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.000
Natalie Austin: Okay.

46
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.320
Natalie Austin: Do you want to, you want to go with eight milligrams twice a day, then if the 12 isn't working. The 12 daily isn't working.

47
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.490
Yeah.

48
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.840
Natalie Austin: You can have. It's not holding you for 24 hour

49
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:16.200
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah, that would be better, it's it's weird to they have one eight milligram, and the two to two milligrams yet.

50
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.250
Zalan Rippeth: To tues it would take to take up all at the same time.

51
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.750
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah, that's not

52
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.980
Zalan Rippeth: Supposed to be prescribed

53
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.270
Natalie Austin: That's probably why it's not

54
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.960
Natalie Austin: Working for you.

55
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.380
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah I would assume it would work better if it was even just take a

56
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.350
Zalan Rippeth: Lot of the, the two twos later. I asked him about that. They said, No, just take all the same time.

57
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.880
Natalie Austin: It's like

58
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.650
Natalie Austin: Okay, that's funny.

59
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.950
Natalie Austin: I've been doing this since 2017 something. Yeah, three years.

60
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.830
Natalie Austin: You

61
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.360
Zalan Rippeth: Know, never heard that before.

62
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.800
Natalie Austin: Now,

63
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.570
Zalan Rippeth: That's crazy.

64
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.270

217
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:35.970
Zalan Rippeth: Right. That was just local people. I do get a I would pretty much get anything that was available Percocet.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.890
Natalie Austin: I know quest takes appointments

486
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.120
Natalie Austin: But I don't think the hospital does. I don't believe so.

487
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:15.720
Zalan Rippeth: So it's just whatever you go in it as long as there's a lab slip there you'll just get immediately.

488
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.550
Zalan Rippeth: Go through the test.

489
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:30.690
Natalie Austin: Yeah, you gotta sign in, you know, with your insurance whatever sign your sign your name, like a sign in sheet, then they'll call you if there's 10 people had to you. You gotta wait for a little bit was no one, and they'll probably take you right back.

490
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.390
Natalie Austin: Depending on how many is there.

491
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.960
Saturday.

492
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:39.540
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah, I have a lot of experience in waiting rooms.

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.430

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.390
Zalan Rippeth: Not joking.

498
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.530
I know

499
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.680
Natalie Austin: Um, yeah. So you call back and just tell them, and that's where you want to send it

500
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.080
Natalie Austin: You want them to send the lab slip in the urine drug screening, they can do both of them there.

501
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.200
Natalie Austin: And then the drug screens will come on the monthly

502
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.240
Natalie Austin: Drug the drug screens will be monthly

503
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:10.530
Zalan Rippeth: Okay.

504
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:16.380
Natalie Austin: And the labs. I think it's just one time. So that should be that should be the only time you need blood drawn

505
00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:17.970
Zalan Rippeth: All right.

506
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:19.410
And I

507
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.600
Zalan Rippeth: Think. Yes. So the question I had was just wondering about the labs.

508
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:38.550
Natalie Austin: Okay, and then you they will send you an email about the Thursday meeting it was one o'clock I she might have changed it to noon. I'm not hundred percent, but those will send you an email with the time and the room number

509
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.700
Natalie Austin: To call into

510
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.810
Zalan Rippeth: Okay, it'll be different from this one right

511
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.600
Natalie Austin: Yeah, this one's my own. This is my zoom room.

512
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:57.750
Natalie Austin: And Rochelle has her own zoom room for individual counseling and then whenever we have group. It's a different room number every week.

513
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.740
Zalan Rippeth: How many people are in the group.

514
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:03.990
Natalie Austin: That about 13

Natalie Austin: I mean, she's she has a whole presentation. She covered some really cool topics. She has a whole presentation. She does. And everyone coming

517
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:27.270
Natalie Austin: I mean you can mute your phone and just listen and then she'll ask people's opinions, you know, what do you think of this, what do you think of that and you're you can interject, you know, and add to the group at your will, whatever you feel

518
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.790
Zalan Rippeth: That sounds pretty cool.

519
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:30.720

Natalie Austin: Checked

554
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.920
Natalie Austin: Sense to

555
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.730
Natalie Austin: FR YOU TH pharmacy.

556
00:42:54.810 --> 00:43:04.170
Zalan Rippeth: If I have a problem there. Say, I mean, I assume they would have contacted you but if I have an issue. Should I reach out

557
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.040
Natalie Austin: Yep, just call back to our 201 800 number

558
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:09.810
Zalan Rippeth: Okay, okay.

559
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:25.260
Natalie Austin: That way, um, but like I said, they probably would have called me by now because I send the script to them for the last patience and I do it electronically and within a minute. They called me so they get it pretty quickly. They call me like

560
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.370
Natalie Austin: It was CVS, they, they, like we have a problem. Oh my god. Okay.

561
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:35.190
Zalan Rippeth: Yeah, I read CVS and Walgreens were there.

562
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.130
Zalan Rippeth: Something happened with them, they were out of the network or something.

563
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:42.960
Natalie Austin: Yeah, the offerings is out of your net. Why don't care sources network.

564
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:54.840
Natalie Austin: Okay, CBS CBS has some other issue. I don't know what's going on. I'm gonna call them, but that doesn't the CVS covers your with your insurance. They just have a problem with the medicine.

565
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.910
Zalan Rippeth: Okay, I think.

566
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.690
For me,

567
00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:05.190
Zalan Rippeth: I think they are. I'm not sure. I think CVS or Walgreens are owned by the same company, I think.

568
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.900
Zalan Rippeth: So,

569
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:07.230
It's

570
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.850
Zalan Rippeth: Probably good the finger from the top down.

571
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.960
Natalie Austin: You're right. That's good. I didn't know that that's probably why.

572
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:23.340
Natalie Austin: Hurting people to use anything but CVS Walmart's already out, not even the running game.

573
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.590
Zalan Rippeth: Wall bar just doesn't carry the medicines.

574
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:46.380
Natalie Austin: Yep. Stay out. They sent a statement out a couple years ago, I worked in pain management like five years ago. And that's when they send a statement out, we will not write for opiates at all. And that includes Suboxone and, like, a year later, they add is the box on in there, they won't treat

575
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.690
Natalie Austin: They won't fill up yet or Suboxone scripts, so

576
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.000
Natalie Austin: They just lump it all together now.

577
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.770
Natalie Austin: I know it's just

578
00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.050
Natalie Austin: That policy.

579
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.870
Natalie Austin: I don't know why this their CEO just came up with that.

580
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:09.240
Natalie Austin: I mean, I think at the time, there was an issue with, you know, a lot of pharmacies are getting robbed. You know, it was kind of crazy.

581
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.000
Natalie Austin: So I think that's kind of what Rama.

582
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.980
Natalie Austin: Ties crazy. Yeah.

583
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:19.800
Natalie Austin: Around that time, I think. So they just didn't want to be part of it, I guess.

584
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:28.680
Natalie Austin: That way that's more for the mom. The mom and pop stores can no benefit like your store your pharmacy them on pod.

585
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.030
Zalan Rippeth: Right, yeah.

586
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.990
Natalie Austin: So that's beneficial to the small businesses just which is fine.

587
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:36.990
Zalan Rippeth: It's probably good. Oh.

588
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:38.820
Natalie Austin: Right.

589
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:45.420
Natalie Austin: So we said, when they first made that same investable the mom and pop businesses or no.

590
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.880
Natalie Austin: Benefit, which is good. So

591
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.060
Zalan Rippeth: Good.

592
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.430
Zalan Rippeth: For her

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:57.660
Zalan Rippeth: Phil and I do Walgreens was out, but

594
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.730
Zalan Rippeth: Did not know CBS did not

595
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.190
Zalan Rippeth: Do that, either.

596
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:07.860
Natalie Austin: Will see me as just has an issue with my scripts, because I work in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

597
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.240
