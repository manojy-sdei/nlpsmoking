Dominique Pozo: That you can have for yourself and I'm gonna, I'm going to write them down in your treatment plan here.

TCL A501DL: Okay, um,

197
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:54.330
Dominique Pozo: And these goals. We can say that they would be met by, like, let's see, April, May, June, July, by July.

198
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.070
TCL A501DL: By July.

199
00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:01.380
TCL A501DL: Yeah, okay. Um, well, definitely trying to stay sober.

200
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.020
TCL A501DL: Is one big one.

201
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.640
TCL A501DL: To maybe trying to find a job, though it may be a part time job or something.

202
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.330
Okay.

203
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.600
TCL A501DL: Um,

204
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.510
TCL A501DL: And

205
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.600
TCL A501DL: Let's see.

206
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.670
TCL A501DL: Um,

207
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.760
TCL A501DL: I don't know, I can't think of a third one.

208
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.620
Dominique Pozo: Okay, um,

209
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.990
Dominique Pozo: Let's see.

210
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:46.140
Dominique Pozo: One idea it would be to potentially grow like a circle of friends or some support do you

211
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.030
TCL A501DL: Do you think, okay, yes.

212
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.740
Dominique Pozo: Do you think that's too much to ask right now being in recovery taking care of your kids.

213
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.270
Is that too much.

214
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:01.920
TCL A501DL: Know, I guess, trying to find, you know, a good friend or two that mean a positive ways. Good.

215
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.480
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think so.

216
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.580
TCL A501DL: need time for myself to

217
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:17.100
Dominique Pozo: Yes, definitely. And how about when you talk about time for yourself. What about. Do you think you could start training with your cut out there. Again, or just dancing at home a little more

218
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.910
TCL A501DL: Yeah, maybe, something like that.

219
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:28.620
Dominique Pozo: How would you name it. I want to make this year words, not mine. So what would you make your goal by July, what would be a realistic goal you set for yourself.

220
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:41.310
TCL A501DL: Well, how about trying to find a new hobby or a hobby period, maybe not new, but a hobby for myself.

221
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.140
Dominique Pozo: Okay. All right.

222
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:52.110
Dominique Pozo: Okay, how about exercises. Do you think that you could do a little more in the realm of exercise and self care.

223
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:53.460
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

224
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.100
Dominique Pozo: Okay, what would that look like just

225
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.650
Dominique Pozo: Again, I want to make it your, your language, not my

226
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.340
TCL A501DL: Time to to scheduling exercise.

227
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.280
And what kind

228
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:19.680
TCL A501DL: Well, either start getting back in shape for karate or dance.

229
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.600
Dominique Pozo: And how would you do that would be that'd be running or some

230
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.920
TCL A501DL: Know, it'd be more like

231
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:30.990
TCL A501DL: Like

232
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.780
TCL A501DL: I don't know how you say it like push ups sit ups stretching

233
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.840
Dominique Pozo: Okay, that's, that's great that's specific

234
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.360
Dominique Pozo: There's a lot of great things online that are like these.

235
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.320
TCL A501DL: You know,

236
00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.450
Dominique Pozo: 20 minute workouts. They're very

237
00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:08.040
Dominique Pozo: Quick and and kind of easy to do. If you do a little bit of research and they're not that expensive and once you have access to it. You can just keep replaying it and it kind of helps sometimes

238
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.500
TCL A501DL: Okay, cool. Thank you.

239
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:11.370

Okay.

241
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.190
Dominique Pozo: Okay, one more. Let's think of one more goal.

242
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:26.250
Dominique Pozo: What is something that maybe you wanted to do for a long time and you haven't thought it was possible. And how could you maybe move towards that.

243
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.240
TCL A501DL: Well like I said I wanted to maybe try to get back into photography

244
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:46.110
TCL A501DL: Like because I figure. There's no places anymore for people to go take family portraits, because the portrait places inside Walmart and Sears are closed now.

245
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:54.030
TCL A501DL: Right. So here in Santa Fe. Like there's only maybe like one photographer, but they're like really expensive.

246
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.850
TCL A501DL: Like $1,000 for

247
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.400
Dominique Pozo: 10, you know. Yeah.

248
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:06.000
TCL A501DL: So maybe get a good camera. Maybe if I could find a way to get a good camera.

249
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.170
TCL A501DL: Uh huh. And

250
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:14.850
TCL A501DL: Start maybe building a portfolio or something. So maybe I can make my own business out of that.

251
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.080
Dominique Pozo: You know,

252
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:22.170
TCL A501DL: Maybe do weddings or or at home family portraits with the kids, I've thought about that.

253
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.720
Dominique Pozo: Sounds really great

254
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.010
TCL A501DL: Able to work my own schedule and stuff, you know,

255
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:32.940
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

256
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.740
TCL A501DL: If somehow I could do that.

257
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.010
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that sounds very possible.

258
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:50.550
Dominique Pozo: So do you think maybe researching and potentially getting a camera could be the goal.

259
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.920
TCL A501DL: Yeah, okay.

260
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.080
Dominique Pozo: All right.

261
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.350
Dominique Pozo: Do you think

262
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:15.240
Dominique Pozo: Maybe starting the business as a more of a long term goal and getting the cameras, maybe a bit like the first step, or do you think you would want to aim for all of that. By July.

263
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.020
TCL A501DL: I'm getting a cameras first step.

264
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:19.890
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

265
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.620
TCL A501DL: I think so too. That's gonna be a big one.

266
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.080
TCL A501DL: Yeah, and then not only would I need the camera, I would need like an editing software.

267
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.330
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Okay, I'm gonna put this on a long term goal.

268
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:35.460
TCL A501DL: Okay.

269
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:41.760
Dominique Pozo: So, get some

270
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.220
Dominique Pozo: Software that appropriate software.

271
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:18.150
Dominique Pozo: Okay and and realistically. When do you think that you could aim for that. Like, could it be at the end of this year, maybe next year what just and there's no right answer. It's just really tuning into realistically when you envisioned when it's when, when do you imagine

272
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.080
TCL A501DL: I think by the end of this year.

273
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.050
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm going to put December 31

Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

275
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.290
Dominique Pozo: All right, great. And then

276
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.360
Dominique Pozo: This is just some relapse.

277
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:43.500
Dominique Pozo: Prevention so naming D. Are you aware of any clear emotional triggers that that

278
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.220
TCL A501DL: That

279
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.750

288
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:49.020
TCL A501DL: Just space like like between, you know, having our own personal space and a difference in parenting.

330
00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.210
TCL A501DL: Every other week would probably be better. Okay.

332
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:50.910

Dominique Pozo: That would be great because I i

350
00:33:46.380 --> 00:34:00.390
Dominique Pozo: You know I'm flexible to a point like you know the last, the last session, I totally understood. You went to the virtual clinic, that's fine. But if someone completely forgets after a couple times, it doesn't work for me anymore. So, yeah.
