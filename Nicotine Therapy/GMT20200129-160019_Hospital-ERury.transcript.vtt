109
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.200
iPhone: Was

110
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.890
iPhone: January.

111
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.860
iPhone: 19 or 20th

112
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.020
Joan Kandel: Okay.

113
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.390
Joan Kandel: So like a week and a half ago.

114
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.580
iPhone: Yeah, like we can have two weeks ago.

115
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.160
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. And why did. Why did that happen.

116
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.760
iPhone: Um, basically because we were in Dallas.

117
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.680
iPhone: And I couldn't

118
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:32.610
iPhone: get hold of anything. And we're supposed to come back early and then earlier than we did. We did it. So then, of course, it's just left without anything, and it's your

119
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.280
Joan Kandel: Show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

120
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.690
Joan Kandel: And how did you get through that time.

121
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.420
iPhone: How did you handle the withdrawal.

122
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.590
iPhone: I mean not easy.

123
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.270
iPhone: Just like lay in bed and literally just cry and my

124
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.620
Yeah.

125
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.230
Joan Kandel: Okay, you didn't have any medications or anything to help you through that.

126
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.330
Joan Kandel: Okay.

127
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.440
Joan Kandel: All right.

128
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.790
Joan Kandel: The reason I'm asking you about that Keegan, is that when we get somebody onto Suboxone and they've been taking fentanyl

129
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:22.290
Joan Kandel: It takes a little bit longer to get them on it because the fentanyl really stays in your system longer than other opiates.

130
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:32.010
Joan Kandel: And so we need to get you to a place where you're where you're feeling pretty crappy before you take the

131
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.200
Joan Kandel: Someone behind you.

132
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.710
Joan Kandel: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

133
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.920
Joan Kandel: Before you take the first dose.

134
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:53.700
Joan Kandel: So, so what we'll do, but we'll definitely get you on to the Suboxone you're going to be feeling much better.

135
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.150
Joan Kandel: Will need to probably wait until

136
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:11.010
Joan Kandel: Like tonight we'll wait as long as you can handle it. Basically, but the thing that's going to be different this time is that I'm going to prescribe for you. Some medicines that will help you not feel so crappy

137
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.190
Joan Kandel: So, so

138
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:32.490
Joan Kandel: The reason that we that we want you to wait until you're in pretty bad withdrawal is that I don't know if you know this about the Suboxone but if you take it and you still have opiates in your system. It puts you into worse withdraw that's

139
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.240
Joan Kandel: Precipitated withdrawal really tell me about that.

140
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:36.900
Joan Kandel: What happened.

141
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.460
iPhone: I wouldn't die.

142
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.230
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's bad. So we want to avoid that. How did that happen to you.

143
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.360
iPhone: I just didn't wait long enough, like you said, and was being

144
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:48.840
Okay.

145
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:50.790
Joan Kandel: Okay.

146
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.590
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so, and you had gotten some Suboxone was that from a doctor or just you bought it on the street.

147
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:07.500
iPhone: No, it was from the doctor that I had left from like when I was breastfeeding. And before I like stopped going my program there.

148
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.290
Joan Kandel: I see. So you just still had it.

149
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.200
Joan Kandel: With you. And how long did you wait

150
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.570
Joan Kandel: Before you took that

151
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.130
iPhone: I took it like the next morning, so like 13 hours.

152
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.460
Joan Kandel: Okay, and I made you feel crappy

153
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:33.930
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Yes. Okay. So, um, so it's kind of like

154
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.370
Joan Kandel: You taking the the your mid your, your Fenton

155
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:46.530
Joan Kandel: Last night, and then taking it around noon day that last time or

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:47.970
Joan Kandel: Two or three

Joan Kandel: Right. Okay. So, so that's actually a helpful experience.

160
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.020
Joan Kandel: Even though it wasn't horrible thing.

161
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.510
Joan Kandel: But you made it through that. But now you know exactly what you don't want to do so.

162
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:17.580
Joan Kandel: So I would imagine that it's probably going to take at least until late afternoon or early this evening, or maybe even tomorrow morning.

163
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:27.330
Joan Kandel: To for you to feel sick enough to take the Suboxone and feel the relief that you're supposed to feel instead of feel that horrible agonizing withdrawal.

164
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:35.730
Joan Kandel: That you don't want to feel so we are going to be able to avoid that. So I don't want you to be freaking out or worrying about that and

165
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.620
Joan Kandel: But I want you to really

166
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.230
Joan Kandel: Be honest with yourself and not be impatient, like, you know, really, you're gonna have to

167
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.850
Joan Kandel: Talk yourself through this and say,

168
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.770
Joan Kandel: You know that second

169
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.700
Got away.

170
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:58.800
Joan Kandel: You feel like you can do that. Yeah. Yeah. So the other thing is it's really going to help you to have some of these medicines that I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you.

171
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.100
Joan Kandel: Three different things. One is Clonidine, if you ever taken. Clonidine before

172
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:13.080
iPhone: Yeah, once whenever I went to the hospital once when I was when I went into the precipitated withdraw.

173
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:14.370
iPhone: I

174
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:26.910
iPhone: don't even care. So I ended up going to the hospital. And this was probably it was when I first started teaching the class again. And so it was like probably right it a month and a half, two months ago in

175
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:33.810
iPhone: The quantity and and like, like a Xanax, basically, but they had to give me like three or four quantity

176
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.770
iPhone: For it like did anything

177
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.350
iPhone: Was like a couple hours.

178
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.350
iPhone: And then something else.

179
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.540
iPhone: Okay, pretty how

180
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:47.760
Joan Kandel: It did help

181
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.160
iPhone: Yeah, okay.

182
00:14:52.380 --> 00:15:04.320
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right. So, um, so, uh, if it's a if it's a natural withdrawal from the fentanyl it's a little bit easier to treat them up precipitated withdrawal so

183
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:14.580
Joan Kandel: So it shouldn't be quite as bad as it was last time, and you'll be able to take the Clonidine before it gets really bad so that it can get in your system. So,

184
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.840
Joan Kandel: I anticipated this is not going to be as bad as it was a month. A month and a half ago.

185
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:31.410
Joan Kandel: But so, so I'm going to get you some quantity and that's going to help you with just the horrible, you know that anxiety and the withdrawal and the you know the twitching and the sweating and all that stuff.

186
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.080
Joan Kandel: It should help you quite a bit with that.

187
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.720
Joan Kandel: And then I'm also going to get you some

188
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:50.220
Joan Kandel: XO friend, which is for the nausea and vomiting and just that real queasy feeling so that'll help with that. And then also some Benadryl which will help you to be able to kind of Concord and sleep a little bit

189
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.350
Joan Kandel: So I'm going to get you those three things if you have some ibuprofen.

190
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.070
Joan Kandel: Yes, like Advil or something. So you can take that

191
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.590
Joan Kandel: You know, for the aches and the pains.

192
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:17.580
Joan Kandel: So kind of getting ahead of all of these symptoms is really going to help you make it through. As long as you can. And like I say, ideally it would be really nice if you could wait until tomorrow morning before taking your dose of the Suboxone so

193
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.880
Joan Kandel: Using these medicines to really get good

194
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.980
Joan Kandel: That it would be, it would be better than

195
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.410
iPhone: Because the last thing I want for you is to have

196
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.440
Joan Kandel: Is to take it tonight and just feel worse.

197
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:35.790
iPhone: You know, if you can make it through till tomorrow morning. I think you're going to be a lot better off. And then when you do take the Suboxone

198
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:51.240
Joan Kandel: I want you to start with just like two milligrams and make sure that it doesn't make you feel worse, it may not take all of your may not make you feel completely better but as long as it doesn't make you feel worse than you can take

199
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:52.410
Joan Kandel: Care of it.

200
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.390

218
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.820
iPhone: My senior year of high school really so 2012

219
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.740
Joan Kandel: And what did you start with

220
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.270
iPhone: I smoked meat a little bit

221
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.660
iPhone: After that, and

222
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:33.510
iPhone: I had tried like Coke, a few 10s of friends and then my step dad was prescribed like large amounts of 3030 milligram oxy Cotto

223
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.500
Joan Kandel: Okay.

224
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.160
iPhone: So I think so. She was actually a digit for a really long time and

225
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:52.380
iPhone: My biological dad has been in and out of prison like my whole life. I never really knew him and Mike has her own shoes. So I've always been on my own. I just moved back since I had the baby.

226
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.260
iPhone: So this was like the first I'm staying with my mom right now because we're in transition would be

227
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:11.490
iPhone: Like just a lot. I went from like having everything to losing everything and having a baby and I'm going to move back home and just spend a lot

228
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.080
Joan Kandel: Yeah, there's a lot

229
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.850
Joan Kandel: Yeah yeah

230
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:15.660
So,

231
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.730
iPhone: Anyways, like I said, so that's kind of how it started was

232
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:39.750
iPhone: I would take some for my step dad and doing here and there. And then I would do on hard and heavy for like a year, year and a half, and I would stop for six months to a year, year and a half an hour. Something happened on searching for like six months to a year, and I'll be off.

233
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:53.970
iPhone: And then I was also tells her like two years probably two and a half years. And then I just met the wrong person. Basically, and who had them all the time available and

234
00:19:54.930 --> 00:20:08.640
iPhone: It just got bad again before I was pregnant, and then once I found out I was pregnant. I was obviously like well I have to figure something out. So I got on the Suboxone and here we are.

235
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.530
Joan Kandel: Yeah yeah

236
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:17.070
Joan Kandel: And before you were pregnant. Did you use the fentanyl or just that's only been in the last month and a half.

237
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.760
iPhone: Yeah.

238
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.470
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Yeah.

239
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.380
iPhone: It wasn't like big like it is now.

240
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.080
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's everywhere.

241
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.500
Joan Kandel: Sadly, the end. Did you has it always been pills or did you use heroin.

242
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.340
iPhone: Heroin so always just the pills.

243
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:40.710
Joan Kandel: Always pills and with the pills. Do you always swallow them or do you sometimes snort them or

244
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.390
iPhone: I pretty much always

245
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.860
Joan Kandel: Always snort them. Uh huh. So you don't really swallow them.

246
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.850
Joan Kandel: And that's the same with the fentanyl you snort it

247
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.970
Joan Kandel: Have you ever injected pills.

248
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:54.870

249
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.980

431
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:53.610
Joan Kandel: In the content in the in the group. And then we do like group therapy and process as part of the group as well and everybody gets to know each other and you could support each other because everybody's going through the same thing. And it's really quite helpful that way.

432
00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:54.150

433
00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:06.210

434
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.030
Joan Kandel: And so we give a week at a time.

435
00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:15.630

436
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.830

451
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.780
And

452
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:37.710
Joan Kandel: And then they will every week they

453
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.410

454
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:58.530
Joan Kandel: Brief addiction monitor and you, you just kind of grade yourself on how you're doing, how you're feeling and it gives us a sense of how how you're coming along and gives you have a chance to reflect on how you're doing. So they'll do that every week before group.

455
00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.430
Joan Kandel: You'll fill out a band.

456

457
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:12.210

00:37:43.950 --> 00:38:00.720
Joan Kandel: During the program and you don't have to go to the lab for future drug screen for future urine. They'll actually send it to you in the mail. So, so I want to warn you of this ahead of time when you get this, it's going to be a big package like a big manila envelope.

467
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.930
Joan Kandel: And it's from us. And when you get that down below. Don't open them.

468
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.850
Joan Kandel: Know, okay, I'm not supposed to

469
00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:09.540
iPhone: Open this

470
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.010
Joan Kandel: And then

471
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.200
iPhone: Call the virtual clinic.

472
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.350
Joan Kandel: And say, Hey, I got this. I got this envelope. What am I

473
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.100
iPhone: Supposed to do

474
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:23.190
Joan Kandel: And they'll have you open it. They want to watch you open it and then watch you take the thing out, and then up and then they'll

475
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.530
Joan Kandel: Go through the test with you. So you get to do it just at

476
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:29.430
Joan Kandel: Home. It's super easy, but they need you to open it in front of them.

477
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.140
Joan Kandel: Okay, okay.

478
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:35.790
Joan Kandel: Oh, London.

479
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:38.700

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:42.510
Joan Kandel: Hi, London.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.670
Joan Kandel: Those are some cheeks. I just want to eat them in a fight them.

483
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:52.650
Joan Kandel: Are nice cheek.

484
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.510
Everybody says

485
00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.140
Joan Kandel: What a cutie.

486
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.990
Joan Kandel: Yeah, hi.

487
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.930
Joan Kandel: Yeah well Sherry's curious.

488
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.250
Joan Kandel: That's a good thing.

489
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.490
Joan Kandel: Okay, so

490
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.360
Joan Kandel: You're able to get to the pharmacy today.

491
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.060
Joan Kandel: Yes. Okay, good.

492
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:23.820
Joan Kandel: So,

493
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.880
Joan Kandel: What I'm gonna do is

494
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.010
Joan Kandel: When you were on the Suboxone before what was a good dose for you.

495
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.500
iPhone: Usually took two to three eight milligrams a day.

496
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:53.160
Joan Kandel: So, uh, and you would just be two to three meaning like you wouldn't take the same dose every day.

497
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.220
iPhone: I mean, so they had me started like three a day.

498
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:09.600
iPhone: And then they like start like their program is like, whether you like they didn't ask as much like how you're feeling and

499
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:18.060
iPhone: It's just more of like okay at this date. Then he looked down at this at this day you cut down to this. And so, um,

500
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:31.620
iPhone: I don't know. I eat. I mean, I feel like I felt better when I would like take a Suboxone like right when I would take it and that first like our I would feel good and happy and okay and

501
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:37.710
iPhone: Once it starts wearing often I would be like, eager to take another one, kind of, I don't know.

502
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.350
Joan Kandel: Yeah okay so

503
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:56.820
Joan Kandel: We'd like to do a little more consistency and a little more individualization because everybody's different. And you know, it's not one one dose fits all, in my experience, most people

504
00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:05.250
Joan Kandel: Do well somewhere between eight and 16 milligrams. Most people don't need to go up to 24 milligrams

505
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.730
Joan Kandel: And and we'll just kind of see how you do.

506
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:27.480
Joan Kandel: But I would suggest that we start you at 16 milligrams, because I think that you'll probably need that dose at least to start and then we may be able to scale back a little bit, but it would it would be only if you're feeling okay you know

507
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.020
Right.

508
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.630
Joan Kandel: Because I want you to feel

509
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:43.140
Joan Kandel: My goal is for you to feel functional and not be craving and not be thinking about using all the time and I don't want it to be a struggle for you every day. I want you to feel like you take your dose in the morning.

510
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.220
Joan Kandel: And then you don't think about it anymore because you're feeling fine until the next morning.

511
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:58.680
Joan Kandel: So that's our that's our goal. That's what we so when when you're feeling that way they when we know you're at a good dose. So we want to get you to that good dose and some people feel that way on four milligrams

512
00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:15.360
Joan Kandel: And they feel like, you know what, I don't need more than this. It's lasting me 24 hours. I'm not craving. I'm not thinking about drugs. I just take my medicine and I feel fine, it's really different for everybody. So, so, but we'll start you at 16 and and see how you do.

513
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:25.080
Joan Kandel: But definitely when you take your first dose. You're not taking 16 because if you were to take 16 and it puts you in a push up that precipitated withdrawal.

514
00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:36.720
Joan Kandel: There's just nothing to do about it. But so, so I'm going to get you the methods that we talked about, you'll get those at the pharmacy and I'm also going to give you prescribe the Suboxone for you.

515
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:43.980
Joan Kandel: And I'm also going to prescribe the Narcan for you because it's good to have an arc and kit.

516
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:54.360
Joan Kandel: For a few nor can kits and take it with you wherever you go, because you never know when you're going to find somebody who's odd and save their life. Do you already have an arc and get

517
00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:02.250
Joan Kandel: Go. Good. You're going to have one. So that's really good. And then at the pharmacy, there'll be refills. So if you ever had to use it.

518
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.270
Joan Kandel: On somebody, then you can go back to the same pharmacy and just get a refill because it's a really good thing to just carry around with you.

519
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:11.670
Joan Kandel: Never know.

520
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.260
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

521
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:16.590
Joan Kandel: So I'm going to get you.

522
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.770
Joan Kandel: All of those meds and so

523
00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:26.940
Joan Kandel: I want you to take the the comfort meds, the meds that are going to help you with the symptom. So the

524
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:31.530
Joan Kandel: Quantity does the So Fran, the

525
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.450
Joan Kandel: Benadryl and the ibuprofen.

526
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:36.060
Joan Kandel: Which you already have. I'm not giving you a prescription for the ID. Perfect.

527
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:36.360
iPhone: Right.

528
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.270
Joan Kandel: But those other three and then the

529
00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:57.810
Joan Kandel: So take those and last as long as you can last if you can last until tomorrow at this time, that would be great if you don't feel sick enough tomorrow at this time then wait until tomorrow night, you know, wait as long as you feel like you can. And then when you

530
00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.460
Joan Kandel: Want that

531
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.290
iPhone: Yeah, just pushes much

532
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:08.010
Joan Kandel: Push it as much as you can because you no longer you push it, the more relief, you're going to get when you actually do take it.

533
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:23.370
Joan Kandel: And then when you take your first Suboxone it's going to be the strips so you'll open the strip. It's okay to cut them. So you'll cut it into four pieces that first strip cut it into four pieces and take just one of them under your tongue.

534
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:34.950
Joan Kandel: And let it dissolve and and and just feel how you feel. If you feel relief from that two milligrams yes then you waited long enough.

535
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:49.980
Joan Kandel: If you take that and you feel like I feel even worse, then you just need to stop and wait longer use more of the quantity and muscle, France and wait a few more hours and then try it again with the two milligrams and see how you feel.

536
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:58.320
Joan Kandel: If you take the two milligrams and you feel like, oh, I actually feel a little better then

537
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.140
Joan Kandel: Take another two milligrams

538
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:12.630
Joan Kandel: If you, if you don't feel very well, you know, so like if you could take the 2 million rows you like, Oh, great. Whoo. I doubt that's gonna happen because it's not much of a dose, but

539
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:21.030
Joan Kandel: But if you do, then you can wait until the sickness starts to come back in a couple hours and then take another two milligrams

540
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.400
Joan Kandel: And

541
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:29.610
Joan Kandel: Once you feel like you're not getting sick from it. It's okay to take

542
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.180
Joan Kandel: More of that. So you could take the, the rest of the eight milligrams

543
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.210
Joan Kandel: And then the

544
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:56.160
Joan Kandel: The second day, just take the eight milligrams to start the day and see if that holds you if it doesn't hold you at eight milligrams. The next day, then take another half so then you would take 12 milligrams that day. And then the next day. You start with 12 milligrams

545
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:05.430
Joan Kandel: And then 12 milligrams should hold you for the whole day if it doesn't then go ahead and take 16 milligrams

546
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:13.680
Joan Kandel: A day and see if 16 milligrams holds you don't take more than 60 milligrams in a day because you'll run out.

547
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:21.600
Joan Kandel: Ahead of next Tuesday. So 16 is going to be your max but 16 will be you'll be feeling a whole lot better than you are now.

548
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.840
Joan Kandel: So did that whole thing makes sense to you.

549
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.670
Joan Kandel: What I just said.

550
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:33.210
Joan Kandel: Okay, because it can get really confusing. But basically, what you're doing is you're trying to figure out

551
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:46.020
Joan Kandel: During the course of the day, how much your dose is going to be to take the next day. So if you had to like take a little bit. A little bit. A little bit and you and you totaled up to 12 milligrams take 12 milligrams all at once. The next day,

552
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.240
Joan Kandel: And so keep track of it. Write it down. Take notes, you know,

553
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:58.620
Joan Kandel: So that you can keep track because with all these little two milligrams and four milligrams, it gets really kind of confusing.

554
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.160
Joan Kandel: Right, yeah. Okay.

555
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:04.920
Joan Kandel: Do you have any questions.

556
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:13.020
