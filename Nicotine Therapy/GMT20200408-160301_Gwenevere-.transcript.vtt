00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Salad didn't want you to have to see me chewing.

2
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you good

3
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.950
Kelli Ottnat: Sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's okay, the timings. Fine. I was

5
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Still talking with the client. So just now notice that I kicked you out of the zoom room.

6
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to keep each zoom session separate

7
00:00:44.430 --> 00:01:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just in case. Because everybody on this planet seems like they're using the platform zoom. So there's been some recording difficulties so I'm trying to keep them all. Just chunk together all by themselves in case anything goes, kind of anchor do, then it's just one session not 510

8
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm sorry I'm going up on you.

9
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so talk to me. How you been doing this week.

10
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.540
Kelli Ottnat: I've been doing

11
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.280
Kelli Ottnat: Well,

12
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.520
Kelli Ottnat: Mentally pretty strong.

13
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
Kelli Ottnat: I've just kind of been sitting back here at the house.

14
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.980
Kelli Ottnat: Haven't had much contact with my son at all and a couple of weeks I'm, I'm assuming he's down in Louisiana. I'm assuming that

15
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.460
Kelli Ottnat: Maybe he's with other family and his grandparents, just don't want to answer the phone.

16
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.510
Kelli Ottnat: Which is falling.

17
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you see there for a little bit. I I'm missing some pieces of course you know you were living it, but I don't know where it left with. I'm going to go. I'm in Louisiana. I got to see him once, and then you disappeared.

18
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.890
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, it was, it was kind of tough. I was, I was really hoping to stay in Louisiana.

19
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.940
Kelli Ottnat: And get a job and and work on getting him back.

20
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.150
Kelli Ottnat: But the, the only place I had to stay. I mean, there was

21
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.120
Kelli Ottnat: There was quite a bit of drug use a

22
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.920
Kelli Ottnat: I did. I didn't get in the mix of it, but it was just

23
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.770
Kelli Ottnat: Chaotic I couldn't. There wasn't really a place for me.

24
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.570
Kelli Ottnat: And of course that

25
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.230
Kelli Ottnat: I miss Scott

26
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming you're sitting together. He's lying in bed.

27
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's what I'm hearing

28
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.740
Kelli Ottnat: No, he's he's at work.

29
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your dog.

30
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.700
Kelli Ottnat: Uh huh. Yeah.

31
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

32
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.920
Kelli Ottnat: Right there.

33
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there. That's adorable.

34
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this our first time meeting since we did the bio psychosocial

35
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like it is.

36
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We met April 4 we did an a kind of modified psychosocial we took prior information. I feel like this is the first time we're meeting.

37
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.350
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, I had checked in at 530 but that wasn't really a

38
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, no, I'm just talking about because I'm looking at my notes and like what the last time was bio psychosocial. We haven't met any other time. Besides that, so I'm just checking myself. All right.

39
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't, you're fine.

40
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just I gotta re label it.

41
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

42
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta get my name straight. I've got your son, and I know I'm going to mess it up. It's like Judah, Joe, something like that. Right.

43
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.530
Dude,

44
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's teen 13. What's the age again.

45
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: He's 813 from

46
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

47
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What did I get that age summer okay so age eight, for whatever reason, I made this story like men at a park son somewhere. I don't know where I got that I'm

48
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember how it was it was I think these grandparents are keeping him from me. I'm going to go up there. I need to see my son, but I don't understand what how I don't understand how you got to see him i don't i don't get that. Could you fill me in

49
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.530
Kelli Ottnat: Well I, I drove down there and

50
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.880
Kelli Ottnat: As soon as I got in town. I called

51
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.460
Kelli Ottnat: In and his grandpa brought him to Jude's grandpa brought him to a park.

52
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a car. I was right.

53
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What was that like to see little man.

54
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.040
Kelli Ottnat: It's always you know bittersweet every time we meet

55
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.150
Kelli Ottnat: Of course, we both miss each other.

56
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.270
Kelli Ottnat: Within the visit end

57
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.600
Kelli Ottnat: And that makes it hard on Jude.

58
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What about what about you.

59
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.760
Kelli Ottnat: And it's tough, but I've kind of

60
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.570
Kelli Ottnat: become callous to it, you know, to

61
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.160
Kelli Ottnat: I know I want to see him. And I know it's gonna, you know, it always hurts, leaving them but

62
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.050
Kelli Ottnat: It's a lot tougher on him. The last time I think it was the last time we met.

63
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:59.880
Kelli Ottnat: He are actually I've seen him a couple of times a few times but the first time that I'm talking with you about after the visit. He had to meet with a psychiatrist.

64
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But what was the behaviors. Do you know what they were. I was breaking things. I had a tantrum. I had a crying spell. I was catatonic what were the behaviors that determine the decision to see a psychiatrist or psychologist.

65
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.810
And

66
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.600
Kelli Ottnat: They didn't tell me specifically

67
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't want to know.

68
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.920
Kelli Ottnat: He was acting out in school.

69
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go.

70
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.740
Okay.

71
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

72
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make you think

73
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.290
Kelli Ottnat: That he's angry.

74
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: angry, angry about

75
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.640
Um,

76
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:53.670
Kelli Ottnat: I'm assuming I would feel like I think he probably feels trapped there with his grandparents.

77
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.450
Kelli Ottnat: It's tough, even, even the phone conversations we have.

78
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:16.320
Kelli Ottnat: Is grandpa is norm, you know they're they're very short within two or three minutes and his grandpa is normally got him on speakerphone.

79
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:29.550
Kelli Ottnat: Pushing him to talk to me. And sometimes we just want to be on you know he'll want to be on the phone and be thinking about what he wants to talk about in his grandpa's Russian talk to your mom, you know,

80
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.020
And

81
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.490
Kelli Ottnat: And then he always pushes them to hang up the phone and it's

82
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's not that's not you and Jude connecting all that right. It's not the same.

83
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a forced contrived experience that's not ideal. I hear you. Yeah, okay.

84
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How about the time that you got to see him was there. Were there moments where granddad pulled back long enough you can have that nice slow flow where there was this quiet. You could just sort of be together at the park. Yeah, yeah.

85
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.330
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, he didn't really get he's actually in a walker. Now the Grandpa.

86
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandpa. Yeah.

87
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.360
Kelli Ottnat: So, um,

88
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:32.700
Kelli Ottnat: Typically, he'll you know he'll stay in the truck or it'll take them a while to get down to the park. So we'll go off and

89
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.980
Kelli Ottnat: Kind of visit

90
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And What strengths do you see in Jude. What do you like seeing him. What, what are your strengths

91
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.800
Kelli Ottnat: He's

92
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.370
Kelli Ottnat: He's so strong, to be able to deal with all of this for one

93
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.450
Kelli Ottnat: He's funny.

94
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.600
Kelli Ottnat: Is really funny.

95
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.070
Kelli Ottnat: I really don't know him to. Well, I know he's got a lot of strength.

96
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay there. Notice that you're crying.

97
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I invited to talk about the strengths

98
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that tier, right, if we can do some metaphor for a minute. What do you think that tier might be saying,

99
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Your tier

100
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.600
Kelli Ottnat: But i wanna i

101
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.900
Kelli Ottnat: Want to get to know my baby more

102
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. And there's some obstacles.

103
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the status.

104
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: From the courts.

105
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What's there. What's the legal because you I you know I signed something don't even know if it was legal. That's how it stuck in my memory. Right. And so it's like, well, let's get clear. Are you clear what is your legal standing with Jude.

106
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.610
Kelli Ottnat: Um,

107
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:30.180
Kelli Ottnat: Well, right now there's papers to just say visitation that the grandpa's discretion.

108
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:40.230
Kelli Ottnat: Which I was I was rushed to sign them. It was like it was in the evening, the day that I signed the papers. It was late in the evening.

109
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.330
Kelli Ottnat: And a

110
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.970
Kelli Ottnat: great grandpa kept calling me to come to a lawyers office.

111
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.620
Kelli Ottnat: Before they closed. I guess the office had already been closed and

112
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.160
Kelli Ottnat: I pulled up there and

113
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:07.290
Kelli Ottnat: It was real fast that it was a stack of papers. I didn't really read their like just sign these offices close these people need to get out of here.

114
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.030
Kelli Ottnat: And

115
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.580
Kelli Ottnat: My reason for signing them was I didn't want you to go to OCS care.

116
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:16.830
Kelli Ottnat: So,

117
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.710
Kelli Ottnat: I signed them in

118
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:26.310
Kelli Ottnat: Later I found out that the visitation was at the grandpa's discretion and the paperwork.

119
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.260
Kelli Ottnat: So I don't really know where we stand.

120
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a

121
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Copy of that paperwork.

122
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.250
Kelli Ottnat: Uh huh.

123
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have it.

124
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.280
Kelli Ottnat: I'm kind of

125
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.390
Kelli Ottnat: Afraid to read it.

126
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well, we can do it together. If it turns out that somehow we can bolster that with my presence here. Maybe I could read it, or let's see how that plays out, but it's a lot to say. I'm afraid to read it.

127
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's enough to just sit with getting

128
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Some comfort or familiarity with that night.

129
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm guessing there's

130
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Why really

131
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like what's going on.

132
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, why, then why arriving late when everyone's leaving was that addiction running the show back then.

133
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.460
Kelli Ottnat: It could have been

134
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.240
Okay.

135
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how likely

136
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What else would have kept you from going to that import appointment on time except the attic.

137
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What else could have gotten in the way besides

138
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.850
Kelli Ottnat: Me not wanting to sign the papers.

139
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

140
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, baby. I got you.

141
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I hadn't thought about that one. Like, I may not know what and how to navigate this force, but I can procrastinate like I can stall. Okay, I see it.

142
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, not wanting to sign

143
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What else might have kept you from getting there, and time to read it.

144
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:31.590
Kelli Ottnat: I think now that I think about back. That was, that was it. I felt kind of forced Jude's dad was in jail.

145
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.420
And

146
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.990
Kelli Ottnat: I didn't really have anybody to talk to about it.

147
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You said there could have been some influence of substance.

148
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How much

149
00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Either heroin or math or I'm not sure what all you were doing at the time, how much of it. How deeply entrenched. Were you at that right at that moment on that day or that 72 hour time span how how bad wasn't right at that point.

150
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.930
Kelli Ottnat: Honestly, I don't even

151
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

152
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.050
Kelli Ottnat: It was probably pretty bad.

153
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.690
Kelli Ottnat: I know I was on methadone. Okay.

154
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you also using even though you're on methadone.

155
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.930
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, at that point in time.

156
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We ever told anybody not

157
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.080
Kelli Ottnat: Actually, hold on.

158
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:46.980
Okay.

159
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.680
Kelli Ottnat: When OCS garden. There was some nothingness.

160
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:01.230
Kelli Ottnat: I've been to the day really that OCS got involved.

161
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.680
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, and and I quit. I quit meth, I was just taking the Methadone

162
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But why, why, there must have been something else.

163
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because method know doesn't really treat methamphetamine. So will you also doing heroin at the time to

164
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, why did you choose methadone.

165
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

166
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Creating prevention.

167
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:32.190
Because I'm

168
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.210
Kelli Ottnat: Taking

169
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.000
Kelli Ottnat: pain pills before

170
00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.960
Kelli Ottnat: Before I got pregnant with Jude.

171
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.330
Kelli Ottnat: And

172
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.350
Kelli Ottnat: And when I got pregnant.

173
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.050
Kelli Ottnat: I was told that methadone was

174
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.030
Kelli Ottnat: I got a safe alternative. Okay.

175
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see if I get the time from I remember this with you before I have a hard time tracking timeline with you and I'm feeling it again.

176
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know if it feels like that to you. Does it feel like you have a hard time catching dates with certain events. Does it feel like

177
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:26.730
Kelli Ottnat: Some what

178
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:35.430
Kelli Ottnat: Are some things that really stand out like like the OCI situation. I remember that.

179
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's get a piece of paper together. Let's do it together. Grab it. You got a pen. Let's grab a paper so that I can, I can do it with you. So I'm going to put right here, a very central event is that one. I'm going to draw horizontal line and then like this.

180
00:17:53.730 --> 00:18:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's going to be this one right here in the middle. That's going to be the and you have it out here. It's def department children, families, you know, New Mexico. It's something similar to that. See why FT guys call it out there. So, out, up in Louisiana its own si se

181
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.190
Kelli Ottnat: Just OCS

182
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. Okay. And that was, we're thinking

183
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What year

184
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is 2020 now.

185
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.360
That was

186
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.850
Kelli Ottnat: Okay, so that would be

187
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:13.920
Kelli Ottnat: Probably 2014 okay

188
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a pencil I can always change it.

189
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: If it starts to shift, you know, the sort of that timing shifts once more things get on the timeline and

190
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to 2012

191
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's write

192
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. A little hash mark for 2011 10

193
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go all the way to when you're pregnant.

194
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so at that point. Let's go back. Let's go to

201
00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: My calendar for months and see if I can

202
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Try it that way.

203
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

204
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So found out pregnant sometime maybe August, maybe, something like that.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: 2010 maybe somewhere in there.

206
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.130
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah.

207
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:36.720
Kelli Ottnat: Right.

208
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.070
Okay.

209
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that timeline and you said, Well, I was using pills, up until I found out I was pregnant or some months into the pregnancy.

210
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.540
Kelli Ottnat: Until I found out I was pregnant.

211
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And do you think that was August, maybe pretty early. Few weeks into it or

212
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.930
Kelli Ottnat: Yes.

213
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.620
Okay.

214
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long had you been taking pills.

215
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.480
Kelli Ottnat: And

216
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.290
Kelli Ottnat: Really since I was about 16

217
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.530
Kelli Ottnat: Pretty much pretty steady

218
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: See, find out and then start methadone clinic next week, you find out next day after you find out you're pregnant. How quickly did you get on a methadone protocol. Once you found out you were pregnant.

219
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.040
Kelli Ottnat: I think it was pretty much immediately.

220
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Alright, so we've got

221
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.890

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened after he was born with garden substance use.

224
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:10.890
And

225
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:17.160
Kelli Ottnat: Everything was was lovely picture perfect

226
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.540
Kelli Ottnat: I was still taking methadone. Okay.

227
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:30.600
Kelli Ottnat: And he did have some Jude had some complications from the pregnancy.

228
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.870
Kelli Ottnat: Because of the Methadone

229
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What were they

230
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.460
Kelli Ottnat: What he was he was a good, good.

231
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so he was chemically born chemically dependent

232
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else about the delivery itself, was it affected.

233
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.550
Kelli Ottnat: He wouldn't eat when he was born.

234
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, did you try to breastfeed him. How did that impact that not eating piece.

235
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:01.800
Kelli Ottnat: Well, we

236
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.730
Kelli Ottnat: Ended up having to have a feeding tube.

237
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: He was he born prematurely.

238
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.790
Kelli Ottnat: No, he was born on time. Okay.

239
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Check in with your body. Let's do a little check in. I want to see how how you're doing around this conversation. See, see what's happening just kind of

240
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.480
Kelli Ottnat: My chest feels a little heavy and okay

241
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.710
Honey,

242
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.900
Kelli Ottnat: My breasts are a lot shorter and slower.

243
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Short

244
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you take a minute and tune into your faith. We do that together, maybe, together with the breath, but down into the belly.

245
00:24:50.670 --> 00:25:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure right open up that chest a little bit, get that breath down into the lower belly. On an inhale and on your own just sort of bring in your face in whatever way feels right for you.

246
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice for me, my shoulders drop down, I noticed I started to relax a little bit. How about you, how, how is this journey into shift how your chest and the depth of your breath. How's that starting to change.

247
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.170
Kelli Ottnat: I can, I can relax a little bit

248
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.340
Kelli Ottnat: But I wish.

249
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.650
Kelli Ottnat: I mean the whole the whole deal with Jude being born.

250
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:54.810
Kelli Ottnat: on methadone was

251
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:59.670

252
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. So Kelly. Are you feeling the toughness of it are you actually remembering that and feeling the toughness of it just now what that was.

253
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.920
Kelli Ottnat: I don't know what I was thinking.

254
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what are you thinking now, we can only we can only be aware of what's going on. Now tell me what your thoughts are now tell me how your actions, your belief in your face or on the same page. Tell me about who you are right now.

255
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.110
Kelli Ottnat: I do feel awful for

256
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.650
Kelli Ottnat: For not being able to get clean

257
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.210
Kelli Ottnat: And

258
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.800
Kelli Ottnat: When I got pregnant with Jude.

259
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.740
Kelli Ottnat: His Dad was so strong. Through it all, though.

260
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.540
Kelli Ottnat: Was really my my support.

261
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And he went to jail.

262
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.330
Kelli Ottnat: Right. He went to jail.

263
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:33.930
Kelli Ottnat: Well, for

264
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.690
Kelli Ottnat: For a year and a half.

265
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.180
Kelli Ottnat: We, we had bought a place and

266
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:49.500
Kelli Ottnat: And we were there for about a year and a half me Jude and Jude Stan Sterling.

267
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.110
Kelli Ottnat: And lunch. Once

268
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.580
Kelli Ottnat: Was pretty good.

269
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.080
Kelli Ottnat: I mean, there wasn't any math use

270
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.660
Kelli Ottnat: And Jude was happy I was pretty happy.

271
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.660
Kelli Ottnat: starling was pretty happy.

272
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You were still on the Methadone

273
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit with that a little bit longer.

274
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel awful for not getting clean

275
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: For during the pregnancy. I kind of right that that was true. And notice how I was pretty happy started with. It was picture perfect, but when we sat with it a little longer. Was it picture perfect

276
00:28:48.330 --> 00:29:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: No, thank you, then you remember the complications, then these other pieces started coming forward to the more you sit with it in here with me. We get little bits start coming forward a little bit more, a little bit more. And you're sitting with

277
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The toughness of that history.

278
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

279
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing the work. That's what it is. It's sitting with, who am I with those memories.

280
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Meeting them.

281
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: welcoming them in all the same. You're not in this alone on right here. You also have your faith. You have the group, we have Scott, you have whatever else that I don't know about.

282
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe in you. It doesn't mean we have to feel all of them all at once. Well we starting to write a timeline to start to get clear to see which ones you may be not paying attention to.

283
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that might get in the way of the future for you doing this. I remember he said, I feel awful for not getting clean

284
00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we look at the past understand it feel better around it so that when you really get in your solid and I know you already are in your determination to get Jude back

285
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A. What if you also are in your determination to get clean

286
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: completely clean. What if you were ready.

287
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get him back and you're not on anything. What are your thoughts, way up there. I don't know when. But what if that's something you want to do. I don't know. Is it something you want to do.

288
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:36.390
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, that's kind of my whole purpose. That's my only purpose.

289
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It. This is a handy little it's gonna be a little light hearted, but kind of catchy.

290
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Pills.

291
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Or needles. It's just doesn't rhyme with needles. So pills.

292
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't teach skills okay oversimplify but let's look at it.

293
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was only the methadone, then everything would be hunky dory. It would be the magic and we would all be fine. And we would all live a happy life.

294
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: We need this part, the stuff you're doing right now where you're looking at tough emotions in history.

295
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're centering you're breathing. You're praying, right. This is a skill. I don't know how much you had it available to you and your when you were a younger mom.

296
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You need the skills I think maybe didn't have them maybe as far back as when you decided the solution was pills at 16 or maybe there was a whole lot of marijuana use to, I don't know, but that was a solution to an identified problem.

297
00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm curious about what the problem was. And if you face it again. Will you solve it.

298
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: With self acceptance self love

299
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: With meditation with exercise with nutrition or will you reach for another substance to escape.

300
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm curious to see if incrementally, you can start to understand what the original problems were that you were trying to solve it with substances.

301
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.080
Kelli Ottnat: And

302
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.040
Kelli Ottnat: I think most of, I mean, I really don't like putting this on.

303
00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.940
Kelli Ottnat: On my childhood or

304
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.830
Kelli Ottnat: On any one of my parents because I know that they tried, and I know that

305
00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't tell them, Kelly and

306
00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Indulge

307
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.180
Kelli Ottnat: My mom.

308
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:09.750
Kelli Ottnat: She had it pretty tough. She had a lot of siblings and her dad was

309
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.910
Kelli Ottnat: Pretty tough on her really tough on her.

310
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.070
Kelli Ottnat: So I guess, you know, that's all. The only way she knew to be

311
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Kelly.

312
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You spent that minute making an excuse for how she hurts you instead of telling me how she hurt you. You know that

313
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: My we're right here. God already knows what happened, it's not for you to forgive or not forgive. That's God's business.

314
00:33:48.960 --> 00:34:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Such as your therapist. This is the medicine be with another human being right here and a pet. Absolutely. Let him love you. Yeah, they know okay indulge in the social medicine, the healing of letting another human hold that pain.

315
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:12.630
Kelli Ottnat: I guess.

316
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.600
Kelli Ottnat: I have a hard time getting over is

317
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.500
Kelli Ottnat: Like public humiliation.

318
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry.

319
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Read through it. You're just touching it, pulling it up into your memory.

320
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's so it's so embarrassing and humiliating.

321
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't even know what it is but humiliation is a universal experience.

322
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Awful.

323
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, Kelly. I'm so sorry that happened.

324
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we can love people. And we can even forgive them.

325
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Still have really wanted us those two things. You don't have to but out the other that love if you do have an unconditional piece for your mom and compassionate about her. Her wounding lets your animal take care of you, he's loving and he feels it. Okay. Yeah.

326
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be both we we can do both. Okay, we can have deep resentment and even anger and nine not saying today, you're ready to have that anger.

327
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe down the line might meet see me saying let's let's hear a little bit about that because we can love the person we can see past

328
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know your mother's difficult childhood or we can rash, we'd see past all the rationalization about how she humiliated you and we can also be very sad and angry.

329
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't exclude each other, you're not going to have to stop forgiving. Mom, you're not going to have to stop accepting

330
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And loving. Okay, we won't have to do that. Not the kind of work I'm doing. It's not going to be an either or thing, unless it's what you want. If you want that, then that's your, your journey, but I'm not going to be saying, well, let's hate her. She's the bad guy. I won't be doing that. Okay.

331
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just

332
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Humiliation is just next level suffering and I don't know what it was, but

333
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: They really stick

334
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: A humiliation that you're remembering

335
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it like one time or just over and over throughout

336
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A time

337
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.190
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, it was.

338
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.100
Kelli Ottnat: It was more than just a couple of times.

339
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:36.330
Kelli Ottnat: I guess she just

340
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:41.640
Kelli Ottnat: She

341
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

342
00:37:51.480 --> 00:38:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you sit with how the humiliation was for you. I'll hold all the justification here all folded over here and I'll say

343
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom did the best she could, she had a tough upbringing and if she knew any better. She's done better. She couldn't. I'll hold all that justification.

344
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to give you room to be pissed off to be said entitled, you could be whatever you want. I still hold that part of she's got her story to generation after generation failing.

345
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Their child and then their child and in their child and you didn't quite get what you needed from them.

346
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:51.570
It's pretty

347
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.410
Kelli Ottnat: Mean when when something like that happened.

348
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You look so hurt and

349
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

350
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's both.

351
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's both.

352
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not happening right now. You are loved have love that humiliation isn't happening now.

353
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But it can feel like that when we bring it up into our mind.

354
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to name it. Do you want to hear another person, hear the story they it when something like that happens to want to see my reaction to it.

355
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.070
Kelli Ottnat: I guess I'm just kind of stuck in the moment right now.

356
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:07.980
Kelli Ottnat: Trying to figure out

357
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So it isn't happening now.

358
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Look around your room.

359
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see shadows, I can see shapes. I see colors I see angles. Right. I can have. It's not, I'm not in danger now.

360
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The power of the mind and the perception of danger can feel very real and the science. I can tell you, really easy doesn't have the right timestamp and it can feel like that trauma that repeated trauma that humiliation can feel like it's happening now.

361
00:40:52.350 --> 00:41:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm not surprised that what that aspect, the sad stuff you can feel like you're in the moment, as if time just stood still and it was half that intensity. I get that.

362
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean it's going to be like that forever. I already have been witness to people that do things like whether it is exposure therapy and you're doing it right now because you're thinking about it even a little bit you're changing the memory.

363
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And later on if you want to do some of these other techniques that we can do. You're literally changing the relationship with that memory and slowly but surely it will be set back in time and it won't feel like it's relived

364
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I have faith in that I do believe in this work.

365
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what would happen if I heard one small piece of it. That was pretty bad.

366
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the worst thing I could do to support your mom's perspective. Would that be the worst.

367
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Would I do that or

368
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Would it be to only feel sorry for you to see was helpless. Would I do that.

369
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, somewhere.

370
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.980
Kelli Ottnat: pretty neutral.

371
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible that you think

372
00:42:45.510 --> 00:43:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something shameful, as if to say that humiliation was effective in making you feel ashamed, as if there's something wrong with you. Is that what it is. Are you thinking there's something wrong with you now.

373
00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.750
Kelli Ottnat: No, but it's just

374
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:06.840
Kelli Ottnat: It's hard to

375
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.870
Kelli Ottnat: even talk about

376
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.640
Kelli Ottnat: One example was

377
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.620
Kelli Ottnat: I was playing in the front yard and it

378
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.650
Kelli Ottnat: Was probably five or six

379
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.320
Kelli Ottnat: And

380
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Look around your room, sweet pea. It's not happening right now baby cakes look

381
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not happening. Now, look at me. I wasn't there at age five, look around taken both exist at the same time that memory feels awful, but it is not happening now, look around, look at your animal. Look at the shapes and colors.

382
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And remember that love you have for Jude.

383
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember the faith, you have

384
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: In God

385
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And that event, although it feels as if it's happening right now is not. That's how powerful the mind is

386
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

387
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you did it, you touched it in touch, gently and he came back.

388
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So there is that history and you came back.

389
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Try it again.

390
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: One memory h5

391
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: See it but checking and see if you actually still want to tell the stories you're a part of you that wants to tell it. Another part of you that doesn't. And it's like this oscillation between wanting to say and not wanting to say it.

392
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.290
Kelli Ottnat: Will it help me heal by saying it.

393
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to, but there's something about your lack of telling stories that makes me wonder

394
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was interpersonal if it really was your mom humiliating you,

395
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be that the inner personal space between you and I, there might be some healing.

396
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't mean that you have to tell every single story. Not if we do this CMDR work or other techniques that we can do. You won't have to tell all the dark stories all the ugliness. People have to. Okay.

397
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But because I have so few. It's almost like I'm still doing an assessment. I know so little.

398
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see what I'm saying, can I have that one little one just to see what you're talking about. And watch you because I hadn't been able to do this before I hadn't been able to see you meet it in your memory and see what happens to you, you get very sad. It looks like.

399
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to do. I think it will heal.

400
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not God. What do you think, do you think saying it to me, will help in some way, our work together.

401
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: perfectly okay well do as much as you're comfortable and you can just, you know, because you just right. I haven't pulled you back. I said, Wait, look around, right. Yep, I interrupted you.

402
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can stop anytime you want to. You can we got as far as well. There's one example on stage five. And then you felt the feeling you don't actually have to feel the feeling of it.

403
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

404
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: See it from a distance. Looks like I'm about age five. I'm on a swing my mom does this and then I hit in this corner or I cry or I bled or I broke or whatever. I don't know what this thing is story is, but as if a detached sort of observer.

405
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You could. I don't know.

406
00:46:59.370 --> 00:46:59.550
How

407
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.790
Kelli Ottnat: To say it.

408
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.510
Kelli Ottnat: I was playing in the yard with

409
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.270
Kelli Ottnat: Probably my siblings or

410
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.840
Kelli Ottnat: Couple of friends is a few kids.

411
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:14.550
And

412
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.120
Kelli Ottnat: My mom was in the driveway.

413
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing maybe

414
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: She knew better. She did done better. Okay. You are not your skin, you're not that humiliation. You are far more than that. Not just that event.

415
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. Okay.

416
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.180
Kelli Ottnat: She should stop you, the yard.

417
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.530
Kelli Ottnat: She called me over.

418
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:08.160
Kelli Ottnat: To her the driveway. There was it I guess what our friends in a car, she was talking to

419
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, honey.

420
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.610
Kelli Ottnat: She told me to lift up my shirt.

421
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: pushy pointing out like you're developing body or something about that.

422
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.380
Kelli Ottnat: I was. I wasn't joking. It's

423
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Unacceptable.

424
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Unacceptable. Oh, honey.

425
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

426
00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, honey.

427
00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so sorry. She didn't that thought was not nice. She wasn't thinking about your feelings.

428
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.970
Kelli Ottnat: She pointed out that very

429
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:12.120
Kelli Ottnat: Oh,

430
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh sweetheart.

431
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.160
Kelli Ottnat: I don't even like this issue.

432
00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:17.670
Kelli Ottnat: Oh,

433
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I know but baby your body. This is our body. We only have one. And somehow, and I don't know what this piece is, but if he has anything to do with our one body were given. And we can't miss love it totally and completely

434
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to get in the way.

435
00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.120
Kelli Ottnat: Las Vegas.

436
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You did a brave thing.

437
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You scurried back a little. There's something about that whatever part of the body. It has extra meaning for you and you don't like that you have an issue with it and I hurt you.

438
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But you did some good work. You decide.

439
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I want to just say it so that I can remove the shame.

440
00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I can remove that there's anything wrong. There's no need for a secret. Not anymore.

441
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just check in with yourself.

442
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.550
Kelli Ottnat: The thing about it is I was

443
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.030
Kelli Ottnat: I guess I was in Caitlyn, you know, I was having fun in the yard.

444
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:04.110
Kelli Ottnat: For her to pull me away. Tell me to lift up my shirt for her friend.

445
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.740
Kelli Ottnat: So that you know she couldn't

446
00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.700
Kelli Ottnat: Just couldn't bear. I don't know. It was really

447
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you did some analysis, you went into her intention. If I said something. Could you correct me and say, no, that wasn't it. Would that be useful.

448
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if if my mom pulled me over and I was

449
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Free and in play, which means not preoccupied with Worry not, I was just in my groove.

450
00:51:47.160 --> 00:52:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And abruptly just pulled from that simple play into humiliation and not only humiliation, but right where my belly meets my pubis as if like right where my personal my vagina, like right in there like my baby little self like right in there. It's like, now what

451
00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there's something wrong. Okay. So I did that story. I made that up.

452
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you see if there's something you want to say.

453
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, or could even even a bit about the vagina. I don't know, but check and see if you have extra shame layer around this piece unsaid.

454
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:47.010
Kelli Ottnat: She says, I mean pointed out.

455
00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.660
Kelli Ottnat: I took it. I took it as she was making fun of me.

456
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:07.680
Kelli Ottnat: She pointed out that my, my parents weren't over my good

457
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

458
00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful little body. Oh man, I love that about babies.

459
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

460
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, keep breathing, honey. You're feel your pet see him right there with you see he's

461
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Smiling

462
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see you looking right at you.

463
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: too sweet just rights week, yeah.

464
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That was

465
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being like ripped from

466
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's okay to relax and be safe, just like rocket ship blasted into this other reality. Like, it's no longer okay to just be spontaneous and in play, you'll get ripped from it and pulled into this other part.

467
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what that looks like out here.

468
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You were lost in play. You were just being a kid and kids, don't worry. And that's what's so cool. Is there just that's what play is we're lost in our group for in a flow, even as adults we even have, you know, I have forgot about time and I just kind of got into like dancing.

469
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Like dance. You know, you get lost in it.

470
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Ripped you out of that.

471
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How can a person who's supposed to protect you humiliate you those two things I'll look you've got double let him love you let them clean up your little tear face. How cute is the hat.

472
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Cute.

473
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I want to process a little bit with you.

474
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: work you did and you did work awfully hard

475
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: walk it through and maybe be an observer of yourself and just sort of touch on what you notice was important for you about today.

476
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:52.920
Kelli Ottnat: I feel like

477
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.270
Kelli Ottnat: Identifying sitting with the feeling

478
00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.290
Uh huh.

479
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.990
Kelli Ottnat: And identifying

480
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:04.680
Kelli Ottnat: Because I hadn't even really thought

481
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.180
Kelli Ottnat: Too much about about it since it's happened and

482
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:16.170
Kelli Ottnat: Just identifying how I felt. Before, and after.

483
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.400
Kelli Ottnat: The situation and

484
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.570
Kelli Ottnat: Maybe I'll be able to process.

485
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're good.

486
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So you haven't visited that memory very often that you're aware of. Right.

487
00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

488
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And look how how we started.

489
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that all I asked you to do was

490
00:56:51.480 --> 00:57:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's not glide across the surface and be uncertain of our timeline. Let's look at time

491
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you said, I don't want to think negatively of my

492
00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Family and my childhood.

493
00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: She did give yourself permission to do it.

494
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you felt it.

495
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's that I don't want to villainize maybe I don't want, I don't want to think of my family like

496
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That cuts you off from processing. It's not either or.

497
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good. I'm not bad.

498
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just one

499
00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes I'm in a good mood. Sometimes I'm tired. Sometimes I'm irritable or frustrated and I imagine you have those experiences to

500
00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: neat thing about what you have, because you have this strong faith. You don't have to be judging jury, you get to feel your feelings. Someone else is going to judge

501
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom's behavior, not you. You get to sit here and you can tell a professional what that did to shape your life and you can heal and know you don't have to keep telling me these stories. If you don't want to

502
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you do, I want to hear them.

503
00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you want to hear another human being, say, that's an acceptable.

504
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom still forgivable but that action unacceptable.

505
00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm so sorry. It happened then tell as many or as little stories as you want.

506
00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a little bit about how you're feeling right now as we end this session. Tell me about your breath. Look, still kind of up high, still feels like shoulders up

507
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it feel like that maybe allow gravity to pull those babies down

508
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:05.100
Right.

509
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:15.240
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, I'll probably process for the next half hour hour just kind of breathe and hang out here with

510
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.370
Kelli Ottnat: The dogs step.

511
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Prayer animals. Notice when the way if a wave comes, go for it. If you want to grieve.

512
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Because maybe grief is what's done done grief have the freedom to be an unconcerned kid that may have ended.

513
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what it is. And that's why telling me a specific story was important because I didn't know what we were grieving. I didn't even know grief was the thing I didn't know because you were busy protecting an image that you have, if your parents.

514
00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: See, we could

515
00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was a little uncertain will is that, is it going to heal. I don't know. We had to find ourselves.

516
01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it is, sometimes naming it exactly what it is. No dance around it. No excuses no justification, we say this was said this was done and then it's out there and shame disappears. Well not immediately, but it can enlightens it secrets out. This is what happened.

517
01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's meet again.

518
01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:26.970
Okay.

519
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.000
Kelli Ottnat: Do you want to text me with a time i'm i'm open if you need to go.

520
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To I wanna

521
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to schedule it

522
01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And want to really commit to something here. I'm trying to look start takes off.

523
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: By when

524
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.750
Kelli Ottnat: Usually for like nine or 10 he's

525
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And which group you're coming to my Friday with Dr. Solomon.

526
01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:05.850
Kelli Ottnat: Okay.

527
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if we can make a little flip flop, just for next week or permanently is still be with Dr. Solomon, though, if you like working with him. It could be nine o'clock on Monday and 10 O'clock individual therapy at 10 on

528
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: April 17

529
01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So it'd be group April 13 9am same doctor

530
01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then individual therapy would be April 17 at 10am

531
01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:45.390
Right.

532
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I had

533
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so you know, just to come completely full circle. I had penciled in something with a three o'clock thing on April 9 if you see that floating around just erase it.

534
01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just me having forgotten for a second about the 10am thing. So just if you run across it. Don't panic. That's not an appointment.

535
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, all right, all right, my dear. You are one brave lady.

536
01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.970
Kelli Ottnat: You are so great.

537
01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:15.960

Kelli Ottnat: Really you so much.

540
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I feel honored to have heard that piece, truly I do because I, I know that doesn't get shared very often. So, or ever

541
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll, I'll keep it in my sacred little spot. Okay.

542
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, my dear, you. Take care. I'll see you soon.

543
