00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.900
Vernon Ortega: Divorced

158
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:34.920
Vernon Ortega: When we were for

159
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.530
Vernon Ortega: 15 years, I believe.

160
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:54.240
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And the reason I'm asking these questions is just to help with supporting your sobriety and all of this. Are you with anybody at this point or do mainly. My question is, is there a significant other, that's using also. That's my concern.

161
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.610
Vernon Ortega: No, no, I live alone.

162
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.790
Vernon Ortega: I'm not seeing anybody at the present time.

163
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:10.950
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. All right. And you'd mentioned the kids and then grandkids are they around at your place a lot or how does that work out.

164
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:18.210
Vernon Ortega: No, I usually go see them and I sprinkle they live over there. So I when I can.

165
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.680
Chris Alliman MD: Fair enough.

166
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:29.670
Chris Alliman MD: Fair enough. The reason I asked, like I'm going to end up getting you a prescription today for. It's a box, and we're going to get that taken care of. But the reason I asked about the kids.

167
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:45.810
Chris Alliman MD: Is because with Suboxone the residue that gets on your fingers. The residue around the mouth, three of them. Now the residue that's on the packaging is enough to kill little kids. Basically they lick it, and they overdose. They stop breathing. Oh.

168
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:53.520
Vernon Ortega: Wow, okay. Oh, I keep everything away from even Mike it and there are you

169

263
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.300
Chris Alliman MD: And that's a different back injury from what we were talking about, or is that the same back injury.

264
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.830
Vernon Ortega: That's the same back end.

265
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.380
Chris Alliman MD: Ready. Yes. Okay. Yes.

266
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.090
Vernon Ortega: Okay, what is the one

267
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.730
Chris Alliman MD: How's that back doing for you at this point.

268
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.550

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.740
Vernon Ortega: Knock on wood I stealing.

270
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.080

Chris Alliman MD: Good.

276
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.940
Vernon Ortega: That helped a little bit

277
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:11.340
Chris Alliman MD: Good Suboxone is known to help out with pain. Also, so you might find that it will, it gives you some relief to

278
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.290
Vernon Ortega: I hope so.

279
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:20.790
Vernon Ortega: Yeah, that's kind of why I was kind of shooting for the Methadone because I know that really helps me for my pain.

280
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.230
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, but

281
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.180
Vernon Ortega: I'm not gonna

282
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.660
Vernon Ortega: I don't want to wait for that anymore. I've been waiting for a couple of months and just tired.

283
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:43.770
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, right here. We also with bright heart health. We also have a doctor that does chronic pain management. Now she doesn't use pills or medications, but it's more through awareness.

284
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:57.270
Chris Alliman MD: And just general lifestyle to help deal with the pain and she has some phenomenal success with it. So as we get stable and the sun. So maybe that's something we can also look at for here.

285
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.220
Vernon Ortega: I would be good. Yeah.

286
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.150
Chris Alliman MD: Be a good option.

287
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:01.650
Chris Alliman MD: Right.

288
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.000
Chris Alliman MD: So Vernon, I still have a whole bunch of questions to ask you. But

289
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:13.470
Chris Alliman MD: What do you know about our organization so far. And what we required what we do with you.

290
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:22.950
Vernon Ortega: This is the first time I hear a bunch of guys first time I talk to you guys, so not very much. I mean,

291
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.260
Vernon Ortega: I know, walking rams and

292
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.760
Vernon Ortega: How they function and

293
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.880
Vernon Ortega: I would assume you guys got a lot of similarities

294
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:42.540
Chris Alliman MD: Very good. So what we do is we everything happens over the the video chat through through zoom through this video platform.

295
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.600
Chris Alliman MD: And there are two meetings a week.

296
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:55.830
Chris Alliman MD: One is the group meeting with me therapist and other people that are on Suboxone and we'll talk about when that will be for you. We'll get to that at the end.

297
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:05.640
Chris Alliman MD: And then the second meeting a week is just with you and the therapist. It's an individual session with the therapist each of those meetings are an hour long

298
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:15.810
Chris Alliman MD: And generally, what I do is I give you I send in a prescription at group. Time to get you to your therapy appointment. And then when you attend the therapy appointment.

299
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:21.930
Chris Alliman MD: I send another prescription and to get you back to your group time. So there are two prescriptions, a week.

300
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:31.320
Chris Alliman MD: And that's generally for about the first month, the idea is to help you get buy in going to the physical going to the behavioral health to the therapy sessions.

301
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:41.370
Chris Alliman MD: Because we know Suboxone helps with those physical cravings. Right. But the therapy helps with all that mental stuff that's going on that needs to be dealt with also

302
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.580
Vernon Ortega: The depression and all that stuff.

303
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.240
Chris Alliman MD: Makes sense.

304
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.290
Yes, sir.

305
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.330
Definitely

306
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.500
Chris Alliman MD: It all plays into it. Absolutely.

307
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.820
Chris Alliman MD: All right, I'm going to run through the next set of questions here. Okay.

308
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.380
Vernon Ortega: Okay.

309
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.600
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so these are some yes or no.

310
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.230
Yes.

311
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.220

464
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:44.940
Vernon Ortega: Okay.

465
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.160
Chris Alliman MD: Right. So Monday. Well done. One

466
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.040
Chris Alliman MD: So the therapist in that group. Her name is serene.

467
00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.590
Chris Alliman MD: And she'll be in touch with you about making a therapy.

468
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.130
Appointment

469
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:17.520
Chris Alliman MD: Probably sometime this week, I would imagine. We'll be in touch with you. She's also the therapist that then helps to run our groups on Monday. I'll be there. She'll be there. The first

470
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:27.660
Chris Alliman MD: First part of the group is where I check in with you to see how you're doing with the medication that you're checking at taking if there's any side effects.

471
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:40.560
Chris Alliman MD: And when your next therapy appointment is we see how you're doing. And, and I do that with each other. The patients that are there, and then Serena takes over and does a group therapy session for the second half.

472
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:48.300
Chris Alliman MD: During that second half. I'm then send I send in your prescription during the second half, while she's doing her thing.

473
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:55.140
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Okay, good. So right now I think

474
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:06.120
Chris Alliman MD: You're the fourth person in that group. And I actually need six people in there to get to TO HAVE SERENA part of the group.

475
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:13.680
Chris Alliman MD: Six people in the group ensures that three people show up and then we can actually have the group so

476
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:27.630
Chris Alliman MD: I still I still have people come into the group, because I do that medical check in part, make sure you're doing okay with the medication. We just don't have the therapy, part two we get enough people and then we start getting that going

477
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:39.960
Chris Alliman MD: Ok, ok. Now, the way you get into the group is that you call to the virtual clinic to do your check in. Initially, okay.

478
00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:40.710
Vernon Ortega: On Monday.

479
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.750
Chris Alliman MD: What's that

480
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.000
Vernon Ortega: On Monday, or tomorrow.

481
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.310
Chris Alliman MD: On Monday, okay.

482
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:58.080
Chris Alliman MD: And you need to call in at least 30 minutes before our group. So that means calling in by 1130 or maybe even 11 o'clock. Okay, calling

483
00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.470
Chris Alliman MD: A call the virtual clinic is like going to the doctor's office.

484
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:12.510
Chris Alliman MD: Or calling the doctor's office. There's always aligned and there's always paperwork. Right, so don't call five minutes beforehand, expecting that you're going to get in the group.

485
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.950
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

486
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:16.560
Vernon Ortega: I'll probably do it first thing on

487
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.140
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. And that works good. You can actually do it up to six hours before group happens

488
00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.600
Chris Alliman MD: Perfect. Okay.

489
00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:37.680
Chris Alliman MD: The what they'll do is go through your paperwork, make sure everything's taken care of. And then if you've called in really early. They're not going to hold you on the phone, the whole time.

490
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:48.270
Chris Alliman MD: What they'll do is have you get off and then once I give them the new zoom room number, they'll email it to you, so you'll be able to get on to the zoom room.

491
00:33:49.500 --> 00:34:01.350
Chris Alliman MD: No, the zoom the zoom room number changes every meeting. It's never the same. That helps us make sure that you go do your paperwork to get the zoom room number before you come in and see us so

492
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.250
Vernon Ortega: Kind of intro

493
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.290
Chris Alliman MD: A little bit that way. Okay.

494
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:17.580
Chris Alliman MD: Good. There are a couple rules that we have for group one is no substance use, right, and that includes alcohol, and that includes tobacco tobacco can be a trigger for other folks.

495
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:29.370
Chris Alliman MD: We do ask that you be in a good quiet place with nobody else around because nobody wants other folks hearing their stories and their issues right want to keep this confidential.

496
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.570
Chris Alliman MD: We do also ask

497
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.100
Chris Alliman MD: What

498
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:44.670
Chris Alliman MD: Oh good lighting be on time. Be respectful, all that kind of good stuff. So just

499
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.840
Vernon Ortega: The common sense stuff.

500
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:50.160
Chris Alliman MD: It's really just the common sense stuff. Absolutely. Absolutely.

501
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:58.890
Chris Alliman MD: Good. So the next thing we need to do is talk about the Suboxone itself. Okay, so

502
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:12.840
Chris Alliman MD: With Suboxone if you take Suboxone too early too close to when you've last used heroin Suboxone can kick you into those really bad withdrawals.

503
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:15.720
Vernon Ortega: I know

504
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.640
Vernon Ortega: Okay, okay, that

505
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:30.360
Chris Alliman MD: You know, so we want to wait until you're in moderate withdrawals, not to when you're just feeling the beginnings of withdrawals, not when your way in the bad part right but kind of in the middle.

506
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.250
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

507
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:49.350
Chris Alliman MD: Now, what we understand through sciences that usually takes about three out of three days or 72 hours to get to moderate withdrawals. Now for different people. That's different. That's just an average. How long would it take you to get to moderate withdrawals. Do you think

508
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.780
Vernon Ortega: I think about 12 hours or so.

509
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.220
Vernon Ortega: 12 hours.

510
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:57.630
Vernon Ortega: Yeah.

511
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:11.310
Chris Alliman MD: Fair enough. Now I just want you to be careful with that. Right. Because again, we don't want to kick you into the bad withdrawals, but you'll be the gate, the judge, you'll be the one to gauge when it's time to start taking the medication.

512
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.470
Chris Alliman MD: OK. OK.

513
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:29.250
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm going to send these. Okay, so my next step here is I'm going to give you the instructions as to how to take the Suboxone for the first four days. And I'm going to email these instructions to you. Also, so you don't have to memorize them. Okay.

514
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:45.930
Chris Alliman MD: Now the these instructions that I give you are going to be very simplified when I send them to the pharmacy because they can't fit all these words on the on the packaging. So it's going to be very simplified so just follow the email instructions that I send you. Okay.

515
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:56.760
Chris Alliman MD: Alright. So the way it works is on the first day after, when you're in mud withdrawals, you're going to take one Suboxone film.

516
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.910
Chris Alliman MD: And then you're going to wait and two to four hours later, you can take half a film.

517
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:13.110
Chris Alliman MD: And then if you need to. And then two to four hours after that you can take another half of film, if you need to. If you don't need to don't take them.

518
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:33.600
Chris Alliman MD: But they're there in KC, okay. On day two, you're going to start the day with whatever you took for day one. So if you only took one film total day one. That's what you start with, they do. But if you ended up taking twofold two films, day one. That's what you start with on day two.

519
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.280
Okay.

520
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:45.210
Chris Alliman MD: And then two to four hours later, you can take another half film and two to four hours after that you can take another half of film.

521
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:46.770
Okay.

522
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:54.630
Chris Alliman MD: Day three, you're going to take your total from day to but there's no extra half films during the day.

523
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.130
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

524
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.530
Vernon Ortega: And that I take red one.

525
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:08.430
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, but you can spread it out during the day. If you choose to. That's okay. The general recommendation is actually that you take them all at one time. First thing in the morning.

526
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:22.500
Chris Alliman MD: And get the medication at that appropriate level, but many people do split it up. And usually if one is also using Suboxone to help out with pain, they're splitting it up dosing during the day.

527
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.480
Vernon Ortega: I'd probably been split it up a little bit, at least.

528
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.260
Vernon Ortega: Yeah yeah

529
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.760
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, I think that's fine. I'll leave that in your hands, and you can be the judge of that.

530
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.400
Chris Alliman MD: Day for

531
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:43.680
Chris Alliman MD: It drops down from three down to two films a day. And that's where you're at, at that point. Okay.

532
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.310
Chris Alliman MD: There's no extra half films during the day.

533
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:57.270
Chris Alliman MD: And then we'll be able to check in and kind of see what's happening where you're at, with things if that dose is working for you. What we need to do.

534
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.510
Vernon Ortega: Okay. Sounds good.

535
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:09.600
Chris Alliman MD: Good, good. Let me check something here. I need to make sure that I've got the correct pharmacy for you here in our computer system.

536
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:33.090
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so I have Walgreens on Riverside Drive.

537
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.160
Vernon Ortega: Yes, sir.

538
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:46.170
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent. Sounds good. So it's pretty slick. I can get to send this in just through the computer. There is no physical prescription that goes to you. It just goes to your computer directly to the pharmacy so

539
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.460
Vernon Ortega: works out pretty well.

540
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:55.320
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm going to get that sent in here pretty soon after we get off the phone. I'm going to send you two emails.

541
00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:08.880
Chris Alliman MD: One with the instructions around group some information about constipation I name and then also the purpose name and then also checking into instructions checking into the virtual clerk.

542
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:17.610
Chris Alliman MD: And then I can do a second email that has those Suboxone instructions that I that we talked about. So you'll have those

543
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.120
Chris Alliman MD: All right, Vernon what what questions do you have a lot of information.

544
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.030
Vernon Ortega: You're pretty clear on everything.

545
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:38.430
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, man. That sounds good. I would encourage you, with your phone set reminders, put it on the calendar that you've got group on Monday, and you need to check in Monday at 12 noon.

546
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:39.150
Many

547
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:45.300
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Many people forget. So put those reminders in because that's when you get your medication.

548
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.180
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, for

549
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:59.220

550
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:06.360
Chris Alliman MD: It will be films twice a day, and it will be enough to get you back through our group time. Okay.
