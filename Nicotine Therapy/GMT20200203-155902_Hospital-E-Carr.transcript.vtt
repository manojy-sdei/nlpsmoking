00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:19.770
Brittney Carr: And so I have five kids five kids. Whoa. I have four kids, and I only have custody of one of them right now. Okay.

39
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.560
Brittney Carr: I my oldest is what his dad and the other two are in foster care.

40
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:33.720
Brittney Carr: Okay, one of them. I had given up for adoption and other one I am actually trying to get her back to see it.

41
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.470
Brittney Carr: But they made her they made it like we difficult for me.

42
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.410
Brittney Carr: I actually in order to get her back. I actually went to rehab. When I found out I was pregnant with my youngest son.

43
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:59.010
Brittney Carr: I went to rehab. I stayed there for eight months. Um, I did really good. I stayed clean for a year after that out of rehab and I was on Suboxone the whole time.

44
00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.910
Okay.

45
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.800
Brittney Carr: I was on 24 milligrams a day and don't seem to work for me also.

46
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:24.840
Brittney Carr: The thing is, I, I got really overwhelmed because I was working a nine to five job every day and see why he had me jumping through all these hoops, which I was already halfway through the treatment plan, but the foster parents filed a motion to intervene, which

47
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.490
Brittney Carr: They were doing things illegally like hiring private investigators

48
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:39.060
Brittney Carr: Just not supporting the transition plan at all like they went on Mother's Day. They're supposed to bring her to see me and see if he specifically told her told them to

49
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:52.890
Brittney Carr: And after they had missed two scheduled visits in a row on purpose because they said they had stuff to do, which had nothing to do with my daughter. I don't know why they had to bring her along but anyways on Mother's Day like

50
00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:05.610
Brittney Carr: I just I gave, I don't know, I just got so excited because God told them to like bring her to see me and they told her, and know that they need to talk to her supervisor, because

51
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:15.000
Brittney Carr: Yeah, it's just in any way she was supposed to be at my house, half the time by then we were three months into the actual transition plan.

52
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.920
Brittney Carr: For her going back home and she is. I was barely seeing her three hours a week that we're supposed to be that we're supposed to be scheduled visit

53
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:36.060
Brittney Carr: But they weren't even bringing her those three hours a week, so they were fighting every way on it. Like they wanted my daughter and she kept writing me letters like saying if I don't want my daughter, I could just give them. I could just give her up and

54
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:47.790
Brittney Carr: Like nobody would hate me for it. Just like all kinds of stuff like these foster parents like I've done nothing to fight me the whole time. And they're not supposed to be not their boss, your parents for a reason.

55
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:56.940
Brittney Carr: And so anyways I'm looking to I'm trying to get back into it I relapsed actually and in June.

56
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.190
Brittney Carr: Okay 19

57
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.660
Brittney Carr: Okay, so I really, I just want to get back on my feet. I know I have an 18 month old that

58
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:18.330
Brittney Carr: I have to take care of. And it's just getting too hard. Again, I don't want to go that far. Again, you know, I don't want it to go where it needs to be. I don't want to get me. I don't want to lose my son.

59
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.840
Brittney Carr: And I went to $68,000 in a matter of three months.

60
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:34.380
Brittney Carr: Wow from June hill to like the end of September was done at the money and just

61
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.410
Brittney Carr: I, I just can't do anything. I need to get

62
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.370
Brittney Carr: This so

63
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.980
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Yes.

64
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.780
Brittney Carr: A little bit of background noise.

65
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:54.900
Joan Kandel: Yeah, thank you for that. I appreciate that. So after you. So you were on Suboxone for sounds like about a year and eight months.

66
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.280
Joan Kandel: Eight months while you were in rehab and then a year afterwards.

67
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.670
Joan Kandel: Correct. And why did you get off the Suboxone

68
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:18.570
Brittney Carr: Because I relapsed I just gave up. I got so stressed out with all the things that my not only my housing people had me doing but my Co. I feel like I lost my job because they wouldn't compromise the

69
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:32.970
Brittney Carr: After a year and a half of jumping through the hoops, they were making me do this class like three times a week. And it was just like ridiculous already and why I lost my job because of it.

70
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.080
Joan Kandel: And yeah.

71
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:48.750
Brittney Carr: I got so overwhelmed up to that because I couldn't be from my apartment, just everything about that. And I just ended up relapsing I just said, You know what, screw it, like, I'm not getting it back. Anyways, foster parents won't even comply and they're not doing anything about it. So like

72
00:07:48.810 --> 00:08:02.130
Brittney Carr: Yeah. And now I guess in New Mexico. They're investigating see why ID for doing things elite doing illegal. Like, I guess, illegal and transactions with other with foster parents

73
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.420
Brittney Carr: Something like that.

74
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.330
Brittney Carr: Well, I guess I wanted to talk to the keys and see

75
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.740
Brittney Carr: That's why I just got overwhelmed and I just didn't see anything happening anytime soon.

76
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.480
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

77
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:16.800
Brittney Carr: Yeah.

78
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.070
Brittney Carr: Okay, I don't want this labor myself and my son.

79
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.400
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Yeah, good.

80
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.770

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.320
Joan Kandel: Yeah, sounds like you've been through a lot

82

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.530
Joan Kandel: And and how sick were you when you took that Suboxone

153
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.460
Brittney Carr: Um, I usually at least make sure I sleep for six hours before I take it.

154
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.240
Joan Kandel: OK.

155
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.740
Brittney Carr: To use it and I usually do pretty good like that.

156
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.720
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Okay.

157
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.450
Brittney Carr: I know it was like 12 to 20

158
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.580
Brittney Carr: I only you're supposed to wait like 12 to 20 hours but um I

159
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.560
Brittney Carr: I just, I always been good at like six hours is always been like an okay please for me to do it.

160
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.730
Brittney Carr: Uh huh.

161
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.580
Joan Kandel: And do you do you base it on the hours or do you base it on how you feel.

162
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:05.580
Brittney Carr: I base it on pretty much both like I at least make sure I'm six hours. But if I'm still like feeling okay then I will

163
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:19.500
Brittney Carr: Okay, but yeah. But if, like, I pretty much know because I i did Suboxone for a long time, like how sick I they put me on Xbox in like three or four times in the hospital.

164
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:20.610
Joan Kandel: So,

165
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.520
Brittney Carr: I'll be exactly like how I'm supposed to feel

166
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.230
Brittney Carr: Right. Okay, so I know and I'm at that. Okay. Yeah. Now it's

167
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:38.730
Joan Kandel: Great. Okay, good. Yeah, I just want to make sure that you that you know that because I'll be prescribing it for you today. And I want you to take it when you're sick enough

168
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.810
Joan Kandel: Yeah, sounds like that won't be too long because you're already well on your way.

169
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:43.740
Brittney Carr: Yeah, I'm

170
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:44.460
Gonna

171
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.830
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right.

172
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.740
Joan Kandel: Um, when you do take the you haven't been using any fentanyl have you

173
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.930
Joan Kandel: Oh no. Okay, good. Do you test your heroin for fentanyl or no.

174
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.350
Brittney Carr: No, but I can taste it in it like

175
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.230
Brittney Carr: Oh yeah, I'm pretty. Yeah.

176
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.550
Joan Kandel: So you have had it before.

177
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.620
Joan Kandel: I've had it has a different taste.

178
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.500
Brittney Carr: Yeah, it has a different way different. Yeah.

179
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.910
Joan Kandel: Okay. Uh huh.

180
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.150
Joan Kandel: So a

181
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.130
Joan Kandel: Week. When you do when I'm going to prescribe the strips for you.

182
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.220
Joan Kandel: And when you do take your first dose.

183
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.550
Joan Kandel: Start with the cutting it in half and just take half of the strips.

184
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.240
Brittney Carr: Start

185
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.890
Joan Kandel: Just to make sure it doesn't put you into worst withdrawals because

186
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:42.330
Joan Kandel: If it, if it, if it was going to put you in worth worst withdrawal. You want to take as little as possible so that it's not as bad.

187
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:49.800
Joan Kandel: So if you took a whole strip and it was going to throw you into that withdrawal, it would be worse than taking just half a strip. So

188
00:15:50.580 --> 00:16:05.130
Joan Kandel: So start with just taking half a strip and if you feel if you don't feel sicker. That's good. If it helps with your, with your symptoms and you feel just fine. Then don't take another one until you know when it starts to wear off.

189
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.380
Joan Kandel: But if you just kind of feel

190
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:13.320
Joan Kandel: Just the same amount of crappy or maybe just slightly better than you can take the other half of the strip

191
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.950
Joan Kandel: Come, so, um,

192
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.620
Joan Kandel: Yeah, we'll talk about we'll talk about dosing in a little bit kind of more towards the end of this, but we'll, we'll get you feeling stable and

193
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.360
Joan Kandel: This is going to really help.

194
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.130
Brittney Carr: Thank you.

195
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.290

198
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.940
Brittney Carr: I was working. I was actually working for the New Mexico department house.

199
00:16:48.810 --> 00:17:02.370
Brittney Carr: Okay. And that was back when I was in last March, I started. Well, I started actually 2018 of November, and I, I stopped working there like

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:14.670
Brittney Carr: March. He doesn't he does a temporary job and then I got a job at a medical spa where I was a receptionist and then that was the job I lost because

201
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.670
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right.

202
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.510
Joan Kandel: Okay.

Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

Brittney Carr: But I just

208
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:49.560
Brittney Carr: My mind has been elsewhere. And I haven't really been focused on trying to find a place I'm about to lose my doctor, which is another big reason why I can't do this anymore.

209
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.880
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's kind of a priority for you once you get

You just

272
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.170
Joan Kandel: About how much do you smoke.

273
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.070
Brittney Carr: A pack.

274
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.980
Joan Kandel: And is that something that you've ever successfully quit.

275
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.080
Brittney Carr: Only when I was incarcerated and that's

276
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.350
Brittney Carr: When I was pregnant with my oldest son.

277
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.180
Joan Kandel: Well, you did. Uh huh.

278
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.690

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:37.830
Brittney Carr: Know,

280
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:43.080
Joan Kandel: You're still smoke, and do you do you think about quitting smoking these days.

281
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.070
Brittney Carr: I do, but I feel like it will take one take one thing at a time.

282
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.960
Joan Kandel: Sure, yeah.

283
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.060

Joan Kandel: Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:05.160
Joan Kandel: Yeah, down the road, though. I think that would be really good when you're feeling, you know, stable. That would be really unimportant thing to do because it's so nasty. It's horrible.

286
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.420
Joan Kandel: Okay.

287
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.540

288
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.130
Joan Kandel: Other past medical problems like besides addiction.

289
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.990
Joan Kandel: The medical problems.

290
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:30.660

291
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.480
Brittney Carr: Like when I was actually pregnant with my daughter.

292
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:52.020
Brittney Carr: And years ago, I had to Calais, and I don't know what it was, but I think in one day and I hit my head on the toilet and I got like 14 stitches. I got four stitches on inside and outside

293
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.040
Joan Kandel: No, he

294
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.750
Brittney Carr: Was really deep and I like

295
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:10.890
Brittney Carr: I don't know what causes it. Like I fainted. A few times in my life and I, when I went to school to get my stitches like nothing more than nothing stitched me and send me on the way they didn't even check into why fainted.

296
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.490
Brittney Carr: So I'm having like random swelling in my left arm and I'm not sure why but

297
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:28.410
Brittney Carr: My, my boyfriend is actually registered years and he was telling me that, like, just say is like observing me and stuff that team, it looks like our problems.

298
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.480
Brittney Carr: So our kidney

299
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.250
Brittney Carr: So I'm not really sure. I need to go get that checked out. Yeah.

300
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.960
Joan Kandel: Do you have a doctor. But you see,

301
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.480
Brittney Carr: Not now. No, I

302
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.400
Joan Kandel: add that to the list of things to do. Right.

303

350
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:38.970
Brittney Carr: I am five four and a half and I way, I'm not really sure. Probably like 100 pounds. I'm underweight.

351
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.110
Okay.

352
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.970

Joan Kandel: Has been the last time you had it checked you

354
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.350
Brittney Carr: Don't remember. But I could probably go check today.

355
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.020
Joan Kandel: Yeah, you know, that would be really great if you could get a blood pressure and a pulse.

356
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.480
Joan Kandel: Somewhere, and then

357
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.910
Joan Kandel: Call the virtual clinic, the number that you call before

358
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.970
Joan Kandel: And let them know that so they could put that in the chart that would be

359
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.130
Joan Kandel: It if you can get a full set of vital signs that would be even better.

360
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.900
Joan Kandel: But if you can only get the blood pressure and pulse. That would be fine, too.

361
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:30.600
Joan Kandel: Okay, so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of just read through a list of symptoms.

362
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.240
Joan Kandel: And besides, what you're having right now for withdrawal symptoms.

363
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.130
Joan Kandel: Not me. If any of these

364
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.200
Joan Kandel: Are true for you.

Brittney Carr: Actually when I got out of rehab. I got dinner.

377
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.660
Brittney Carr: I was still

378
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:23.130
Brittney Carr: I was still clean. I was still sober, but I just got thinner and I don't know why. Maybe it's because I'm so busy with the baby and stuff.

379
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.770
Brittney Carr: When I got out of. Yeah.

380
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:26.640
OK.

381
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:39.180
Joan Kandel: Change in vision redness and the eyes pain in the eyes hearing loss pain in the ears ringing in the ears.

382
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.570
Joan Kandel: bloody noses or congestion.

383
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.540
Joan Kandel: Congestion sores in the mouth.

384
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.620
Joan Kandel: Pain in the teeth.

385
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.600
Joan Kandel: pain in the neck.

386
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.400
Joan Kandel: trouble breathing cough wheeze

387
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.050
Brittney Carr: Eating I get like

388
00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:05.430
Brittney Carr: Like once in a while. Like, I see a lot of the time. Like I feel like I have to just stop and take deep breaths. Like, because I feel like I'm forgetting to breathe. I don't know why I'm explaining it but

389
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:12.240
Brittney Carr: Like I'm like what I'm concentrating like all i don't know if it's because they will my breath or what but I'm I always find myself like

390
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.260
Brittney Carr: Guess me all the time. I don't know why, but

391
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:16.830
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

392
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.030
Brittney Carr: Any catch my breath.

393
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:24.570
Joan Kandel: Well, one of the things that that heroin does or any opiate is it it

394
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:35.310
Joan Kandel: It lowers the the drive to breathe. So we call that the respiratory drive. And so it's really common in people who are using opiates that they

395
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:42.810
Joan Kandel: That they have exactly what you're describing that they feel like, you know, the breathing is just like you have to kind of think about it, it's like

396
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.970
Joan Kandel: You know, you have to like

397
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:51.780
Joan Kandel: Focus on it, instead of it just being kind of an automatic thing. And that's actually how people OD

398
00:30:52.710 --> 00:31:09.060
Joan Kandel: Is what we call respiratory depression, meaning that that yeah the what the, what the heroin or the other opiates do is they kind of turn off the switch in the brain that that makes us breathe on our own just automatically. And so people who are

399
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:19.350
Joan Kandel: Who have odd. They don't their brains don't make them breathe and they're like out of it. So they're not thinking about breathing and so they just don't breathe and

400
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.610
Brittney Carr: That's how they die.

401
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:29.160
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's kind of heavy duty. So you're probably you're probably just being aware of that.

402
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.640
You know,

403
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:38.700
Joan Kandel: That your body is not telling you to breathe. So you have to remember to breathe. So if you were to get just a little bit too high.

404
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.870
Joan Kandel: You might not remember to breathe and and that would be

405
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.360
Joan Kandel: How people die.

406
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.030
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Crazy, huh.

407
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:48.960
Joan Kandel: Yeah yeah

408
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.230
Joan Kandel: Yep. That's why people OD

409
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:57.930
Joan Kandel: Okay, so a

410
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.260
Joan Kandel: pain in the chest.

411
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.140
Joan Kandel: Fluttering of the heartbeat.

412
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:08.880
Joan Kandel: We already talked about the

413
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.890
Joan Kandel: Areas. Yeah.

414
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.660
Brittney Carr: Does that like when

415
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:23.280
Brittney Carr: I don't know, I always guys asking me about this earlier, but like when you breathe in and like you get like restart pins. It feels like in your heart. Like what is that

416
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:34.710
Joan Kandel: Yeah. What that can be different things, but oftentimes it's, it can be the the diaphragm is the muscle that kind of goes up and down, and it's right underneath the heart.

417
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:50.700
Joan Kandel: And it can kind of spasm and give you like a real sharp kind of pain and that hand. The best thing to do for that is to really take slow deep breaths in and out, because then that relaxes that muscle. So that's the most common reason that people get that kind of thing.

418
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.230
Joan Kandel: And and that's

419
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.660
Brittney Carr: The sign of anything or

420
00:32:55.050 --> 00:33:00.060
Joan Kandel: It probably goes along with what we were just talking about that the that the opiates kind of

421
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.620
Brittney Carr: Keeping from

422
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:05.880
Brittney Carr: I've got this since I was a little girl like I got more when I was a little girl.

423
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.430
Brittney Carr: Uh huh. Yeah.

424
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.060
Interesting.

425
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.890
Brittney Carr: So,

426
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:17.790
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's not necessarily a sign of have anything specific. It's kind of a general kind of thing.

427
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:28.290
Joan Kandel: belly pain, vomiting, we already talked about diarrhea, constipation,

428
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:36.750
Joan Kandel: pain when you pee blood in the P change in hair or skin easy bruising.

429
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.860
Brittney Carr: Skin, the change in skin like my skin just got really dry.

430
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:54.060
Brittney Carr: Okay. So I recently had a staph infection that I didn't go to the hospital for it, but I got a cure. And I put some on there and a bandage day and all my baby studies to do wound care.

431
00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.670
Brittney Carr: And uh huh hospitals and stuff so

432
00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:06.000

433
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:15.540
Brittney Carr: And okay, itchy and just like it's just like flaky, like the skin. You mean like this really and

434
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.010

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.730
Brittney Carr: Seven years ago now.

460
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:09.540

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:45.540
Brittney Carr: Like

486
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.460
Joan Kandel: Yeah, that's perfect.

487
00:37:52.920 --> 00:38:00.030
Joan Kandel: Perfect. And now let me have you kind of push on your belly and just let me know if anything perched there.

488
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.670
Joan Kandel: And you push on it.

489
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.260
Goes okay

490
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:09.840
Brittney Carr: Yes.

491
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.800
Okay.

492
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.450
Joan Kandel: And you don't have any swelling in your

493
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.220
Joan Kandel: In your left arm right now.

494
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.900
Joan Kandel: Okay, that just kind of comes and goes.

495
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.150
Brittney Carr: Yeah, just once in a while.

496
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:27.930
Yeah.

497
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.550
Joan Kandel: Okay, so, so let's talk about

498
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.970
Joan Kandel: Let's talk about the program, a little bit.

499
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.140
Joan Kandel: So what we do is

500
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:48.480
Joan Kandel: You'll have every week you'll have group meeting, which is kind of group therapy.

501
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.650
Joan Kandel: It's a group therapy session. And it's also the medical check in.

502
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:53.400
So,

503
00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.100
Joan Kandel: So there's a doctor there.

504
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.010
Joan Kandel: Like me and a therapist there.

505
00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:08.790
Joan Kandel: And we do a small part of the hour. It's an hour every week, a small part of the hour is just checking in with everybody about how their medications doing, how they're doing.

506
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.350
Joan Kandel: Medically speaking

507
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:24.660
Joan Kandel: And and then the rest of the time is more therapeutic it's more for therapy, it's processing and, you know, there's usually a topic that people discussion. Everybody kind of talks with each other. And it's very supportive and it's really

508
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.180
Joan Kandel: It's really a nice a nice thing.

509
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:34.200
Joan Kandel: So that's every week. And that's when we prescribe the the medications.

510
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.800
Joan Kandel: If you show up to group, then you'll usually get your meds.

511
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:49.710
Joan Kandel: Or sometimes if you show up to an individual appointment, then that's when you'll get your meds. So, so we don't give long prescriptions. It's usually just till the next appointment.

512
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:58.080
Joan Kandel: Um, and so, so there are various times that the groups happen so

513
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:02.100
Joan Kandel: I have a group at

514
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:16.680
Joan Kandel: Both of my groups are on Tuesdays ones at 430 in the afternoon ones at six in the afternoon six in the evening. There are groups on other days which aren't my groups, but do you have a preference for time.

515
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.720
Joan Kandel: For days.

516
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.010
Brittney Carr: Let's see, seeing maybe the six o'clock. One thing.

517
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.180
Joan Kandel: Okay.

518
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.650
Joan Kandel: And Tuesdays are fine with you.

519
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.170
Brittney Carr: To see ya. Okay.

520
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.960
Joan Kandel: Okay, so, so let's put you in, in, in that group, which will be tomorrow.

521
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.980
So,

522
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:50.700
Joan Kandel: So we'll have you show up tomorrow. So I'm actually just going to get you enough medicine for today and tomorrow and then tomorrow all want to check in with you on your

523
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.590
Joan Kandel: On how you're doing.

524
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.660
Joan Kandel: So, so let's talk a little bit about the, about the man.

525
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:00.600
Joan Kandel: So,

526
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.060
Joan Kandel: We talked about how take half of the strip. When you first take it later today.

527
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:23.940
Joan Kandel: And then, and then if you need more than that, then you'll have it to take what I want to do is I want to see how you do. I know that 24 milligrams was a good dose for you before I want to see how you do on 16 milligrams to see if that's enough. Do you know if you've ever

528
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.270
Joan Kandel: Been on 60 milligrams of. How does that feel

529
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:37.650
Brittney Carr: Um yeah why no one knows taking 60 milligrams. I took one morning one at night and I still still felt like throughout the day, like

530
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:53.340
Brittney Carr: I was just, I just didn't have I had to take and I just didn't I just want the money when I send you. I won't be able to sleep during the night. I didn't take it. I'm just let me know. It was like I wasn't like really dying stick but

531
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.710
Joan Kandel: Put your stuff.

532
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.680
Brittney Carr: Like that, like days idea and like

533
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.610
Brittney Carr: Just like a little bit of a cold sweats and like

534
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.880
Yeah.

535
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.180
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Okay, so, um,

536
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:25.710
Joan Kandel: So we'll see how you see how you do on in my experience, most people do do pretty well on either eight or 12 or 16. Some people need to be a little bit higher. Most people do not need to go up to 24 milligrams

537
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.080
Joan Kandel: Some do. So we're kind of

538
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:32.460
Joan Kandel: What I'd like to shoot for is, is to have you feel

539
00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.600
Joan Kandel: You know, fine and functional and normal

540
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.400
Joan Kandel: On the lowest dose possible

541
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:44.940
Joan Kandel: So if you feel fine and normal and functional on 16 milligrams or 18 milligrams

542
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.900
Joan Kandel: Great, that's where we'll stop rather than just jumping you up to 24 milligrams

543
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:49.890
Joan Kandel: Because it's

544
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:55.290
Joan Kandel: It's better to be on the lowest amount that that helps you feel good.

545
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:56.520
Brittney Carr: Okay.

546
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.080
Joan Kandel: So how does that sound.

547
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.030
Brittney Carr: To try it.

548
00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:04.110
Joan Kandel: Okay, we'll see how we do. And, you know, we'll talk about it tomorrow so

549
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:16.680
Joan Kandel: So what I'd like for you today to do today is take, you know, start with the four milligrams and then take up to 16 milligrams. If you feel like you need 60 milligrams, which I imagine you probably will.

550
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:28.140
Joan Kandel: And then tomorrow. Take 16 milligrams and then we'll talk about it tomorrow and see how you feel. See if we hang in there with 16 or go up a little bit or see how you're doing.

551
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.060
Joan Kandel: Okay, okay.

552
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.570
Brittney Carr: All right.

553
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:36.510
Joan Kandel: Yeah, you bet. The other thing I'm going to prescribe for you, besides the Suboxone is

554
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.180
Joan Kandel: Is Narc can do you, do you know what Narcan is. And do you have an arc and chips.

555
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.310
Joan Kandel: Yes. Yeah, good.

556
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.690
Joan Kandel: Do you have it.

557
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.060
Always means

558
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.180
Joan Kandel: I'm going to prescribe it for you because I think that everybody should carry it around with them.

559
00:43:54.510 --> 00:44:04.470
Joan Kandel: You never know. I carry around with me all the time because you know you're gonna find someone slumped over and you can't wake them up and you squirt that stuff up their nose and then you save their life.

560
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.360
Joan Kandel: So that would be good.

561
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:15.390
Joan Kandel: So, so I'll get you that. And if you ever have to use it or you misplace it or you can't find it. You can go back to the same pharmacy and they'll have a resource for you.

562
00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:20.010
Joan Kandel: So, so those are the two things I'll be prescribing for you.

563
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:32.100
Joan Kandel: And and i just prescribed them electronically so I type it in the computer. It gets sent over to your pharmacy. So I'll do that, you know, after we get off the call here.

564
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.460
Joan Kandel: And so they should have it within you know

565
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.800
Joan Kandel: A couple of hours and you can

566
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:38.220
Joan Kandel: Go in.

567
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:38.850
And

568
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.180
Joan Kandel: And just be really careful with that first dose.

569
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.640
Joan Kandel: We already talked about that. I don't need you already know that.

570
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:48.330
Joan Kandel: So,

571
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.720
Joan Kandel: Then the other thing that I want to

572
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.430
Joan Kandel: Tell you about is that

573
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.470
Joan Kandel: They ordered labs for you, they talk to you about that.

574
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:59.190
Joan Kandel: Where to go

575
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.020
Joan Kandel: Get the labs. Okay, perfect.

576
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:11.730
Joan Kandel: Yeah, and the lab may be a place where they can get a full set of vital signs. You know, sometimes they'll do vital signs and we asked them to write them down for you and then call the virtual clinic.

577
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:22.860
Joan Kandel: Those, that would be great. And the virtual clinic is the number that you call this morning. And that's kind of the main number like put it in your phone as a save that number.

578
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:33.480
Joan Kandel: Because that's the number that you'll call every time you have an appointment either an individual appointment or a group appointment and they will tell you what number to call

579
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.820
Joan Kandel: To get into the room.

580
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:38.460
Joan Kandel: Like this.

581
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:47.580
Joan Kandel: So, so every time. That's your that's your point of contact. If you have any questions about the program or you have any like needs like if you're

582
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.800
Joan Kandel: In need of medicine or you

583
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.310
Brittney Carr: Have to

584
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.360
Joan Kandel: Talk to somebody about your when your next appointment is best number to call

585
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:59.700
Joan Kandel: Anything, and they're there 24 seven. So you're very accessible.

586
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:10.530
Joan Kandel: The other thing I want to tell you about is the is the urine drug screen. We do that you'll do that at the lab, they'll do the first one at the lab. So they'll collect some

587
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.670
Joan Kandel: Some P from you.

588
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.260
Joan Kandel: And

589
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:22.980
Joan Kandel: But then about every month we we test urine drug screen, but you don't have to go to the lab for that you'll do that at your home.

590
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:29.880
Joan Kandel: Wherever we send that to you and you'll get up, you'll get kind of a bulky manila envelope in the mail.

591
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.260
Joan Kandel: From us

592
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:44.010
Joan Kandel: And what Don't open that just leave it. Leave it closed and when you get that in the mail call the virtual clinic and say, Hey, I got this envelope. What do I do, and they'll have you open it in front of them on the camera.

593
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.010
Joan Kandel: And because if it's already open.

594
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.690
Joan Kandel: Then they will

595
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.360
Joan Kandel: Say, well you have to go to the lab to

596
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:54.060
Joan Kandel: So much easier if you just do it at home.

597
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.890
Brittney Carr: And I'll talk you through it.

598
00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:01.380
Joan Kandel: So if you get that envelope. Don't open it. That's the main point just call the virtual clinic.

599
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:03.540
Joan Kandel: And

600
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:14.790
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I think that's it. So so the so the next time you're going to call in is tomorrow call in at about 530 or so, which is about a half an hour before we start.

601
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.160
Joan Kandel: We're going to have you fill out.

602
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:28.350
Joan Kandel: Every week before group they have you fill out what's called a Bam. A brief addiction monitor and you're just kind of doing a self assessment of how you feel like you've done in the past week, or how you're doing.
