64
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:40.770

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.350
Brooke Templeton: Um, it's been a long time. Okay.

94
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.320
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, how long ago.

95
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.000
Brooke Templeton: Like probably like at least fleek. Five, six years ago.

96
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.630
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, what medication. We on at the time.

97
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:04.860
Brooke Templeton: I'm saying antidepressant and I'm trying to remember what it was. I'm

98
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.940
Brooke Templeton: Zoloft maybe and quantifying

99
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:17.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. That sounds, that sounds right. So, I mean, I looked at your chart, you're pretty young. So you were on these as a teenager, then

100
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.710
Brooke Templeton: Okay.

101
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.840
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But you're not on them anymore.

102
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:22.800
No.

103
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.280
Jill Beavers-Kirby: How come you're not taking them anymore.

104
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.550
Brooke Templeton: Um, I just stopped seeing the doctor.

105
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:30.810
Okay.

106
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:48.180
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It would probably be a good idea to at least restart the Zoloft, since you're talking about depression and stuff, but we'll talk about that a little bit later. Okay, um, any thoughts of suicide any attempted suicide.

107
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.680
Brooke Templeton: No.

108
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.320
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Have you ever overdosed where you had to get Narcan

109
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.110
Jill Beavers-Kirby: No, no. And just the fentanyl know heroin or pills or anything.

110
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.150
Brooke Templeton: No. Okay.

111
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, how did you get started on fentanyl. Did you have a surgery or were you injured or

112
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.320
Brooke Templeton: Um, no, I'm just fine off the street.

113
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.460
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, just started. All right. Um,

114
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.910
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So are you working now.

115
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.230
Brooke Templeton: No, no.

116
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.710
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Were you working before this pandemic thing.

117
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:23.970
Brooke Templeton: Know,

118
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:31.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And a lot of people are laid off right now because of that. So I didn't know if you're working for. And what was your last job, and how long ago was that

119
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.610
I'm

120
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.080
Brooke Templeton: Okay, I'm

121
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.340
Brooke Templeton: Probably like three years ago I went for direct sales company at a Tracy, California.

122
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.390
Okay.

123
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.180
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So you were in sales or

124
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.150
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah. Okay. Did you like it.

125
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.430
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I could see where you'd be good at sales. I could see that, um,

126
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.700
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And what part where you live in that right now we're part

127
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.070
Brooke Templeton: Oro Valley like to slow

128
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.780
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Down by Tucson. Okay.

129
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:11.070
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. Um, so with the Suboxone um

130
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:20.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, depression and anxiety and and drug abuse, those kind of all go together. A lot of people start taking drugs.

131
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:30.570
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So because they are depressed or because they are anxious and they don't like being depressed and they don't like being anxious and yes medicines can help those

132
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:42.990
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But sometimes, you know, we take them too much. We get addicted. One thing leads to another. Okay, so that that can happen. Um, but with Suboxone it really isn't.

133
00:18:44.370 --> 00:19:00.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: known to cause depression or aggravate depression is not usually one of the side effects or contraindications for it. Um, I would like to have you restart that and wreak and retry it and see. See how it goes.

134
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:12.150
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, most people, the complaints with Suboxone with the tablets. They don't like the taste. Once they dissolve. They say the taste is like

135
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.120
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Not the best, but they'll put up with it.

136
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:23.550
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It can cause some constipation, but you know that that can also be be over with and everything.

137
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.980
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But

138
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:35.880
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Suboxone because it's part of the buprenorphine and part of naloxone what the meloxicam will do is it'll

139
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:48.360
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Keep you from getting that high, it keeps you from getting, you know, from having those the craving feelings and then the buprenorphine is going to lock into yourselves.

140
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:58.770
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That are craving that fentanyl so your cells get used to wanting a drug, whether it's fentanyl heroin. Another opioid, whatever it is.

141
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:07.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And that in that time frame, you know those cells get used to it. They crave it they need it to live, they need it to survive. So

142
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.870
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The buprenorphine will help those cells from from that craving.

143
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:29.310
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then, like I said, the naloxone prevents that high feeling. It's just a teeny tiny dose. It's not the same dose, you give to somebody when when they're overdosing though. Okay, the way it is. We start Suboxone is what's wrong.

144
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.410
Brooke Templeton: Oh, my mom was showing me something.

145
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:32.940
Brooke Templeton: Sorry.

146
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:43.860
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The way that we start Suboxone is you take a half as you wait till you're in withdrawal. So, you know, you're craving the drug your nose is running.

147
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:55.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Your eyes are watery or, you know, you're chilled or you're having hot flashes. You know, you want to wait until you're in withdrawal. And then what we do is we start, have you take a half a strip

148
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:57.630
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then

149
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:06.990
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You're going to wait like four hours. See how you feel if you still feel bad. You're going to take another half a strip. Okay.

150
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:16.710
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That's that was that'll be like day one, so that'll be a dose of eight milligrams. And then, day two, you get up, you take your strip

151
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.550
Jill Beavers-Kirby: See how you feel if you still feel bad. You take another half a strip

152
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:30.570
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And you, you're going to do that for the first few days to see how you feel. So we can figure out, like what a good dose might be for you, even if you were on the three films.

153
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.650
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A day in the past, you might only need two films.

154
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:43.590
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A day. Now it's just based on how your body's going to metabolize that okay so as you change as you get older and things that kind of that kind of stuff will change.

155
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:59.340
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So you might only need you might only need one film a day, you might need one and a half, you know, it's going to be just whatever you figure out and how you feel. Um, the other thing that we do here by heart health is we do group counseling have a talk to you about that.

156
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:09.570
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So you know the the group counseling. It's via the phone internet zoom meetings, just like this.

157
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.220
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It works out really well because you're in the room with a counselor and myself and

158
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:25.650
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm you know we're we're there to support you. But the other people in the room who are going through the same thing as you are.

159
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:34.500
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's great because they can offer tips and advice and you can offer tips and advice about what you've been through how you've managed something

160
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:42.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So it's really, really very educational. I really like the group meetings I love being able to sit in on. I learned something new.

161
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:51.570
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Every day, and then what my part is, and the meaning is that I you know if there's any medication changes that come up or anything that we decide you need

162
00:22:52.020 --> 00:23:00.150
Jill Beavers-Kirby: To manage that. Like I said, there's a therapist who runs the meeting and she's there to like I said just kind of coordinate the meeting, keep people on topic and things

163
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:09.030
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So that's kind of what bright heart health does with as far as what makes them different, like I said, is the group meetings and

164
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:23.520
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The group meetings are every Wednesday, and I'm not exactly sure when the group meetings are for Arizona, I'd have to find that out the care coordinators will be in contact with you to let you know that and you would log on, just like you did here with zoom

165
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:36.120
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And the other thing before I forget the instructions about trying, how to start the Suboxone that will also be sent to you by the care coordinator, so you don't have to remember everything going into that. Okay.

166
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:43.710
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So kind of just talking about how you're feeling now I'm. When is the last time you've done anything. No.

167
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.960
Brooke Templeton: I'm last night.

168
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:57.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. So you haven't had any today. Do you feel like you're in withdrawal or getting out. Okay, so, yeah. So you we would want to wait. Like I said, until you're in withdrawal to start it.

169
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:08.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Because if you start it when you're only like a little bit craving. It's not going to work. Right. You're not going to have a good experience you're going to be like, I don't like this, this isn't working.

170
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:22.650
Brooke Templeton: Yeah, I've done that before. Um, in to me it didn't seem to make a difference if I took it like like way too early or like like two and a half days in it, like it made me sick or either way.

171
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.200
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What do you mean, it makes you sicker.

172
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:34.080
Brooke Templeton: Like okay, something's was worse in some things was better like it took away like some of the light body aches, but like

173
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.550
Brooke Templeton: Like I was throwing up

174
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:52.020
Brooke Templeton: Like after I took it both times and then like it stopped like like runny nose, but then like I do, like, take it. Don't like right after both times are like like taking it like right immediately after like two days in

175
00:24:52.680 --> 00:25:00.690
Brooke Templeton: It like didn't really make it. You know what I mean like something's better and some things was worse, but it didn't make a difference how long it had been

176
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:09.060
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So those symptoms didn't go away after you've been on it for two months or how long were you on it before.

177
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.320
Brooke Templeton: No, I'm

178
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.790
Brooke Templeton: I'm like three, four months.

179
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so

180
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.850
Brooke Templeton: Most of the time.

181
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:18.960
Brooke Templeton: I'm sorry.

182
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:27.060
Brooke Templeton: I didn't take it most of the time, okay guys getting a prescription. The whole time, but I wasn't really taking them a lot of the time. Okay.

183
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.290
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Why weren't you taking them.

184
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.500
Brooke Templeton: I didn't like him. I don't like how many fuel.

185
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:49.620
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So what I need you to do is I need you to give it a good 100% try okay because some of those side effects are going to go away in the first three days. Okay, I need you to, you know, take the medicine.

186
00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:04.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Take it as directed and try it give what I would like for you to do is give it a good solid week of taking it, you know, one film a day to film a day, what three film a day, whatever it is for you.

187
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:21.420
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, and, you know, take it. Just like that. And then we could meet back in a week and see what symptoms, you're still having what side effects are still having and decide if it's the Suboxone that's doing it, or what's causing it. Okay.

188
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.470
Okay.

189
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.540
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm

190
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.550
Jill Beavers-Kirby: There they told you that you have to get like some lab work and stuff done.

191
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.520
Brooke Templeton: Um, I think so.

192
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:48.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, yeah, so that's going to help, too, because you might have some other lab kind of stuff that's that's going on. And you might just be sensitive to the Suboxone but like I said, usually those kinds of side effects go away within the first three days. Okay.

193
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:58.320
Brooke Templeton: Well, yeah, no, I understand that. But like, I'm, what I'm saying is, it didn't make a difference if I took it like when I wasn't sick or when I was like

194
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.960
Brooke Templeton: Like right after I took it made it like worse for most part.

195
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.340
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But it's kind of hard to tell how it's going to do for you over time if you're only taking it spotty.

196
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:24.150
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Here and taking it here and taking it if you can. What I like to do is a tape. Most people take one film twice a day.

197
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:31.080
Jill Beavers-Kirby: They take it about like when they get up, you know, whatever time and then they take their second film.

198
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:38.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Usually like late afternoon because they're, you know, sleeping for part of the day. So they really don't need to mess with it during the evening.

199
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:47.880
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So they take it when they get up and then they take it. Like I said, usually mid to late afternoon when they're starting to get those cravings. Again, um,

200
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:54.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then, like I said, you know, they're sleeping. So if you could get on a schedule where you're at least taking it, like I said,

201
00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:07.590
Jill Beavers-Kirby: In the morning, and then mid to late afternoon because like I said, the usual doses like once or twice a day. And if you could do that for me for a solid week taking it consistently at the same time every day.

202
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:13.110
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I would like to see how you're feeling. Then, and if you are

203
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:23.940
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Feeling you know crappy or hey, you know, Jill It's day four, and I've been taking it every day at eight o'clock and every day at 3pm. And I'm feeling like crap still

204
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:38.040
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, you can contact me and let me know. But I, I really want to see how it's going to go. If you take it. Like I said, every day at the same time, at least least four days in a row. And let's see if we can work through these side effects. Okay.

205
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:50.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Because if it is the drug. Yes. There's other things we can try. But, you know, this is the one that we know works. The one we have the most success with the one you know so that's why I say that, um,

206
00:28:52.200 --> 00:29:04.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, and, yeah, the only other medicine, you've got as the implant. So that's not going to interact with it. I'm trying to think if there's any thing, nothing over the counter interacts with it. That would make you feel like that, um,

207
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The half life of fitness, meaning how long it takes to get out of your system is

208
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:19.230
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I want to say it's around a moderate time. I want to say it's around like eight to 10 hours. So that means that

209
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:31.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: After you've taken your last dose of that know half of it will be out of your system within eight to 10 hours is what I'm pretty sure it is. So that's the other thing is we have to wait till we get all that stuff out of your system to

210
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:38.430
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So that's going to take probably a day and a half to get all that out your system at least

211
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.380
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Once you stopped doing it you know for everything to be flushed out

212
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:52.110
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So I would I would really like for you to try it. Like I said, it's solid study

213
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.080
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Same time every day for a good

214
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.770
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Four or five days love to see you go week

215
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:13.740
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So, if you would, if you could try that. That would be great. Like I said, if you get it today for and you're like, man, I've been puking for the past four days, I've had diarrhea for the past four days. This just ain't working, let me know and we can we can try something else.

216
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Or something else.

217
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:18.810
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So,

218
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.240
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Does that sound like a plan.

219
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.460
Brooke Templeton: Okay.

220
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.590
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Time mountainous and what I'm

221
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What pharmacy. Do you use

222
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.860
Brooke Templeton: Um, let me go ask

223
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:35.580
Okay.

224
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:00.330
Brooke Templeton: Hi, Joe.

225
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:05.460
Brooke Templeton: I unfortunately Brooks not being honest with you. She's on heroin to

226
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.230
Brooke Templeton: Okay, that's the note I was giving to her, to tell you the truth.

227
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:21.690
Brooke Templeton: Okay, well, that's where she is now saying don't even bother because I think she's probably, I don't know. She said she wants to do this, but now all of a sudden

228
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.890
Brooke Templeton: You know, I don't know if she, I don't know why she would didn't want to tell you that she was on that as well. I don't know if that changes things.

229
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:35.100
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It doesn't change things with what we're doing. But, you know, she's got she's got to be vested in it.

230
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:44.550
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Right. Otherwise, it's like, because what's going to happen is the same thing that happened with her last time she's going to take it here and I'm going to take it here and not take it consistently routinely

231
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And my hope is that

232
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.650
Brooke Templeton: Okay. The problem is, she wants sub you text not Suboxone

233
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.330
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I get it, I know it. Yeah, I know.

234
00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:00.090
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I know exactly what she wants. So we're gonna have to what is an insurance on shown access

235
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.800
Brooke Templeton: Know, while

236
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:10.830
Brooke Templeton: They're just slightly different place signed up for access, but I don't. It's not valid, yet they just signed it up. So, I mean, it's going to take a while.

237
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.820
Brooke Templeton: So that would be valid. So it's all self. It's all self pay. Yeah.

238
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.540
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, so, um, you know, the

239
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.090
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The people like to study texts for a lot of different reasons.

240
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:24.810
Brooke Templeton: I

241
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.120
Brooke Templeton: I read I read the difference. Yeah.

242
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.850
Brooke Templeton: Yeah, because you get a high with subjects. Right.

243
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:50.460
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Because it doesn't have an Arcana. Yeah, right. So that's why I would like for her to just try it and see. I get it. I think she would really just try it and see and come to a meeting and start getting involved. I think she would like it but she's got a she's got to help herself.

244
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.340
Brooke Templeton: Right. Right. And I'm not. Yeah, I'm hoping that she's there, but it sounds like porn might not be there.

245
00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.800
Brooke Templeton: But what is the next step in case that she is you are going to give the

246
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.460
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm gonna go ahead and send something into the pharmacy. I'm going to send the

247
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:24.450
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Suboxone him because I i one access is it's hard to get a sub sub you text cleared for access, you have to get a prior authorization. And one of the reasons that you would do so many taxes if you were pregnant. We don't want that to be the reason she sends me decks.

248
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:34.650
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Into if you have an absolute and tolerance of the Norwalk zone, but I want that to be documented.

249
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:40.290
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And with actual proof that she's intolerant of the meloxicam

250
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:41.490
Brooke Templeton: So, okay.

251
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:48.780
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then, you know, access can still say you know once she gets on access to, they can still say, yeah, yeah. We don't want to do that so

252
00:33:49.860 --> 00:34:02.910
Brooke Templeton: Yeah. Well, and I think that's down the road, because I think that the access won't be valid for like like 45 days. So I'm going to be pocket out is going to be out of pocket for me for until that long. So I'm not. Yeah.

253
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.400
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Are you familiar with good Rx

254
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.530
Brooke Templeton: Um, yes.

255
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:21.270
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so when you go to the drugstore have them run it through good Rx type of program or some other prescription drug program. I tell everybody good Rx because it's pretty well accepted but it

256
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.380
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Can save you some money.

257
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.950
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You can download the app on your phone or they can just run it through at the drugstore and

258
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's going to be through the discount

259
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.880
Brooke Templeton: Okay, so you're saying you're going to call it into the pharmacy.

260
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:46.050
Brooke Templeton: But I was going to look through good Rx to see which pharmacy. It is the least expensive. So how do I get back to you on which pharmacy to call it into

261
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:49.530
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You can just contact bright heart and they'll send me a note.

262
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.240
Brooke Templeton: Okay, great. Okay.

263
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:58.560
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I don't think I don't have any patients down in that area just yet. So I can't, I can't really think of who would be the cheapest

264
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.440
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, Walmart usually pretty cheap. If you got a Walmart.

265
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.970
Brooke Templeton: Okay, and I

266
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:12.180
Brooke Templeton: Yeah. The other thing that that I'm sure Rick would be okay with me sharing back as a teenager, she had

267
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:25.800
Brooke Templeton: knee Dislocated three times she had a really severe burn. She had an abscess on her face. I didn't know this at the time that the risks and stuff but like the last time, which at the apps us on the face.

268
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:40.560
Brooke Templeton: It was when she was 18 like in April and they put her in observation and on a morphine drip for the entire weekend and I feel like, you know, and she was given morphine multiple times as a teenager through these

269
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:56.730
Brooke Templeton: Injuries and stuff. And I had no idea the effects, but I feel like that last one, where she was on morphine. Looking back, I believe she came out addicted or, you know, seeking that after the fact, because it was only two months, three months later that I kind of lost her

270
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:57.840
Me.

271
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:06.000
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, as a nurse week the part of the training that we went through at one point in time, probably in the

272
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:14.850
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm late 90s was pain is the fifth vital sign you know your heart rate breathing temperature

273
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:24.030
Jill Beavers-Kirby: All that, you know, these are your vitamins. But pain is the fifth vital sign. So our patients can have pain, our patients can have pain so

274
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:41.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Coincidentally enough. That's when Purdue Pharma produced oxycodone oxycontin, and then this big push came out to say pain is evil. You can have you're supposed to have a pain you're paying level supposed to be zero. So, yeah, we used to give morphine oxycodone OxyContin out like candy.

275
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.070
Brooke Templeton: Yeah.

276
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.710
Brooke Templeton: And now look around the error ways

277
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:57.630
Brooke Templeton: Right, especially I've heard it's just even when you're at that adolescent or teenage years. It's our teenager, it's even that much more addictive. It sounds like at least what I've read

278
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:03.570
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Is the brain doesn't really stop it's warming and neural pathways until about 21

279
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:05.610
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So,

280
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.290
Brooke Templeton: Unfortunately, okay.

281
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:16.110
Brooke Templeton: Yeah, so I just didn't know. I thought I should tell you that just because I think the withdrawal from heroin heroin is longer than fentanyl

282
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:23.670
Brooke Templeton: Yeah. So okay, so I didn't know if that affects like the four day timeframe that you wanted to check back or anything like that. I give

283
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.990
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Her a seven day supply

284
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:25.860
Okay.

285
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:27.450
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um,

286
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So yeah, just let me know what pharmacy.

287
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.530
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, income, I said, Good through bright heart and I'll let you know.

288
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.370
Brooke Templeton: Okay. Do you need anything more from breath. Before I let go for

289
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.680
Jill Beavers-Kirby: No, I don't think so. Okay.

290
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.220
Brooke Templeton: Great, thanks.

291
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.420
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, thank you.
