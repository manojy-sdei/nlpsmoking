1
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.090
Marianne todd: Okay.

2
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um,

3
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So bring me up to speed. What is something changed here what's going on. Oh.

4
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.170
Marianne todd: Nice. So, I believe it was it was the day I text you I got a message from my ex husband, my messenger

5
00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:10.050
Marianne todd: Telling me to call him as soon as possible, and I called him. And it turns out our older son is going through a really rough time with not having me around, he's just been acting up a lot. And he's really close to go into JPL.

6
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.950
Marianne todd: And he just got suspended from school again and stuff. And so it was him. Basically, you know, like telling me, like, I need you to be in his life. I need you to be there.

7
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:32.820
Marianne todd: And which is really awesome. You know what I mean, like, I'm super excited, but it was really scary because he's also angry with me because he just doesn't. Okay.

8
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.860
Marianne todd: You know what I mean, he doesn't understand everything he doesn't know the full truth about everything like he's just kind of really confused.

9
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:51.240
Marianne todd: And so we actually video called him that night, and the next night. And at first it was very difficult. Like, he was really angry.

10
00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.540
Marianne todd: I couldn't help but to break down crying, obviously, but I did apologize to him. I let him know. I want to be there. And that's not going to change. I am going to be there.

11
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.590
Marianne todd: And he loosened up a little bit after that. And last night was just amazing. Like,

12
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

13
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, wonderful. To the timing I don't know this tiny feel so good. I'm glad I get to be way.

14
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.440
Marianne todd: More than Cisco crazy cuz mean you had just gone through it and not knowing

15
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I mean. It's so ironic.

16
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:41.040
Marianne todd: And it was really good. But the thing. I had a question about is I kind of talked about this a little bit too because his dad is trying to get them into counseling.

17
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:57.660
Marianne todd: But he's having an issue with insurance and all kinds of things, I guess. Yes. And I was, I don't know if you're able to do this or not but I was thinking, wondering if we could do some sessions with me. Yeah, sure. I try to move on things. Okay.

18
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Love to do that. I don't get to do much family, work in here.

19
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:14.190
Marianne todd: On Aiden is very unsure of it right now apparently he's been diagnosed with a bunch of things like social anxiety, depression,

20
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.260
Marianne todd: And so when I had brought it up to him. He was very burnin perm and thing. I don't know. I don't know.

21
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:35.850
Marianne todd: And I told him I was like okay, baby. Well, it's up to you. I was like, I just want you to think about it, let me know. But I told him, if anything, I could set something up where you can meet you and see if you're comfortable. You know what I mean. So let me tell you this is

22
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how it would go, I can't be his therapist, but this is how it could go, let's say do you envision actually being in the same room with him.

23
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.990
Marianne todd: That when it happened for a while because he is 18 hours away over it and about it right now.

24
00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you feel if you were in, you are in, in, zoom, much like you see in group and his screen was there and your screen was there. How would you feel about that.

25
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.130
Marianne todd: Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking about

26
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.940
Marianne todd: Like I'm sure we can do it to where we do like a group to

27
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how we would do it. We would do it as family therapy and I wouldn't become the Family Therapist, right. I can't really do that. Officially, but you've seen that I can still

28
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of continue to be supportive, both as a couples therapist and individual and also in the service of your goals.

29
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is distressing and Dutta Dutta duh, I can certainly do that. So this is how you could sell it to Adrian, you could say, Aiden.

30
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get you on the app. Get him comfortable talking with you right on zoom see this. And you could say, Aiden. You can get up and walk off the screen and you can just look

31
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.470
You don't even have to be on the screen.

32
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.210
Marianne todd: You go

33
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So he you know it's that number one if it's you. Why don't you check out with this lady's all about see if she's mean, see if she's nice see if she's funny, see if she's friendly, see if someone you could kind of kind of sit with a little bit

34
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm

35
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's that. There's self.

36
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Healing the fact that you can be off screen. You get to decide how much you talk. You get to decide, all of that part.

37
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's so much more comfortable for people and then being face to face. I mean, he's probably going to notice his blood he may not want anything else after that it's so much more comfortable than having to look someone in the eyeballs.

38
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you can sit back, I mean your little picture could be anybody. You can be. You can be way over here you know your little picture can be so small that gives a lot of these kids are also into all these technology things is kind of even that's their, their gig.

39
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's number one. Number two is I want to ask you something.

40
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you want from you if you've heard any kind of when you and Benito are talking. Are you heard me say if I'm going to be very heavily waiting on skill building so that you guys can navigate on your own. But think for an don't answer right away. I want you to think for a moment.

41
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want

42
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Short term from a first meeting. What would be just the bare minimum, what you would want from that encounter with all of us together.

43
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.010
Marianne todd: When I think I already know it's just wanting him.

44
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.760
Marianne todd: I just want him to feel more comfortable.

45
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.530
Marianne todd: And I want him like, I don't know how to explain it like

46
00:07:52.410 --> 00:08:00.000
Marianne todd: Okay cuz the whole drug addiction thing has already came up with him. Okay, he brought it up last night.

47
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:13.650
Marianne todd: He was telling me. He's like, Mom, I don't want to be rude. He's like, I really don't want to upset you. Yeah, he's but this is what I overheard that telling grandpa in court was that you had openly admit it to him about your drug addiction.

48
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:24.720
Marianne todd: And so I kind of want to help him under like I don't know how to explain it. I want to be able to explain it to them better. You know what I mean.

49
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so stay there. Stay there. So take a deep breath.

50
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's start with you. You're my client wants you to picture something happens during this this session where we're all together.

51
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And I make sure that people are taking care of that their safety. I'm taking care of watching language and all of that and you walk away from this this session. And what's the feeling you're going to have when you walk away.

52
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.270
Marianne todd: Oh no, like,

53
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.710
Marianne todd: I guess they want to feel more secure. Okay. And mine, whose relationship. Okay.

54
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the thought. You want to have. So right now, there's probably missing information there's missing details you want him to come away, maybe with some information.

55
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:38.340
Marianne todd: Now I want him to come away from the from it with the information that I truly do love them and I do care. And I want to be there.

56
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so the goal is for him to hear the. I love you. And what about the the piece about the addiction. What do you want to know about that.

57
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.350
Marianne todd: But it wasn't me.

58
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.960
Marianne todd: Like, but I was it just made me something, but I'm not

59
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's some behaviors that you think he is holding on to that he thinks are you, but really it was the behavior, while you were high kind of thing.

60
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:27.930
Marianne todd: Yeah, and it wasn't he didn't see me, he never saw me. Hi, he never had to deal with any of that, it was just me not fighting as much as I should have been to be there for. So it's kind of like the neglect in it.

61
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

62
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and that we had talked about we had done a little bit around that. So it's really interesting.

63
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm imagining

64
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.760
That

65
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've sat a little bit with that neglect. Right. I didn't fight. I could have fought like you sat with it. We got to do that work a little tiny bit together at least

66
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want just want to test it. Just checking it. Do you want him back in your life 100% if you had your druthers, would you take them in the home and get 100% custody of them.

67
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.100
Yes.

68
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And he says to you, well, why didn't she fight for me. Why have you been fighting now over these years. What's your response to that.

69
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.520
Marianne todd: But response in the truth would be. I was just scared.

70
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.570
Scared.

71
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.080
Marianne todd: Of losing him forever like in the court system because

72
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.270
Marianne todd: I'm just

73
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:52.740
Marianne todd: His family comes from military and a lot of money and my family comes from drug addiction and prison being broke so it has always really intimidated me

74
00:11:53.280 --> 00:12:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I went into court find you if I go into court and they pull up my record. They might take away my option. My parental rights, I might never they might. Is that what you're trying to say.

75
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.430
Marianne todd: Well, there's, that's the thing. I don't have anything on my record.

76
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.050
Marianne todd: Why so

77
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Much fear. Then, so I didn't name it. What is it, because I didn't quite see how in court. Right. Is that what this is about.

78
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.660
Marianne todd: Yeah, like

79
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:30.990
Marianne todd: The year for me is in the town that he's in right now. The cops and the system over there has always kind of favored people from that town.

80
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:49.410
Marianne todd: Okay, and history has proven it with some of my friends and, you know, stuff like that, and the wife always had a fear that with them being from felon with them working at the military bases there. And on top of that his grandma does have a lot of power and a lot of pull in that town.

81
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Do they not know right now the full scope of your substance use today not know it right now.

82
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.030
Marianne todd: No, they don't.

83
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.350
Marianne todd: They don't know

84
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.490
Marianne todd: They barely know they only know what I told them.

85
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What did they know

86
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:16.710
Marianne todd: Just that I went through a drug addiction and that I have been cleaning. That was the only time I ever told them anything about it was after I was clean. It was the last time, Aiden had come back into my life.

87
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:25.590
Marianne todd: And I had made them aware, like, hey, yes, I was going through a drug addiction. That's why my behavior was the way it was. And now it's going to be different.

88
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

89
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if you were to

90
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea is, so why he didn't pursue custody like sending letters subpoenas like using the judicial system to get him. Let's say I'm doing the worst case scenario. Okay, right now, just just kind of test your readiness to hear this fear.

91
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if he says that it's I didn't want to go to court because my whole history might come up and they might find a way to take you away forever.

92
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

93
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I get it.

94
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.590
Marianne todd: Yeah, okay.

95
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been writing him. Have you been trying your darkness to try to get the message. I love you to him.

96
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.380
Marianne todd: Um, we've been video chatting. That's it. Because right now, he

97
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hears years ago.

98
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.070
Marianne todd: Oh, years ago. No, I wasn't.

99
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: He tell me why.

100
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Marianne todd: It was just like, after I got clean my hugest fear was just because every time his dad would get upset, he would rip them away again.

101
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:54.870
Marianne todd: And so my hugest fear was going through that over and over and over again and it causing me to relax because of me getting so upset about it and watching him and his brother get so upset about it.

102
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But I heard that.

103
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The fear is I got my hopes up and your dad would would pull contact and it was triggering

104
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: My a relapse for me and my fear was it's going to keep happening. And I'm not going to be able to get a handle on my recovery. I might stay in addiction, I might if this keeps happening. Yeah.

105
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I get that.

106
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.010
Marianne todd: Yeah, okay.

107
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.450
Okay.

108
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Are those the worst things that he could say

109
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.440
Marianne todd: Oh, Baden

110
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:33.630
Marianne todd: Mm hmm. I

111
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.630
Marianne todd: Mean, yeah.

112
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:45.030
Marianne todd: I don't know anything else like that I have actually done or said or anything that he could say that's worse.

113
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: In your assessment, though, would those be the one of the more most difficult things that he could bring up

114
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.200
Marianne todd: Yeah, definitely.

115
00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And it sounds familiar, because that's already this I didn't fight it could have fought like so that's why I brought him up, is I want to check and see how ready, you are to hear because there's no room.

116
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: When it comes to kids, they're completely irrational. So what's happening is probably

117
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: He's going through that same ripping that just don't want to get my hopes up. And how could this be true. What if she's not telling the truth and

118
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to go through this again. So the same self preservation that you're doing, he's doing this to he's not doing it from an adult perspective.

119
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: He's just flailing around trying to know, well what do I hold on to hear my hope and excitement my belief in her or she going to get my hopes up and let me do

120
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:45.780
Here.

121
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

122
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:56.520
Marianne todd: Am I, that's something that's actually been heavily on my mind like I already know that he feels that way. You know what I mean.

123
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:10.500
Marianne todd: Because it does always help in this way it happens to where I'm able to get in touch with them and then all of a sudden Mitch is gone, and he's left with no answers no security, no nothing. You know what I mean.

124
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This next question might be a little uncomfortable for you.

125
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Marianne, and that's why right I'm your therapist, and I'm not the Family Therapist. That's why down the line. What's going to be important is that you get a separate clinician because it kind of questions have to do with the functioning of everyone in this system.

126
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And a question that a family therapist might ask is, Marianne, how do you know you're ready to commit to this, given the fact that

127
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It could happen that something negative happens with your son. Are you going to relapse again how fragile, are you in your recovery. Are you really ready

128
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: To commit to sobriety, no matter what.

129
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:10.230
Marianne todd: I mean I feel like I am, yes. Like I feel like it's a lot

130
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: because something happened to your son. You could be accused of something

131
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.560
Yeah.

132
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.390
Marianne todd: Are you going to

133
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it right

134
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your excuse in the pipe right in the past has been well under that's going to be my go to. That's what I'm going to do. So what do you know about yourself. Now, they didn't know them.

135
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.340
I mean,

136
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:43.530
Marianne todd: I don't know, there's, it's hard to explain. Like it's now that I have a counselor. That's actually helping me

137
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:53.280
Marianne todd: It's a lot different, because now I can actually recognize good things in myself and I've never been able to do that in the past.

138
00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:03.480
Marianne todd: Like I recognize that I am positive. Now I'm a lot happier. I'm a lot stronger. Like I don't let things get to me anymore.

139
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.430
Marianne todd: Like I don't let

140
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:21.330
Marianne todd: Little things ruin my day, like I used to. You know what I mean. And in between these couple years that I haven't been able to talk to aid. It's given me time to actually build my strength and to work on my recovery.

141
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.570
Marianne todd: To where I feel a lot stronger now.

142
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:42.510
Marianne todd: Because in the beginning, I just wasn't getting the help that I needed. And I didn't know how to navigate through everything. I didn't know where to even begin. And so now that I actually have the hope I need I'm know how to get through things. You know what I mean.

143
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What is

144
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Some something happens, you weren't seeing a counselor and something significant happened right

145
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you do to protect his emotional well being, what would you do to protect him.

146
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.370
Marianne todd: What do you mean

147
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you're not coming to bright hard health anymore. Something happens here. Don't know people's insurance flakes out all kinds of things happen and not getting this support.

148
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How will you put

149
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Aiden's safety first.

150
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.150
Marianne todd: Mean, I don't know. I don't know how to answer that.

151
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time that these are asking really difficult questions and not going to come quick

152
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.450
Marianne todd: I mean, like, are you talking about, if he was with me or if it was just the same way it is now.

153
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we totally got right now. Or maybe it's in the future. What came up

154
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, how about both

155
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:12.240
Marianne todd: I don't know. I know. The only thing I can really think of because it's kind of hard with him not being with me and he's over there with his dad like

156
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:28.110
Marianne todd: The only thing I could think of is to just be persistent and keep fighting to be in his life, even if his dad were to get upset and say, I can't talk to them, instead of giving up. I would just keep bugging and fighting and doing what I had to do.

157
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.190
Marianne todd: About my sobriety.

158
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.810
Marianne todd: No, I would just stay strong and stay clean

159
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see how that will

160
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Also be protecting him. You're right.

161
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:45.870
Yeah.

162
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So be persistent and I think having this reality test.

163
00:21:54.030 --> 00:22:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You're making a change you're working on growth and recovery and the authentic self. But your ex husband is not

164
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This is possibly

165
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: One hump in a roller coaster. He's very upset. Finally, I got the register of your ex husband or his father doesn't mean there could have been a register of this a lot earlier.

166
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But this finally reached the threshold that got his attention.

167
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: In the past you attribute sort of this I relapse because he was being pulled away. I think you're better off for your own sake really asking yourself.

168
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I ready if he gets pulled away. Am I ready. That's fair. You see how that puts his safety. I don't want to make any promises to you, Adrian that I can't keep so now keep you safe is I checked myself and make sure I'm not going to make a commitment. I can't keep

169
00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:57.210
Marianne todd: I

170
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Know my limitations. I'm going to know what I'm capable of and I'm not going to make them unless God willing, I mean, right, I'm gonna keep it.

171
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's fair. Don't we want that from the people that want to make a commitment to us. Don't make one. You can't keep

172
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, that's

173
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.740
Marianne todd: really heavy on my mind because when I would talk to them in the past, I would make all these promises.

174
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:36.240
Marianne todd: Of. Oh, I'm going to come see you and I would tell myself. I'm going to make it happen no matter what, like, I'm not going to let anything get in the way and then things would get in the way and I wouldn't be able to see him. And so I've

175
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:43.740
Marianne todd: Been very book. I don't know. It's been at the front of my mind since his dad reach out to me.

176
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:51.600
Marianne todd: Because, and I've already told him because he's asked if I come visit and they talk, you know, right now, I just don't have a reliable car.

177
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:59.970
Marianne todd: I have to build up vacation time. On top of that, and I told them, and that's what I'm going to work on and I will let you know as soon as I'm able, you know, when I be

178
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So you see how

179
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This stuff we're talking about

180
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea of how

181
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This recovery is very important. It's, it's kind of at the heart.

182
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your ability to keep your promise.

183
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if the real fight is about your commitment and persistence to your own sobriety, that if you start there, if that if that is something you can keep like what I can promise to myself is that

184
00:24:48.270 --> 00:25:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to keep pursuing this I gotta keep working on this, because then I'm available to you. I'm someone who keeps my promises. I will keep working this recovery program. I will do everything I can to to be the parent that you deserve.

185
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how is that similar of different than the way you have

186
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.300
Talked with him before.

187
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:28.470
Marianne todd: Mean, I don't know, like in the past. I never talked about anything but had to do with drug addiction like out of law. I didn't want to be honest with them about it. I didn't want to know anything about it.

188
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.700
Marianne todd: You know what I mean, it was like one of those things that I really hit

189
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, if this is it, then, then it's this honesty. This is what's different. Mm hmm.

190
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are honest, the, the, the, the sort of paradoxes here is if you're honest right then your worst fear.

191
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Could come true.

192
00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your parents right could then pursue, blah, blah, blah, blah.

193
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But you sanity today for letting him know that you love him so he doesn't have to put it in question. You did not reject him. You did not fail to fight for him.

194
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your addiction went after the high and an addict doesn't care about family. It doesn't care about the love of anyone else all it cares about is, is the high

195
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's a way that you can find a way to communicate that to him that your commitment to your recovery to really not letting that be a part of your life, letting him know you're, you are still new to this I think is fair.

196
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: New, you may want to say I've got it, I've got it licked. But you are still taking a huge dose of buprenorphine.

197
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You just get your, your feet start on the ground. We had a slip. We've got all this intense stuff in your life. He had challenges that you faced with real grace. I think that you could have an excuse to have gone off the rails. I think you you really handled it.

198
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But it would, you're, you're still in the early phase here and that can be part of it too. I will be honest with you. I'll tell you about what I'm capable of doing again and again and again. Right. That's my promise to you, son is I've gotta I've gotta say this is I'm in early recovery.

199
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Not like to hear that, though.

200
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:52.920
Marianne todd: I mean, it doesn't really bother me. Like, I think it is very you know what I mean. Yeah. Because, like, even though

201
00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:06.990
Marianne todd: Know when I think about it. Yeah, I was clean. In the past it was on Suboxone for a while and then I did it completely on my own for even longer after but and it was almost two years completely that I was clean.

202
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:16.710
Marianne todd: But at the same time, I just, there's a huge difference this time because I just wasn't facing anything then, you know, what do you mean

203
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:18.990
Marianne todd: What do you like I

204
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know what you're facing this time.

205
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:30.390
Marianne todd: Like I'm just facing everything that I've actually gone through in the past, like when it comes to especially losing Aiden.

206
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:40.020
Marianne todd: And when it comes to the way my mom really was like the times that we talked about it like I do get

207
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:48.870
Marianne todd: A little bit defensive because it was just something that I never wanted to be real about, you know what I mean.

208
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:57.900
Marianne todd: Because I've always just convinced myself that, yeah. My mom had her issues, but she was loving and so it didn't really matter, I guess, you know what I mean.

209
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:09.540
Marianne todd: And I don't know, I'm just facing a lot of things that I never used to and it's all the main things that have that led me to where I was.

210
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If the biggest change in your relationship with in his

211
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Honesty.

212
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to let you know if I'm not ready to take you want full time because I don't have enough skills because

213
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to work on learning how to be a parent. I don't know what the truth is for you. Marianne, I'm making stuff up, but I'm giving you a role play example.

214
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That Aiden. I wasn't honest with myself. I needed. I had, I had a crappy start and a lot of ways in in in in my life and I'm just now learning how to love myself how to be okay with

215
00:29:54.570 --> 00:30:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This history. I have. I've seem to have had some some trauma myself and I've been using substances to figure out how to do it.

216
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To get through my life and I'm learning how to do it. And my promises. I'm not going to make a commitment unless I've really thought it through. Okay, so that I don't let you down again. But I'm going to know my own limitations.

217
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I don't know, do you see, even though because I tell, I say, well, you just remove them right in right now, everything you would just move right in. You wouldn't give it a second thought.

218
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: As what you want, but now I'm making you really look

219
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:36.570
Hard

220
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.220
Marianne todd: Yeah.

221
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be what you want. But what would be the downside of doing that.

222
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And get a bigger one. You're like, oh my

223
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.420
Marianne todd: Yeah, I don't know.

224
00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If what this is asking you to do is know yourself, it's asking you to reflect and

225
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, would you, would you take on three more dogs right now.

226
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Puppy. Well, right. So you found that one. So why not, why not 34 puppies.

227
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.240
Marianne todd: Just because

228
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You're so cute. Why not

229
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.300
Marianne todd: Try. Q And trust me, I've tried a couple of times and bonito stop.

230
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay. And why did you stop you. Do you think

231
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:43.560
Marianne todd: We'll just because like we're at work, a lot of the times, and we already have one dog that's pain in the butt. Choose up stuff and get them to everything. And I know we got three more. It would be 20 times a nightmare.

232
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can kind of see that you don't have the time, right.

233
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So then, then that's part of the limitation. You see, now you can apply it with a two. It's like

234
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you here. I want you here that's absolute

235
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I went to

236
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Drugs, because I felt whatever your truth is I felt helpless that I couldn't solve this. I can't, I can't solve what seems this a formidable force of your family and their connections I it seemed huge so big was overwhelming and I used. I can't have that as an option. I can't

237
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to tell you, I want you here and here would look like. I would still have to work. What would that be like for you, like, that's, that's the thing. It's like, I want you to hear that's absolute. I want you to hear

238
00:32:50.820 --> 00:33:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would you want from being here. Well, what, what's your expectation beans. You are here. I'm still be gone. How many hours a day. Are you working

239
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.280
Marianne todd: Only eight hours a day.

240
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And then so those hours with a suit is being in school that would that match. Well, or would you get to see him much

241
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:15.540
I mean, I

242
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.830
Marianne todd: Don't know how to explain it like I would still get to see him.

243
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.000
How much

244
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Each hours of the day.

245
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.110
Marianne todd: Right now I don't know cuz my schedules all over the place.

246
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:36.720
Marianne todd: Was different like sometimes they weren't till 10 o'clock at night sometimes they work in the morning, it's just always back in Florida.

247
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:48.750
Marianne todd: But I just, I don't know, in my mind, I feel like that's just life that's just something we have to deal with, like, I don't know how it's ever going to change. You know what I mean.

248
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know what he knows he may have something made up in his head that you know

249
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You cut everything out, you just stay home and homeschooling or something. I have no idea.

250
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know anything about what he wants, what is right. It could be just a concept of his needing to know that you love him some kind of vulnerabilities coming up for him right now and it may not be about actually being with him. I have no idea.

251
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But this when he heard about the substance use, did you see a change in his, his demeanor with you. Did you see a shift.

252
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:41.640
Marianne todd: Well, actually, like, it was kind of weird because I had explained, but I did go through a drug addiction and I you know I explained to him how it started with pain.

253
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:48.060
Marianne todd: And I was just some of the things I've been through make it kind of hard. You know what I mean.

254
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:55.500
Marianne todd: And I had told him, like how just one thing led to another and I became reliant and I was taking more than I was supposed to

255
00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:04.500
Marianne todd: And then I had explained to him that I was in a program that was helping me and I told him I see a counselor every week. I do group every week. And he actually

256
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:14.460
Marianne todd: Got a lot more comfortable and he started to open up a lot more because with the issues that he's going through, like I felt like

257
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:27.090
Marianne todd: It made it to where he was able to relate to me. You know what I mean, like he was able to say like, Oh, hey. Like you go through that to this is what I'm going through and it was, it was really awesome.

258
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:28.500
Oh,

259
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice that it came from exactly what is this is you didn't have to make something up there might be some minimization in there can. I'm not too, too. Sure. But ultimately, there was honesty. You got to connect

260
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You could relate to each other right you've been through some stuff. This is not been an easy ride for either one of you.

261
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

262
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I feel like I have pushed you pretty hard today.

263
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:00.600
Marianne todd: A little bit.

264
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I did I pushed really hard. I wanted to see

265
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If you've given this some thought.

266
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And what what is he asking for currently once he really What's he asking for

267
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:33.120
Marianne todd: He's not asking for anything really. I think he's just trying to figure it out to and he's just trying to get comfortable and just trying to figure out whether this is going to be a permanent thing or you know what I mean, like he doesn't know either.

268
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.130
Marianne todd: So,

269
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm curious what is his father's name.

270
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.330
Donovan.

271
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder if if really it's a conversation with Don and it's this is about. Has he

272
00:36:50.040 --> 00:37:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Been enough understanding about the well being of Aden to understand that pulling the rug out is not in Aiden's best interest that does that's harmful.

273
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:16.320
Marianne todd: Honestly, I know for a fact. He doesn't seem to get that because even when he has kept me out of a flyer I begged him to be split little Ben and Aiden talk

274
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:29.370
Marianne todd: Because it's it's never been fair to them like they're brothers. They don't even know each other very well, you know what I mean. And he just didn't care. He didn't want to hear it. It was his way and that was it.

275
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So what finally got Donovan's attention. I'm a little confused. How is this finally registering for him.

276
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:50.280
Marianne todd: With all the trouble that isn't getting into and the hard time that he's having. He's starting to realize like, and what he told me as he feels like with me not being around it's giving Aiden.

277
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:59.730
Marianne todd: It's making it really hard for him, and it's affecting him on a serious level because he thinks that he is acting up because he doesn't have me around and

278
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:08.760
Marianne todd: You know what I mean. And I know the continent is will three I call them cotton I call him by his last name because that's just what I've always known him by

279
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Simon or

280
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.390
Marianne todd: I don't buy cotton.

281
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.590
Marianne todd: Okay, that

282
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.550
Last name.

283
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.410
Marianne todd: I forgot what I was saying.

284
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't think he has the insight to see. So, so it's pretty reasonable. What I was saying, which is he's going to pull the rug out again and I wanted to know if you were under the illusion.

285
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That everything's going to be Groovy and we're all going to get together and you're gonna have custom you're going to end up

286
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I got to tell you, history tends to repeat itself. It's the most predictive thing of the future.

287
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:55.440
Marianne todd: Yeah and there's a huge part of me that has that in my head still like I i know it could still happen but like at the same time, I know this is a lot different.

288
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:02.940
Marianne todd: He's never once has his dad reached out to me and asked me to be in his life like never at all.

289
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:15.840
Marianne todd: And it's just the way he talks to me now is completely different. Because every since the day that me and him had split up. He would talk to me with this anger in his voice he would put me down all the time like he was just

290
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:25.590
Marianne todd: Extremely immature every time we would talk and now he's actually talking to me like a person. He's not talking down to me. He's not being rude.

291
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:38.340
Marianne todd: And he even he's sitting here telling me he wants to bring eight and up the summer and he wants all of us to go camping and to go fishing. And then when I told him I'm going to work on getting my car, reliable and

292
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:45.060
Marianne todd: Building up some vacation time and then I told him after I do that, I'll let you know when I can come down and everything.

293
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:57.180
Marianne todd: And he's like, okay, he's like, yeah, that would be awesome. He's like, I'll let you take a reno for the weekend so you guys can have some alone time and not once have they ever what may be a work with Aiden. Not what

294
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have an interest to have a more thorough conversation about his plan to hear from cotton what like to test out your concerns. Is there anything you would want to know, to see if he's really legit. This time I hear your evidence. I heard all that this feels different.

295
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, else you would want to know if he was here. What would you say anything you would be able to in talking to him. See if he has matured.

296
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If he got more reliable.

297
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:43.380
Marianne todd: Honestly, I don't know, there's so many things that have crossed my mind with him, but I would love to just sit down and have a conversation with him and see work has said that. So there's just so many different things that come up. You know what I mean, it's just, is he

298
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.320
Marianne todd: Still looking down on me. Is he still viewing me as just this

299
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:59.670
Marianne todd: Basically piece of crap on the side of the road. You know what I mean, because that's how he's always treated me that's what he's always thought of me since we split up.

300
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:11.550
Marianne todd: And it's just basically wanting to know if he does understand what it's doing to age when he wrote some way. You know what I mean, does he understand what he's doing to our son does he understands what he's doing.

301
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:22.500
Marianne todd: To to innocent kids in this. You know what I mean, like, there is a lot of things that crossed my mind, but I would love to just sit there and pick his head about

302
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did you fall into addiction in that relationship with cotton.

303
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:35.100
Marianne todd: No I my addiction started after Aiden was taken away and everything.

304
00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Taken away heated moment he was irrational.

305
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:51.420
Marianne todd: And yeah, he literally. It was only two months old and he literally grabbed it and then ran out the door and then next thing I knew, I was at the sheriff's station talking to a CPS worker.

306
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.040
Marianne todd: What

307
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just curious what triggered that for him. Well, what did you and what you keep received was so grievous that you did.

308
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:00.900
Marianne todd: To me and

309
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:11.010
Marianne todd: When we never got along. The only reason we stayed together was because of our son, and he was just we were only

310
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:27.540
Marianne todd: 1716 when we met, something like that. And no, I was. It was right before I turned 18 cuz I got pregnant, two months into the relationship and I found out on my 18th birthday, that I was pregnant.

311
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to go check it out. Check on this chicken, make sure I'm not burning it

312
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:32.970
I'll be my page.

313
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

314
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:55.020
Marianne todd: So yeah, I was thinking like we just never really did get along and that day we had just gotten into another little petty fight, but we always gotten into

315
00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:06.390
Marianne todd: And that's when I had reached my limit. And I told them, I said, I'm done. I can't do this anymore. And one of my friends had actually came and picked me up and me and Aiden left

316
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:17.100
Marianne todd: And he had called me bawling. His eyes out begging me to come back and he's like, at least let me say bye to Aiden. Let me have a minute with him and

317
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:27.960
Marianne todd: I went back and when I got back, he had destroyed the entire house and he at first was talking to me he was begging me to stay there.

318
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:35.850
Marianne todd: And I told him I couldn't that I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't handle it was too much and Aiden been there to grow up that way.

319
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:44.550
Marianne todd: And next thing I knew that was when he grabbed Aiden and ran out. And then when I got when I had called the sheriff station.

320
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:58.050
Marianne todd: They were telling me if they hadn't called CPS yeah he was going to be charged with kidnapping and it turned out he had called CPS and he had told CPS that I had cleaned the house and that's why it was so destroyed.

321
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so do you know if he has any mental illness. Anything that you know

322
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:08.520
Marianne todd: I'm aware of, no.

323
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:27.150
Marianne todd: I mean, he was in the military, and he did get discharged because he was hurt, but nobody has ever told me what happened. I know he was over in Iraq. So I don't know if he has issues from that. Now, or I don't know anything.

324
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

325
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be curious to see

326
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If it turns out what you want is to actually have that conversation.

327
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm open to that too. So whatever it is that you need in the service of your recovery your goals, your peace of mind. All of these things are huge.

328
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of stressors and I can definitely see how they are in your benefit to you know address them through various interventions. So I can certainly justify that very easily.

329
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To do these things. So you're more than welcome to if it turns out what's underlying this is is a father, that doesn't quite get that you're in a recovery program that you that the

330
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you didn't actually do anything wrong. You are just do kids that that just work a battle and now ready for a baby and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

331
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I let's keep talking because

332
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't about addiction, it was maybe

333
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it that you didn't like about him.

334
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.730
Marianne todd: He was extremely immature and extremely rude like

335
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.480
Marianne todd: I don't know how to explain it. Like he

336
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.670
Marianne todd: He didn't know how to hold down a job at all. But it was just

337
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:18.660
Marianne todd: God, I don't know how to explain it. It was his demeanor. Like when it came to being parents like he wouldn't even get up and take care of. He

338
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:31.950
Marianne todd: Every time he would cry like it was always Marianne, your son's crying. Get up and take care of him like he had no part in doing anything whatsoever. And then he was just always

339
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.720
Marianne todd: I don't know how to explain it because it's been so long but

340
00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:57.900
Marianne todd: It was just always rude and mature comments not taking things serious. You know what I mean, like, and then we actually got back together after all of that because he told me that the only way I was going to be in my son's life is that if I was with him. And if I married him.

341
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.730
Marianne todd: So we ended up going over to Reno and we got married.

342
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:14.160
Marianne todd: And it was a last minute thing. I mean, I remember having resentment towards them, because my mom was bawling her eyes out that she wasn't going to be there and everything else and

343
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:34.170
Marianne todd: Then when he joined the military. He was getting 1500 every two weeks, only because of the fact that he had a wife and kids because they give you housing allowance. They give you family allowance all kinds of extra money for that and he would send us $400 a month to live off of

344
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.090
Marianne todd: And then

345
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:48.840
Marianne todd: Every time I would call him once he was out of a school, he would tell me I was wasting his time, I was wasting his minutes and he was out of strip clubs every night just blowing his money there.

346
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:55.980
Marianne todd: And then that's when it finally drew the line with me and I left him and then they rotate in a way for me and

347
00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.450
As even

348
00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: As even largely raised by Cotton's parents

349
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:04.470
Marianne todd: My son.

350
00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:11.700
Marianne todd: Yeah, he the whole time. His Dad was in the military, he was being raised by his grandparents.

351
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe it's about their opinion of you maybe it's about

352
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Something going on in there. Okay, I'm starting I'm getting some more pieces. This is helpful. So how can I, how can I help. What can I do, what would you like

353
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:39.750
Marianne todd: I don't know. Because what I wanted on a today was to just

354
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:51.090
Marianne todd: Be able to know how to talk to aid more about my addiction and to help get him into counseling with me and I got that. So,

355
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you want to schedule something with me and something comes up, just let me know and we'll create some time.

356
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.780
Okay.

357
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. This must be exciting.

358
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.930
Marianne todd: Yes, it is very exciting.

359
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Schedule another time to meet

360
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.830

Gwenevere Abriel: Years. O. D. What is your work schedule this week.

363
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:48.720
Marianne todd: Oh, crap. You know what, I don't even know. Because my phone being broken because we have an app on there that we look at her schedule on and I can't get into it because my phone's really really broken.

364
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you going to know when to go in tomorrow.

365
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:58.680
Marianne todd: I'm gonna have to go in when bonito goes to work and I'm gonna have to ask one of the CSM to let me know when I work tomorrow.

366
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:09.630
Marianne todd: And then after that, I'm going to have to wait till I clock in to get on the computer to see when what my full schedule is because they won't let you login unless you're on the clock.

367
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What time can you let me know your schedule like

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:18.000
Marianne todd: Probably by six o'clock. My time cuz bonito goes in at
