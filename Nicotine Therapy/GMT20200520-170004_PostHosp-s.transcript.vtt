5
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.850
Helena Rouhe: I'm double checking to see if Margaret Johnstone, a nurse practitioner who specializes in mental health that she's going to be able to join us. She may have had to

6
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.030
Helena Rouhe: Meet with another patient due to an emergency. So we will do our best to touch base and get this process started. And then we can kind of go from there.

7
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:26.070
Helena Rouhe: Okay, do you have any questions, concerns for me. Otherwise, I'll kind of jump in with just kind of what brought you to us and get a little bit of history and see what we can do to help

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.320
Laura Sanchez: Um, well, I wanted to

12
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.720
Laura Sanchez: Get help for depression and anxiety.

13
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.160
Okay.

14
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.640
Helena Rouhe: And have you experienced those kinds of feelings before

15
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.930
Mm hmm.

16
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.400
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, this is just the first time that I'm reaching out

17
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.570
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so what was the first time you started experiencing those ideas, feelings of depression and anxiety.

18
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.320
Laura Sanchez: Well, I'm 28 now and I was 18 I feel like I i went two or three years, feeling this way.

19
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.930
Laura Sanchez: Okay, then I kind of, you know, suppress the feelings me, but I feel like now for the past, maybe

20
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.610
Laura Sanchez: Six or seven months, I've been kind of experiencing those same feelings, but just

21
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.270
Laura Sanchez: Unable to shake the sun is

22
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:51.960
Helena Rouhe: When you first experienced those feelings had anything. It doesn't have to be that there's any kind of event, but was there anything going on in your life that was kind of antagonizing those feelings were you changing school or anything going on with family or work environment.

23
00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.440
Laura Sanchez: Well, when I was 18 i think i definitely struggled with college okay but like the transition

24
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.190
And

25
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.410
Laura Sanchez: I was in culinary school. So that was really stressful for me.

26
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.240
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, and

27
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.420
Laura Sanchez: So I fast forward to now I feel like

28
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:26.190
Laura Sanchez: I'm unemployed, because of the corona. I'm feeling extra lonely and I went through a breakup last month.

29
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.680
Laura Sanchez: But I do feel like the breakup and the relationship. I had a lot to do with with the ceilings.

30
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.520
Okay.

31
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.750
Helena Rouhe: Is this your first significant relationship or if you had other significant relationships in the past.

32
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.720
Laura Sanchez: About other significant relationships. Yes.

33
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:58.290
Helena Rouhe: Okay. And when you have Breakups are things didn't work out in those relationships to just you kind of go through something similar. It doesn't sound like it sounds like you were able to kind of whether those storms little differently.

34
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.410
Laura Sanchez: No, sorry. No, um,

35
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.450
Laura Sanchez: I, I think I kind of just like I said try to just surprise.

36
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.580
Laura Sanchez: I guess just

37
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.820
Laura Sanchez: overthinking the situation.

38
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.420
Helena Rouhe: And I just jumped into other relationships.

39
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.960
I guess.

40
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.150
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, just to not feel like I have to deal with.

41
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.210
Laura Sanchez: But just going through a breakup. I, I didn't go. I didn't do that.

42
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:39.570
Helena Rouhe: Okay. So do you think that you've been kind of doing some different levels of distraction. Just kind of keeping yourself busy from one thing to the next that you don't have to necessarily deal with your feelings.

43
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:50.250
Laura Sanchez: Here and maybe not working and not really reaching out to friends or talking to people mean kind of just sit and think about all these thoughts that I have

44
00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:00.270
Helena Rouhe: So was there a time period when you would reach out to friends and talk to people. Okay, here's Miss Margaret, she's going to join us here in just a minute.

45
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.140
Okay.

46
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.310
margaret johnstone: Hello.

47
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.260
Helena Rouhe: Hi, Mark, how are you

48
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.760
margaret johnstone: How are you doing,

49
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:22.710
Helena Rouhe: Good. We have Laura here with us today and Laura and I were just touching base. She's kind of struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety. She's just kind of giving me a little bit of a rundown of our history.

50
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:33.420
Helena Rouhe: As first started showing up to 28 now which is first started showing up when she was 18 and she's recognized the last six to seven months. Thanks, have

51
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:47.340
Helena Rouhe: Or maybe eight months. Sorry, that things have gotten a little bit more ramped up for her and that she is not necessarily doing a good job of reaching out to friends and family to kind of acknowledge her feelings.

52
00:05:48.060 --> 00:06:00.180
Helena Rouhe: She wasn't calling every school and is currently not working to to co bid. She was also in a significant relationship that broke up about a month ago. Is that right, Lord.

53
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.670
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and how long was that relationship.

54
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.920
Laura Sanchez: Um, two years.

55
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.290
Helena Rouhe: Two years. Okay. And so what I was just asking Laura as you're joining us Margaret is

56
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:23.460
Helena Rouhe: Laura. Have you had an opportunity in the past to kind of reach out to people when you struggle, then you feel like you're not doing a good job of that now, or do you feel like maybe that was always something that's a bit of a challenge for you. Some of us are not good at reaching out

57
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.020
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, that was always a challenge for me. I

58
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:38.760
Laura Sanchez: I'd kind of lost touch with a lot of my friends, you know, through the years, so I didn't feel like I had someone specific to reach out to, um,

59
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.240
Okay.

60
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:51.180
Helena Rouhe: Was there any particular reason. I mean we grow up and people move and they go to different schools and they do different things. Is it more along that lines or was there anything that yeah

61
00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:05.070
Helena Rouhe: Okay. And so in the past or for any reason. Did you ever seek out a therapist or counselor or a mental health practitioner of any kind.

62
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:16.470
Laura Sanchez: Of when I was 18 my warm, sign me up for therapist here locally, and I was seeing her for about two months and maybe I just didn't

63
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.270
Laura Sanchez: Feel like she was a right person for me so I kind of

64
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.490
Helena Rouhe: Fit. Yeah. Did you ever take any medicine for your

65
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.060
Laura Sanchez: No, she never prescribed me with anything.

66
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:44.100
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so just as an FYI. And the reason why we have two of us joining you here as opposed to just you and I meeting is that as a therapist is a licensed therapist. I don't have the ability to prescribe because I'm not a medical provider.

67
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:57.780
Helena Rouhe: But Margaret Johnstone isn't medical provider and she has a specialty of working with people who struggle with mental health issues. And so that's why both of us being here. I can kind of get a sense of history and a little bit of what's

68
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.770
Helena Rouhe: You know what you're struggling with, and then Margaret can kind of speak to it more from the medical side and

69
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:18.150
Helena Rouhe: Identify you know possible options. They're just, you know, further clarify. So that's why why we have two people here. I know it's kind of strange like, what is going on all these people were going to the janitor. Next, like what

70
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.900
margaret johnstone: Is happening here.

71
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.380
Helena Rouhe: This is it. This is our group, nobody else's joining

72
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.460
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so

73
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:33.510
margaret johnstone: Hello, Laura. Tell me a little bit about your depression. Oh, have you ever had any suicidal thoughts.

74
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.300
Laura Sanchez: Um, yes I have.

75
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.170
I'm

76
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.730
Laura Sanchez: Like I said, it was around the period when I turned 18

77
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.660
Till around

78
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.660
Laura Sanchez: The time that I turned 20

79
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:53.610
Laura Sanchez: But I kind of learned to suppress suppress the feelings or suppressing these sad or depressive

80
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.240
Thoughts

81
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.460
Laura Sanchez: But I feel

82
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.060
Laura Sanchez: That I bottled up those feelings for a long time.

83
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.430
Laura Sanchez: And just recently I decided to

84
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.310
Laura Sanchez: Put a vested Omar because I did have suicidal thoughts.

85
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.470
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, I felt like

86
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.460
Laura Sanchez: I should reach out to to get help. Before I went through with something

87
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.340
margaret johnstone: That was really good decision.

88
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.240
margaret johnstone: Really good. Yeah. And did it help you staying there.

89
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.920
Laura Sanchez: Um,

90
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:38.460
Laura Sanchez: I liked going to groups and talking about how to deal with stress. But I just felt like it was extra lonely.

91
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.830
margaret johnstone: Yeah, pretty isolated.

92
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.370
margaret johnstone: Yeah, did they start you on any medications there.

93
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.730
Laura Sanchez: Um, yes. I started Prozac.

94
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.770
Laura Sanchez: 20 milligrams on

95
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.590
Laura Sanchez: This drill, but I don't take that daily

96
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.240
margaret johnstone: Okay, and the visceral during our did they tell you to use that

97
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.190
Laura Sanchez: Whenever I feel

98
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.290
Laura Sanchez: Like thoughts if I'm getting too much anxiety.

99
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.010
margaret johnstone: tinting

100
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:05.880
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm.

101
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.910
Laura Sanchez: So you've been. I've been. Clean okay so far for the past week.

102
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.170
margaret johnstone: That's great.

103
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.130
Laura Sanchez: That's great.

104
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.600
margaret johnstone: But then the visceral will help it will help you feel calmer.

105
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.240
margaret johnstone: Yeah, it might make you a little bit tired though.

106
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.950
margaret johnstone: How are you sleeping right now.

107
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.130
Laura Sanchez: Um, it's hard for me to fall asleep.

108
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:39.480
Laura Sanchez: And I'm also a light sleeper. So I haven't really gotten much sleep since I left on this little more, especially in there. I was taking Prozac, but I just think it was just noise in there was no

109
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.380
Laura Sanchez: I just haven't been sleeping correctly.

110
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.930
margaret johnstone: And how many hours do you think you got last night.

111
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:56.220
Laura Sanchez: Fell asleep poke around 1am and I woke up at seven. So, about six hours. So actually, that was, that was a good night.

112
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:05.880
margaret johnstone: Okay, well, that's the minimum you need you need cold. Yeah, because your, your brain heals. When you're sleeping and you really want to get a good night's rest and feel rested.

113
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:06.720
Laura Sanchez: And they're

114
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:14.430
margaret johnstone: Really good for your brain because your brains been under tremendous stress. Yeah. So are you having any of the suicidal thoughts now.

115
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.870
Laura Sanchez: No, not since I left the studio in LA.

116
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.970
Laura Sanchez: Or not since I got there. So I've just been surrounding myself.

117
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.120
Laura Sanchez: With my family and I really supported

118
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:34.020
margaret johnstone: Good. That's a good rule to stay around supportive people. Okay, tell me a little bit. How about

119
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.370
margaret johnstone: Panic attacks, things like that. You have a history.

120
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:39.930
Laura Sanchez: Well,

121
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.680
Laura Sanchez: Panic attacks. I've only had them maybe two or three times in my life.

122
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:59.520
Laura Sanchez: And I feel like the last time was last Thursday. And I feel like that was caused by kind of just being alone and drinking alcohol.

123
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.240
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm.

124
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.700
Laura Sanchez: And I feel like instead of relaxing with alcohol just kind of went a little manic

125
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.690
margaret johnstone: Can you tell me how much alcohol, you're drinking

126
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:24.330
Laura Sanchez: Um, well, since I've been unemployed. I've been drinking almost every day about a glass of wine a day or sometimes I drink like two or three margaritas a day.

127
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.420
Laura Sanchez: Just depends on, on the day

128
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.570
margaret johnstone: So you have some alcohol every day. But how many times a week. Would you have two or three margaritas.

129
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.480
Laura Sanchez: Oh, like once or once

130
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.320
Laura Sanchez: Just one.

131
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.270
margaret johnstone: So in any alcohol, since you got out of the hospital.

132
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:51.090
Laura Sanchez: No, they didn't tell me not to drink, but I just feel like it's the right thing to do, to just kind of lay off alcohol for a little bit. I

133
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.770
margaret johnstone: Think you're very smart.

134
00:12:54.090 --> 00:13:01.140
margaret johnstone: Now I'm going to tell you if you can you really need to lay off alcohol there. The Prozac will not work if you're taking drinking

135
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.000
margaret johnstone: For x that it can alcohol will counteract the effects of the Prozac.

136
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:12.270
margaret johnstone: Okay, and it and one drink when you're taking Prozac will feel like two or three

137
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.830
Laura Sanchez: Oh, OK.

138
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.150
margaret johnstone: stronger effect on you and it counteracts the on it and I depressant effect.

139
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:27.300
margaret johnstone: If you can, I would I would stop drinking for a while and consider long term very limited use

140
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.140
Okay.

141
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.940
Laura Sanchez: I can do that.

142
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.980
margaret johnstone: Great, great.

143
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.660
margaret johnstone: Um,

144
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.690
margaret johnstone: So tell me a little bit about

145
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.390
margaret johnstone: Your family you're you're you're staying with your family now.

146
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:52.800
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, um, I was actually staying at my ex boyfriend sounds, um, for two months, but now I'm back home.

147
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.830
Laura Sanchez: Because of the brick go

148
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:10.320
Laura Sanchez: I'm comfortable or I am I have my own room. I, I have a good dynamic with my sisters. I have three sisters. Um, but they're all one of them works for Amazon. So I don't really see her at all.

149
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.570
Laura Sanchez: Lily. The one I'm the middle child who went after me.

150
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.810
Laura Sanchez: She's the one that helped me through this and she

151
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:26.940
Laura Sanchez: She went to this little more, and she's also on medication for depression and anxiety as well.

152
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:45.390
Laura Sanchez: So I have the closest bond with her and have a younger sister who is 17 and she's still home and you know doing schoolwork. So, but it's, I feel like there's a large gap between us in in each. So I'm not super cluster.

153
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.690
Laura Sanchez: My dad works pretty much every day.

154
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.820
Laura Sanchez: I see him the afternoons, but I do enjoy spending a few

155
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.850
Laura Sanchez: Hours talking to him.

156
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:04.680
Laura Sanchez: And my mom. I think she is one of those sources of my anxiety because I'm

157
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:27.150
Laura Sanchez: Just living with her has been really hard to grow up. She's, she's a hoarder and living in that environment is just is really stressful and she also has a daycare. So there's always kids here. You know, it's always noisy.

158
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:36.480
Laura Sanchez: So, and her and I just haven't really gotten along for my adult life since

159
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:44.550
Laura Sanchez: She's very Catholic and she always pushes she's always pushed out on all of us, but

160
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.670
Laura Sanchez: It's, I don't know. It's just a different. We're just two different people.

161
00:15:50.910 --> 00:16:01.050
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm. Yeah. So sounds like there's a lot of activity going on in your home. And it's not a a peaceful, quiet place UK

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.980

Laura Sanchez: A little over a year now.

174
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:38.280
Laura Sanchez: And it's

175
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.700

margaret johnstone: And you're breathing problems.

Laura Sanchez: I've never broken any bones.

189
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.700
margaret johnstone: Not knowing

190
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.540
margaret johnstone: Or a healthy girl. Do you have a primary care doctor you go to

191
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:37.710
Laura Sanchez: Um, I think. So the one that was assigned to me when I signed up for Blue Shield.

192
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.880
margaret johnstone: Mm hmm. Good.

193
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.560
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, good.

194
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.980
margaret johnstone: For you have a doctor if you have any medical issues come up

195
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.710
margaret johnstone: Yes to and you have go to the dentist. You follow up with dental care at all.

196
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:57.630
Laura Sanchez: Times at the dentist was last year before my dental plan expired.

197
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.790
Laura Sanchez: So I need to find a new dentist, you

198
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.200
Look good

199
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.820
margaret johnstone: And how about glasses. Do you wear glasses are having problems.

200
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.680
Laura Sanchez: I do wear glasses specifically at night to dry.

201
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.690
Night.

202
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:29.550
margaret johnstone: Okay. Sometimes the antidepressants can make your vision, a little blurry. Sometimes that goes away after you first started, sometimes it doesn't. So you may need to get your eyes checked later on if you stay on the the Prozac.

203
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.600
Laura Sanchez: Or no way i

204
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:40.200
Laura Sanchez: Can do that, um, I was going to ask. It may, it may be, I can take melatonin because I have trouble sleeping.

205
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:46.350
Laura Sanchez: Um, when I was destroyed, Omar. They gave me Benadryl and that helped a little bit

206
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.800
Laura Sanchez: But I don't really want to take Benadryl kind of just want to do like a healthier option.

207
00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:00.420
margaret johnstone: Well, I would try some melatonin. You can take between three and 10 milligrams

208
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.250
margaret johnstone: Okay, you want to take it a few hours before bedtime, actually, because

209
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.380
margaret johnstone: You need it to kick in.

210
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:19.320
margaret johnstone: Okay. And sometimes that plus the antidepressant should actually help you sleep better to you should notice your sleep regulates while you're taking the Prozac any side effects from the Prozac at all.

211
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.390
Laura Sanchez: Um,

212
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.690
Laura Sanchez: I just noticed that I'm a little tired.

213
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.490
Laura Sanchez: Other than that, no, not really.

214
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:35.820
Laura Sanchez: Okay, I haven't noticed any anything major besides sleeping being tired.

215
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:42.060
margaret johnstone: Okay. And so what you should notice is that the tarnish to decrease that feeling also

216
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.230
Laura Sanchez: Okay.

217
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.060
margaret johnstone: To feel your energies. Okay.

218
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.560
margaret johnstone: Tony, you said your sister was on on antidepressant.

219
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:58.050
Laura Sanchez: You know which one she takes she's on three different kinds. She actually told me two days ago.

220
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.950
Laura Sanchez: At not, I can't remember which one, but she's tried three different kind

221
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.950
Laura Sanchez: Because Prozac and another one didn't work for her.

222
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:19.920
margaret johnstone: Okay, okay. Um, so you want to pay attention to make sure this Prozac is working for you because it sounds like you're thinking is pretty clear right now and you're not having any suicidal thoughts.

223
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.580
margaret johnstone: Right. And how would you, how would you say your mood is right now.

224
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:35.670
Laura Sanchez: Well, today. Welcome, a little startled. Um, I don't know if that's a side effect from from any of the medication, but when I wake up I kind of wake up alarmed and

225
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.760
Laura Sanchez: A little anxious. So then, kind of in the morning. I just felt a little off.

226
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:47.730
Laura Sanchez: Mm hmm. But now, talking to you. I feel like I'm okay. I'm I'm

227
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.830
Laura Sanchez: Feel like

228
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.930
Laura Sanchez: I'm happy to be having a conversation right now.

229
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.310
margaret johnstone: Good.

230
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.020
margaret johnstone: I'm happy to talk to you too.

231
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:08.490
margaret johnstone: Yeah, yeah. And it's hard to tell sometimes. So, on a scale from like one to 1010 being the best day of your life and one mean the worst.

232
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.620
margaret johnstone: Put yourself right now.

233
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.870
Laura Sanchez: I'm like, have sex.

234
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.190
Laura Sanchez: Okay, yeah.

235
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.420
Laura Sanchez: I'm doing a little

236
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:16.950
Laura Sanchez: Okay, yeah.

237
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:32.280
margaret johnstone: And then see if you can find out what your sisters taking that's working for her, too, because there's a genetic piece to all of these medications and so it's good to know what helps other people in your family.

238
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.940
margaret johnstone: And your family have any mental health issues.

239
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.180
Laura Sanchez: No, I think my mom needs some therapy, but she hasn't been diagnosed with anything.

240
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:52.320
Laura Sanchez: She hasn't seen topic know besides my sister Lillian she's diagnosed with I believe seasonal depression and anxiety.

241
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.820
Laura Sanchez: I feel like hers is pretty soon, fear and anxiety.

242
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.410
margaret johnstone: Okay. And anybody in your family ever have any issues with alcohol or drugs.

243
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:05.880
No.

244
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.310
margaret johnstone: Okay. And besides the alcohol. Are you using your. Have you used any other drugs.

245
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.000
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, I was smoking marijuana every day.

246
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.390
Laura Sanchez: For the past

247
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.670
Laura Sanchez: Year or so.

248
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.990
Laura Sanchez: But I've been smoking since I was 18 okay

249
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.510
margaret johnstone: Are you smoking now.

250
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.330
Laura Sanchez: No. I'VE BEEN SOBER

251
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.390
Laura Sanchez: For me marijuana for about

252
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.550
Laura Sanchez: Three weeks now.

253
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.770
margaret johnstone: Okay, good.

254
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.730
margaret johnstone: Because again, that can interfere with your mood and interfere with with the anti depressant.

255
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.690
Laura Sanchez: Yeah.

256
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.160
margaret johnstone: A very, very careful.

257
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.910
margaret johnstone: Right, adding any other medications in

258
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.380
margaret johnstone: So right now, how would you say your anxieties.

259
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:02.820
Laura Sanchez: I'm like I said in the morning. I felt a little anxious right now. It's like a two. It's

260
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:15.300
Laura Sanchez: To be honest, it's kind of because this is new for me those zoom calls and because it's a little noisy outside my room like a two. Yeah, that's

261
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.110
That's good.

262
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.410
margaret johnstone: Okay, um,

263
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.160
margaret johnstone: halina. Do you have other questions. Thanks.

264
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:32.580
Helena Rouhe: I think what I would like to know, Laura is I understand your concerns about your living environment and I'm want to be respectful and

265
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:41.220
Helena Rouhe: I think sounds like you need to get out of that relationship. So it's good that you made that choice and that you changed your living room environment as a result of that, and

266
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:52.440
Helena Rouhe: Sometimes we stay in things a little bit longer than we want to just because we don't want to go back to other situations and maybe that was part of the stress that you were managing before. Yeah.

267
00:23:52.860 --> 00:24:07.200
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. So what are your options in terms of living environment. Thankfully air families kind of taking you in, you have a place to land, but it doesn't sound like that's kind of an ideal spot for you to spend

268
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.280
Yeah.

269
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:20.970
Laura Sanchez: It's definitely not the place I want to be, to be honest, I was a lot more comfortable staying at my ex boyfriend, because it's just him and his mom and you know she talked me in

270
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:42.630
Laura Sanchez: And it was quite there. And I liked it. It was in a private community gated community and I do eventually want to get my own place or move out with with one of my sisters. But as of right now, I'm unemployed and my income isn't stable.

271
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:49.230
Laura Sanchez: So, for the time being, I'm trying to just kind of make the best out of be being back home.

272
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:57.690
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Do you have any other family members or friends that you feel comfortable enough to maybe look into that option.

273
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:04.170
Helena Rouhe: I don't think it sounds like a good idea for you to consider the ex boyfriend in that situation.

274
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:14.550
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, I'm trying. I that I think that was one of the main reason why I spiral a little bit so I blocked him.

275
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.870
Laura Sanchez: I blocked his number. I just don't want to have contact with them. Yeah.

276
00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.160
Helena Rouhe: Sounds like a good choice.

277
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.010
Laura Sanchez: Yeah I know if I do, I would go back

278
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.960
Laura Sanchez: So I have been talking to one of my friends and she suggested that I move in with her.

279
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:39.780
Laura Sanchez: But we haven't kind of talked about the details. So I have to have a conversation with her about that.

280
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.080
Helena Rouhe: Oh, good for you that you blocked your ex. You know what's done is done. Let's move on. I think that was a really

281
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.850
Helena Rouhe: A choice and good awareness.

282
00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:57.600
Helena Rouhe: In terms of this friend. What's your vibe about her. She kind of she likes to keep things clean and put things together. She a little bit of a messy girl.

283
00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:06.030
Laura Sanchez: No, she's actually super clean. I live when I was 18 it's just she herself.

284
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.370
Laura Sanchez: She lost her boyfriend to lung cancer.

285
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:20.730
Laura Sanchez: Late last early last year and she's going through her own personal depression and

286
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:28.230
Laura Sanchez: That's all we kind of gave each other space because you know we understood that we were both

287
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:35.010
Laura Sanchez: In a dark place. And we were together, we would kind of just always just drink or smoke or

288
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.350
Laura Sanchez: Or try to escape our feelings. So we don't know if it's a good idea.

289
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:48.510
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, maybe not such a great idea. I mean, on some level, right, it would be nice to have your own space and be together and be supportive. But if you

290
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:58.860
Helena Rouhe: If you have a history of kind of spiraling not in good spaces, you probably need to be a little bit stronger, both individually before you would spend

291
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.160
Helena Rouhe: Significant time together again in the future.

292
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:15.750
Helena Rouhe: Sounds like you've got really good instincts about paying attention to what's good for you. What's not necessarily good for you. So I would certainly recommend you stay connected to your friend, maybe that's not a good. Maybe there's a reason why you guys been like

293
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.780
Helena Rouhe: Maybe we shouldn't be living together.

294
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.680
Laura Sanchez: Yeah.

295
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:31.440
Helena Rouhe: What about any other kind of friends, or maybe an extended family member who you could even like rent a room from or even if it was just to do chores around the house to kind of just give you

296
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.470
Helena Rouhe: Not necessarily move out but just have like a different space to be in for a while.

297
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.250
Laura Sanchez: No, um, my parents.

298
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.810
Laura Sanchez: Are were immigrants here.

299
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:57.660
Laura Sanchez: So I have a short. I mean, I'm sorry. I have a small family. You're so all of my there's there's just not. No, no, when it can think of. Okay.

300
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:11.790
Helena Rouhe: So is there a way for you to kind of carve out a little bit of a quieter space in your current situation so that you don't have to kind of have all that shenanigans.

301
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.130
Helena Rouhe: Going on in your head and and

302
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.690
Helena Rouhe: And and around to all the time.

303
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.180
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, I've actually kind of had this conversation with my dad so keep it.

304
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.250
Laura Sanchez: Up the canopy outside

305
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:33.720
Laura Sanchez: Oh yeah, it's, it's a little bit like cluttered because like I said my mom's a hoarder. But I'm trying to clean it up and just kind of making my own space outside

306
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:41.760
Helena Rouhe: I like is it okay so is it kind of like a 10 like a football 10 or is it a hard world.

307
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:52.350
Laura Sanchez: No, it's kind of like a patio with me just had. I'm not sure what it's called but it has like a, like, tape the strip on top.

308
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.450
Laura Sanchez: Okay. Mm hmm. And

309
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.140
Helena Rouhe: Is it

310
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:59.250
Helena Rouhe: Are you staying out there full time or just kind of during the day. Okay.

311
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:04.020
Laura Sanchez: Oh, no, no. During the day, I have my own room here and my

312
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.820
Laura Sanchez: I have my room organized and I'm here. Most of the time, but I like to

313
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.660
Helena Rouhe: Eat I

314
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:18.210
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, so he built that for me so I can spend some a little, little alone time out there. It's a little bit off to the side of the house, so it's less

315
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.930
Helena Rouhe: But sounds like your mom at some point, kind of abated that space with some stuff.

316
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.430
Laura Sanchez: Yeah, the whole house or outside of my room. Yes.

317
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.690
Helena Rouhe: But. And what about that canopy space is there is there stuff.

318
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.830
Helena Rouhe: In that space or

319
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.650
Laura Sanchez: I'm working on cleaning it out and just

320
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:43.680
Helena Rouhe: When you, when you move it. Can you move it to a place where it's not going to find its way back in your cannabis space like

321
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:56.220
Laura Sanchez: Well, we'll see. I hope not. I think I can make it work. And she's respect for me trying to better myself. So she's, she's trying her best. I know she is even though

322
00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:14.580
Helena Rouhe: Not much. I know she sounds like anxiety runs in your family certainly kind of managing mood stuff and I'm sure I don't have to tell you this but hoarding is certainly a form of managing that and even and they're kind of trapped in their own existence. So

323
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:14.940
Laura Sanchez: Yeah.

324
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.170
Helena Rouhe: It sounds like you're very empathetic and understanding person, which is fantastic but it is hard to live in those situations. So, yeah.

325
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:35.340
Helena Rouhe: If you can carve out those spaces, literally, so that you can have those spaces. And I think if you can be outside when you're outside or the kids around you or are they in a different area.

326
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:53.220
Laura Sanchez: Um, yes they are outside New me a lot of them are babies so they mainly stay indoors, but the others are outside playing which I understand. And I like the kids, the kids aren't really a problem with their kids.

327
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:58.320
Helena Rouhe: And they're loud. Yeah, right. So can you kind of set up a little bit of a

328
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:07.200
Helena Rouhe: Yes, that's exactly the word I was going to use and then it felt like maybe that was going to be a little harsh, but yeah. Can we kind of put them

329
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.190
Helena Rouhe: Up.

330
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.130
Helena Rouhe: A little bit of a no go zone.

331
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:17.460
Laura Sanchez: Maybe, definitely. I can maybe go like a little fence at Home Depot or something. I

332
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.230
Helena Rouhe: Believe in

333
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.560
Helena Rouhe: Something that's kind of solid so that they're not like

334
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:27.060
Helena Rouhe: Peering through those little spots. What are you doing over there. What's going on right

335
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.410
Laura Sanchez: There super noisy and they live around me too, but

336
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:36.630
Laura Sanchez: My, my dad's pretty open with me, transforming that area to whatever

337
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.980
Helena Rouhe: So maybe you guys can work on that being a bit of a project so that you can have

338
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:46.230
Helena Rouhe: Your own space where the kids are in your space you have some privacy and

339
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.810
Helena Rouhe: You can either be outside when it's

340
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.800
Helena Rouhe: When it's nice enough to be outside and inside when you need to be inside

341
00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:01.950
Helena Rouhe: Yes. Okay, so I would really advocate for you to do that. It's important when we're feeling overwhelmed by things to start taking

342
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:12.450
Helena Rouhe: A little bit of our lives back a little bit of ownership and and where we can. And I think you have a really good sense of kind of where you're at, but I

343
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:24.090
Helena Rouhe: Think it would be important for you to start kind of being a little more firm about this is what my schedule needs to be. I need to eat at this time, keep myself hydrated and

344
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:34.560
Helena Rouhe: Not taking substances and and have a safe space to be in and with the plan that you're going to start, you know, looking to see what your options are once

345
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:45.210
Helena Rouhe: Some of the restrictions in the world, start lifting start moving around, or do you have some ideas about getting a job or do you have some places to look, things like that.

346
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.670
Laura Sanchez: Um, well, right now I'm

347
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.900
Laura Sanchez: hoping I get my original job.

348
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.010
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

349
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.870
Laura Sanchez: It was for a general contractor. But I think his plan was to closes doors and

350
00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:03.780
Laura Sanchez: Move and retire to Chile or in July. So I'm not sure what's gonna

351
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.070
Helena Rouhe: You know when I moved to Chile.

352
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:11.100
Laura Sanchez: That's the only non he tested it and I have a good relationship with my boss but

353
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.030
Laura Sanchez: I don't know.

354
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.050
Yeah.

355
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:26.130
Laura Sanchez: So if that doesn't work out, one of my neighbors who works for Costco and said, they're always hiring. But right now to be completely honest, I'm, I'm scared to go outside. I'm scared to like

356
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.940
Laura Sanchez: go grocery shopping. Sometimes it's it's it

357
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.220
Laura Sanchez: Brings me a lot of anxiousness and

358
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.700
Laura Sanchez: Okay, and just being around a lot of people is

359
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:36.870
Laura Sanchez: Something that

360
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.250
Laura Sanchez: You. Yeah.

361
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:53.610
Helena Rouhe: That's fair. I think it's okay for you to take a couple of weeks to just kind of let the medicine kick in and get you stable. And do you have any outside clinicians that you're going to be working with. Are you okay with working with us.

362
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.600
Laura Sanchez: I don't, and you're working with both

363
00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:04.500
Helena Rouhe: Okay. So Margaret has a group on Fridays at 10am and we would have you join that group and then

364
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:18.720
Helena Rouhe: If the person who helps lead that group is Serena and she's lovely and I think that the two of you would get along really well. So she would work with you in terms of individual therapy and kind of just working on coping skills.

365
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:30.870
Helena Rouhe: You know, just the stuff that I've been talking about, like, let's make your life a little more user friendly for you and then start creating some small goals that feel manageable and then kind of build from there.

366
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:44.970
Helena Rouhe: Okay, and then Margaret will work with you in terms of medicine and and how your overall feeling medically and chime in. I'm sure on how you can manage your mood and all of that. Does that sound like it would be a good plan for you.

367
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:53.130
Helena Rouhe: Yes. Okay, great. Mark, do you want to start this Friday or would you like her to start in a week. What do you think

368
00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:12.180
margaret johnstone: I think about a week because the Prozac slow acting. Okay. But I want you to pay attention to your sleep. How many hours you're getting. And if the melatonin and helps or not, and also find out the names of the drugs, your sisters taking WHICH ONES SHE FINDS really helpful.

369
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.040
Laura Sanchez: Okay. All right.

370
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.600
Laura Sanchez: Okay. Sounds good. Well, I can email on for ya grip on Friday.

371
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:27.480
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, so I am I'm letting RJ know right now she's the person you've been working with as far as getting going with our program and then

372
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:36.930
Helena Rouhe: We may have you just for the practice of it. Start group this Friday. If we've got other people going just to get us to the habit of joining group.

373
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:46.350
Helena Rouhe: And then you can let Margaret know if there any updates that you have as far as your sisters meds and all that kind of stuff when we're a group we have

374
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.850
Helena Rouhe: At the most 10 people in group, but typically it's more like eight

375
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:58.230
Helena Rouhe: And maybe a leaf would be a smaller group because this group is just getting going. And people do share kind of how things are going for them.

376
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:07.020
Helena Rouhe: What their medications are doing from them. We share that at a group level because we expect that people are going to keep what happens in group confidential.

377
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:18.060
Helena Rouhe: And I also think that it's helpful when you're meeting with people who are have similar struggles that you kind of hear what goes well for them and what doesn't go well for them because I think we learn from each other about

378
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:33.330
Helena Rouhe: Different coping skills and it's helpful to understand that you're not alone and kind of like an Aurora. I know it can feel a little bit lonely, but sometimes there's some comfort knowing that you're not by yourself in these struggles, did you experience that when you went to

379
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:34.740
Helena Rouhe: Bora.

380
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:40.440
Laura Sanchez: Um, yeah, I just feel like I didn't relate to anyone specifically

381
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:45.630
Laura Sanchez: There. Um, but I liked hearing everybody out and I like okay

382
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.190
Laura Sanchez: You know, train young

383
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:51.240
Laura Sanchez: I did. I liked talking to other people about their issues.

384
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.610
Helena Rouhe: So the good news is, is that you don't have day in day out with these people. It's just a group

385
00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:09.540
Helena Rouhe: It's one hour week and you can kind of hear what their things are what's going on for them. And then what's going on for you. But then that's why we do the individual sessions so that you have more one on one time. That would be something you would do is Serena so

386
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.470
Helena Rouhe: And that'll be on a different day than Friday because we try and keep that spread out.

387
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:22.200
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so I'll have our Jane reach out to you, and she'll follow up with you and why they're start group this Friday or next Friday and

388
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:31.740
Helena Rouhe: That's kind of our program. Do you have any other questions or concerns for us. Anything else you feel like, hey, now that we're talking, there's this thing I should show you

389
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.680
Laura Sanchez: No, not really. I'm

390
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.540
Laura Sanchez: I think, like I said, it's just

391
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:45.000
Laura Sanchez: A little bit hard for me to open up about my feelings, but I'm working on it. I'm trying to be a little bit more open

392
00:37:45.930 --> 00:38:01.020
Laura Sanchez: And other than that. I'm Oh my, my appetite has been kind of all over the place. I'm sometimes I'm really hungry and sometimes I'm not hungry at all, but I try. I'm trying to

393
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:07.440
Laura Sanchez: Eat at least three times a day and keep it. Keep it normal

394
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.390
margaret johnstone: Yeah, good.

395
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.930
Helena Rouhe: For you.

396
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:15.420
margaret johnstone: Good. And then focus on a balanced diet. If you can, yeah.

397
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:18.990
Laura Sanchez: Okay, I'm

398
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.430
Laura Sanchez: Okay, yeah.

399
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:31.860
Helena Rouhe: Well, we'll plan on having you join that group on Friday and our general reach out to you. And I think we're good to go. Unless you head out for the day. Take care of yourself.

400
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.960
Laura Sanchez: Okay. Thank you guys so much for

401
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:34.530
Laura Sanchez: You

402
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.090
Nice to meet you.

403
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.250
margaret johnstone: See you soon.

404
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:39.480
Laura Sanchez: Bye.

405
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.440
Bye bye.

406
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:58.860
Helena Rouhe: I mean, I'm always amazed at how people can be so insightful and aware and recognize what their needs are needing to do and they just need like the most baby of nuggets. Sometimes it's just kind of incredible

407
00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.050
Helena Rouhe: I mean, there are certainly other people who live

408
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.790
margaret johnstone: Yes.

409
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.670
Helena Rouhe: You know willingness to know understanding and, you know,

410
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.500
Helena Rouhe: Do that for you. So

411
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.810
margaret johnstone: Got a difficult home situation.

412
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:10.830
Helena Rouhe: Yeah yeah

413
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.480
margaret johnstone: Lots going on there.

414
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.980
margaret johnstone: Yeah, so, um, yeah. Projects kind of slow acting and

415
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:22.440
margaret johnstone: And if it doesn't, isn't the right fit. And maybe her sisters on something that will work.

416
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:23.760
Helena Rouhe: Right.

417
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.440
margaret johnstone: I'd like to give it you know

418
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.160
To yeah

419
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.250
Helena Rouhe: Totally. I was just thinking to get her kind of in the habit, we might get her starting a group. And when I

420
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:42.810
Helena Rouhe: Pulled up your group just to confirm the time I noticed nobody else's aside. So I've already included you on an email with and Serena to say where Margaret's patients and why aren't we getting this group started so

421
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:46.860
Helena Rouhe: We'll get that going. So that you can have that as a regular thing.

422
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.490

447
00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.850
margaret johnstone: I know that. Did you just take a picture and blow it up.

448
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:47.550
Helena Rouhe: No, I took a picture and then I stuck it on so I don't have a green screen, which is why I'm pixelated and everyone so all my hair disappears and

449
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:57.600
Helena Rouhe: I have a green screen in my other office. I'm just waiting for some equipment to come so that I can set it up in there. But yeah, you can go into your settings in zoom

450
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.100
Helena Rouhe: And it's like the little gear symbol on the when you

451
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:07.560
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. And then when you click on that, it'll actually has a little button that says virtual backgrounds.

452
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.580
Helena Rouhe: And you can

453
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:12.630
Helena Rouhe: Choose from what they already have, or you can add one of your own images.

454
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.060
Helena Rouhe: Hmm, yeah.

455
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.630
margaret johnstone: Way.

456
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.700
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, so it's fun to have something that's a little bit more personal and

457
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:31.920
Helena Rouhe: You know, give somebody a talking point. It can also be a bit of a distraction. I had one of my patients have. They were like, what are you doing are you flying. And I was like, let me just go ahead and take this off, I'll just have my

458
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:37.230
Helena Rouhe: Shelves in the background. I don't want to be distracting to you right now.

459
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.710
Helena Rouhe: Right clouds. Wow. I'm not okay. We'll just

460
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:42.270
Helena Rouhe: Remove

461
00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.340
Helena Rouhe: Too much of a distraction.

462
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:46.920
margaret johnstone: Picture. I love it.

463
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:52.170
margaret johnstone: You know, lovely, lovely. So yeah, and I think it's very relaxing.

464
00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.280
Well, good.

465
00:42:55.170 --> 00:43:01.770
Helena Rouhe: I focus on that instead of worrying about how everyone is since this self destructing planet that we're all living. And so, wow.

466
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:12.690
margaret johnstone: This little gals been pretty depressed for a long time. Um, and, you know, her suicidal thinking for a couple years is pretty intense.

467
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.880
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. So sounds like she's the contracting for safety right now and that

468
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:26.880
Helena Rouhe: Is not making any plans or decisions and good for her that she went got the help that she did so hopefully now we can stabilize. I don't think she's ever gotten help before so

469
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.330
Helena Rouhe: You have the opportunity to make a difference, I think,

470
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:39.750
margaret johnstone: Yeah, so if somebody like that. I would have trouble particularly right out of the hospital. I would make them more, you know, low to moderate

471
00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.970
margaret johnstone: Kind of in that range.

472
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.090
margaret johnstone: Mostly because of the suicidal stuff.

473
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:45.840
Yeah.

474
00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:51.240
margaret johnstone: And so I don't think there's a choice for low to moderate but

475
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.930
Helena Rouhe: I agree.

476
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:53.070
Helena Rouhe: I agree. Yeah.

477
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.420
Helena Rouhe: Just given the circumstances.

478
00:43:54.450 --> 00:44:04.350
margaret johnstone: Yeah, and I find a lot of people fall in there that I'm seeing that are there, you know, they're not eminently suicidal, but they've got some high risk issues and

479
00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.040
Yeah.

480
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.790
margaret johnstone: So things to be aware of, I don't know, I'm

481
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:10.560
Helena Rouhe: Telling

482
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.750
margaret johnstone: That's the way life goes

483
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.050
margaret johnstone: Nobody falls in all the boxes.

484
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.320
Helena Rouhe: Now, now it's not clean like that are a bit messy.

485
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.770
