Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: It.

49
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.960
Lauren Johnston: Only because I work so much and to have to worry about going to the pharmacy, you know that often is

50
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:50.760
Lauren Johnston: A headache and like I had to have my family member who watches my kids while I'm at work who I haven't seen in several, several years. So I moved up here physically and I had to have her go pick up the medicine for me.

51
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.340
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so I tell you what, I know that with everything that's going on that that can be an inconvenience. We do that to be protective. So once you're compliant and we're seeing each other than that.

52
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.570
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Drop off. Okay.

53
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:14.010
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So I've already asked them about that and we're trying to be. We just want to be protective and keep everybody compliant. Yeah, so hopefully that'll drop off and we'll meet every week. Okay.

54
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:25.080
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay. Okay, so we're on the same page with that. So I'm going to ask you, I looked at your oars. Do you need a refill. Now or You still have a refill left on your soapbox I

106
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.530
Lauren Johnston: You know where I left off, but a different cuz I'm in another state. I had it all planned down in Florida.

Right.

108
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:58.500
Lauren Johnston: I'm hoping it will be that easy here so far, called I found one place that will take me, but they won't put me under anesthesia.

109
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:08.310
Lauren Johnston: Because I don't want them to do it like just locally, where they pull them all I have to do the work I have to get it all done like wham, bam. Thank you, ma'am. Like, I can't

110
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.830

111
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.550
Lauren Johnston: I would pull out more than two.

112
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.870
Lauren Johnston: At a time. You know what I mean.

113
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:24.000

Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Through some

115
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.770
Lauren Johnston: Painful I think it would be less painful doing it that way.

116
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.280
Lauren Johnston: Going under anesthesia, because you know I'm

117
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.820
Lauren Johnston: Not trying to take any pain medication, obviously, you know,

118
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.620
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, if you

119
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:37.980
Lauren Johnston: Know,

120
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:45.000
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: If you need some short term, we could we could. Some people have to do that short term because the pain can be so severe. Okay, so

121
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.980
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I don't want to penalize you

122
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.460

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.960
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah, okay. And there are other pain options like you're saying like ibuprofen, but

124
00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:02.670
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: We've had people who had to do something just for like three days doing a transition and they did find he didn't relapse. So we don't want to penalize you okay

125
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:16.950
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Right, right. Okay, so let's see. Um, so we have, you have the medicines and I see that you are working in a management position. You've been at your job, long term so work is good is a good

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.450
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Did you have you ever tried the patches or Chantix or anything like that.

529
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:19.200
I'm

530
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:25.020
Janice Macko: Not really. I never really gave them a chance. But, uh, you know, I'd be willing to

531
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:41.790
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, so I really do want you to talk with her again. So I'll share a little bit about it. One of the benefits of not smoking is that when you don't smoke. You could add 10 more years to your life because it does shorten your lifespan increases your risk of heart attack, heart attacks.

532
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:57.720
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I've actually had some patients who stopped smoking and they actually noticed that their breathing got better at a couple of weeks. They didn't feel like they had that elephant sitting on their chest. Many patients, notice that they're smelling improved taste improve

533
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.020
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah.

534
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.100
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Circulation improve blood pressure got better.

535
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:17.130
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And the one of the major benefits of not smoking is that with you being young, if you stop, you definitely can limit and stop the progression of any type of damage to your long, so definitely want to encourage you to do that.

536
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:25.650
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Now there are a lot of different options out there to help you stop smoking because what my smokers share with me is the thing that they want is the nicotine.

537
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.940
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: But I don't want the other stuff that increase the risk of cancer. Right, right.

538
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:37.260
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So one of the things that I used to do. I will give my patients patches and this is very common nicotine patches. Have you ever tried them before.

539
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:38.850
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: No. Okay.

540
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.940
Janice Macko: I think when I was in the hospital once or twice I gave them to me.

541
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:43.230
Janice Macko: Okay, yeah.

542
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:51.390
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So the thing about the nicotine patches. You put them on usually on your shoulder. You don't want to sleep with the nicotine patches, because you have some very vivid dreams.

543
00:45:51.480 --> 00:46:02.370
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay. Yeah. Okay, take them all. And when you crave a cigarette. Instead of smoking a cigarette. You can break like the GM and have put it under your tongue, or you can do the laws and your

544
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:16.890
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And our call, they have different ways of delivering the nicotine. So you have that Joan is giving you the steady state of the nicotine and then we had a breakthrough crave is instead of reaching for the cigarette. You grab that gum other laws injure okay yeah

545
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.810
Janice Macko: Yes, it sounds good. Okay.

546
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.470
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: worth a shot.

547
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.120
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: However,

548
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.960
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You want to make a t shirt. Yeah.

549
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:35.490
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Definitely want to just encourage you to talk with your doctor about that. All right. Any, any questions on the on what you can do.

550
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:37.740
Janice Macko: No, no.

551
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:42.210
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I've actually had patients who said they like holding it in their fingers.

552
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:48.720
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yes, I'm in their mouth and I've had patients make like a fake straw a fake cigarette.

553
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.670
Janice Macko: My mother did that right

554
00:46:50.730 --> 00:47:01.620
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And it was just holding it and put the gum in your mouth of the laws of nature. So you still get your nicotine, but you still got like this draw us to have a straw you're chewing ice or something. Okay.

555
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:08.490
Janice Macko: Yeah, well, if I can get over the filter monster. I'm sure nicotine is isn't you know it's bad, but it's not going to be as bad. I don't think

556
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:18.720
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: That's a good point that you bring up if you can get over to things that you've gotten over, you can definitely do this. Have you at least decrease your nicotine use WERE YOU WHAT WERE YOU THAT

557
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.440
Janice Macko: Um, I was I was smoking, like a pack a day.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:37.320
Janice Macko: My boyfriend's mother, she kind of his breathing issues. So we have to go outside. So it's kind of I would say almost cut in half because it's a pain in the butt to go outside to smoke so

560
00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.960
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So you say you're at one half a pack per day so far.

561
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:41.940
