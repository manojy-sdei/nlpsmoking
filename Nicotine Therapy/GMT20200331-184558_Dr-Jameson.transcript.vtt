00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:36.270
Dr Jameson: New to bright heart and I reviewed her or his report and actually her previous program was sending had been sending two weeks supplies and then dropped it to weekly. So I think we're already extending a courtesy for her as a new patient here to be getting two weeks applies.

Dr Jameson: And then just to make sure you're aware, we these meetings. I'll get transcribed meaning like they they typed down everything that is said so in order to do that, it gets recorded, so just so you're aware you're getting you're being recorded.

15
00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.930
Dr Jameson: They don't save the video record the video like playback of it after a month or something. But the transcription remains so.

16
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.810
Dr Jameson: Okay, so as long as you're okay with that.

17
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:21.480

21
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:56.700
rosita stotridge: anywhere from one to two o'clock in the evening I would start filling the leg cramps and like that kind of the sweats and the fatigue kind of fill in the wilderness.

22
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.760
Dr Jameson: Where we get paint really relax. I

23
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.050
rosita stotridge: Felt that and then it not just cake sleep my legs cramp just

24
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:23.370
Dr Jameson: So that's all. How are you take area on the medication. Now, or, you know, we'll take it off the street now, but I see, okay, just wanted a. Okay, so how much are you are you still just doing one a day or you take more than that. Now I get if I can have the money.

25
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.940
Enough I get at least two, two and a half a day.

26
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.730
Dr Jameson: So, so for you the best is the two and a half or

27
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:45.900
rosita stotridge: If I could get. Yeah, the two and a half. If I could get three that I'm not be able to dose, like a half dose do a half at night and see if that would help. And if it didn't take the other half.

28
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.910
Sick.

29
00:03:49.410 --> 00:04:00.120
Dr Jameson: Okay. Well, I mean, we want to keep you on enough to make you not feel ill, but not any more than absolutely necessary, either.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.870
Dr Jameson: If I getting my from two to three.

31
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.370

32
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:24.120
Dr Jameson: So the, the place that you were going before. Are you just interested in DID THEY WHY ARE YOU switching just because they didn't give you any more than one a day or he was just given me the one a

33
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:38.100
rosita stotridge: Day and I had told her that was wonder withdrawals and I had like three two to three claims drug test and where she went and offering to try to take me up any I ended up going out and using and I failed my drug test.

34
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:49.140
Dr Jameson: Oh, so I kicked. Yeah, yeah. Alright, so the last time you had a prescription. When did you last go there. Two weeks ago, almost three weeks ago. Okay.

35
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.990
Dr Jameson: All right. Um, and then how long ago did you first start

36
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.880
Dr Jameson: In treatment.

37
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:07.260
rosita stotridge: I have been in to countless Suboxone treatment. I'm in now. I was in another treatment back in 2014 as methadone.

38
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.840
rosita stotridge: Okay, and Alice on it for a few years, but I ended up losing my job and I'm unable to pay for it because they didn't take insurance at all.

39
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.720
That's when I'm just boxing.

40
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.130
Okay.

41
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.520
Dr Jameson: And when was that that you Mocha Suboxone sorry

42
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.160
2014 2014 or 15

43
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:44.460
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you've been taking Suboxone sorry I might be confused. Sorry. You went taking two blocks on Suboxone since 2014 yes okay continuously are often on here like, Yeah, okay.

44
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:53.040
Dr Jameson: So sometimes when you don't have a prescription you buy from the street, which is not uncommon. I am not.

45
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.160
And then I would if

46
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.470
rosita stotridge: If I could have done the Suboxone which it's kind of a whole it's easier to get hair when it's a box off the street, it really is.

47
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:22.980
rosita stotridge: Um, so when I couldn't find this a box and I would do the heroin and I was referring the hair one over the Suboxone because it the hair one, just a little bit lasted so much longer than what the money. I had to get the Suboxone with

48
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.890
Dr Jameson: So financially. I mean, it's

49
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:37.470
Dr Jameson: You can, yes. Avoid withdrawal longer with okay with her when I say, okay, so look, I'm

50
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.560
Dr Jameson: How long were you with this other clinic.

Dr Jameson: Okay, there's when I first went man I was pregnant with my little girl and Alex on subjects, man. Okay.

52
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.820
Dr Jameson: Um,

53
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.000
Okay.

54
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:07.290
Dr Jameson: I'm just looking you up in our, you know, we will we're required to look, everybody up in the drug monitoring it doesn't seem like you were

55
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:14.070
Dr Jameson: On Suboxone except after mid February this past year and then before that.

56
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.630
Dr Jameson: I just see occasional Oxycodone and hydrocodone type things. Yeah, I had

57
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:30.330
rosita stotridge: She had asked me about going to the emergency room I have very bad teeth and that's the hydrocodone oxy codeine, you say they

58
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.510
rosita stotridge: Were eight of them for to say

59
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.040
Dr Jameson: Yeah but but you are still taking Suboxone at that time.

60
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:47.040
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right. So, okay, is it the same clinic you've gone back in and out of or different clinics, the same clinic. Okay.

61
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:55.620
rosita stotridge: I was in the 2018 and then I think I was in with the clinic until a little middle of

62
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.320
Dr Jameson: Okay, and I had

63
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.630
rosita stotridge: Dropped out, and then I started back in 2020. Okay. Okay.

64
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.860
Dr Jameson: And when you dropped out. Did you relapse. At that point, or

65
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:18.060
rosita stotridge: I was going through some personal issues with my sister and my children and I went down. Yeah, just just went down the wrong.

66
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:33.030
Dr Jameson: Path. So what made you decide again in February to cuz my oldest daughter is 11am I am ready to I want to be 100% committed to this and

67
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:41.430
Dr Jameson: I want to get my ain't got my children right now. My sister has my kids and my kids, I'm a mother. That's, that's who I am.

68
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.430
Dr Jameson: And they need their mom. Yeah, and I miss my kids every single day and

69
00:08:48.480 --> 00:09:05.760
rosita stotridge: Maybe in an addict out chasing. I can't be a mother or a human being, I'm a human being, but I can't be 100% myself because I'm worried about the withdrawals are worried about going and Jason and I'd rather stead of going out chasing. I'd rather take my kids to a park or

70
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:13.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, are there any legal issues at the moment, or have you had in past

71
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:24.540
rosita stotridge: Right now, you know, once I get stable enough on the map, you know, again we go back in and sound for a new petition and try to fight for it.

72
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.020
Dr Jameson: I see, okay, but you're not on parole or probation or any

73
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.390
Dr Jameson: Okay, and you have a license driver's license license.

74
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.400
Dr Jameson: That's because of drug use or you just never had one.

75
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:51.000
rosita stotridge: I got caught draw them with twice driving without a license and I had fun I had to pay and I used to live up in my ex husband was in the military in Norfolk, Virginia.

76
00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:04.350
rosita stotridge: And I had a farm up there that I had to pay and pay the farm back in. I want to say 2019 or 18 and everything's paid off. I just got to go do my reinstatement fee here in Tennessee and I say,

77
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm okay.

78
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.460
Dr Jameson: And then I saw, I guess, well how much school did you get through.

79
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.730
rosita stotridge: my junior year of high school.

80
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.660
Dr Jameson: And then

81
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.660
Dr Jameson: Have you, I mean, assuming you're not working right now without a car that would probably be hard.

82
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:39.930
Dr Jameson: But any any work in the past, what kind of work have you done I'm done housekeeping. I've done, get a cashier at a gas station.

83
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.360
Gym at a bait on base that I was a greeter and

84
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.560
That's pretty much it. Okay. Yes.

85
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.870
Dr Jameson: In the past, okay.

86
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:59.310
Dr Jameson: Do you have any sort of ideas of what you would like to get back. I know right now is kind of weird with this virus.

87
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.180
Dr Jameson: So aside from that, any, any thoughts of what you might once I got

88
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:13.530
rosita stotridge: Stable and got my legal issues right with my children. I would like to pursue my school. Yes, yes.

89
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:27.360
Dr Jameson: You don't have a GED yet. Okay. Yeah, I think that's, I think that's a great idea and just open so many more options just it really would. Okay, so are you on disability or just

90
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.900
Dr Jameson: Simply okay and who do you live with.

91
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.240
Dr Jameson: Right now stay with my mother often on. Okay.

92
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.550
Dr Jameson: So she's supporting you kind of her yes we had a

93
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:51.420
rosita stotridge: rocky relationship. A couple years ago because of the drug habit, but she was very hard to get her to understand about Suboxone

94
00:11:52.710 --> 00:12:09.000
Dr Jameson: He was thinking, pretty much. I was trading one drug for another. And it was just very hard to get her on the same page with it, but actually done some research on it, and she's getting she's okay with it. Okay. Well, it's certainly better than hair when I mean yes

95
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:19.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I'm so sorry. How many kids you have for. Oh, wow. So there I think you said 11. Did I hear, I got a 10 year

96
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:25.350
rosita stotridge: Old a four year old a two year old and a five year old.

97
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.160
Okay.

98
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:33.750
rosita stotridge: Wow, that's a hand three girls and my five year olds. The boy. He's stuck with three sisters

99
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.210
Dr Jameson: So your sister has custody at the moment. Yes.

100
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.640
Dr Jameson: She let you see manner. Um, it's

101
00:12:46.500 --> 00:13:01.380
rosita stotridge: I have visitations through the court, which ain't much is all it's four hours a month and my sister is she, she she lets me see him, besides the four hours a month at my mom, my mom's around

102
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:18.240
rosita stotridge: So yeah, I guess you could say she lets me see him. I wish it was more, but you won't let me video call or anything like that because she says it gets upset because they start Miss they miss me and they, you know, they want mom let me video call with them.

103
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.360
Dr Jameson: Yeah, everything has to be on her schedule her way.

104
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.850
rosita stotridge: And it's difficult. Yeah. You can't really imagine. Yeah.

105
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:38.040
Dr Jameson: Okay, so any other besides I know we'll get to it back to the the opiates and heroin and somebody any other drug drugs that have been

106
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.400
Dr Jameson: Problem or that you still use from time to time I have done some methamphetamine.

107
00:13:45.570 --> 00:14:02.310
rosita stotridge: It's because I couldn't find a Suboxone or heroin. Yeah. The it don't help with the actual physical withdrawals, but it. I don't know. I guess it just messes with your mind. If you don't focus on it, don't care so much. Yeah.

108
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:09.630
Dr Jameson: Alright so that you're using that from time to time. Now, yes, I told the lady that I done my

109
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.540
Orientation with that.

110
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.620
Dr Jameson: I told her, I said no. When I go to my first drug screen. I said, I will fail because I have smoked a little bit of marijuana

111
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.670
Marijuana and methamphetamines

112
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.950
Box into my system.

113
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.230
Dr Jameson: You do or don't. Sorry.

114
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.120
rosita stotridge: I will have Suboxone

115
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:48.210
Dr Jameson: Or methadone or methadone. I'm sorry, Miss inside of me and Suboxone and marijuana. Okay. Um, I called him and I didn't get an answer. I had left a message for them to call me back because I was going to go do my drug test this morning. So, okay, because if

116
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.880
Dr Jameson: I say with this pandemic going on with a

117
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.810
rosita stotridge: Virus, it's

118
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's kind of weird.

119
00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:11.970
Dr Jameson: Not, not business as usual, that's for sure. Just to let you know. I know that a lot of programs are kind of like punitive like that. If you're, if you have a drug test. That's not what we're wanting to see get kicked out. But we're not, we don't really take that approach. I think

120
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:26.430
Dr Jameson: If you look at studies of of recovery. It's usually well I guess depends which way you're going, but it's usually like this, right, it doesn't, it's not like people just flip a switch and then completely stopped. So it's very hard.

121
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:36.630
Dr Jameson: Yes understatement of the century. Yes. So we kind of take more of a realistic approach, meaning

122
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.100
Dr Jameson: I mean,

123
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.800
Dr Jameson: We hope not to see other other things and they are missing you know

124
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.490
Dr Jameson: But it's more from for I'm not just me. I mean I our sort of philosophy is really more about

125
00:15:53.910 --> 00:16:10.680
Dr Jameson: Being open and honest and taking taking ownership of what's happening and looking at why this may be and what's happening and what's the problem. And what are we doing to try to find other ways of dealing with with our situation, then using something so

126
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:24.570
Dr Jameson: It's more important that your which you seem to be so i'm not saying it. The, the honesty and being open is very appreciated, and that's really kind of the

127
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:34.230
Dr Jameson: Basis of this sort of working with my counselor and my doctor. I'm not going to get an award. Well, right. It's only that gets heard at the end. Right, so

128
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:44.370
Dr Jameson: But a lot of people are afraid to say what's really going on because they're afraid they're going to get kicked out. So I think it just like to make sure that's clear from the beginning.

129
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:59.130
Dr Jameson: The one thing I think that will get you in trouble is if you're not testing positive for Suboxone as time goes on, because then we have to worry that your medicine has grown grown and walked off right so

130
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.700
Dr Jameson: That's our responsibility to try to

131
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.720
Dr Jameson: Confirm that our patients are actually taking the medicine and not

132
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:20.610
Dr Jameson: Letting something else happened to it. So, um, that's I think probably the biggest potentially problematic thing on the drug screen side of things. So, um,

133
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:32.940
Dr Jameson: So yeah, so as far as especially the initial I mean it is, whatever it is, it is. And that's okay. We just, you know, meet a baseline somewhere and then

134
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:42.450
Dr Jameson: Going forward we expect to see Suboxone we very much hope, not to say anything else but if there's something else there. We're just going to want to talk to you about it and

135
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.790
Dr Jameson: Yeah, see what our plan is alter our plan if we need to.

136
00:17:49.770 --> 00:18:00.600
Dr Jameson: Okay, so let me just back up a little bit further. Well, a couple other questions here. Do you smoke cigarettes. Yes, I want a half a pack a day I'm

137
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.310
rosita stotridge: Days that I'm withdrawing probably about a pack and maybe a

138
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.230
Half a pack.

139
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:19.260
rosita stotridge: It's like when I'm withdrawal and if I smoke it just the length of time that I'm smoking a cigarette. It kind of lets work one of us I trying to say.

140
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:27.750
rosita stotridge: receptors have something that makes you feel it makes me feel a little bit better than but as soon as the cigarettes gone the with your

141
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:46.110
Dr Jameson: dance again and I'm okay. And how about alcohol. I don't drink. I don't have apartments alcohol. I drink on occasions like weddings or things like that. But no, I don't know. And then I think you mentioned a has been are you divorced or

142
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.050
Separated separated

143
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Dr Jameson: And is he still in the military, you know, he contracts for the Navy now. Okay.

144
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:09.720
Dr Jameson: And is he in the senior buyer. Now he lives in Norfolk, Virginia, still we talk occasionally. I mean, we have a decent relationship. Yeah.

145
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.830
Dr Jameson: But it is he a recovery or knows

146
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:24.720
He drinks. He has he's drunk. A lot of his family actually drink so hot, too, but, uh huh. I saw more of an increase when he joined the Navy on drinking

147
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.370
Dr Jameson: I guess I'm just curious why your kids or with your sister, not with him.

148
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.840
Um,

149
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.630
rosita stotridge: Well, my oldest belongs to him, but my three

150
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.820
Youngest. I see. Okay.

151
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.850
So, and when

152
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:56.160
rosita stotridge: He's a good guy, but he ain't a good guy. And when I decided to leave him and come back to Tennessee. He pretty much just stop having a relationship with money and his daughter pages up Connor having anything really to do with her.

153
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:02.940
rosita stotridge: My three youngest they're dead. He has stepped up really good own responsibility with

154
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.470
rosita stotridge: You don't make her feel left out any you know he's

155
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.340
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, and are you in. What's the status of that relationship now.

156
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:22.770
rosita stotridge: Mediums trying to work, man. The kid three youngest his father's trying to work things out of a trial, I'd like to pursue things with him. Okay.

157
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.130
Dr Jameson: And so he lives nearby. Yes. Okay.

158
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:34.140
Dr Jameson: Okay. Is he in recovery or what's his you know he he don't do neither neither is not an addict. Okay.

159
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.300
Dr Jameson: So you're you're

160
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.870
Dr Jameson: on speaking terms, we're not really. Not really in a relationship, right. The second is that what you're saying.

161
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.420
Yeah, okay.

162
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:52.530
Okay.

163
00:20:54.630 --> 00:21:04.920
Dr Jameson: It's hoping to rekindle relations. So the drugs have had had a part of that. Yes, yes, he

164
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:24.720
rosita stotridge: He understands. He, he's very understandable with me on it to a point, but then to a pony. You know, you don't understand where I'm coming from. As an addict. Yeah. Like I said, I want to have a stable.

165
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:32.940
rosita stotridge: Law. I don't want to be going through withdrawals and he just wish that I could just stop.

166
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:39.870
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think I'm not even gonna say I fully understand if I'm being really

167
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:52.350
Dr Jameson: You know, completely honest, because I i've never been there. I've never, I mean, I see, I see what people are describing, but I don't know that I can truly understand, you know, in your own mind and yeah

168
00:21:53.400 --> 00:22:09.600
Dr Jameson: But also wanted someone who you care for and you're trying to depend on and you know it's pretty hard to be in a relationship with someone who's got this other priority. Yes. And that makes you in

169
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:18.660
Dr Jameson: Unavailable, you know, for one way in one form or another. Either you're not home because look in or you're out of commission so

170
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.260
Dr Jameson: Want to spend time and yeah

171
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:36.090
rosita stotridge: We have a date. And that, to me, makes you downtown to the day or going to be missing. I would go out and meet a friend and I will try to tell him what I have to get my medicine. Before I am enjoying myself with you and

172
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.460
Dr Jameson: But you can see i mean i think

173
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:52.050
Dr Jameson: I mean, I always when there's this Court, I always try to put myself in the other person's shoes for even just a minute to like think okay what is why, why are they saying what they're saying or what. What, or where is it, where are they coming from just to kind of

174
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.060
Dr Jameson: Give them a check, you know, fair

175
00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:07.200
Dr Jameson: fair shake you know and i guess i feel i you know there's not a lot of. In fact, I think sometimes people are considered enablers if they continue to tolerate. You know what I mean. And sometimes

176
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.620
Dr Jameson: Sometimes it's really better that they say no and make you kind of get your

177
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:30.000
Dr Jameson: Hand poor still a little bit right to get your get your stuff together and and on the same on the other side. I think you being able to just work on you and focus stay in your own lane here for a little bit of time and kind of get yourself. Get your mind a little bit

178
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:50.820
Dr Jameson: As we say in our gym or getting ready for a workout. Get your mind. Right. You know, you know, just kind of not have other distractions and really do what's best for you. First and foremost, anyway, so it's good that it sounds like there's still a an open window, maybe for now. Right.

179
00:23:51.840 --> 00:24:05.850
Dr Jameson: So that's that's occurred. I mean I that's encouraging. I think a lot of people don't they just it it's hurt. It hurts them. Do you know what I mean, to feel like their second it'll all the time and not everyone can

180
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:11.730
Dr Jameson: Can even even keep the idea, possibly, you know, it's like

181
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:25.380
Dr Jameson: They're gone. You know, so you did pretty pretty strong over at all. He really yeah yeah well that's and that's good that you appreciate and recognize that. And yeah, I think.

182
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.250
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that's good. Anyway, so I sorry I was just kind of trying to put you put all the pieces together like

183
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:33.990
Dr Jameson: Okay.

184
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:40.050
Dr Jameson: But do you are you allergic to any medication initial one

185
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.060
Dr Jameson: And you know what happened when he took that and I favor in house.

186
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:52.500
Dr Jameson: And then dude I prescribed any medication, besides the box. Oh, yeah.

187
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.610
Dr Jameson: So no other medical conditions or or

188
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:08.370
Dr Jameson: About any operations. I've had three areas section. Okay.

189
00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.790
Dr Jameson: I'm sorry I had a hernia repair. Okay.

190
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.060
Dr Jameson: That's fine.

191
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.440
Dr Jameson: A lot of times, stuff like that. You forget

192
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.340
Dr Jameson: I've even had people, you know, ask these questions and then

193
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:44.130
Dr Jameson: I don't know, there's no no no medical history, you know, medical problems and then something comes up like 20 minutes later in the conversation about while they were on chemo or something and you're like, oh, except for that time I had cancer it, forget about that too, sometimes. So anyway,

194
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.450
Dr Jameson: I always figure well geez if it's that much of a distant

195
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.690
Dr Jameson: Memory, then we are good because

196
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.360
Dr Jameson: Um, was it in your belly button or was a hernia. Yeah. OK.

197
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.420
Dr Jameson: OK, and then how about family members like parents, siblings, anybody else that's struggled with.

216
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.140
Marijuana and then

217
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.540
Dr Jameson: In high school, how old are you, I was in high school as a freshman.

218
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:26.850
rosita stotridge: Really the fella down into my junior year and then my junior year I started doing a little bit of cocaine here and there.

219
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:36.810
rosita stotridge: And I was, I was a good girl. I was varsity cheerleading team. I'm just started hanging out with the wrong crowd and I went down the wrong path with

220
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:51.870
rosita stotridge: The wrong people, and started doing the cocaine and dropped out of school and then I got introduced to oxy cotton on faith and started doing those really bad and from the OC us. I went to heroin.

221
00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:00.960
Dr Jameson: And when, when did. How long ago did you transition from the OCD. I was on I was for us back in

222
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.050
Little girl was born. My oldest was born and

223
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:12.540
So the last time I had done an OC with about 2006 2007

224
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:26.370
I was clean for about a year, with almost a year. And when I had my first child, and then I ended up how I even got convicted was a physical therapy.

225
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:28.980
I had

226
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.790
To call the sad sciatic nerve.

227
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:47.820
Dr Jameson: Had messed up and they sent me to physical therapy and the physical therapist or feeding me percocet 7.5 and the physical therapist. Yeah. Yes. Given me prescriptions for example.

228
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.110
rosita stotridge: My mom had the same reaction as you and

229
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:58.710
Dr Jameson: Well, they're not supposed to prescribe medicine. So that's why I'm confused. He prescribing medicine. This is in Norfolk, Virginia.

230
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:13.500
Dr Jameson: And I started taking them percocet 7.5 and like you wrote you the prescription and send to the pharmacy, are you, he gave you the pills. No, he gave me a prescription. Well, he must have had some kind of

231
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:30.960
Dr Jameson: Other maybe he was a PA or might have been a nurse practitioner or something. Anyway. OK. OK. So anyway, you ended up with prescription for Percocet and that was what did you say 2007 no that was

232
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.290
A little girl is born January 2000

233
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.390
And

234
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.090
2010 about

235
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.720
March or April of 2000

236
00:30:44.010 --> 00:31:00.330
Somewhere around there surgeons Percocet and I started feel and taste of it again and I went in there about heroin and I've done heroin ever since. And then I hit. Well, I got introduced to methadone.

237
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:19.380
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, sorry, sorry. Did you do her when before you had your baby to know. Okay, so only after. So then the Percocet and then that led to that lead to heroin and that was sorry. How long after you started the Percocet, did you end up on heroin, um,

238
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:30.660
I would say at least six, seven months. Okay. And then I tried to hear one I was doing morphine, also in between, with the heroin.

239
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:42.450
rosita stotridge: And I had got I just got fed up with it. I was carrying a lot of my shoulders on laws and had in it. And at this time I was married

240
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:55.590
rosita stotridge: And I had he had no idea about my I was, I kept it very well. He had and he had no idea. And like I said, I felt like I had a brick building carrying on my shoulders every day.

241
00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:04.440
I finally just come out one night and told him the truth and Tony money to to get some in some country meant something to help

242
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:15.330
rosita stotridge: I got introduced to message them and I was in the Methadone clinic for about 34 years and it worked. It helped really well. The methadone. Good.

243
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:38.790
rosita stotridge: But I ended up moving from Virginia to more folk there, my separation with my husband and my son financial needs that will back a little bit, so it will pay for the methadone and I was by methadone off of the street for about seven, eight months. This is back in 2014

244
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.650
And

245
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:49.770
After I had my son because he was he was a message on baby after I had him. That's when

246
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.650
I ended up getting on the Suboxone

247
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.490
Dr Jameson: Or you prescribe the Methadone during your pregnancy or you're just buying it described. I was

248
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.500
OK.

249
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.900
Dr Jameson: And then after

250
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.390
Okay.

251
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.870
Dr Jameson: Well, anyway, so you're often on methadone. Okay.

252
00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:30.330
Dr Jameson: Watson four to five years ago it was. Yeah. Did you ever do any inpatient like we have things now.

253
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.560
I've had, I had custody of my children at this time.

254
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:45.870
Dr Jameson: My sister. She don't agree on Suboxone or methadone anything. She's totally against it on every way in the world to the heroin. She's a heroin fan.

255
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:49.770
Dr Jameson: Okay.

256
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.550
I guess you just expect

257
00:33:54.990 --> 00:34:02.970
rosita stotridge: That I just quit, uh, you know, it was just, I'm going to quit and me in a room for about two weeks and know now.

258
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:08.070
Dr Jameson: How about six months, but okay yeah your philosophy and yeah

259
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.880
rosita stotridge: So I was so scared to actually try to go to the facility.

260
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:24.150
rosita stotridge: To a facility, she would try to prove me as an unfit mother and go that way and but it ended up happening anyway she found out that I had gotten to the Suboxone program.

261
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.280
Listener

262
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:37.200
rosita stotridge: And she just she got mad. She got really mad sad. That's all I was doing which which one drug for another drug and just did not she does not understand that attics

263
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:47.160
Dr Jameson: Yeah, but how did the judge agreed with her. But just because you were in treatment, you shouldn't be with your kids. Yes, they, they, she went

264
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:52.650
rosita stotridge: I didn't even know my kid. She lived in Nashville, at the time I didn't even know my kids. My kids was at

265
00:34:53.730 --> 00:35:07.770
rosita stotridge: My mom's house and my step mom that she went over to the courthouse and got an emergency petitions and when they let her have emergency petition and got my children CPS or nothing ever come to my home.

266
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.410
Dr Jameson: They took my kid. I mean, I had to coordinate. That was it. They took them to my kids from

267
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:28.890
rosita stotridge: The judge, her, her name's a judge Simmons Amanda Simmons and she she's already she's got in trouble before because she just see like taking she takes kids. You go into that even kids that in

268
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:40.530
rosita stotridge: Haskell that get in trouble like going in and being in her courtroom here in cases they've been kids that really to just get, you know, a little smack on the hand or something.

269
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:48.750
smack on the hand, but she would just rip these kids completely out of the home. I mean for me as a mom.

270
00:35:50.070 --> 00:36:03.000
rosita stotridge: Not having two or three doctors excuses. So she's, she's really against judge limits there. She's really get that. Like I said, I was in my I was in Suboxone clinic I had all my drug screens that is Tom

271
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:14.310
rosita stotridge: Where I had custody of my kids and I was in flux and clinic. I was not doing nothing else. Yeah, I had on a drug screens and everything FX tour and still she ripped away from me.

272
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.670
Dr Jameson: So are you petitioning, I guess, not yet. But the plan is to petition to get them back. Yes.

273
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.510
Dr Jameson: Or no judge to I don't even know. Well, I mean, it seems like

274
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:37.230
Dr Jameson: I mean, that seems discriminatory to me and I agree with taking kids away from an active addict like

275
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:48.420
Dr Jameson: I can't properly care for their children or their and putting them in danger, or sometimes driving around and I will tell my mom, you know, we, because we live in a rural area and

276
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:55.320
Dr Jameson: You know, stuff like that around. Everybody knows everything. And yeah, everything and you just see these mothers with these

277
00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:06.840
rosita stotridge: Kids no shoes and know little bargain or nothing on at the wind blows, and here they are in a hoodie and walking across the Walmart parking lot and their kids. I got no shoes socks. Nothing on and like

278
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:22.140
rosita stotridge: How much it's never went like that. My kids food. I mean clothes clean never nothing. I never took them to drug houses. Well, nothing like that. And she wrote them my way from me. Wow.

279
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:32.400
Dr Jameson: Wow. Well, yes. I mean, it seems like the, I think part of the problem is probably that to get a really good lawyer you need a lot of money and then

280
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:42.840
When I do fall for the new petition. I'm going to fall for a new judge because she is. She's against the Suboxone or methadone to

281
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:53.850
rosita stotridge: Impure of other cases and other counties that mothers that someone you know the addict. They try to get them into a clinic tricky.

282
00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:05.970
Dr Jameson: I mean, I was just gonna say that we have, we have patients referred to us by the drug courts in Ohio. Like, it's, it's the way that people get their kids back is to be in treatment programs usually

283
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.740
rosita stotridge: I'm, I'm very 100%

284
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:13.920
emotionally ready for this.

285
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:34.290
Dr Jameson: Right track in my kids. I wonder if there's any like advocate type Oregon. I know some of my other patients have talked about that. There's advocate organizations, it seems like this might be a at me. So you got to get yourself. We got to get you squared away, but it seems like that's

286
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:48.330
Dr Jameson: Like this judge needs to be educated about how the medication works and how the brain. What chemistry wiring changes and the you don't just turn that off.

287
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:57.330
rosita stotridge: Yes. And at this point, like I said, I'm an adult. If you have bread on it. But when I'm done orientation went to Lady at Twitter, you know,

288
00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:06.420
rosita stotridge: A year, two years from now, I want to be completely off Suboxone I'm going to be completely. I would love to be drug free off everything and

289
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.110
rosita stotridge: When I went to court over my kids I was actually in the process of doing that. I was

290
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.010
rosita stotridge: Four milligram of methadone, a day.

291
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.870
To a day.

292
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:26.640
Effects her all the paperwork, you know, everything is the doctor, what am I can make come down. This is me. The judge what you know.

293
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:42.210
Dr Jameson: Myself as an addict, saying, Okay, I'm ready to take this step and still didn't see that as a positive outcome or she, she was just totally against it. The shame. And I think that that's

294
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:54.180
Dr Jameson: A great long term goal. I think my opinion and my kind of observations of doing this for some time, not I don't have years and years of experience, but

295
00:39:55.530 --> 00:40:04.170
Dr Jameson: I think part of this you know the the medication certainly satisfies the receptors in your brain that make you feel sick when you haven't used recently.

296
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:14.190
Dr Jameson: But the other big piece to this whole project is figuring out where you're

297
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:32.700
Dr Jameson: Where you can use some help learning different coping mechanisms finding other ways of managing discomfort, whether it's this kind of discomfort or anxiety discomfort or anger or, you know, those kinds of

298
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.780
Dr Jameson: Accounts one out of that thing.

299
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:43.830
rosita stotridge: You had a 30 minute rule. And it worked. Very good. I still try to use it.

300
00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:45.990
rosita stotridge: When

301
00:40:47.130 --> 00:41:02.340
rosita stotridge: When you start having a craving or your mind starts going somewhere else at least 30 minutes. Get a coloring book you know wall. Do you do some exercises. It's because she is like a proven fact for if you can get your mind off of it, at least for 30 minutes

302
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.030
Mm hmm.

303
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:12.240
Dr Jameson: Yep, there's a ton of different techniques, so that's that's distraction. And then I think dealing with any unresolved.

304
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:21.420
Dr Jameson: You know hurts from from years past, and we've just just finished some groups. Today we have a new counselor who does

305
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:31.260
Dr Jameson: I don't know if you've heard of em, Dr. But many, many of our patients are sort of suffering with the residual effects of trauma of trauma one sort or another.

306
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:42.570
Dr Jameson: And kind of releasing that burden and and sort of rewiring your, your brain pathways in a way that those memories, no longer triggered the same sort of

307
00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:58.080
Dr Jameson: emotional response and just kind of let you heal from from different kinds of wounds that have built up a lot of times we spend most of our energy trying to not feel things that we don't want to feel and I think

308
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.200
Dr Jameson: We, it's not a very realistic.

309
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:10.710
Dr Jameson: Plan to think that we any of us can sail through life and not deal with not

310
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.160
Dr Jameson: be faced with various sorts of pains, whether it's physical or emotional or whatever. And if we don't have a way of

311
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:30.240
Dr Jameson: Kind of like taking that in and feeling it, and then letting it go if we're always trying to duck it or get around it, or under, you know, like, get away from it, then

312
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:46.890
Dr Jameson: You kind of end up back where you started. If you're only solution is to not feel it, you kind of end up looking for something to make it go away. So I think that's the biggest honestly I think that's the biggest challenge that we face is in general as a

313
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:58.440
Dr Jameson: Community is is is being able to do that because it's scary. And it's uncomfortable and, you know, if you've spent a whole you know lifetime.

314
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:06.390
Dr Jameson: Marketing. You don't believe that you can handle it. Sometimes, so we you know we trying to like build confidence.

315
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:18.330
Dr Jameson: Look, as a matter of fact, you can and you do, and you have and you can, again, you know, there's a lot of that kind of, you know, thinking and work. So anyway, um,

316
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:30.900
Dr Jameson: So if if trauma is is a is a factor in your life you don't want. I'm not asking you to spill it all right to me. Right. The second, but we do have a counselor, we have this available.

317
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.570
Dr Jameson: Which is really, really exciting. Actually, I don't know if you're familiar with anyway. You don't have to put on that.

318
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:43.680
rosita stotridge: As my program. I was in before had a counselor and I'll, I'll use that resource a lot

319
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:56.760
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. So, um, I, I don't think that the program officially requires people to do more than at least a single visit with a counselor, but I sort of

320
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:12.780
Dr Jameson: Kind of do require that until the counselor tells you and me that okay she's good. Not much else to talk about. I think, I think that should be, kind of, I almost think that's the more important part than just basically

321
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:32.790
Dr Jameson: Emotions in the mental well because there's usually there's there's always multiple reasons why people find themselves drawn right so lots of kids smoke pot or take drugs and copy in high school, but not all of them end up you know

322
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:41.730
Dr Jameson: Completely engulfed and some of that can be some of it is is genetic. I mean, some of it is the way your chemistry is but

323
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:52.200
Dr Jameson: Usually there still are other factors like why you thought it was a good idea to hang around with the wrong crowd like what was, you know, I'm, you know, not ask you to answer these questions to me now, but

324
00:44:52.560 --> 00:45:02.070
Dr Jameson: Like, what was that about, like, what were you, what were you why. Why did that happen. And then when you started realizing it was a problem, you know. Anyway, just

325
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:07.020
Dr Jameson: A lot of times there's either anxiety or there's low self esteem or there's

326
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:18.960
Dr Jameson: No. Yes. And if we don't deal with that. That's not going to just go itself. So, um, so anyway, so that's kind of my philosophy about the whole thing.

327
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:33.930
Dr Jameson: And if we're able to taper you off Sunday then yea, if we're not. I think you're still better off than where you have been yes you know we say it all the time. If you had diabetes. Nobody would blame you if you had to take insulin, the rest of your life.

328
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:43.950
rosita stotridge: Yeah, and explain it that way to my sister before. And she said, well, people that has diabetes. It's not a choice to them. She said it was a

329
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:54.570
Dr Jameson: It's a choice when people eat crappy food for 30 years and gain weight. Absolutely it is. Nobody, the kind that you get when you're a kid. Sure.

330
00:45:55.020 --> 00:46:09.630
Dr Jameson: Yeah, but, but what if, how do we know if you don't have a genetic abnormality in your brain that makes you you know i'm not i'm not trying to give you a pass. I'm just saying we don't know what we don't know, and there's not a lot of benefit and blaming

331
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:14.730
Dr Jameson: blaming the victim and, you know, I've told her many times I've said it.

332
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.330
At

333
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:34.680
rosita stotridge: 910 years ago and I kind of said woke up in rooms like okay I choose to be an addict not, that's not how it worked. I said, Yes, I did make bad choices to lead down the road that I'm at right now. I said, but it's how the world has she put it, it's not that way at all.

334
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.420
Dr Jameson: Well, I think.

335
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.370
Dr Jameson: It's very

336
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:47.790
Dr Jameson: Well, you haven't been there yourself. I think most people don't love. We started out saying that you just don't really understand and even

337
00:46:48.150 --> 00:47:01.740
Dr Jameson: Like alcoholics right so that's probably a much more sort of familiar form of addiction. But we don't. We know most of us know you go through withdrawal for a week or something, you get some shakes, you feel, you know, and then you're done.

338
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:09.810
Dr Jameson: opiate withdrawal is legitimately months and there's depression that happens and it

339
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:18.030
Dr Jameson: comes and goes. And I've had patients tell me they got sent to jail and didn't have any treatment, it was six months where they could sleep through the night or, you know,

340
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:26.010
Dr Jameson: It wasn't all like the worst of it in the first couple weeks. It's the worst with, you know, physical stuff, but it doesn't just

341
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:45.450
Dr Jameson: It takes forever takes forever. And that's just more than it's reasonable to expect people to be able to. And again, we're talking about a group of people that in general don't have as many advanced coping skills as other people might and

342
00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:56.100
Dr Jameson: So then you're asking them to to tolerate all this misery when they're not really as equipped mentally kind of psychologically for that so

343
00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.020
Dr Jameson: Anyway,

344
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:07.530
Dr Jameson: Okay, so as far as the structure of our program goes. Um, did they explain to you about the weekly groups and

345
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:15.330
rosita stotridge: You know she she told me that I have to do a weekly group that she didn't. They didn't really go into detail about

346
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:27.330
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, so we have this initial meeting. We talked about if the medication seems like it's appropriate for you. I haven't really like answered, you know, medical questions about how it works and all that stuff. But, and we have to decide on your dose, but

347
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:39.210
Dr Jameson: Going forward you have an initial evaluation with a therapist, and then they determine at that point what the recommendation is for every two weeks, every week, every day.

348
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:41.700
Dr Jameson: Meeting with the counselor.

349
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:58.830
Dr Jameson: And then going forward from today. Generally, I see patients for refills, but in the context of these groups. So it's a counselor and me and then up usually try to infer eight to 10 patients maximum

350
00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:10.020
Dr Jameson: That we meet weekly and it's mostly the counselor running the meeting and talking about some sort of topic related to recovery or, I don't know, we talked about variety of different things.

351
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:19.500
Dr Jameson: But at the same time I'm checking in with who needs refills and making sure drug screens are up to date and that kind of stuff. So

352
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:26.910
Dr Jameson: My Tennessee group. I only have one right now because we just, we just started seeing patients in Tennessee pretty recently.

353
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.910
Dr Jameson: Have. What are you central or Eastern

354
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.120
Dr Jameson: Okay, so it's 230

355
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.840
rosita stotridge: I'm, I'm an East Tennessee. I mean,

356
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:50.160
Dr Jameson: What, what time is it for you right there. It's 335, I think. Okay, so you're the same as me. Yeah, so that your time zone. So I'm sure a half or

357
00:49:50.730 --> 00:50:08.700
Dr Jameson: So before I tell you the time I'm Eastern also. So it's at noon on Wednesdays. So that'd be tomorrow. So yeah, so we meet every week we start out with a week supply of medicine and then each you know as time goes on and we established that

358
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:14.700
Dr Jameson: People are showing up and making their appointments and doing their drug screens and, you know, kind of

359
00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:25.770
Dr Jameson: pulling their weight, so to speak, then we'll eventually go to two weeks at a time for the prescription. I still prefer people come to group every week indefinitely, but

360
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:36.930
Dr Jameson: But we didn't have you do fewer trips to the pharmacy anyway and then eventually usually do every two months or so, as things are continuing to

361
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:45.450
Dr Jameson: Become smooth and, you know, sort of routine. Then we'll eventually you get them a month supply at a time for the medication.

362
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.590
Dr Jameson: So we have initial labs, which

363
00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:58.140
Dr Jameson: We already talked, but we yes you're waiting for the call back so you do the blood work and urine. The first time and then after that.

364
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.790
Dr Jameson: We do a monthly drug screen urine usually

365
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.150
Dr Jameson: I guess they have saliva tests, but I've yet to see

366
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:19.590
Dr Jameson: Those are very few and far between, I think, but you never know could be randomly a your saliva test one month we mail a package to the patients with which contains one or the other of these

367
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:27.450
Dr Jameson: Tests kits. So you can do that at home, too. We just ask that you, you don't need to do that for a month, at least, but

368
00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:35.370
Dr Jameson: You're supposed to leave the package closed and then sign into virtual care and then virtual clinic and then they

369
00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:41.520
Dr Jameson: Take it from there. So that's how that will work down the road. So pretty convenient.

370
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:48.360
Dr Jameson: So that's kind of the general structure format, whatever.

371
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:55.500
Dr Jameson: The groups are just like this and zoom except they'll be more more little squares on your on your device.

372
00:51:55.890 --> 00:52:08.610
Dr Jameson: We asked people to have headphones of some sort, your butts or whatever because that's where privacy of other patients that whatever we're saying, Isn't we don't know who, who else is behind your, your, your camera there.

373
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:20.580
Dr Jameson: And then we asked you not to know smoking in group, either because some people are in the process of or have recently quit. So we try not to trigger them and then

374
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:32.970
Dr Jameson: That's big. That's really mainly it this this is perfectly fine. What you're in quite a relatively quiet place if possible and as undistracted as possible. Ideally,

375
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:41.850
Dr Jameson: The way it looks so well that time be okay for you, at least for now. Yeah, you said 12 o'clock. Right. Yes. Yes. So what we ask is that

376
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:51.150
Dr Jameson: The checking in can get backed up with, you know, seven or eight people checking in, for the same time. So we asked you to start

377
00:52:52.140 --> 00:53:06.690
Dr Jameson: Checking and no less than half an hour before it's supposed to start. So meaning 1130 or sooner. That way, if you have to wait on hold for 15 minutes you're not late to group by the time that that makes sense. So

378
00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:16.800
Dr Jameson: You can even do it earlier, if you want. It's just that the the ID code for the meeting changes every week. So you need to be

379
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:28.290
Dr Jameson: In, you have to. You do have to go through the virtual clinic to get the right number and they're just checking. Like if somebody is overdue for a drug screen or needs an appointment with somebody or

380
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:34.950
Dr Jameson: Both if you have to pay a copay. I mean, whatever it is, like, the usual things that you do to check in for an appointment so

381
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:44.130
Dr Jameson: So that's how that works. So okay, so you were doing, sorry, did you say tablets or films. What did you say

382
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:56.880
Dr Jameson: Tablets. Tablets, have you do you like. Is that okay, do you mind, though the, I mean you have a preference. I like the tablet more than that. Yeah, okay. Everyone's different. So I didn't make any difference to me so

383
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:03.480
Dr Jameson: Then the question is the Joe thing.

384
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:05.700
Dr Jameson: I'm

385
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.680
Dr Jameson: So certainly want a day is a very low dose. I think that's probably

386
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.870
Dr Jameson: Silly

387
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:28.110
Dr Jameson: I mean, generally, the average doses to a day. Sometimes we have to start a little higher than that and then sort of once things kind of as things are resetting and getting stabilized, you know, try to get down to

388
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:38.220
Dr Jameson: It. I mean, there are different philosophies about that. I don't feel super strongly I prefer people to be around to a day, if we can, two and a half.

389
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:53.370
Dr Jameson: But you know if if you if you still feel sick, then I think the whole point of this is to make you not be tempted to physically anyway, not have cravings and

390
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:58.110
Dr Jameson: You know, more likely to slip so

391
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.500
Dr Jameson: Did you did you

392
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:18.000
Dr Jameson: Select a pharmacy already. Yes. Okay. I've already given them the information on that. And I've already called My pharmacy because. Do I need a PA don't have to have a PA approved that depends on here insurance. All right. She um

393
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.950
rosita stotridge: The pharmacist told me, as long as it's the same the tablet and it's

394
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:29.010
Dr Jameson: You know, the same medicine. Yeah. The only thing is that if we change the directions that and I'll I mean

395
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.630
Dr Jameson: I'm not a fan of insurance companies because their entire

396
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:41.010
Dr Jameson: modus you know like their Mo is to pay for as little as possible and collect as much premium as possible so

397
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:56.880
Dr Jameson: Often like they'll tiniest little thing even a different doctor sometimes, but certainly a different instruction on the thing often triggers a whole brand new fire off. So now if I had to have a PA

398
00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.440
rosita stotridge: Who do I get in contact

399
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:05.850
Dr Jameson: Well, so the pharmacy will send that to us and we have someone we have staff that that complete those

400
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:11.820
Dr Jameson: Primarily, the one that I see working on those is woman named

401
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:16.830
Dr Jameson: Danielle. Sorry.

402
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:26.220
Dr Jameson: And usually, she's able to turn that get them turned around pretty quickly. But every so often there's a cluster of them, and it can be slower.

403
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:36.720
Dr Jameson: But generally, we're able to get those done pretty quickly. Okay. Um, it don't even have to be changed, but there's always, I hope not. I mean, you can also

404
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:38.820
Dr Jameson: I'm

405
00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:46.200
Dr Jameson: Sorry. Someone sent me a message and I don't know where it went. They asked me if I could see a patient and

406
00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:52.080
Dr Jameson: Don't know what's going on. But anyway, okay. I lost it. Um,

407
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:58.920
Dr Jameson: I mean, it's been known to happen. I don't know what your resources are today, but sometimes people will

408
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:12.960
Dr Jameson: Ask you know. Well, let me just by the first day, it's worth myself while we're trying to get the PA sorted out, just so that you don't have to wait with nothing right if that's if that's the case, I will. Yeah, so, um,

409
00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:18.870
Dr Jameson: How I guess.

410
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:26.100
Dr Jameson: Well, I guess we'll start with two and a half a day, unless you think the two is going to be said you've done

411
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:36.360
Dr Jameson: If we could start with a two and a half and go from there. Okay. I mean, also just what I was going to what I was thinking about was depending on how

412
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:52.530
Dr Jameson: Consistently or able to get Suboxone off the street, you know if it was kind of hit or miss some of that with you know it's sometimes hard to tell if if you know if you're not able to take it every day. Anyway, what the right dose is because it's kind of never stable.

413
00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.220
Dr Jameson: So okay, so

414
00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:03.990
Dr Jameson: Tomorrow, your group would be tomorrow. So instead of me just sending one day worth and then

415
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:21.120
Dr Jameson: I'll, I'll do two days and then know what let's say I'll do eight days and then that'll line us up with next Tuesday, so that hopefully we can keep you on a sort of regular schedule.

416
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:26.820
Dr Jameson: FDA. So the other thing that sometimes happens

417
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:30.720
Dr Jameson: Is because of the way that our

418
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.900
Dr Jameson: Company is where we're all working remotely.

419
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:50.250
Dr Jameson: I happen to have licenses in multiple states. So the special code that I need that we need that you need to write a prescription for this medication is affiliated with.

420
00:58:50.850 --> 00:59:00.510
Dr Jameson: A California D number which is what's printed on the prescription. However, I have a DEA number also in Tennessee. It's a separate number

421
00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:15.510
Dr Jameson: Everything's kosher is not. It's just that sometimes the pharmacy systems get or the pharmacists get like very disturbed by this because they freak out about I had told him that you is out of California.

422
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:27.390
Dr Jameson: I think, is that where you're at, well, the company's headquarters is in California. That's not where I live, but yes. But yes, that's what its gonna say it's California. Well, I told him, I said, I think.

423
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:36.360
rosita stotridge: The address and do believe agenda California acid, but she's allowed to practice in Tennessee at because I had SM RJ

424
00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:42.180
Dr Jameson: I think what she told me you could do, Tennessee, West Virginia. Oh, I have. Yeah. So I worked

425
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:55.650
Dr Jameson: Worked before I worked here. I worked for a different company called doctor on demand. But anyway, it's an online thing and I had when I worked for them. They got me licensed in like 15 states. So I have a lot to make sure to ask me, make sure

426
00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.510
rosita stotridge: That you went to PA you is actually

427
00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:18.240
Dr Jameson: No, I'm an MD. Yep. Yep. So, some states have different regulations. Now everything's a little bit funky right now because of the whole coronavirus thing. So there's some regulations that used to exist that have been removed because because of crazy times so

428
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:25.470
rosita stotridge: When I told her that you was able to you, you had your lessons to practice in Tennessee. She didn't have no more issues.

429
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.010
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and I. So what I do is I I hand write my

430
01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:47.610
Dr Jameson: My, my, Tennessee DEA number in with the instructions for the prescription. Because a lot of times that's that's part of what they, they still need to see that number. So I add that to the prescription. So that's in there and then. But yeah, sometimes they see that and then they see California

431
01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:54.630
Dr Jameson: And they think it's some kind of big scam and they get all suspicious and part of it is based on

432
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.160
Dr Jameson: Whether or not that area is particularly

433
01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:05.460
Dr Jameson: Mature about how how we're treating addiction these days.

434
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:20.160
Dr Jameson: Because just like that Judge unfortunately sometimes doctors pharmacists, you name it, are a little bit behind the times as far as like how this works best. So

435
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.000
Dr Jameson: Sometimes the pharmacists are not necessarily super

436
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:37.950
Dr Jameson: Agree pleasant about it's funny because they don't have it. I didn't have any trouble dispensing ginormous numbers of regular opiates to people for 15 years but now that you try to get yourself.

437
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:46.590
Dr Jameson: Into a better place they suddenly start looking down their nose at you. So yeah, doesn't make any sense to me. But anyway, insurance to it so

438
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:53.610
rosita stotridge: hard at first when I first started my insurance that covers the box and they wanted to cover it was called universal

439
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:57.840
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's this is a generic yeah not

440
01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:04.110
rosita stotridge: Work at all I had was on it for like two weeks, and it just popped in this out of my job. I didn't think

441
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:12.660
Dr Jameson: It's probably because it's cheaper. Yeah, they wanted that one so I usually step still send the prescription for the generic version, it's not

442
01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.160
Dr Jameson: That one always. I mean, it's just buprenorphine naloxone so

443
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:27.330
Dr Jameson: Anyway. But yeah, so they're going to try to get whatever is cheapest, but I think they finally figured out that treating patients with something

444
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:42.240
Dr Jameson: Is actually cheaper than not treating them at all, because then they end up in the ER all the time and hospitalized with overdoses and heart valve injection infections and all sorts of other things. So they have become a little bit more

445
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:50.040
Dr Jameson: With the times I forgot to actually ask you, speaking of all that, how are you using a heroin.

446
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:52.770
rosita stotridge: I've never

447
01:02:52.950 --> 01:03:09.510
Dr Jameson: Used ok ok ok so no needles. What's inhaling, okay. Um, and then I know you've been taking this. And so, and you were on methadone, too. So you probably have a pretty decent idea of how it all works. But I just want to make sure you if there are any questions about

448
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:20.070
Dr Jameson: How medication works what it's doing, you know, any, any questions about that I would be happy to try to answer and

449
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:35.970
Dr Jameson: So just to briefly summarize basically the it is a different opiate. So on one flip one if you looking at it, depending on how you're looking at it and you are, in a sense, replacing

450
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:52.860
Dr Jameson: In the receptor of your brain. The other opiate or the, the whole that's left by not taking opiates, which makes you feel sick, you are replacing that with either methadone or in this case Suboxone so that the Suboxone

451
01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:08.820
Dr Jameson: enters your system and it goes into your same receptors that the other opiates would would be in, and then it sticks. They're like, super duper strong stronger than all these other opiates that

452
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:24.810
Dr Jameson: Your body has seen before. So if you take something else like for your tooth or whatever. And you've had Suboxone in your system, you won't notice much

453
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.320
Dr Jameson: Of anything compared to what you're used to, because the Suboxone kind of blocks.

454
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:42.930
Dr Jameson: Blocks the other opiates and it's the, it's the buprenorphine that's doing it not than the lock zone. A lot of people think it's been a lock zone. That's the blocker. And last one is a blocker.

455
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:54.660
Dr Jameson: But in this case, the buprenorphine is actually what's blocking the naloxone is in those pills or strips. Because if people try to do funny things with

456
01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:04.620
Dr Jameson: With the pills like crush them and snort them or melt them and shoot them or something, then you get your know lock zone, along with it and that will

457
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:16.950
Dr Jameson: Obviously not go well if you're taking the medicine, the way it's time to be taken, where it's all under your or in your cheek or under your tongue, then the last one is not even absorbed by your body

458
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:22.920
Dr Jameson: So that's, yeah I know even a lot of a lot of doctors don't know that.

459
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:39.750
Dr Jameson: So it's really as is there for a deterrent to, you know, how they reformulate did they reformulate oxy content pills and different ones for what like have funny they open it. Yeah. So, which I guess wasn't necessarily fully

460
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:48.690
Dr Jameson: tamper proof, but it's the same concept. It's like trying to make a medication that can't be Miss used if it

461
01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:53.790
Dr Jameson: If someone decides they want to try to do something it backfires basically so

462
01:05:54.510 --> 01:06:00.690
Dr Jameson: So it's really the buprenorphine itself, which is why people take Sunday text. Sometimes, which is just playing buprenorphine and

463
01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:09.000
Dr Jameson: It's still it's still works. The problem with that is, which you may well know is that, then the sub you text can be

464
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:20.730
Dr Jameson: Abused because it doesn't have the blocker in it. So the locks on me. So that's how that works. And then it's also important, which you probably already know, but you have to be somewhat

465
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:28.590
Dr Jameson: Well, once you're on the Suboxone, it's fine. You just keep taking it, but the first dose of Suboxone, you have to be

466
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:39.180
Dr Jameson: In some degree of withdrawal before you take it because it will actually push out other opiates if they happen to be there when the Suboxone arrives.

467
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:55.860
Dr Jameson: And that actually brings you from wherever you work crashing down to the level of the Suboxone and from what I'm what people describe. It's the worst withdrawal. You can even imagine kind of all at once. Terrible.

468
01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:03.390
Dr Jameson: Have you had experience with that. Are you familiar with that whole, no problem. Okay.

469
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.240
So you're lucky, then yeah.

470
01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:10.980
Dr Jameson: So, I'm sorry. So, tell me again. You've

471
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:21.480
Dr Jameson: Taken Suboxone how, when was the last dose, you had, um, well I had actually bought one day, one day before yesterday. Okay, and then have you taken any

472
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:34.080
Dr Jameson: Thing. Any other opiates since then. No. Okay. So, okay, because that's, yeah, we want it unformed, this was the one, the one negative to the to the medication that I can

473
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:44.340
Dr Jameson: That I can say is that you have to be uncomfortable before you start it, which is not great but once you're on it, then you're then you're fine. I've been

474
01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:49.440
rosita stotridge: I've been having withdrawals. For the past two or three days now but a runny nose and can't sleep did

475
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:54.150
You fill in, like, a scrub against crawling.

476
01:07:55.170 --> 01:08:00.120
Dr Jameson: So, so you're good. As soon as you get the prescription filled, you can start and

477
01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:10.140
Dr Jameson: I guess you know i don't know what your it's going to be two and then a half a day. So if you want. I don't know how you can split those up, however.

478
01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:18.210
Dr Jameson: however you like. Technically, the medication is meant was meant to be a once a day medication.

479
01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:35.670
Dr Jameson: We find most of our patients don't like that idea. At least start, you want to take repeatedly throughout the day instead of all at once, once a day, so it's fine. I mean, you can do it either way. It doesn't matter, but

480
01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:39.000
Like the two and a half, all at once.

481
01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:49.140
Dr Jameson: It's a very so it's a long acting medication. So we talked about half lives and in pharmacology, so it

482
01:08:50.160 --> 01:09:02.040
Dr Jameson: It takes a little while to get the level up, but not that long. And then it stays and very gradually comes down, which is why you've probably noticed when you start to withdraw from it. It's not

483
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:13.950
Dr Jameson: Quite as it doesn't happen as soon and it's not quite as it's a little more drawn out before you get to your very worst. And that's because there's still some there and it's it's gradually dropping

484
01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.090
Dr Jameson: So once you're at your steady state is the another term we use in pharmacology, as far as your level goes

485
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:27.420
Dr Jameson: It's such a gradual decline that really, it can be taken all at once, once a day.

486
01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.820
Dr Jameson: You don't, I'm not telling you that you need to do that, but I'm just letting you know if you wanted to do.

487
01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:50.370
Dr Jameson: Probably at first, you're probably going to want to take it regularly to kind of like get used to it. But as time goes on, you could consider splitting it into two doses in the day, or I don't know, let us figure out how you want to do it, but I would start with a full pill and then

488
01:09:51.810 --> 01:10:03.750
Dr Jameson: Give it a little time and see how you feel, consider maybe, you know, twice a day and then a half at bedtime or, I don't know, whatever time of day seems to be harder for you that probably want you and take the extra half but

489
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:14.670
Dr Jameson: It really whatever seems to work best for you. It's really fine. I just ask that you not increase your dose without talking to me first and

490
01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:27.120
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, we have problems with, you know, the pharmacies are watching too. So if you run out faster than you're supposed to. It doesn't really matter what I say they're not going to feel and other professions so

491
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.320
Dr Jameson: So we need to be on the same page about what you're doing.

492
01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.670
Dr Jameson: We've had a run a problem with

493
01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:47.760
Dr Jameson: In general, and it wasn't you, because you have never been here before. But we have a problem in general with people missing appointments, especially with counselors. But even with Me too. I mean, anybody and group in general. So

494
01:10:48.870 --> 01:11:05.580
Dr Jameson: I tried to just say out upfront everybody coming on, like we expect you to make that this you know the priority is your recovery. And so we expect people to be at their appointments when they're, when they're scheduled

495
01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:18.090
Dr Jameson: You know, that's where you get your refill is in groups. So if you don't come to group then, you know, then you're calling. Two days later, I'm on a medicine. Yeah, I bet you are out of medicine now, aren't you, so

496
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:33.060
Dr Jameson: You know, we're not going to fall over ourselves on a Saturday to call. I mean, we might do it, but it's not going to be like I drop everything to rush and do that because this was not my doing this, you're doing and what I mean. So we don't necessarily make it

497
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.730
rosita stotridge: This is important responsibility.

498
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:44.970
Dr Jameson: Absolutely. And there are consequences and it's important. Some of our patients have, you know, kind of got stuck in adolescence and never quite

499
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:53.730
Dr Jameson: Finished yet chapter. So sometimes it's partly I feel like I'm sometimes just being a parent sometimes

500
01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:06.720
Dr Jameson: But anyway, um, so just to say that up front. And so I told I explained how we do a week at a time. At first, and then we gradually increase you. Well, if you keep missing appointments and you don't call you don't. Well, you know,

501
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.780
Dr Jameson: Then maybe you only get three days of medicine at a time, and even in the worst in the most

502
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:21.900
Dr Jameson: Problematic cases you getting one day of medicine at a personal, you know, you get two pills, with seven refills like

503
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:34.590
Dr Jameson: We can do that if we if you know we'd rather not have to, but, um, so anyway, there is there's like a, you know, given take enough, you know, earning earning your privileges kind of a thing. So

504
01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:48.510
Dr Jameson: That being said, we're also pretty understanding reasonable people. So if something's happening has happened is about to happen and you realize you're not going to be able to keep whatever appointment. It is

505
01:12:49.620 --> 01:13:01.470
Dr Jameson: Okay, just give us a call. Let us know so we can make adjustments and put somebody else in that spot or whatever, you know, just kind of common courtesy and hopefully I don't really need to have those issues here, but

506
01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:07.350
Dr Jameson: I just try to put it all out up front. So there's no oh no, look,

507
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:11.970
So,

508
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:22.740
Dr Jameson: Young mean, I think we're pretty forgiving and reasonable for sure understandable, like, you know, we get it there, especially these days with with

509
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:39.150
Dr Jameson: Everything's crazy, but we do also request the sort of common courtesy of especially when there's professional people sitting waiting for our patients to show up and they don't bother to call and say they can't make it. It's like, you know, kind of lame. So

510
01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.890
Dr Jameson: Anyway, we can. I can get off that little soapbox now.

511
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:57.030
Dr Jameson: So yeah give the pharmacy a call before you head down there to make sure they received the prescription and make sure they don't have any issues if you need a prior off if they have a question about was this doctor in California and

512
01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:04.680
Dr Jameson: Then just anytime there's an issue you want to head to virtual clinic. That's usually your, your

513
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:13.530
Dr Jameson: Go to place there is someone always there available to answer so 24 seven if you need to.

514
01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:15.900
Dr Jameson: And then

515
01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:26.040
Dr Jameson: We'll plan on seeing you tomorrow actually right away group is actually going to be, oh no it's Rochelle tomorrow, sorry. What am I, other counselor.

516
01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:35.340
Dr Jameson: That doesn't the majority of my groups is on vacation this week. So I was about to tell you that we had a substitute. But it's this is one of the groups that I have a different counselor with nevermind.

517
01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.000
Dr Jameson: The counselors name is Rochelle and

518
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:48.690
Dr Jameson: Just say, like, if in case you have any anxiety about what that's going to be like, we're pretty you know she may ask you invite you to

519
01:14:49.650 --> 01:15:04.170
Dr Jameson: Answer a question or contribute, but you're hundred percent allowed to say I'd rather not today, or I don't feel comfortable or I'd rather just listen. Today, or I don't know or you know you can just say no if you don't feel comfortable

520
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:12.300
Dr Jameson: Eventually will expect that you start to cooperate and participate, but you don't. It's okay if you're not quite there yet.

521
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:26.850
Dr Jameson: We do usually think she starts the groups with a gratitude. Some my other cancer and it's a group with a gratitude. But we usually ask everyone to give some something at least one thing that they're grateful for. So just to give you a little

522
01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.980
Dr Jameson: Preview, I guess you have something that you're not totally caught up on that, but

523
01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:40.620
Dr Jameson: We usually have some topic about something to do with recovery skills or relapse prevention or

524
01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:44.700
Dr Jameson: What have you. So I don't know what she's got

525
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:46.110
Dr Jameson: In

526
01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.760
Dr Jameson: Store for us tomorrow.

527
01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:01.950
Dr Jameson: Okay, any questions for me before we I talked to you much. I'm sorry you pretty much covered it. Okay.

528
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.790
Dr Jameson: And then some probably I know terrible

529
01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:24.600
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I will see you tomorrow and hopefully there will be smooth sailing at the pharmacy, but let us know if there's anything we can do to help them alive and do try to remember to check in, no later than 1130 that I say that the half an hour early tomorrow.

530
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:35.580
Dr Jameson: Sometimes it helps to put alarms and cell phones and such. Just make sure you don't forget what time it is.

531
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.820
Dr Jameson: Just a thought.

532
01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:48.450
Dr Jameson: Anyway, all right. Well, it was nice to meet you and hopefully the higher dose will be more comfortable for you. Thank you.

534
01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:04.440

559
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:41.370
Dr Jameson: dubious about the the overall concept of medication assisted therapy.

560
01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:49.740
Dr Jameson: And in fact, she tells me that her sister was able to successfully get our kids.

561

Dr Jameson: Period.

573
01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:13.560
Dr Jameson: Certainly seems that the benefits

575
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:24.900
