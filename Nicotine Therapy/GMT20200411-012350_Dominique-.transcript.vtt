8
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.130
Galaxy S10: Well, that's okay because he didn't have any of the any of the information to wait for him to send that to me so

9
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.350
Galaxy S10: We're here now.

Dominique Pozo: So do you want to do. Can you stay. Two Minutes Later at the end. So you just get your full hour and yeah okay great so. So what I need to do is just a basic initial assessment and it's just a lot of

13
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.200
Dominique Pozo: Kind of just Historical questions, to start with, and I'm going to be typing as we do this because I got a record it.

14
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.390
Dominique Pozo: So I'm just gonna pull that up for myself here.

15
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.960
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

16
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.560
Dominique Pozo: And then before we get started with this. Do you have any questions for me.

17
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:23.580
Dominique Pozo: About the program or myself as because I'll be your therapist in group. I'll be you know co facilitating with the doctor and then also if you're wanting and needing individual therapy. I'll be the one

18
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.110
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

19
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:42.420
Galaxy S10: I'm not right now, but I'm sure that somewhere down the road, a question or two might come about. But as of right now, I think I'm pretty, pretty sure where this is going, and what you know because this isn't the first time I've done treatment. Oh.

20
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.980
Galaxy S10: I just

21
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.850
Galaxy S10: Kind of familiar without all the stuff like

22
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.000
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. And I'm going to

23
00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:08.700
Dominique Pozo: Kind of start recording. You know what brought you here. And so what can you give me a little history around, you know, how, how you got here. And what that journey has looked like and how many times you've been in recovery before

24
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.740
Dominique Pozo: Or in a program

25
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.070
Galaxy S10: Oh, I'm in

26
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.120
Galaxy S10: 1994 um I was well 94 when I went into

27
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:36.000
Galaxy S10: Recovery. The first time and I was in a very abusive relationship with my first husband and a father of my children, and he was

28
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.530
Galaxy S10: Not only abusive, but he's the one that kind of took me down the road up

29
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.200
Galaxy S10: Into drugs.

30
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.720
Galaxy S10: Okay. And so when I decided to leave him.

31
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.980
Galaxy S10: CPS had come in taken my tool destroyed.

32
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:04.830
Galaxy S10: At that point, I guess I kind of just realized that I needed to do something different and I needed to figure out a way to get my children back and

33
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:20.640
Galaxy S10: It stayed stuck with him in animal tell for about a week while he was still getting high. And, um, I guess, at some point, he just finally passed out and I snuck out of the motel room from there and

34
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.190
I

35
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:38.100
Galaxy S10: Said recovery program for that was CPS so I actually just stopped doing drugs at that point. Um, I just never went back and

36
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.730
Galaxy S10: And lived a very sober life for very, very many years and

37
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.870
Galaxy S10: And so about seven and a half, eight years ago, I was hit by a car at work.

38
00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:03.300
Galaxy S10: Manager at Sonic and have gone out to deal with one of my customers. And as I was coming back and that was the lady that was Barreling through the drive through and

39
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:18.540
Galaxy S10: Passing the drive through at the same time and she read it to me. And so from there I have been on pain medication and have been on pain medication ever since. Okay, I added that

40
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.970
Galaxy S10: My drug of choice.

41
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.400
Galaxy S10: The first time was not opiate there wasn't a downer. It was eat. I was on cocaine and so

42
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.520
Galaxy S10: When I stopped.

43
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:46.200
Galaxy S10: using drugs at that point, I never took anything harder than a ibuprofen. So then all of a sudden, you know, there was no regulations on medication and

44
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.680
Galaxy S10: Before you knew it has been 300 deals a month and

45
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.860
Galaxy S10: Cost. Yeah, so I very very quickly became addicted to them.

46
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:08.550
Galaxy S10: And I wasn't there was no regulation to it and it wasn't in my mind, but I was an addict at that point.

47
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.430
Galaxy S10: It wasn't until probably the last

48
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.170
Galaxy S10: Year and a half, two years that I started to really realize where that had taken me and

49
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.830
Galaxy S10: And I realized that I was

50
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:33.570
Galaxy S10: Taking because then the regulation started and I started getting decreased on my medication but needed more

51
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.380
Galaxy S10: And so

52
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.090
Galaxy S10: Then I realized I am now getting them on the street, you know,

53
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.750
Galaxy S10: Maintain and that's where I realized

54
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.880
Galaxy S10: There's a problem here.

55
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:55.680
Galaxy S10: Yeah, I don't want to be a problem. I don't want to have a problem anymore. I decided

56
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.570
Galaxy S10: 25 years ago that I was not going to have a problem anymore.

57
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.200
Yeah.

58
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:13.770
Galaxy S10: So I decided I wanted to do something different. AND THEN I GOT CUSTODY OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER. And I'm, I'm married again and so

59
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.520
Galaxy S10: It probably it totally been over the last year, year and a half, that really just

60
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:38.940
Galaxy S10: Aren't hitting hard that you know you have a problem and it needs to be fixed and I you know my rational self and my irrational self fighting with each other and saying, No, you're being you know for sure, it still

61
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.900
Hmm.

62
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.300
Galaxy S10: I'm an addict, because now I'm getting them on the street, you know, so

63
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:58.380
Galaxy S10: I just really wanted to do something different. Don't want to be. I don't want to be an addict. I've been there done that and not not my I want my life to be. And so I decided I was going to

64
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:12.330
Galaxy S10: I was going to seek out a way to get off of the the pills and my doctor actually took me off because I

65
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.220
Galaxy S10: My you as well. Coming up clean

66
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:26.370
Galaxy S10: Was not there was not any opiates in my system. So what happened was I would take my medication. And then I would get the box.

67
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.020
Galaxy S10: And that would help me over to I got my next script so

68
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.410
Galaxy S10: You know, kind of floating in between the two. And I'm thinking, well, what sense does that make you know

69
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.130
Galaxy S10: Are you going to be an addict or you should be sober, you know,

70
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.960
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

71
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.560
Galaxy S10: So basically what I did, I decided I was going to get

72
00:08:50.880 --> 00:09:02.610
Galaxy S10: Find a program that I could that could help me and get me out of this situation. My doctor finally told me you know I can't prescribe you the pills anymore and I had already talked to her about nine months ago.

73
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:15.660
Galaxy S10: At one of my doctor's visits, because she was given me three months worth of my medication script and then I see her again. Three months later, and she'd rewrite mainly scripts and and so I

74
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:26.160
Galaxy S10: I had talked to her and told her I don't want to be on the medication anymore. Can we start tapering the offer, what do we need to do to to get me offered the job.

75
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:37.950
Galaxy S10: And she just kept writing me to script that they might that I had been getting them before. And so I kind of got left in this spot where I just didn't know

76
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.890
Galaxy S10: What to do anyone you know

77
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:54.720
Galaxy S10: Taking me off the script. I want to get off, but I'm an addict. So here I am, you know, I'm going to take the pills. But, you know, it just didn't make sense to me. It wasn't lining up for me. I said, Okay, well,

78
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.350
Galaxy S10: The last time I spoke with my doctor she

79
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:06.570
Galaxy S10: She said, Well, I got it. I kept keep writing me the script. So I said, Okay, well, I don't want to be on them anyway.

80
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:19.020
Galaxy S10: And I had this talk with him about it. So I guess we're now in the same boat. Maybe you know where we're kind of in the same, you know, doing the same thing and

81
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:34.170
Galaxy S10: So she's not licensed to do this. And so I told her I would seek out a program. And I did that I live in a rural area. So there's not one up in my area I did find one in

82
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:50.220
Galaxy S10: Our major city and went there twice and got the run around and come to find out that I was going to have to go from where I live, which is almost an hour drive one way into town every day.

83
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.950
Galaxy S10: And get those and

84
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.320
Galaxy S10: For me, either.

85
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:07.800
Galaxy S10: Do that I can't keep up with the gas. I can't keep up with and violate and at that, you know, I've got a two and a half year old granddaughter that I have that I don't want down at the Methadone

86
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:18.090
Galaxy S10: Clinic you at five o'clock in the morning, which is exactly where and what time I would have had to been there, as I have o'clock in the morning to get

87
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:30.750
Galaxy S10: So that wasn't going to work. So I did end up speaking with one of the ladies, last time I went and she came across an email from your, your clinic and

88
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.070
Dominique Pozo: greet me so

89
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:45.660
Dominique Pozo: Oh, good. No, no, it's good. The details are important. It's good for me to know and that's what I'm recording right now is you know what's led you here and how you got here so it's fine.

90
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.940
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

91
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:55.530
Dominique Pozo: And I'm just wondering at any of these points from 94 to present as you've been, you know,

92
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.520
Dominique Pozo: In recovery and then sober for a long stretch and then dealt with it again in 2013 14

93
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.930
Dominique Pozo: When you got hit. Have you ever been suicidal throughout any of that. Okay.

94
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.330
Galaxy S10: I did go through depression.

95
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:21.150
Galaxy S10: But matter. So because my children had been taken away from me. And so I did see a

96
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.400
Galaxy S10: psychiatrist and psychologist for that.

97
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.710
Galaxy S10: I went through a

98
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:35.640
Galaxy S10: group meetings and individual therapy for for probably about three years I think.

99
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.800
Galaxy S10: I turned it turned out that

100
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:43.020
Galaxy S10: When I had left my position I found out probably about a week later that I was pregnant with twins.

101
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.400
Dominique Pozo: Oh my gosh.

102
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.100
Galaxy S10: You know, put this shit on top of the think right

103
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:56.490
Galaxy S10: My gosh, yeah, so that's that's what ended up happening. So I was pregnant with twins and

104
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:15.720
Galaxy S10: And so I went through a lot of depression, simply because I was fighting the system. I'm pregnant. I'm by myself. I'm in recovery and I have no family whatsoever because I had alienated everybody. So I was doing that all on my own and

105
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:31.410
Galaxy S10: They have put me on antidepressants and anxiety medicine and I realized that that wasn't shooting for me either, because I have babies. I had to take care of and they just zombie me out so

106
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:41.070
Galaxy S10: Easily. And, you know, that wasn't something that I wanted to be. I just didn't want to be dependent on anything I wanted to fight to fight myself.

107
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.210
Galaxy S10: I did.

108
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.830
Galaxy S10: And

109
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.890
Galaxy S10: It wasn't until after I got

110
00:13:48.750 --> 00:14:05.430
Galaxy S10: It got started getting my life together that I started really integrating with my family and my friends and stuff like that. But everything I did on my own. So a very, very difficult time for me. So yes, I went through the depression but never suicidal. Okay.

111
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:10.950
Dominique Pozo: That in here.

112
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.570
Okay.

113
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.690
Dominique Pozo: I mean, that sounds like quite a

114
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:50.640
Dominique Pozo: Almost like a rite of passage to make on your own and really come through. It seems like you're very strong woman and you know you've, you've really maintained.

115
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:58.800
Dominique Pozo: you maintained your sobriety. Up until the accident and then you have now chosen to make a change again.

116
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.720
Galaxy S10: My granddaughter, I think, is my driving force.

117
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.530
Yeah.

118
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:13.830
Galaxy S10: She deserves to have, you know, she deserves. Me and every in every part of me, you know, and I think that

119
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.890
Galaxy S10: The medication to take something away from you and if it's not

120
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.170
Galaxy S10: Mentally it

121
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.910
Galaxy S10: Is in your spirit, you know, take that I don't. I really don't know how to play, Nick.

122
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.880
Galaxy S10: What's the divide

123
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.050
Dominique Pozo: Know,

124
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:42.540
Galaxy S10: You deserve better as a mom. My daughter, my twin daughters, the one that looks like it with during the

125
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.900
Galaxy S10: That's her daughter.

126
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.120
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

127
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.480
Galaxy S10: My daughter is a mess. So to make them not it deserves to have

128
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.940
Galaxy S10: Somebody in your life that

129
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.330
Galaxy S10: Has all their son.

130
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.630
Dominique Pozo: What's going on with your daughter right now.

131
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.990
Dominique Pozo: What is she, what did

132
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.530
Dominique Pozo: You know,

133
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.400
Galaxy S10: Addicted to meth and heroin and everything.

134
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.220
Galaxy S10: Oh no, that's how we ended up with my daughter.

135
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.290
Galaxy S10: But that's a whole that's a whole nother story.

136
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.670
Galaxy S10: Uh huh.

137
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.690
Dominique Pozo: And we're speaking about another topic. Yeah.

138
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.860
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's just take a moment, that's a lot, you know, to be dealing with your own recovery and then

139
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:48.600
Dominique Pozo: Kind of have it in your face. Probably daily because of your you know your your caring for your granddaughter.

140
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.110
Galaxy S10: Yeah.

141
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.540
Galaxy S10: Well, she was

142
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.870
Galaxy S10: My daughter did drugs with her.

143
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.000
Galaxy S10: Pregnancy and so she's a drug affected, baby.

144
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.200
Oh,

145
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.810
Galaxy S10: She's very difficult

146
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.910
Galaxy S10: Very difficult baby.

147
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.250
Galaxy S10: She's a good kid.

148
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.910
Galaxy S10: Very, very sweet, but she does.

149
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.730
Galaxy S10: She does have her

150
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.730
Galaxy S10: Moments and Earth days were

151
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.360
Galaxy S10: Very out of control and

152
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.550
Galaxy S10: I can only talk up to the fact that it's the drugs.

153
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:44.490
Galaxy S10: But on she deserves to have help her her grandparents, if not her parents at the very least, her grandparents of their whole scruples about themselves with her. She deserves that

154
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.630
Galaxy S10: You know, I don't want her growing up when when thinking that you know everybody in her life is

155
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.420
Galaxy S10: There's an addict, you know,

156
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:03.660
Galaxy S10: I don't know who their father is, but I can only imagine that he's an addict, too, because that my daughter ended up getting pregnant.

157
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:11.400
Galaxy S10: You know I want her to grow up and know that there's somebody that care enough about her that, um,

158
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.640
Galaxy S10: That they have a sofa.

159
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.200
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

160
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.440
Dominique Pozo: How long have you had her

161
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.900
Galaxy S10: Important she'll be three known July.

162
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.210
Dominique Pozo: Oh, since the day she was born.

163
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.500
Galaxy S10: To do.

164
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.330
Galaxy S10: We're doing the paperwork.

165
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.210
Galaxy S10: My daughter was in labor.

166
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.470
Wow.

167
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.450
Dominique Pozo: So did so your daughter agreed to that her every

168
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.640
Galaxy S10: Yeah, that's a whole nother story. Okay.

169
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.200
Yeah.

170
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.660
Galaxy S10: But we'll get into that later.

171
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:55.740
Galaxy S10: That's fine.

172
00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.810
Dominique Pozo: When you say when you say we do you have a partner. Now is that who we are. Who's we

173
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.430
Galaxy S10: Yeah, my

174
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.910
Galaxy S10: My husband and I've been married

175
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.450
Galaxy S10: Before years we've been together for five years, but I will be four years.

176
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.840
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I'm gonna start recording some of this. So,

177
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.620
Dominique Pozo: Okay, and

178
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.480
Dominique Pozo: How would you describe your, your partnership with your husband.

179
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.010
Galaxy S10: My partnership with my husband is good for the most part we have

180
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:49.380
Galaxy S10: We see totally and always see it on total ends of the spectrum when it comes to my granddaughter.

181
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.120
Galaxy S10: For the most part, him and I have a really good relationship.

182
00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:04.650
Galaxy S10: But my granddaughter is a source of contention, sometimes with the two of us, because he doesn't believe in discipline or something, I don't know.

183
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.980
Galaxy S10: Or you know the word no.

184
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:19.140
Galaxy S10: And I was raised differently, where my mom, you know, was very strict and so I learned how to use

185
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.050
Galaxy S10: And and put my foot down.

186
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.870
Galaxy S10: So it does. It does some tension sometimes between the two, but

187
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.150
Galaxy S10: Overall, we have a good relationship we have a good marriage.

188
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.710
Galaxy S10: And

189
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.180
Galaxy S10: But you know, I guess everybody has their little niches.

190
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:54.270
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's quite a thing to take on because it sounds like if your granddaughters three AND YOU'RE MARRIED FOR YEARS AGO pretty quickly. You all basically took on having a child.

191
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:55.890
Galaxy S10: Yeah.

192
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.010
Galaxy S10: Good me. I'm just going into my bathroom.

193
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:00.870
Dominique Pozo: Sure.

194
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.970
Galaxy S10: Yeah, it was, it was very quickly that

195
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.660
Galaxy S10: We it uh

196
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.950
Galaxy S10: It put a whole new twist to our marriage.

197
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.170
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, definitely.

198
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.940
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's see.

199
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.550
Dominique Pozo: Okay, how about

200
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:39.390
Dominique Pozo: Can you tell me a little bit. We're going to kind of rewind to your parents and was there. Were there any mental health issues on your mother side.

201
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:48.090
Galaxy S10: Mental health. I don't think so. I don't, I'll be honest, I really don't know anything about my family.

202
00:21:49.680 --> 00:22:00.810
Galaxy S10: My family on both sides and my on both sides of my family lived in Germany. Oh. Come. I have very few relatives that live here in eight

203
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:09.870

Galaxy S10: All I know

209
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.540
Galaxy S10: Regarding my family.

210
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.460
Dominique Pozo: What did you grow up with

211
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.350
Galaxy S10: My mom, we moved here to the states when I was

212
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:32.910
Galaxy S10: Five.

213
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:39.360
Galaxy S10: And it was my mom, my sister and I, and that was

214
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:54.450
Galaxy S10: Well, my step as he's the one that product, but they they divorced pretty few years after we got here. And so then my mom, my sister and I.

215
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.130
Galaxy S10: A whole life.

216
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.780
Galaxy S10: Have a few family members that live in Colorado Springs.

217
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:08.430
Galaxy S10: But my great aunt is really do and and a cousin of mine aren't really the only other family members that I know.

218
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.100
Galaxy S10: They don't really know much about their family you know history.

219
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.500
Galaxy S10: I know that my migrate out had schizophrenia and that was

220
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.670
Galaxy S10: That was what

221
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.540
Galaxy S10: I'm that was on top of her having breast cancer twice.

222
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:39.420
Galaxy S10: And know, aside from that, I really couldn't tell you much more than that. I don't know anything about my dad's family at all.

223
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.120
Dominique Pozo: What was your relationship like with your mom.

224
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:57.690
Galaxy S10: Um, difficult. It was very difficult. Um, I moved out of my mom's house and out the top 13

225
00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:58.650
Oh, wow.

226
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.400
Galaxy S10: And so I've been on my own, pretty much.

227
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.010
Galaxy S10: Most of my life.

228
00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:12.600
Galaxy S10: And yeah, I was a very difficult town, and I think that a lot stems from

229
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.760
Galaxy S10: That move here.

230
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:25.890
Galaxy S10: My mom and dad are step dad getting a divorce and of course it mom's fault because you don't let you know at that age don't understand what

231
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.020
Galaxy S10: What caused it. I mean, I found out later on. It was he was having an affair.

232
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.450
Galaxy S10: But, um,

233
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.600
Galaxy S10: You know, so I

234
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.770
Galaxy S10: Growing up, it was, it was pretty difficult. Um,

235
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:47.430
Galaxy S10: And I'm like I said, I left home when I was about 30 minutes getting ready to turn 14

236
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.850
Dominique Pozo: Where did you go live. That's pretty young to be on your own.

237
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.180
Galaxy S10: I actually weirdly enough,

238
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.450
Galaxy S10: I'm a friend of mine.

239
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:07.680
Galaxy S10: My sister and I lived with the with her best friend with my sister best friend.

240
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.190
Galaxy S10: At the house at her house.

241
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.160
Galaxy S10: But her parents didn't live there.

242
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:32.220
Galaxy S10: Or her father lived in Santa Fe during the week and he would come Friday evening and leave Sunday early Sunday afternoon late morning early afternoon, for he was only there a day and a half.

243
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.270
Galaxy S10: And her mom would pop in from time to time, but for the most part it was just the three of us.

244
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.700
Dominique Pozo: Oh my gosh.

245
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.750
Dominique Pozo: How did you get food and take care of your basic needs.

246
00:25:47.490 --> 00:26:01.350
Galaxy S10: When her dad would come, he would, you know, because we would take care of the house and do tours and stuff like that. So he would pay us to do that. And then he would buy groceries and he would make sure the bills were all paid and everything so

247
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.290
Galaxy S10: He just wasn't one of those hands on kind of got some stuff at the very least.

248
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.390
Dominique Pozo: Wow, that's her with her mom.

249
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.740
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's a lot of independence at such a young age it

250
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.120
Dominique Pozo: Will grow someone up pretty

251
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.610
Galaxy S10: Quick. Yeah, yeah.

252
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.120
Galaxy S10: Yeah. And then I met my ex husband, my, my kids.

253
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:21.810
Father.

254
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:23.790
Galaxy S10: When

255
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.630
Galaxy S10: 15 and we see

256
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:47.400
Galaxy S10: We actually met what when I was in the detention center and he went off to a boys school for about a year and then I was just about 17 when he got out and almost yeah it was almost 17

257
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.770
Galaxy S10: When he got out and then I live with him and

258
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.840
Galaxy S10: A man.

259
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.720
Galaxy S10: Takes a very drastic turn

260
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.430
Dominique Pozo: Yes. Okay.

261
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:05.250
Dominique Pozo: All right. And is your sister. She older than you or younger.

262
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:07.710
Galaxy S10: Or twin

263
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.560
Dominique Pozo: Or your twins. Oh, OK.

264
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.240
Dominique Pozo: OK, and then

265
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:25.620
Dominique Pozo: Was there any addiction with your mother or blood father or step father and he didn't finish.

266
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:33.360
Galaxy S10: My real father was an alcoholic and my mom was never an addict.

267
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.460
Galaxy S10: She's been on pain medication and I was in high school.

268
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:46.200
Galaxy S10: She. She was a nurse and advocate back and so she's been on pain medication.

269
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.550
Dominique Pozo: Where were you born

270
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.490
Galaxy S10: West Germany.

271
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:24.060
Dominique Pozo: Okay. And did you. Was there ever any sexual abuse as a child.

272
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:25.950
Dominique Pozo: That you're aware of

273
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.220
Galaxy S10: No. Um, well, yeah.

274
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.130
Galaxy S10: Great out that I

275
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:39.060
Galaxy S10: Was that I was telling you about her. We didn't see them very often. But maybe once a year.

276
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:50.760
Galaxy S10: We would drive out to Colorado Springs to go see her and her husband and her husband was sexually molesting my sister and I, whenever we would go and see them.

277
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.380
Dominique Pozo: Oh gosh, okay.

278
00:28:52.470 --> 00:29:00.000
Galaxy S10: That didn't that didn't come out for several years and then of course you know that became a big family issue and

279
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:06.390
Galaxy S10: You know, my mom called us both liars and, you know, all kinds of

280
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:19.800
Galaxy S10: Mean it just became a big huge family issue. And so it just never was addressed and you more. And it was never dealt with and life goes on.

281
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.920
Dominique Pozo: How old were you when that was happening.

282
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.060
Galaxy S10: I was young.

283
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.710
Galaxy S10: App and for

284
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:43.320
Galaxy S10: Several years. Like I said, it was only once once or twice a year that we would go out and see my app, but it started when we were

285
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.450
Galaxy S10: Eight or nine maybe when

286
00:29:50.100 --> 00:30:04.830
Galaxy S10: Even maybe even younger, I don't even I, to be honest here. I can't remember how when it started, I just remember that we are young really young. I don't remember how old we live, but it continued for for a few years.

287
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.650
Galaxy S10: Maybe five, six years. Okay, we can move go to Colorado.

288
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.200
Galaxy S10: And then of course you know I got involved with my ex husband and

289
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.790
Galaxy S10: He was very sexually abusive to me.

290
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:46.380
Dominique Pozo: And then did you, this is changing the topic quite radically. Did you finish high school and how far did you get in your education.

291
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:48.780
Galaxy S10: I did it.

292
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.260
Galaxy S10: Back to the ninth grade.

293
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.710
Galaxy S10: And dropped out in the ninth grade but I

294
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:06.300
Galaxy S10: After I got on my feet. I went back and got my GED and and I went to it went went to college and

295

296
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:17.820
Galaxy S10: Am about two semesters short of getting my associates degree in criminal justice. I had to stop going to school.

297
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:29.850
Galaxy S10: Going to school because of my children was a single mom for very, very long time. So,

298
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:46.530
Galaxy S10: My kids really it was very difficult with my twins, my son, because it's a boy and a girl. So what my son was very have a very difficult child. And so I ended up having to drop out of school.

299
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.320
Galaxy S10: To go with him.

300
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.670
Dominique Pozo: But you're so close two semesters well

301
00:31:54.180 --> 00:32:02.790
Galaxy S10: I know and I keep thinking I'm gonna go back within you know life just keep setting itself in my lap and same not yet.

Galaxy S10: I wanted to go back now. But, you know, yeah, I got a two and a half year old granddaughter that I did amazing and so

304
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.660
Galaxy S10: Now, it's not the time either.

305
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.310
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Not yet.

306
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.880

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.160
Dominique Pozo: Do you are you currently working or how are you

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.200
Galaxy S10: At home with the baby and my husband works.

312
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.040
Okay.

313
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:40.500
Dominique Pozo: And how would you describe her name your financial status.

314
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.810
Galaxy S10: When good we're good, we're good. You know we we make a decent living.

315
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:51.900
Galaxy S10: Gives me

316
00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:58.290
Galaxy S10: But, you know, we don't struggle financially that I think we just like every

317
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.950
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I didn't catch that last thing. The last thing I heard was, you don't struggle financially and then it cut out

318
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:21.750
Galaxy S10: Yeah, I'm

319
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:28.170
Galaxy S10: Fine with you finally live from paycheck to paycheck, you know, and we we make it work.

320
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.580
Dominique Pozo: Alright, um,

321
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.000
Dominique Pozo: Where, where do you get your emotional support at the moment.

322
00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.260
Galaxy S10: Um, I am my emotional support.

323
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.660
Galaxy S10: I don't think my

324
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:04.650
Galaxy S10: skill set. So I am my own emotional support.

325
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.470
Galaxy S10: Okay, I think I learned how to do that.

326
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.280
Galaxy S10: I mean, some days, it gets difficult

327
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.770
Galaxy S10: Think I learned a lot when I went to therapy.

328
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:25.170
Galaxy S10: And so I have a lot of skills that I learned through through that kind of

329
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:33.210
Galaxy S10: And I have been I have, I have a couple of really good sense that I can you know that I can talk to us if I need to.

330
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.020
Galaxy S10: For the most part I depend on my own business.

331
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.250
Okay.

332
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.870
Dominique Pozo: All right. And then, do you have any hobbies.

333
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.090
Galaxy S10: Oh, yeah.

334
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.710
Galaxy S10: I love. I like to draw. I like to

335
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.090
Galaxy S10: I'd like to do arts and crafts, you know,

336
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.140
Galaxy S10: I think that's about it.

337
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:09.540
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

338
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.180
Dominique Pozo: Drawing and coughing. That's great. That's a lot.

339
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.490
Dominique Pozo: All right.

340
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.410
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

341
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:17.460
Yeah.

342
00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.250
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so let's see. Um,

343
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:48.090
Dominique Pozo: Alright, so we're getting close to the end here and just want to come up with maybe like six short term goals that maybe we can imagine you either meeting or we can check in around them in July and and

344
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.280
Dominique Pozo: Just see how you're doing.

345
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.710
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

346
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:53.400
I'm

347
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.080
Just maybe

348
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.030
Dominique Pozo: If you want to name them all. Just put them in your in your treatment plan.

349
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.210
Galaxy S10: Excuse me. Um, I would really like to stop smoking that would

350
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.450
Galaxy S10: smoke cigarettes and that's one thing that I would really love you.

351
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:17.790
Galaxy S10: Know I like I

352
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.580
Galaxy S10: Like I said, like Jones, the other day.

353
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.350
Galaxy S10: Time.

354
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:23.310
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

355
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:29.730
Galaxy S10: Uh, one thing at a time. But that was that's one of the things that I would really love to be able to do

356
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.460
Galaxy S10: I would love to be able to

357
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:34.800
Galaxy S10: Potty Train My granddaughter.

358
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:36.450
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

359
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:44.100
Galaxy S10: Great. That's a good one. If that's if that works that that's one of them that would be. She is such a hard and she's just like a mother.

360
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:55.470
Galaxy S10: But that's you know that that's a real struggle for me right now. And that gives me a lot of stress because he just refuses have anything to do with the toilet.

361
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:56.400
Haha

362
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:05.040
Galaxy S10: Almost three. So July is a birthday, and I told her the other day that she's not getting tired fabric, they should getting campers because

363
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:12.360
Galaxy S10: The bathroom. But of course, as a joke, you know, she does all can be

364
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.890
Galaxy S10: Sure, yeah, that that's one thing that I would really like to do

365
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.110
Galaxy S10: I would like to

366
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:37.050
Galaxy S10: I really don't want to be on the Suboxone program, but I don't. I would like to try to get off of that, just as quickly as I possibly can, you know, that I know that that's a process, but for me.

367
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:38.430
I

368
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:44.790
Galaxy S10: I've come to the realization that I don't want any, anything that that

369
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:55.770
Galaxy S10: A binding to me. You know what I mean I my and make myself understood, because I really don't know how to say that I'm more clearly.

370
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:04.620
Galaxy S10: Because I've been wrapped up so so much and you know that control my life. And this just seems like another

371
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.270
Galaxy S10: Another bondage, you know, um, so that that's

372
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.670
Galaxy S10: Something that I would like to try to, you know, work through just as quickly as I can.

373
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.640
Galaxy S10: And

374
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.490
Galaxy S10: I mean, I really don't.

375
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:28.560
Galaxy S10: Like to start by back to school, but I really don't think that that's going to be something that is a short term goal.

376
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:44.010
Galaxy S10: Honestly, but that would be something that I would really like to be able to do and just finished at the very least finish my associates degree. So now, and I don't really know how quickly that will happen. So, or if that would even be something that would be that I could

377
00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:54.630
Galaxy S10: Try to work on right now because I'm so involved with this with my granddaughter, and she's really not on any sort of schedule whatsoever.

378
00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:06.240
Galaxy S10: Go to sleep at any specific times and I'll wake up at any specific time. So it just kind of makes it, you know, hard for me to kind of do what I need to do as far as that goes. So

379
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:19.830
Galaxy S10: That's maybe something that I'd like to start looking into because it's really important for me because when I got my GED. And I started going to college. That was huge for me, you know, that was

380
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:26.070
Galaxy S10: That was enormous. That was one of the biggest milestones. I've ever

381
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:29.070
Galaxy S10: Accomplished

382
00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:31.770
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

383
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:32.670
Galaxy S10: That would be

384
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.850
Galaxy S10: That would be something that I would want it.

385
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.000
Galaxy S10: Was working on to, um,

386
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:58.920
Galaxy S10: But I mean, really, I think that's about it. I mean, I really can't think of anything else that that's that pressing for me or that I could think of that I would want it to do immediately. You know what I mean, like, three months ago is a very short short time.

387
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.540
Galaxy S10: Frame

388
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:04.740
Galaxy S10: You know,

389
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:20.820
Dominique Pozo: Well, I have two questions so far. So when you say you want to stop smoking cigarettes. How would you go about that. Do you have some first steps you can take. So I can put that in your plan is

390
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.230
Dominique Pozo: You know, what could you do to move in that direction.

391
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.400
Galaxy S10: I suppose I could

392
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.470
Galaxy S10: You don't want to those white lines or whatever and see if they can

393
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.290
Galaxy S10: What they can do to to the smoking cessation.

394
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:47.730
Galaxy S10: And see words that leads me and it's hard because my husband smokes do so.

395
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.170
Galaxy S10: Gonna have to be unified

396
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:53.700
Go. Yeah.

397
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:57.120
Galaxy S10: You know,

398
00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:09.870
Galaxy S10: I can't force him to do something that he doesn't want to do. But that's something that I want to do, you know, because I, you know, go through all this and do what I'm doing.

399
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:18.930
Galaxy S10: To be better in my life. I think that's one of the things that I really have to think

400
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:28.950
Galaxy S10: Think about because you know if I'm going to change this area of my life really should come along with it. I think you

401
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:35.730
Galaxy S10: Know, I mean, if I'm going to be up that if I'm going to be a better person. You're not be addicted to

402
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:47.070
Galaxy S10: take pills. And I think that that's something that I need to kind of, I didn't there to you know make that make that a part of this journey.

403
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:55.470
Dominique Pozo: Definitely. I think that's, that's great. It's looking at all the addictions and not being dependent on anything. Sounds like

404
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.460
Galaxy S10: Fun. I've got it.

405
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.120
Galaxy S10: I've got a baby here. You know what I mean. I thought I was done, I

406
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.680
Galaxy S10: Have my kids tired after my twins. And I thought, no, I haven't. Good skin, you know,

407
00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:16.200
Galaxy S10: And behold, here's this little girl and you know I need to be around here for a while. You know what I mean.

408
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:25.230
Galaxy S10: I've been a smoker for 30 some years, you know, and so that's something that that really presses on me.

409
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:42.390
Galaxy S10: On a daily basis. You know that I need to be here for her because if I'm going to make this change for her and her being my driving force for this and I need to turn it in the same in that in that arena. Yep.

410
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:54.480
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well I'm gonna throw out a couple potential goals. How would making it to your weekly group sessions. Would that be a goal that you'd like

411
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.260
Yeah.

412
00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:56.790
Galaxy S10: Yeah.

413
00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.740
Dominique Pozo: And then

414
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.430
Dominique Pozo: And then as far as individual therapy or you do have a therapist at the moment.

415
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.940
Dominique Pozo: 25 oh you're

416
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:21.240
Dominique Pozo: Just you just froze up i i was saying, do you have a therapist at the moment that you're seeing individually.

417
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:35.400
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Okay. How often would you like to meet with me. We can we can meet weekly bi weekly or monthly and you know this is a part. It's an important part of at least in the beginning to have that support.

418
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:42.420
Galaxy S10: Right. Um, I think probably weekly would be good. I mean, initially, and

419
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:49.230
Galaxy S10: Yeah. And then, you know, maybe go down from there. But I mean,

420
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:55.710
Galaxy S10: To me, I think it is a very crucial point part of this, this whole

421
00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.870
Galaxy S10: This whole decision to to do things differently because

422
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.270
Galaxy S10: I think it's not just a physical dependency, but it's also a psychological dependency and somehow

423
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:14.370
Galaxy S10: There's something not connecting right in there.

424
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.360
Galaxy S10: You don't even need to figure out why.

425
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:25.680
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, okay. Well, so I'm going to place that is one of the goals to can you hear me, looks like you froze up

426
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:38.850
Dominique Pozo: Yeah okay I'm gonna put for now attending weekly individual therapy sessions will be another short term goal. Does that sound good.

427
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:40.500
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, okay.

428
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:54.870
Dominique Pozo: Right. And then let's another you know very I think meaningful goal could be something about self care. Is there, is there some

429
00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:07.290
Dominique Pozo: Form of self care that you really enjoy doing and maybe you're not doing enough of it and you can commit to doing more of it, however, that feels doable and, you know, however you want to word that

430
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.200
Dominique Pozo: Oops.

431
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.710
Dominique Pozo: Can you hear me.

432
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:25.950
Dominique Pozo: Can you hear me.

433
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.040
Galaxy S10: Yeah. Can you hear me.

434
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.180
Dominique Pozo: Yes, yes.

435
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.580
Dominique Pozo: Oh, okay.

436
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.600
Galaxy S10: Hold on a second.

437
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:42.120
Galaxy S10: I'm on an Android. So I have to go off. I've just scroll through the pages to get to the speaker.

438
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.040
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah, look.

439
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.820
Galaxy S10: Scroll you out of before it gets to the speaker.

440
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:56.580
Galaxy S10: I think, more, more than anything, I'd like to be able to to take a little time for myself because I don't get a whole lot of that.

441
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:07.560
Galaxy S10: Okay, so, you know, just to have a little bit of because my my life revolves around my husband and my kids are my daughter, my granddaughter, I should say.

442
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.820
Galaxy S10: And so my whole world is wrapped around them so

443
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:18.870
Galaxy S10: From beginning to the end of the day, that's my life and I think I forget about me some time.

444
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:32.160
Galaxy S10: I think that that would probably be a goal is to maybe take a little time just for myself, you know, just to clear my head and be able to

445
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.890
Galaxy S10: Take care of me, you know. Yeah. Okay.

446
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:47.400
Dominique Pozo: Great. Okay. That's good. I think that's enough for now have short term goals and then I put completing your criminal justice program your school I put that as one long

447
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:48.060
Term goal.

448
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:59.880
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Okay. And then just. These are the last few questions here. Are there any people you can call for support. Do you have

449
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:03.840
Dominique Pozo: Do you have that right now. I know you mentioned a few friends.

450
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:08.340
Galaxy S10: Yeah, I have a My best friend is led

Dominique Pozo: Okay.

454
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:23.910
Dominique Pozo: And then what is so when you take that time for yourself what is one

455
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:30.870
Dominique Pozo: Activity or behavior that you can do that is related to self soothing and self care for you.

456
00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.160
Galaxy S10: I think. Yeah.

457
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:36.780
Galaxy S10: Just like

458
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.050
Galaxy S10: Even just a bubble bath, where I have

459
00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:47.550
Galaxy S10: Like my husband and whenever I take a, take a few minutes to myself like you have to be right in the middle of of that.

460
00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.980
Galaxy S10: I feel like I think that

461
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:57.600
Galaxy S10: That's what a bubble bath or a walk or, you know, something, something like that.

462
00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:59.520
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. Okay.

463

Dominique Pozo: Okay, and then this is part of just the relapse prevention piece have been able to name what or can you name any significant things that trigger you emotionally

465
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:29.100
Galaxy S10: I don't, I really don't have a trigger. This, to me, it's not that kind of an addiction. I don't, I don't know how to explain that it's not

466
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:41.820
Galaxy S10: Something that I seek out. It's something that I just want to be rid of. So there isn't really anything that I can think that'd be like, Oh, that makes me want to use. You know what I mean, I don't

467
00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:42.030
Know,

468
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:50.940
Galaxy S10: Kind of an extent, for me, I just wanted the off potatoes altogether. You know what I mean. And really, no.

469
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.580
Galaxy S10: There's nothing that would i don't think that would trigger me to to want to go and

470
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.860
Galaxy S10: Kill all that that's not that kind of an addiction for me.

471
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.090
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

472
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:09.330

473
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:11.520
Dominique Pozo: Can upset you.

474
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:18.840
Galaxy S10: I think with my husband. I think more and more than anything, it's

475
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:20.970
Galaxy S10: My granddaughter.

476
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.530
Galaxy S10: When it comes to her so

477
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.840
Galaxy S10: Yeah, that

478
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:36.720
Dominique Pozo: Sounds like it. Well, here's something that I'm happy to offer up to you all to, I don't know how your husband.

479
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:48.030
Dominique Pozo: feels about therapy. But if you guys are really struggling, you can bring him in. We can have a couple session and you can really talk through some of the the discord that's going on and how to get maybe on the same team around it.

480
00:49:49.170 --> 00:50:00.900
Dominique Pozo: I actually, I do really enjoy working with couples and I I use a lot of compassionate communication skills and that's kind of a lens that I really like to live through and work through of

481
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:01.650
Galaxy S10: You know, really.

482
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:08.310
Dominique Pozo: Being able to identify needs and feelings and then making requests on how to how to work together.

483
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.660
Galaxy S10: Yeah, we can definitely

484
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.400
Galaxy S10: We can definitely check into that a little bit later. Let's

485
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:21.480
Galaxy S10: You know, let me get through this.

486
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:24.420
Dominique Pozo: This initial definitely

487
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.050
Dominique Pozo: You know,

488
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:26.760

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.220
Galaxy S10: You and then. Yeah.

490
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:36.600
Galaxy S10: We can definitely bring him, and if that's something that he chooses to do. I don't know how he was all about that. I've never even asked him.

491
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.590
Galaxy S10: I haven't even been brought up ever

492
00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:45.420
Galaxy S10: We don't really have. We don't have a contentious relationship whatsoever.

493
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:52.380
Galaxy S10: It's the only the only part that we really don't see eye to eye on is my granddaughter, you know, and it's more. So just because he doesn't

494
00:50:52.950 --> 00:51:01.290
Galaxy S10: Have no boundaries and she knows that, you know, and so yeah and I do so you know she behaves completely different with me and he knows that to, you know,

495
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:16.710
Galaxy S10: She just behaves differently with me and then she does with him. And it's because he has no boundaries, no limits and so that that really causes that a bit of an issue. But other than that, we have a pretty good relationship.

496
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:22.380
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well good. It sounds like for the most part you all are able to really support each other and

497
00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:23.910
Dominique Pozo: That's uh

498
00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:27.600
Galaxy S10: Yeah, he's a very he's very supportive.

499
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:28.440

504
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.920
Galaxy S10: Oddly enough, you don't have nothing to do with the toilet. But she's got her training center.

Galaxy S10: Go with your gut Buffy not up here in just a minute. Okay, come on. Go get changed. Oh, go, go, go, go.

508
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:31.230

509
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:33.450

510
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:39.480
