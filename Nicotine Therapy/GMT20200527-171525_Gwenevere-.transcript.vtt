Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's going good. I ended up traveling on Monday, I was on an airplane.

8
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So I had to cancel my appointments and now I'm in a, I guess it's like a Dark Zone in Wi Fi. There's like nobody's getting my texts out here. I can't sometimes them receive them, sometimes I don't. It's a nightmare. I'm so used to big city where everything goes through, like, I'm like,

9
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like a. Now, what do you mean you didn't get my text. And sure enough, there's this big red exclamation mark that says not delivered. Like, what the f is that

10
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.540
Jay: My phone does that

11
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.100
Jay: In the beginning of the month because I guess the payment plan is on the beginning of a month, instead of the month.

12
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.650
Jay: So, and

13
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.550

Jay: Yeah, mine does that all the time.

15
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not used to it. It's pissing me off, man.

Jay: Oh yeah, good.

22
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

23
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice to be out here. It's quite dry.

24
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very dry very dry, but my hair behave so much better.

Jay: Okay.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.140
Jay: Let me try another one.

Jay: Doing pretty good. I wish I could show you more at a time.

46
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.900
Jay: I have a collage, though, I got a cup level.

47
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.550
Jay: Let's do this one first.

48
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Oh, I like I could really see the face down on the bottom right.

49
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.160
Jay: Yeah, that one's a good one.

50
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, and almost looks like it's the shape of the dude's head that that makes the challenge for you know

51
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.340
Jay: Yeah, it's because you have to go. You have to curve with the head to get it and then you have to blend it.

52
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.810
Jay: Yeah, um, let me see. I got one more.

53
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.370
Jay: For me, I got a bunch more. But throw individual

54
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What about starting your own business. What are your thoughts on that.

55
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.980
Jay: That's what I'm doing. I just started a business page on Facebook and everything.

56
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. JS faith that rolls right off the tongue to I really like it.

57
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.720
Jay: And then this was my original

58
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.080
Jay: I guess virtual business card.

59
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.400
Jay: This one that I've been thrown on Facebook like crazy.

60
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do people. Um, they just hit you up on your cell phone like hey, come. Here's my address come over

61
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Wow.

62
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.910
Jay: I do house pizza, Tony.

63
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And nobody's freaking out about Corona coven SARS, whatever. That's called this week. No.

64
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.540
Jay: I mean, if they are. They don't seem to me.

65
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.970
Jay: That people are doing bad

66
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, I need my rich done

67
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Over here I got my camera up above my route lines. So I look like a blonde.

68
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't do me any good when I tell everybody does it.

69
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to do I need to learn to zip it

70
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.720
Jay: To your own secret.

71
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Out myself.

72
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But I always go for the job. That's why I say that's my fly go for the joke I always go into the joke.

73
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so you've been busy loving that okay here's, here's the $50,000 question.

74
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been throwing up

75
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.910
Jay: Not at all.

76
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

77
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.130
Jay: No, we did it.

78
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.530
Jay: That's cool.

79
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so cool.

80
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.070
Jay: And I've been sitting in such a better mood. I'm working all the time.

81
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.500
Jay: I just feel much better.

82
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of ask the right questions keep in communication with people because you never know what little phrase what little thing, then you'll get somebody who knows something about something that's

83
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: JUST ASKED THE RIGHT THING. The more we keep talking. Someone knows some little nugget.

84
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That can make the difference. You know,

85
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:24.750
Jay: That's what I was telling my step dad day before yesterday. It's crazy how just changing one of my medications made that much difference.

86
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm just glad to be a part of that.

87
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Victorious

88
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.200
Jay: Now, I still get I still get like six my stomach. You know, like I feel like I want to throw up. But it passes.

89
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:52.350
Jay: Okay. It comes in waves and see. That's how it was before. I used to throw up and it would come in waves, it would happen for, like, you know, an hour or two and then it would stop for about six. This was while I was in prison.

90
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

91
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.270
Jay: That's when they were telling me that it was my liver liver and

92
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that that piece is still there. Right.

93
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. So that sounds like liver and then what may have been the add on is the allergy to the analog zone.

94
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.230
Jay: Yes. And that was having me throw the ball do everything.

95
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so that, so maybe that's what we're to

96
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I could run across the person that could fix my ears, make it all about me today. Shall we know. Hahaha. All right, let me open a note for us.

97
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we're busy and how has your mind been hasn't been trying to mess with you until you ain't worth it. You're not going to make it. Let's go use or has it been saying hey we're kicking ass we're doing great. Look, we're feeling better, we're on the right track.

98
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.430
Jay: Yeah, it's I've had plenty of opportunities to use and I didn't

99
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.330
Jay: Um, I'm just, I'm trying to get that money.

100
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.310
You

101
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, are you, are you on the side are you dealing at all.

102
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.130
Jay: What do you mean

103
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you selling drugs at all.

104
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.160
Jay: No, no.

105
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Just asking. Because sometimes when people want money, they go that route and it scares me only because there's a lot at stake with

106
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.250
Jay: You. Yeah.

107
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:15.930
Jay: You did, yeah. But that was that was before my haircuts started coming into play. Yeah.

108
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And I gotta tell you, for someone is conservatives me to get on an airplane with a kid the world because I'm like dad loves math wash your food. I'm like cuckoo. It says to me, that we're starting to open up

109
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.750
Jay: Yeah.

110
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if I'm out willing to go out there, then the message must be getting out to us cuckoo birds.

111
00:08:47.100 --> 00:09:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this little path in my garage. Like I would only come back from Costco and only I could walk through this little blue path. So yeah, my family's like okay then and now she's on an airplane. What this is not the reality we're used to. So

112
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope I'm not killing everyone in my family, having traveled, but they said, go for it. Let's do it.

113
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm excited. I think our economy is going to make it through. We've got to be working

114
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so. The reason I got on a plane is because what I was hearing was the viral load right the infection pressure, it needs to be like high like

115
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, wow, that much of that viral load right the much as much of it, versus, you know, my chicken. The rapping on the plastic, not so much. So

116
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, I hope it's true because I went shopping for the first time without wiping everything down. So if I'm sick and 40 days you'll go. I'm gonna go and have your was right. She needs to wipe down that chicken.

117
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so business is going well. We have a deep, we're back to. So the baseline misery.

118
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Not funny but kind of fine and then

119
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We have YOU'RE GETTING GETTING A LITTLE desperate in the thinking because you really needed money and remind me again what the urgency is for the money. What, what's the intensity of needing money for

120
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:31.140
Jay: Oh well, at the time it was because I wanted to buy an ounce. A week and I didn't have the money. Hmm. That's what it started out as and then

121
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:40.080
Jay: I started seeing that I could be self sufficient. So I haven't gotten gas or cigarettes and my mom. I've got

122
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.400
Jay: Nothing in the past month. So that's the urgency of is, I want to be self sufficient.

123
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it. Want to be an adult, want to be on your own not dependent

124
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:52.950
Jay: And I just wanted

125
00:10:53.460 --> 00:11:05.550
Jay: To my mom and my stepdad that I really am trying to change and I might not be able to get a paying job right now, but I can get out there and hustle, the legitimate way and make just as much money.

126
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But you do see the irony right of the stinking thinking. Right. That said, why don't you go sell some to have a legitimate life, you do see that how fucked up. That is right.

127
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.070
Jay: In the beginning it was just for me. That's what I was going to sell drugs for was

128
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter.

129
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you hear it. You hear it.

130
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, Mom and Dad, I was trying to do the right thing. I was trying so I sold drugs.

131
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If those don't go together. Do they

132
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.270
Jay: Talk about here cuz

133
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. But I asked you earlier. Let me make sure.

134
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier. Were you thinking of selling selling drugs and you said yes. Starting to in order to make money to have weed.

135
00:11:50.160 --> 00:12:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you see the two things of I'm trying to be an independent person who doesn't get in trouble anymore and ended up, but I'm going to do it by selling a drug, those two things they don't they don't go together. That's what I'm trying to point out

136
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.160
Jay: The person just because I thought about it doesn't mean I put the process in play, right.

137
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And it right. Is it didn't get done. And is it because you saw in your mind. They don't go together. They don't go together. I got to do a legit thing.

138
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.850
Jay: I'm not a good drug dealer. Oh.

139
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That can't be the answer.

140
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.170
Jay: all end up getting high. That's my answer.

141
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we'll go with that. For now, I guess.

142
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I was kind of hoping you would see the the incongruity of it.

143
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.150
Is

144
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it would be a bit hypocritical to say, hey, I want this law abiding life. But over here. Wow. Wink, wink wink wink.

145
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But the truth of the matter is,

146
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You had it and you must have countered. It was something just in time to not take action on it.

147
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you say to yourself, it got you to not sell

148
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.890
Jay: Well, end up getting on a good night.

149
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:11.940
Got it.

150
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And how is it that you're still running into opportunities. Well, you're hanging out with us. There's different opportunities that you've had to decline.

151
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:37.080
Jay: No, it's not that I'm hanging out with them. It's the people's hair cut, because I have to go to people's houses to click through. So naturally, I'm stepping into whatever environment that

152
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:38.460
Jay: I got it.

153
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.410
Jay: I didn't think about it at first, until, until it happened to me.

154
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.390
Jay: And I had the situation. Good. And I'm just professional

155
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.180
Jay: If it's not about the money. If it's not about the haircut.

156
00:13:51.900 --> 00:14:02.460
Jay: Then I don't talk about it. I don't gossip about people. I don't, you know what I mean, if they asked me if I know somebody yeah i'll tell you if I know somebody, but I can tell you how a normal. You know what I mean.

157
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:08.880
Jay: Okay, about the haircut business or you know what they got going on in their life. I don't talk about it.

158
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:19.410
Jay: So whenever they start getting high in the living room while was cutting hair. I just stayed in homes on. You know what I mean, collect my money and left.

159
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.560
Jay: That's happened about three times now.

160
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So on one hand it's great that you got to have real time testing you got tested.

161
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But just notice you pass those tests, but you've also said, watch.

162
00:14:40.770 --> 00:15:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm around it all us so they exist at the same time. This one might be a bit of some rationalization saying I need the money. I can do this. I can have what you guys call willpower. You think that that's the case. But having the stuff nearby all someone may do is say, you know what

163
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Just do a little and you like the person you're talking to. And this looks like fun. It's high risk. Somebody's got to say it, you know, your therapist is the one to do it. I'll be the bad guy here.

164
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So I love that you're you're making money, but it is high risk.

165
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: With those folks, is there any one more step that you could take because it's really I don't want to see it. I don't want to know that you're doing it. I don't want to smell it. I, you know what I mean, even if you get a sense that for a lot of people are quite the trigger, because

166
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It the memory connection with a sense of something

167
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just

168
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.860
Jay: My triggers are syringes spoons.

169
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.180
Jay: And

170
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.640
Jay: The dope that goes in them. You know what I mean. So if there's smoking. It doesn't bother me never has because that

171
00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Okay. Well, that's a good sign. But you know how life is. Right. You know, you now there's going to be a syringe a suede is because it messes with you. It's going to test you like that. So here's my question because I got to do the therapist dance here. Okay.

172
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there one thing that you could say, Hey, Joe. Cool, cool, cool. We're down for tomorrow, noon, your place. Got the address here it is just texting confirm Coco. Cool.

173
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This will be your style. You're not going to talk like me. Obviously, I'm in. I'm recovery. I can't, I can't be around any alcohol.

174
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Any weed. It can't be around any dope. Is it going to be cool if I'm away from that for just even the 45 minutes that I'm over there cutting your hair. Oh yeah, man. No problem. No problem. No problem. Now, that's the way I talk right. I know it's very square

175
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But in your world. If I was a customer.

176
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we do a quick role play. Can I just see what you come up with on what you could do to protect your recovery. Because honestly, everything's at stake.

177
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.940
Jay: Does not bother me.

178
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.440
Jay: I know

179
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It can you indulge me

180
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.080
Yeah.

181
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Gimme gimme gimme a name of a customer who would who would I be

182
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Benny

183
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Isaac.

184
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, Jay, I saw your ad on Facebook. Nice fades. Man, can you come by tomorrow at four I can text you my address

185
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.030
Jay: That's what I do. I just text.

186
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm Isaac. What do you say to me right to me.

187
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.840
Jay: So yeah, which is

188
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, if you were protecting your recovery. If you because you may, you may not take what I'm saying. Seriously. And, and so then you're going to say, oh, doesn't bother me.

189
00:17:52.200 --> 00:18:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's say you did because we're just making believe right now we're pretending. What could you text or say to me, to protect your recovery, because it is central to your life.

190
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.230
Jay: As well.

191
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend we're talking

192
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:21.780
Jay: Just like you said that I'm in recovery. I don't know how I see it. I would have to be on the food. It's kind of doing these role plays and stuff like that the situation is not bothering this kind of it just

193
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.170
Jay: I think we can have something

194
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:31.920
Jay: I think about something better than that, nothing that I'm doing. It's not bothering me. You know I'm saying

195
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's shift gears to just imagine that you were selling

196
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.240
Jay: Okay.

197
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you said there'd be temptation is the because it's in your hand.

198
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:49.830
Jay: Yeah, because they know I could do whatever I want with it. If I want to go get high and go give me this range, and I can get high.

199
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.110
Jay: So because all it takes.

200
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:59.280
Jay: All it takes is for me to have the dope in my pocket and that one misfire in my mind, and I'm going to get hot.

201
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.120
Jay: It's a lot easier for me to

202
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.490
Jay: Ignore it.

203
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.640
Jay: If I don't have it on you to me.

204
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.120
Jay: Because I no longer look for it. I no longer jump on my phone and try to find it. I've cut the

205
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:28.500
Jay: Cut my reaction time to wanting to get high. You know I'm saying, Yeah, when I want to go. Hi. The, the thought in the craving doesn't last as long as it used to.

206
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:29.640
Jay: And I think

207
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:43.680
Jay: That that's because I've been being more vigilant and I've been being more on top of shit. You know what I mean, I'm starting to realize I'm starting to realize that there's a different approach to life.

208
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:53.160
Jay: You know, before I knew I could get a job and work and get money my hardest part was finding the job. So what am I going to do now. I can't do nothing.

209
00:19:53.730 --> 00:20:14.940
Jay: Can you money for gas money for cigarettes. Screw it. This guy's gonna give me a 20 I could sell half of that. Give me my tail books and get high. You know what I mean that's how my old mind would be right, but now I got this outlet where I can go here and it's it's different. I know.

210
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.950
Jay: It's a totally different approach to life. It's different lifestyle than trying to embrace it.

211
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it feels totally different for you.

212
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the dopes not in your pocket and there's no one misfire

213
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But from out here from a distance from far far distance. This is how it looks out here. Look at my here's my shoulder and someone says, you know, a man

214
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't actually have any money. But here I just stuck in your pocket a bag.

215
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know you're saying the eight. It doesn't bother me.

216
00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on the side of mitigating which minimizing any risk. Like, that's the site. I'm on to protect you. I don't care about the addict. Like, I have no respect for him. And you'll see that again and again I care about you.

217
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to fight for you and I'm going to be saying, as if you were like this, this little boy right. I'm not going to have it around so that you could accidentally because look at how far away my pocket is from that couch or that coffee table that's five steps away.

218
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How quickly could get to my pocket and one misfire to me literally logistically inches and feet away.

219
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: From such a

220
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Use you could use. So I know I hear what you're saying.

221
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder if there is some minimization, because maybe you're like,

222
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't tell me I can't do hair like that might be the big thing. Like when, don't, don't even try and get away with this. I'm finally doing something awesome don't don't don't mess with it. Is that kind of what you're thinking.

223
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:06.960
Jay: No, I mean, I just, I've been in these situations that you're talking about guys still owes me 10 bucks, because he thought he could pay me and dope.

224
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.080
Jay: Those three days ago. And that's why I said Isaac, because that's one

225
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.630
Jay: And I'm still waiting on him to pay me but

226
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.390
Jay: I will cut his hair again unless he pays

227
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.210
Jay: Nice document.

228
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Itself that that does feel the difference

229
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.870
Yeah.

230
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:40.470
Jay: I had one friend whenever I got out of prison and he totally just a disappointed me a couple weeks ago. So I don't have no friends. So the way I see it is

231
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.310
Jay: I'm not doing for nobody unless

232
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.510
Jay: They got some money unless it's worth my time and it's I feel with my time. So my needs some help and I feel like they need to know

233
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.450
Jay: But I'm no longer putting myself out.

234
00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:07.770
Jay: For other people because I'm sick of feeling pushed out left behind and you know I get blamed for why am I getting blame somebody else problems. And one thing

235
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:15.900
Jay: You did. And so now I'm just, I don't got no friends like this guy, Isaac. I've known him for us but

236
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.670
Jay: He's not my friend. He's a customer.

237
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.680
Jay: So if you don't got my money. I don't got a conversation

238
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. This is a professional relationship. This is a business transaction know bartering I don't barter just cash money.

239
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.420
Jay: Will see and I told him. It's crazy, because you sell drugs and you ain't gonna fucking money.

240
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.560
Jay: The Hill. You know what I mean, what's wrong with that the whole time. He said, My cherry talked about biggest volume, he was

241
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, please. He's got the money it's gotten 10 boards. Give me a break.

242
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.680
Jay: That's what I said. I was like, but it's cool.

243
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.250
Jay: Like, keep it rubbing your chest. Don't ask me from there as you got my money. Yeah.

244
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what happened with your friend.

245
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:02.730
Jay: Now he just

246
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.400
Jay: He called me at one o'clock in the morning he woke me up. You know what I mean. And

247
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.760
Jay: He wanted me to go take us a week. That's almost one o'clock.

248
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.320
Jay: And

249
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.370
Jay: So he takes me back to that I need help. So I texted what's going on. He didn't text me back, and I fell back asleep.

250
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

251
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:33.270
Jay: I woke up, I woke back up the next morning and I'm blocked on his account, his girlfriend, he texts me from her account telling me to stay in my own lane, and then I'm blanking on her account.

252
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.160
Jay: Oxide. He wanted to take my joy and want to collect because he was tweeting

253
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: He's using math.

254
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:45.780
Jay: Yeah, he started using it.

255
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.330
Jay: So I'm good. I don't need no friend.

256
00:24:51.750 --> 00:25:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, what if we look at more like you do. But first thing change people, places, things you're changing your people, you're, you're doing a huge step, huge, huge, huge

257
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was DIPPING INTO THE PLACES thing. Try and keep it real safe. Okay, but I can. I heard a little bit more. And it's like, you know, you're actively staying you're awake and

258
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Conscious but remember the addict is smarter than all of us. It's pretty slick okay smarter than all ever be.

259
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And and that's why we say it's kind of baffling and all that it will find a way to convince you that getting even closer and closer and closer to it is fine because guess what I did find last time I'll be fine. This time. And then the third time, but the 54th time

260
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: There's that one. How did you call it.

261
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: misfires

262
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It happened to be on a day when someone broke a promise and you felt small stupid something like the combination of some kind of effort update just. That's it. I'm done.

263
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:04.470
Jay: We'll see that day after all that stuff happened because it wasn't just him. There was a girl.

264
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:16.560
Jay: That did something similar. She, she started going out with the dude. And I had my fire stick should at her house was like hope you don't think I'm a dick, but can't get my stuff that I mean I don't want him take my shit.

265
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:29.670
Jay: She started getting stupid like, Oh, well, I wanted to be with you and this and that. But this and that. And I'm like, first of all, you don't say nothing to nobody. So how you're going to blame me for that. And number two, I'm done.

266
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:30.810
Jay: Don't talk

267
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:38.640
Jay: Don't text me I don't got nothing for you. I'm not the reason why you with this dude. You don't seem like why are you blaming me for that.

287
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.360
Jay: I'm enjoying talking about my haircut.

Jay: Well, I mean, kind of

292
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:48.750
Jay: What is

293
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:57.570
Jay: The comb over come over nowadays is a comb over with the hard part. So basically, it's going to be long hair on top. It's going to be blended in

294
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:08.850
Jay: A little bit longer on the site. It's not really but there's nothing in the back. It goes all the way up to the cowlick in the back. You know what I mean. They have lays over

295
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:21.330
Jay: And there's a part right here and you put it with the clippers in that seat. Then there's a gentleman's cut, which is similar but you you don't go as far up with the with the zero

296
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.410
Jay: And you still coming over. And it's, you know, it's what the old man. Good.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

311
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.110
Jay: In the back whenever you do the zero too long.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I the clipper I handle that. It's just right on the clipper comes in, it's right at that line that I get a little bit like I'd like it to be smoother.

318
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've also done that thing where, you know, you take that here like this. Like so long part and then I take a different one. And I literally shave like not with shape, but try and make that part like really deeper thing.

319
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.620
Jay: That's called the hard part. The

320
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard part I do the hard part and

321
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And and a lot of years ago I did when it was cute. You know, I did a little lightning bolt.

322
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: In the background sounds like, well, let's see how it goes will grow back in a few days, if I mess it up real a lightning bolt in the back of his head. That's pretty good.

323
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Books now.

324
00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's not cool.

325
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What about us ladies, you don't want to give us any attention. Why don't you want to cut her hair.

326
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you want to cut our hair.

327
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:13.590
Jay: I mean, I will. I just, I never have.

328
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:14.790
Uh huh.

329
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.690
Jay: I think one thing

330
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.150
Jay: I learned my girlfriend's here one time.

331
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And did she like it.

332
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.340
Jay: Yeah, but

333
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.800
Jay: I don't know, I'm not comfortable enough to solicit

334
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got you, I got you.

335
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:34.290
Jay: I wouldn't

336
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:39.630
Jay: If I go to school for this. That's what I want to go to school for us to do women's here.

337
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let me hear it now I'm hearing. Now let's talk

338
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.390
Jay: I know how to do man's here.

339
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:58.380
Jay: But that's what I want to learn how to do is women's here because I see it as a to me. It's a type of art. It's an expression of work to me. Yeah, I take my time and I

340
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.560
Jay: Tell you might be over here. Good.

341
00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember this one time I was in South Beach.

342
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: As much younger and and this guy, this this hairdresser, and I go sit down.

343
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And he disappears. Right. He goes in the back and then I catch it catch an eye on what he's doing. I swear. He was like psyching himself up for it.

344
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And then he came to my chair and he liked stared at my head. I got, I don't have a lot going on. It's not a lot to do here, but he had a mission that was like a spiritual thing for him. So he's looking at my head of hair and I swear he he just he grabbed it and when and then

345
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like,

346
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was like he was in some sort of trance, or something and he got into it like this is South Beach, like right on the beach. You know, he so when you said an art. It made me think of that guy like he wasn't just your regular

347
00:33:59.280 --> 00:33:59.520
Jay: Yeah.

348
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:01.710
Jay: You got into

349
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.080
Jay: Felton yeah

350
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, What is going on. I was like, okay.

351
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I like the passion. I like the passion. Okay.

352
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.190
Jay: Sometimes I get really into it too.

353
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.710
Jay: Yeah, like, yeah, there's a couple of the haircut. You could tell when I really got into it.

354
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.400
Jay: I mean just the photos I can look at them and tell you which ones.

355
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:36.240
Jay: I was really psyched about doing it's the type of hair because you could tell. Whenever you go in and start cutting some ways here how it's gonna turn out if it's real thin. Yeah, you know, you're gonna have shadows in it and it's gonna

356
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:37.890
Jay: It's

357
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell them to say, hey,

358
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you won't get this look. But if you let me do it longer, you won't have the. Do you like educate them a little bit

359
00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:53.310
Jay: For the most part, they tell me what they want.

360
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.910
Jay: Uh huh. I basically tell them what I'm going to do for them.

361
00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:01.350
Jay: Okay, I do what makes him look good. Like yesterday, this kid wanted

362
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.060
Jay: A high paid and instead, I did a medium pay

363
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.700
Jay: And good thing because ended up liking it.

364
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:15.810
Jay: Because the high paid to me would have looked to a military on him. He's graduating high school

365
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I was about to say that

366
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.240
Jay: So I left to go a little long on top and I do me a favor.

367
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So Jay, forgive me for getting excited but

368
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're thinking about going and getting trained. Yeah, where

369
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.550
Jay: I don't know, I owe student loans, so

370
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Much. So what, how much, how much do you all have you got

371
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.470
I'm

372
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.190
Jay: Only like 1600 dollars.

373
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

374
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's funny. Now,

375
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.360
Jay: I would have had paid off. But I went to prison for nine years.

376
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that money is going to get paid 1600 totally, totally doable, where

377
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying you haven't gone online and looked around at

378
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:12.210
Jay: Take you the truth when I still got jury trial in July. I'm expecting to go back to prison. So I'm really not trying to plan pass them.

379
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:25.110
Jay: Because then if it does happen. I'm going to prison and start getting high and prison because I'm going to feel like a failure, you know, to me, so I'm just trying to keep everything simple right now and just see what happens.

380
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.830
Jay: make as much money as I can do and what I do and

381
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:40.560
Jay: We'll see what happens after that my mom already said that she would help me pay for college courses. So we have a question. I told you scoot down here.

382
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So that we do know where

383
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we do number. Okay, so it's hard for me to buy in with that but you have taught me. You said listen

384
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I get down on myself when I perceive I failed, and I do know you have taught me that I'm think I'm gonna sneeze.

385
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not wait

386
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it past

387
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. It's gone.

388
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.240
Jay: Look up at the sun.

389
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.120
Jay: Light and it makes me sneeze.

390
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.640
Jay: Know, no.

391
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a bunch of dots in my eyes.

392
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, I wish I could

393
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Sweep that away for you that not wanting to feel like like a failure.

394
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I never did send you my

395
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I had so much going on. I don't think did I send you the perfectionism thing to ever get that done.

396
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.500
Jay: I think we did

397
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You asked for it to be sent to you. I just see if I put it in your text.

398
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.020
Jay: Might have

399
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Would have been maybe last week.

400
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking

401
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:16.680
Jay: Oh yeah, look. On May 11 I wrote down right here. I turned down submit this week, and I think that was brave.

402
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, oh man, it was

403
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:24.900
Jay: That's crazy.

404
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.480
Jay: That was on the 11th.

405
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.910
Jay: So I've been doing good.

406
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You're have. So this notion member I had started reading that perfectionism article. Right. Remember that you liked it. You said, Send it to me. I could have sworn I did but but the bottom line is you didn't finish reading it doesn't matter why or how but I want to

407
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even think because I'm on my laptop. I don't have anything on me. But I'll track it down again.

408
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But this thing that you do to yourself.

409
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're not allowed. Just you. Everybody else I imagine or wheel. Am I allowed to fail.

410
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:10.620
Jay: Yeah.

411
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What, wait what

412
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Get away with it.

413
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.800
Jay: Oh,

414
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you sit on it for a second, then you don't know why you do it. Yes, you do know. So think about it. Let's just play with that a little bit. Why do I get permission to fail. I get to start something. Do I get to stop halfway through change mine.

415
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I don't get permission to boy. If I started, I better finish it.

416
00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:44.250
Jay: Yeah, I mean,

417
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I changed my mind. I don't want to it anymore.

418
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:57.030
Jay: I don't know, I try to hold people to the weird I behave. So if I say I'm do some I'ma do it. So if somebody tells me they're gonna do something, I expect

419
00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.560
Jay: If not, if it's disrespectful. Okay.

420
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see if I can. I'm going to give a tangible example and sit with this for a few minutes because this is a core. This is a core belief you have about the way the world works and how you're supposed to be and it might rob you

421
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the riches.

422
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And opportunities that that life has to offer.

423
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I said,

424
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Heck, it just happened. I started this concrete job three different things. I did the knockdown

425
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And these are things I've

426
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: NEVER DONE BEFORE find you so I did it, I was like, Oh my gosh, it looks like some of the knockdown is, um, you know, the texture is coming off. So I'm talking to my uncles and

427
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, is this me. Is this the wrong composition is too much water like what the heck is that, did I just scrape the whole damn thing off.

428
00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And they looked and I put the camera and they said, now it looks like it's just the edge and it's just a thinner, you should be fine. And so then so so I'm in New Mexico. Now, and that is literally exposed with no seal. No pain.

429
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of me.

430
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.290
Jay: Oh,

431
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, I left it incomplete undone and I flew to New Mexico and it rains there. It's so rainy in Florida right now is like rained on getting rained on right now. What do you think of me.

432
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.030
Jay: That's you. That's you, that's your own project.

433
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, come on. Be one next level. This is this, you can do it. What do you think of me that I dropped that project and left it half done and I could be causing harm to the very thing that I work so hard at. Come on.

434
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:54.180
Jay: In order for me to compose an opinion. I would have to see multiple situations of that.

435
00:41:55.350 --> 00:42:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So you would want to see a pattern of I start and stop start and stop start and stop then you would formulate What opinion of me, what would it be, do you think

436
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.020
Jay: Which don't finish your projects.

437
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you want to know why.

438
00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You sure you want it. Or maybe I'm just not trustworthy and you really can't rely on her because she doesn't finish where she starts

439
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:20.790
Jay: Know,

440
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd want to know.

441
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, guess what might be two reasons, I might start and stop multiple projects.

442
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.440
Jay: One time there.

443
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.020
Jay: Was a lot of different

444
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.060
Yeah.

445
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you just now you got to keep it. Keep it real with me. No, no, you got no time to hide anything from me. Right.

446
00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there any moment where you thought

447
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What a loser.

448
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.210
Jay: Know,

449
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Why she finished her shit didn't think of those things.

450
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:07.860
Jay: Know,

451
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did that to yourself.

452
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But your justifications for stopping something whenever you want.

453
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not a good enough reason

454
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder why that is but you don't get to start and stop.

455
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When you want to

456
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do see you might be telling yourself something about what that means to not follow through with something you started

457
00:43:52.710 --> 00:44:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It means something to you when you aren't able to finish something through to how you expected something to be it has meaning for you.

458
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it say about you that you didn't finish what you started

459
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:13.710
Jay: With I

460
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that sounds like a step dad kind of thing, right.

461
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is that

462
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like something like we come from an adult like parent

463
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the truth. Think about a project right now.

464
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That you put energy into and you're going to have to the hard part is you've got, you know, a lot of substance use in your history. So I want you to be able to see a pure and clean one where you can really see that you started something

465
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And something else got your attention was a competing priority.

466
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you went with this one.

467
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not this one.

468
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't have to answer to anybody. You just made a decision.

469
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You put energy. You can only put energy and focus really decent focus into one thing at a time. We're going to a halfway decent job, but there was a competing priority.

470
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and you went with this one.

471
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Has there ever been a time where you like. That's just the way life is, I had this demand on me this demand on me and this demand on me I couldn't

472
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull it off because all my energy and resources were pulling me this way my original destination was over here, but then all of this attention was needed here. I had to go that way.

473
00:45:52.710 --> 00:46:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have projects like that where you're like, Hey, I made a decision that was competing demands and I went left when originally, I thought I'd go right

474
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you think of any.

475
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:10.200
Jay: Okay.

476
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

477
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:20.850
Jay: I mean, I guess, whenever I was working from home alone and then now I started cutting hair. So I went with that.

478
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.630
Jay: Well, still trying to my model.

479
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's offer a recent one. Let's see if this is applicable. You had two more clients that were scheduled for the next day and you canceled them.

480
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You had to

481
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: See, I happen they happen. I just saw one because you shared a little story. I need money.

482
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to follow through with my business. I want to keep my wrap up for keeping books all the things that go with keeping those two appointments money rep continuing professional reputation spread the word. Then there's more customers a lot goes on.

483
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know what over here was

484
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm exhausted. I'm I'm what whatever you were what were you what was over here.

485
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.670
Jay: I was just emotionally just

486
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: A wreck. Yeah.

487
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you had a choice.

488
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't follow through with something

489
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that you didn't try. All you did was turn your attention and energy somewhere else. That's it. We can only ever do that, we're always choosing choosing choosing choosing all the time. Where is the best. How can I budget this amount of attention and energy and concentration

490
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what's urgent. Yes, money is important. Yes, my rep is is my business practice in is important, but what's urgent.

491
00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: My mental health because, you know, what if I can't hold that together. I'm going to want to get high. And then you know what's going to happen. I'm back in custody.

492
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You made a choice in no point would anyone ever if they were rational say to you know what Jay, you are really trying. No one's gonna ever say that

493
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No one. No one in my world.

494
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all it ever is, is we're constantly choosing. Oh, and sometimes they're so close. They're like, neck and neck how they're both good choices.

495
00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're tough ones to make

496
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But choose, we must like Yoda choose, we must

497
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you chose you really glad you chose you.

498
00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: There are going to be more haircuts there's going to be more

499
00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But the victory of having remembered that your sobriety.

500
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: is central to everything right now.

501
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to remember that I hope when your post with another decision.

502
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That someone else might say, are you fucking week

503
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone else might say something nasty like that, but what you think and how you decide, and you measure what's your priority. That's the only thing that I'm interested in is how you but up those two choices.

504
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Were one tips the scale, one goes like this is what I want to hear about

505
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Not what everybody else thinks we're getting rid of the negative people you're doing it now. You're seeing it. You're getting rid of them.

506
00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're not on the side of my recovery, then you're not on the side of health my gross you're not on this side. We'll talk later see things change down the line. I'm just gonna hang over here. That's it.

507
00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you next think you're going to be confronted with having to face this belief about yourself that if you start something you sure better finish it.

508
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.550
Jay: So one more time.

509
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: No problem. When do you think the next decision is going to be where you're going to be having to make a decision that's based on your philosophy of if I start something I have to finish it. What's the next thing likely to come

510
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:39.420
Jay: Next,

511
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And if he goes. Cool. And we'll get high together, then what do you do

512
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.800
Jay: Why we you

513
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I mean, before you even get there. He says, Great. We can also get high. Right.

514
00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:06.390
Jay: What's up, good, good.

515
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a competing priority. Remember, you're going to finish this haircut you booked it you're going to finish it. But guess what happened recovery was a competing

516
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Priority it isn't that you didn't try to be this this good businessman. It's that this. It's just urgent. It's just more urgent, this has to be on point or this

517
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not gonna be interested in cutting hair as soon as you get high you to be like die, no better way to make money. Forget that. Okay.

518
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This notion you have I just wonder if it's outdated.

519
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I say

520
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Something, it means i'ma if I don't finish it on a failure. That sounds like a step dad kind of thing.

521
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we tell kids because we have to be

522
00:51:56.850 --> 00:52:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The resilience to help them follow through with things. But that's not true, as we're adults, we have that inside of us. We already know how to finish projects inside of us. We know how we don't need it from the outside world anymore from a parent.

523
00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I got.

524
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

525
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I sure hope you keep doing what you're doing. I liked your choices. I think those are things to be proud of, you know,

526
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, keep journaling up because when you see it, then you're like, Dang. Last week I was tested like a MoFo.

527
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: They're all over the place.

528
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:35.670
Right.

529
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.430
Jay: Look back it was it

530
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:44.310
Jay: Was that long to go. I thought it was. That was just the other day.

531
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at the schedule and see if we can schedule something to get

532
00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A pencil.

533
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to meet at

534
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Nine.

535
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: On

536
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: June.

537
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:38.370
Jay: 2

538
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.330
Yeah.

539
00:53:44.610 --> 00:54:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and here's a client that I talked to about making sure you didn't smoke cigarettes before you put it sublingual. Have you noticed any benefit from it absorbing because that that may have something to do with the nausea to like you might be getting the right amount of medicine.

540
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.240
Jay: I really haven't

541
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.710
