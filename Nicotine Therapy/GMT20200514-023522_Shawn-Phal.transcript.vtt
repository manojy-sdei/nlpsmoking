15
00:05:44.790 --> 00:06:03.630
Galaxy A10e: Got a autoimmune disease called interstitial cystitis and and so when I finally like wasn't pregnant anymore, a doctor that I was seeing was like finally able. They're tricky for that. And so I bought on pain management and I was

16
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.680
Galaxy A10e: In management for like a year and a half, I think.

17
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.020
Galaxy A10e: Or so, and

18
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:23.340
Galaxy A10e: Then you know it's a chronic disease, though I wasn't getting any better and but now at that point I had been used, you know, on pills for a year, year and a half.

19
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:34.380
Galaxy A10e: So my doctor, you know, wanted to take me off pain management but you know i mean i needed them mentally and physically at that point.

20
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.400
So,

21
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:48.000

56
00:10:39.510 --> 00:11:01.740
Galaxy A10e: So we are really close to one another as close with our older sister. But, you know, she just is different. I mean, she didn't go through as much as we did cuz she got pregnant when she was like 16 or 15 or 16 like super young and so she got to move out and live with my grandma. So, um,

59
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:21.750
Galaxy A10e: And so me and my sister were super close and then, like I said, you know, we took care of my little brother. He was much younger than us.

60
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:42.660
Galaxy A10e: So yeah, we're really close. And then my mom, um, you know, there's been times where we weren't very close. And then, you know, especially when she was drinking, but she has been sober almost six years now. So yeah, we're really close. Now I see her like every day. Okay. Okay, good.

Galaxy A10e: Yeah, well, yeah, um, before I got interstitial cystitis I mean I had been working since I was 16 you know as soon as I could get a job. I got one up. And so I've worked on, you know, my whole life. And then when I got

63
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:23.880
Galaxy A10e: Interstitial Cystitis I just could not cope at all. And so my uncle before I got that. My uncle and I bought a place together because my aunt was taking care of him.

64
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:39.600
Galaxy A10e: And she isn't. And so she kind of just left him. So then him and I bought a house together. And so I take care of my uncle, which is really nice because then I'm able to be home you know

65
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:48.210
Galaxy A10e: And when I'm flyering you know he can he works around my schedule and stuff, you know, so it's really nice.

66
00:12:48.660 --> 00:13:08.220
Galaxy A10e: You know, I can't imagine like being on my feet for like nine hours or or something like that, you know, not being able to use the bathroom because I have to go all the time is my bladder so bad, you know. So yeah, I'm really fortunate there to be able to be home and working so nice.

67
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.230
Shawn Phalen: So y'all live up here. Oh, man.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:29.040
Galaxy A10e: Okay, and then hopefully I won't move anymore. I'm usually. I mean, I just have like a super bad memory. So even though I thought a

71
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:49.560
Galaxy A10e: text this morning, reminding me about tonight, literally at 728 all the sudden, I was like oh my god like freaking out and then it takes a minute for them to like you in the waiting room and stop, you know. So yeah, of course. I had dinner going I turn everything off. I just shatter.

72
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.600
Shawn Phalen: Have you had any legal issues because of your pill use or

73
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:22.860
Galaxy A10e: Um, no, no, not really because I just was that home all the time so I you know I was kind of lucky because I added a prescription and so I didn't have to, you know, go through as much to get bills as someone else would have to, you know, yeah.

74
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:29.460
Shawn Phalen: So how are your symptoms. Now with like physically. How do you feel

75
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.960
Um,

76
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:38.610
Galaxy A10e: I think I can just like cope with it a lot more. Now you know like I can even imagine like

77
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:48.060
Galaxy A10e: In the beginning, there's just, I mean, I honestly don't think I would have been able to get through it. You know, I don't know.

78
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:59.430
Galaxy A10e: You know, I think that my symptoms are a lot better. Um, and like I said just mentally. I've been doing it for so long now it's kind of like

79
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:11.400
Galaxy A10e: You know, like, in the beginning, I would be like on support groups and stuff like trying to figure out what I had because they didn't even know what I had since I was pregnant, they didn't want to touch me, you know,

80
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:19.800
Galaxy A10e: So I was just search and search and search, trying to figure it out in the beginning. And I'd be like on support groups and people would be saying like

81
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:34.380
Galaxy A10e: You know, you get used to a you learn to live with it, whatever. And I'm like, there's no way. But, you know, yeah, you kind of do just cope, you know, eventually, and I think after I had my son was able to

82
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.160
Galaxy A10e: Get on some of the medication.

83
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.100
Galaxy A10e: And it kind of finally start kicking in a little bit. It definitely helped

84
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.760
Galaxy A10e: It's kind of hard for me because

85
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:56.790
Galaxy A10e: Since I've had to take like so much medication for it. I've gained a lot of weight. Yeah, and that's been really hard for me like mentally

86
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:10.770
Galaxy A10e: When I was younger I had a really bad eating disorder and but in reality I really didn't have to do much. I just was in earth, you know,

87
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:23.730
Galaxy A10e: With all the medication my, you know, metabolism is just gone and I bought an older, obviously, you know, so my metabolism. Metabolism has just gone downhill.

88
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.390
Galaxy A10e: So mentally that that's really hard for me to deal with, you know, I don't really know what to do.

89
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.310
Galaxy A10e: When

90
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.210

Galaxy A10e: It's like on fire. I'm on fire deal. They're everywhere. My stomach actually physically flow over my bladder area.

94
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:15.960
Galaxy A10e: I feel like I have to pee non stop but nothing comes out, you know, so I just sit there because it's like, mentally, even though I know I don't have to pee. That feeling is just so prominent that it's just like, I can't ignore it. It's, it's terrible.

95
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:23.910
Galaxy A10e: Like cramping, of course, you know, just, it's just terrible, terrible. I can't

98
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:42.180
Galaxy A10e: And now. Oh, I kind of stay with my medication. I stay at my base, which usually, you know, I can be walking around at a six or so.

99
00:17:43.260 --> 00:18:01.500
Galaxy A10e: And then with flare ups. It's just off the charts. But usually I have a pretty bad flare like twice a month, sometimes more, you know, um, but that can last for days at a time.

100
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.360
Galaxy A10e: Which is hard.

Galaxy A10e: Hey, try this, you know everything. And then finally the amitriptyline and lyrics together started to help

126
00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:18.600
Galaxy A10e: Just little bits at a time and then when I saw on pain management, it really started you know that that really did help, but really actually has been a big help. Like, I thought there's when you Tramadol going to help you know if my Percocet and North Coast and everything else, you know,

127
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:33.360
Galaxy A10e: Was helping me. There's no way Tramadol will, you know, just in my mind. I just thought it was so much you know weaker or less, you know, but it's actually helped a lot. I mean, yeah.

128
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.720
Shawn Phalen: So, um,

129
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.300
So basically you just find ways to cope. Then I mean

130
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.570
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, basically.

131
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:48.330
