00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:55.140
Angelina C: I don't, I say he's like a little hawk met and then the other one was a Chinese guy I've never talked to just now in my life. So I don't know who that was. I've never seen them before.

12
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.190

Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me have it all.

16
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.260

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: On it all.

18
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.320
Angelina C: You should be, well, don't be proud of me because I finally did it today. So

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.200
Angelina C: I called for my student loan this morning.

20
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:34.380
Angelina C: And I got we don't pay on it from come march that it might now that I was Codex going on. It's like I'm paying on it. So I don't start paying $5 a month for nine months in October.

21
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.580
Angelina C: And that's wiped clean so I can go File my taxes now. So, my brothers coming to get my or I'm going to take them to him, but I'm going to go do my taxes, give them to him so we can get that money.

22
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.430
Angelina C: And I owe my brother a lot because I wrecked the Audi that I was buying from him and I'm up and moved out of that place without killing the landlord in advance.

23
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.490
Angelina C: And he said he doesn't really care about any of the other money and my mom probably won't either. It's just, he wants the money back for what I did at the apart at the place because I didn't do his friend wrong.

24
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.110
Angelina C: So, and so he borrow some money off of my stimulus, because I have it in a hiding for I have it hiding from Paul really

25
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:22.470
Angelina C: I have my stimulus, but it's, it, it's on an account that my mom has for me. And so my brother's been holding on to annoy putting certain mountain, it just in case. Paul is to get the card and so

26
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.780
Angelina C: I now that I can file my taxes. We're going to go get a low income apartment.

27

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.800
Angelina C: He is so far gone, when I have to I

30
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.860
Angelina C: I hate to say this I because because always saying, Why do you feel like you have to try and I said, because I know who he really is. But I he came in on Wednesday.

31
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.260
Angelina C: And he

32
00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:02.070
Angelina C: Kept me up all night and I had to go to work the next day I went to work, throw. I've been throwing up for a week. A week my nerves everything had been shot.

33
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

34
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:13.440

Angelina C: He is so far on and I can't, I, I told my kid. I'll get him help we can take in my moms like it's not that easy. He's not wanting help

38
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:41.220
Angelina C: But he told me that I have to get out why he's here. And I said, I've already planned on moving out anyway. So my daughter wants me to go to the apartments over by her the low income ones, which

39
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.390
Angelina C: Which are good. So they'll go by my income for right now. And then I'm going to go ahead and go back to nursing and get in with my daughter.

40
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.160
Angelina C: Yeah, but we have to leave all the vehicles here of course he doesn't want to speak. And even though he gave Michaela one so

41
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:07.530
Angelina C: But that's pretty much where we're headed. I didn't go into work today, I gotta go get blood work. They're going to check me for if busy or not busy man, they're going to check me for

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.990

Angelina C: Not anorexic, the other one.

45
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:18.870

47
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:40.230
Angelina C: What's going on now. I've just I know a lot of it to depression and stuff, but every since I've been sick, just a hard time eating and with my potassium been throwing up my potassium cry low, so I gotta go get checked for all those things today.

48
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So I didn't York. Okay, well, okay, good, but believe me I you know if you are believe it if you're inducing your

49
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.030
Angelina C: Iron. It's not believe me I can't think of the word for it. One with your iron

50
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.750
I think

51
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.480
Angelina C: I can't think of it.

52
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just celebrate. Let's celebrate that you made some big decisions. Let's get behind that.

53
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:14.460
Angelina C: It feels really good. I, I told a Michaela that you know it through this. All I I stay quiet to myself I stayed in my room just thinking positive just thinking, you know,

54
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.870
Angelina C: He left for a couple days and I didn't think he this guy. He was supposedly on Wednesday. That's why I thought today was Wednesday. So I'm confused. In my day.

55
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.230
Angelina C: Uh huh. I knew I had the meeting at to opt in today. So

56
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:34.290
Angelina C: Anyway I he left at instead leaving it to this morning. He left like at midnight or something. But he was Michaela hit text me when she was in Albuquerque kind of scared of him and

57
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:44.760
Angelina C: It just bothered me a little bit. So he's just not too far gone, and it's going to be better will have running water will have our own apartment and then I can just start getting into a job in Albuquerque.

58
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.140
Angelina C: So go back

59
00:05:46.440 --> 00:06:00.300
Angelina C: Way I know I have good internet from a Kayla to get her schooling going again. It just gives me a fresh start. And then, now that I can file my taxes at the huge things and I could be my brother back which they're like seeing that I only have to pay so much so that's nice.

60
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Angie. Let's slow down and appreciate you did in one week. But most people take a year to do. Do you know that

61
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:19.800
Angelina C: No, but it feels good. Let's just because now we have a little bit of money because I can found my taxes. I think that's what makes me feel good that I've sat on it to usually I'd blow my money.

62
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:33.630
Angelina C: And we haven't even McKeever now we're trying to stick together on it, and my brother Boston and I'm just gonna let him keep that. And then the rest I have plenty still to get into an apartment and it's still maybe a car.

63
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If it means that you're in that you are repairing some damage that you did with your brother with this car, give him the money. I love it.

64
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that relationship that investment giving that piece of money back, even though I know you need it. I know you need it.

65
00:06:50.730 --> 00:07:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's part of this recovery. That's where that that that you know I was damaged people right I damaged property I damaged relationships when I was in active addiction and I've got to atone

66
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're doing it. You said, I'm going to give up, even though I know how much you need this money.

67
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to repair that relationship, it will bring dividends, it will bring much much more having an ongoing relationship with your brother.

68
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it will 1000 or 2000 or whatever it is, it's you're not going to have right now the investment in that relationship. I think it's going to be so much more worth it.

69
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.740
Angelina C: Was like he was saying, you know, he does loan people money, but he only sees a one or two payment, you know, and

70
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:39.840
Angelina C: You know, I haven't told he asked, Can I get a loan from you and it felt so good because I told my Kayla he's asking me for a loan which I owe him that money but

71
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:49.950
Angelina C: He was, he broke. He told me 160 but he said, I guess 960 but he was going to give me 60 back and I said, that's fine. But he says, why don't I just keep that

72
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.940
Angelina C: Mom probably won't have you pay her back probably and that

73
00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:01.320
Angelina C: He's not even worried about the Audi money he's just worried about what I did with his friend when we moved out and it just didn't give them enough notice so

74
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:12.210
Angelina C: That's and he says that, that's all. He'll care about other than that he doesn't care about anything else except being my grandfather's truck back from his dad and he says, It doesn't matter how much it costs will get it back.

75
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To have it.

76
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me more about this notion of going back to school, that's the piece that my jaws just dropped

77
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you come to a conclusion.

78
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:30.720
Angelina C: Well mckillop out here. We're having a hard time getting I have to get a phone line. I have to get so much, just to get internet out here.

79
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.710
Angelina C: Yeah, so

80
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:47.190
Angelina C: My God, I found this guy. He's so cute, he's gay. He comes into the store and he's running out here, he's like 20 something cutest little guy. But he's running for president of in a stand Sia or governor and He's the cutest little thing. And he told me to go to

81
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:58.140
Angelina C: College. It was America Americans community college, I think, and I think that was when I wrote it down, though, and he told me that

82
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:12.030
Angelina C: He wants some feedback from Michaela on teenagers right now what they're going through the ones that want to drop out. Why in the bullying and he wants feedback from a lot of the younger students. So I thought that was kind of fun because she can campaign with them a little bit

83
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.170
Angelina C: Uh huh. So

84
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:22.290
Angelina C: I started thinking about and I go, because I have to get a phone line out here to get the internet to even get it to work. So I said when we get to Albuquerque. Boom. We have Wi Fi.

85
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.990
Angelina C: Once we get the Wi Fi. We're good. We don't have to worry about anything. And then you can get your laptop.

86
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:36.240
Angelina C: I say, even if I have to get a cheesy went off a wish for 30 $40 right now at least we'll have when I have my little one, but the kids have slobbering all over it, but

87
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:45.120
Angelina C: The grandbabies but other than that Mikael is pretty much packed after she saw this and you know what hurt me, though, is I did start putting money into the house.

88
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:45.990
Angelina C: And I

89
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:51.450
Angelina C: Put some of that money into. And he's like, well, just think of you. It was like you're renting, I said, that's fine you know

90
00:09:52.080 --> 00:10:02.760
Angelina C: But once we got into that fight. I couldn't stand him he's just not himself. So we're just so excited. I'm, I'm happy. There's a lot that got done, but it just took a phone call, like you said, that was really

91
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:03.900
Angelina C: You know,

92
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:15.450
Angelina C: Yeah, and it feels good and it's just now, you know, at least I'll have the truck. Now to move everything out. Just so he gets back and that my brother. And I'll start looking for a car with the rest of the money.

93
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Far out

94
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

95
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: This all came about from drawing the line on a piece of paper writing down what's important and then fine tuning it and putting over on the left side. What has a sense of urgency and that day. I think there were like four items or something. It wasn't a lot on there.

96
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You have it there.

97
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.900
Angelina C: Yeah, I'm here.

98
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you get off the video with me and go do them know what did you like

99
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:56.460
Angelina C: I went to the room when I started getting ready for work and piddling and procrastinating. And then I kept telling Michaela

100
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.340
Angelina C: Today I said I was just calling. I need to make these phone calls. I'm not going to do it. And I called my brother.

101
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:09.750
Angelina C: And let him know about when I if I can find my taxes. What we're going to do with the money and how I was going to do it. And you said, That's great.

102
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:18.060
Angelina C: So I got off and I call the student loan people. That's what got me late getting on with you but I called the student loan and they said that

103
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.160
Angelina C: They said,

104
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:29.730
Angelina C: That if I make if they say, I thought it was $30 a month. That's what I made with Alexis. And she said, you can go from because I told him everything my I was spending on and all this.

105
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.450
Angelina C: So he wrote it all down and he said that was food and everything.

106
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:41.790
Angelina C: He told me it's going to be $5 a month for the next nine months, starting in October, but they will not take my taxes. So that's another 5000 right there for me.

107
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:49.020
Angelina C: So once I started getting the money and and i don't tell Paul. Now I'm hiding it. Because that's only because he's not doing any good for us.

108
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, let me stop right there.

109
00:11:51.990 --> 00:12:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay all not here yet right here. So keep keep holding on to that when you say he's not himself. He's not no fool is going to tell someone I got a few thousand dollars if you're an addict.

110
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just don't

111
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.580
Angelina C: Right.

112
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.470
Angelina C: He's not. Yeah.

113
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.550
Angelina C: I've learned and

114
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:20.490
Angelina C: He's not and then you know like you when you got Michaela new phone. And I'm like, he wants. And I said, Why doesn't he just keep this account, since he has the kids phones on it.

115
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:33.840
Angelina C: I said, just keep this account and I'm just going to go get me mine. He's like, I want my own account. I'm like, dude, whatever. So I'm going to put my phone in Mackay listening and then he can just have this line. I just got to get it out of my name and put his name on it so

116
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.640
Angelina C: And let him change everything.

117
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take apart a little bit how

118
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting on the phone with your brother did something for you.

119
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. It did something. What did it do for you.

120
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:54.390
Angelina C: He well I've been empty I procrastinate to call him a lot. Um, especially for everything that happened.

121
00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:02.460
Angelina C: Um, and like it. At first he kind of had attitude with me when or no, he called them morning I got my money. He said, I got my money. What do you want to do with it.

122
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:13.770
Angelina C: And I said, Please, just hold on to it. I'm not going to tell anybody. I got it. And I said, but then I didn't work for two weeks. So I use. I use that money up. I didn't work, two weeks. Thank gosh I had it.

123
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:20.370
Angelina C: But then, I've been spoiling here little kitties and getting them little things at the Dollar Tree just things I feel good about

124
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:28.410
Angelina C: And then my brother just has been watching it. So I, at least, like if I need to cigarettes or I need, whatever. Um, it's there. I'm okay.

125
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:39.600
Angelina C: And so now that I filed this this morning when he he's always been there to help me and I know he's the one that I desperately need to pay it back in that weighs heavy on my mind more than anything.

126
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:50.520
Angelina C: Than fixing the house up because he even said, can we go out there and fix the pipes in the hot water heater for you. And I said, no, because I don't want to put money into this like now and get kicked out.

127
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:57.180
Angelina C: So when he comes home. I have to leave. And I just thought, I'm not doing that. I'm not so I told

128
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.150
Angelina C: My brother said that smart. And he says, he says, that makes sense. So we just sat on it for a while and then I call them today.

129
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:19.290
Angelina C: Because I'll tell my mom, but my mom just she fell. I guess he told me two days ago she felt pretty bad and hurt her ankle on her elbow and her skin tears like paper. So, um, yeah. So she's doing okay though, but he was telling me I'm

130
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:28.230
Angelina C: I told him about the low income apartment and he thought about going back to that place rich was out, but it's just too small for my Kayla night she needs her own room. She's 16

131
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:39.000
Angelina C: And if I can get low and I was paying 640 there I'll pay pay less because they go by my income. I'm just going to have to drive. The only thing is I'm gonna have to drive back and forth for right now from

132
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:49.950
Angelina C: Albuquerque to edge word I'm just until I can get switched jobs over either to get a, get a gas station in Albuquerque or

133
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:58.080
Angelina C: The Beehive home with my daughter had nights. Yeah. So yeah, I'm gonna try that. And I think we'll be all right.

134
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And what makes you think about returning to the field of nursing again.

135
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: The money. Yeah. So remind me. Did you leave because you were like,

136
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.580
Angelina C: burnt out.

137
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you were burnt out. Okay. Yeah.

138
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.390
Angelina C: I was just

139
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.310
Angelina C: A new last year. This. That's why I guess the coven didn't really bother me this much.

140
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:29.400
Angelina C: Honestly, because last year we lost everybody went to the nursing home almost and we we almost shut down our whole company because of it.

141
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:41.790
Angelina C: So that's why this year it. That's what it feels like to me. So everybody's like, because like one person came from California. And I like you're not doing this and you're not doing that. And I'm like, you should be in California. You shouldn't be here. Don't tell me what to do.

142
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:57.570
Angelina C: It's like you're supposed to. Why are you here. But yeah, that I think that's why I haven't really taken it that serious and I I should just because of the nursing part, but I feel that it's just like last year. We just lost so many of the elderly, you know,

143
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's let's keep deconstructing the importance of how you were able to move forward on so many decisions.

144
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's no here's what I heard, I heard you say my need to pay back. My brother is really important and it's almost like was did you make a decision when you're on the phone with him. I'm going to pay him back.

145
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:46.980
Angelina C: Because our deal was last year when I got my taxes to deal was I was buying the Audi from him, and it was $3,000. Okay, so then I had already was using their money before I got a job, no problem. They can be whatever I needed gas money to get to work, whatever.

146
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:56.400
Angelina C: And I, and it was just so small. My brother was reconstructing his room remodeling and I seen his bathroom and all that. So he was in our old McKellen eyes over him.

147
00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:07.290
Angelina C: So we were out in the living room. So it was just so crowded at the time. So he threw us over, not through us, but he put us with his friend rich, which is a millionaire. That is a tightwad

148
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:14.220
Angelina C: That was charging a 640 for a studio and it was teeny tiny and it's just way too small for material and I

149
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:29.580
Angelina C: And I thought, you know, I was paying 640 for a two bedroom before. So it was just something to get out and he paid for the down payment, and if we moved out early to break the legacy really charged, my brother, all of that for everything after I lost my job I wrecked the Audi everything

150
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:37.800
Angelina C: And so I'm just, I, I've known this whole time. I need to pay my brother back with my taxes. He's the one that will do it for me.

151
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:45.960
Angelina C: So he's going to, I'm going to go take them after we get off the phone. Today I'm going to do. He's out here at doing some workout here. So I'm going to go meet them and

152
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.870
Angelina C: And I'm going to go give them my taxes and file it. He's like, is there anything else I said, nope, it was just my student loan.

153
00:17:53.820 --> 00:18:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the reasons I'm less focused on Charlie. Charlie did that. That's not where I'm trying to steer your attention. What I'm trying to do is have you really zero in on something that worked for you.

154
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Because notice after you and I were talking, it was all fine and good, and you pretty much like what we were talking about

155
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you just got ready for work, even though you had said, I'm going to make this call. I'm going to do it as soon as we end, but you didn't. So hold on. That's fine, whatever.

156
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you did was get on the phone with your brother and my question. So I'm asking. And again, I'm not interested in content. These are process questions, these have to do with finding the switch that works for you.

157
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And it

158
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.950
Angelina C: Feels good, that I could pay him back.

159
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.890
Angelina C: That I know that I could file my taxes.

160
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.470
Angelina C: I just had to call them. You know what I mean.

161
00:18:50.670 --> 00:19:04.380
Angelina C: So I let him know what was going on. And I think it just gave me the motivation to once I got off. I called the student loan people right away before I would not get off and do it, it's been since January. I've talked to them. So that's how time flies.

162
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stay on this this concept.

163
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:12.210
Angelina C: So once I got off that i just i i looked at Michaela this morning, cuz we finally got to talk this morning and

164
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.150
Angelina C: I just thought, I have a lot to do games like if it's too overwhelming long. And so I just started making calls and

165
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:23.460
Angelina C: I let my boss know three hours ahead of time that I need to get blood work done. And she's like, we got you covered. So

166
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:32.730
Angelina C: I just kind of took it and ran a night I did on my brother, and it does feel good to pay him back because like it first. Mikayla was like the same way, kind of like you would have been like

167
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:42.210
Angelina C: We don't have that money to do that with but he didn't, it didn't matter. I have money in my account, no matter what, even though he borrowed money he still made sure I was okay.

168
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.980
Angelina C: And and still make sure the account would go down. He's always to ensure

169
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That you did put something over here that I don't, I gotta get clear on what is, what is it that you think that I'm thinking

170
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:05.460
Angelina C: Know when you are when you are sitting there and you said, I'm like what we were saying how my brother, even though I need to pay him back, even though I need the money so bad.

171
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, like

172
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.190
Angelina C: Kayla was the same way. Kinda

173
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:20.400
Angelina C: You know, and it was kind of like we said like guy you need it. But to me, I know later on down the line. I know if I need him and I pay this back and it feels so good. I've never done that with Paul we've never

174
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:31.950
Angelina C: We've either done things bad and just took it and run when we were in our addiction, whatever we never pay people back. And so for me, little by little, I always made that deal with my brother, and I've stuck with it because

175
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:42.660
Angelina C: Even when we were down and out when we went there, they helped us and I think he really didn't think I was in a pay him back. I don't feel so that made me feel even better.

176
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so stay there. Stay there. If this is the ingredient.

177
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is what I see out here. I see. I'm holding myself accountable.

178
00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: As a sister as a friend, it's a family member.

179
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This is different. I'm not an active addiction. I now feel guilt.

180
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to pay my brother back and look what loosened up because this is what I heard. I might be different, how you felt a bit out here. This is how it looked

181
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it freed up energy to be accountable to find out the truth and now with the student loan. Now you were free that psychologically it loosens it up, you already addressed the big guilt.

182
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You addressed it by saying, I'm going to pay you this, and he made it easy because he he did this thing easier. But fantastic. That's fantastic.

183
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because an active addict would not do that an addict would justify rationalize and say, you know, I don't need you, you, you could have persuaded him.

184
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't. And that is such a testament to the different place that you are in your life. Do you see that you are in recovery you doing that thing you did with your brother.

185
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And look what just listened up I might I want to apartment school. Do you see that I see my husband is in addiction, you all this type wound up pent up energy around not seeing what is loosened up and all these opportunities opened up.

186
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When you addressed guilt regular old healthy guilt, which we all need gotta have it but you found it and it. I think it was what was keeping you from taking action on things like with that list.

187
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't. I don't know. Look at your list right now. Does it say, Pay brother back just curious to

188
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:50.760
Angelina C: Know,

189
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Though it wasn't on the list.

190
00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And so guess what you did you procrastinated

191
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you found it on your own. You had to get there on your own you realizing I need, I need to address this thing with my brother, but it didn't make it to the list.

192
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is an important piece of information. So now let's say sometime in the future we do something like this again.

193
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say to you, you know what, Angie.

194
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you feeling guilty about something. Where are you feeling like you want to repair either a relationship or a debt of some kind. Just TUNE IN. TUNE IN. TUNE IN. And we'll wait for it, wait for it, and if

195
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We find it. We might have found a block for you. We might have found, What might be holding you up. It might be around accountability.

196
00:23:45.420 --> 00:24:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, water to self mother, brother, whatever it is. Okay. That is a key feature in a sober life when you are an active addiction. That is just a ridiculous concept accountability, please.

197
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so hold on to that and really

198
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Take an opportunity and see what a departure, this way of being is

199
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You and your brother didn't keep your word.

200
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're keeping your word that means you value you you value your word. You are accountable responsible. You are trustworthy. Guess what that says to the universe.

201
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: My trustworthy. I trust myself. I do what I say, look what it opens up to promises, you may want to keep give and offer your daughter. I can keep a promise.

202
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's huge.

203
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to move on. I want to go to the next one. I want to sit here and bask in what you did.

204
00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:00.870
Angelina C: Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm proud of myself and it feels good. I mean, you know,

205
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.910
Angelina C: It does. It does really good and and I'm like, I even told me, Kayla, you know,

206
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:16.110
Angelina C: Cuz I told my mom necessity to I just went Michaela like you got to help me save you got to help me do this. You got to help me.

207
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:23.610
Angelina C: And I just came at her. I said, Let's get an account in your name and let's put it in your name and not and i was going like 90 miles an hour. And just like mom.

208
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:38.700
Angelina C: No, that's too much for me right now. I said, okay, so I backed off of that. And that's when I, you know, I'm just happy that we can do my taxes and that just we need the money and I, and now I know to save to before I just blow it.

209
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:39.810
Angelina C: Ya know,

210
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:52.710
Angelina C: Because I didn't have, you know, so, but now I know that he's I should have known that to begin with it. None of the vehicles. So I have insurance and my name on them. I gotta go take out of it, but

211
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.920
Angelina C: Hey, I'll get a new car. I don't care.

212
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get a transportation. It'll. It'll come these other pieces. These ones where

213
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be in a home that has running water that has stability for you and your daughter and not be living with an active addict. I just think that is such a good investment.

214
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:32.040
Angelina C: Yeah, I, I might my oldest had a talk with me to the day before Mother's Day. I kind of shut down for Mother's Day, a little bit but um I told

215
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:44.070
Angelina C: She, she started talking to me and said, Mom, and because she's really wanted me to live with them and I said, Trisha. There's just too much that's too small for us. It's just too much. And we've already tried that and so

216
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:55.950
Angelina C: I just told her so we start thinking, and I said, you know, maybe I'll just try the low income apartments by you and then to start talking more about it and she thinks, I'd be a good idea to so we just started talking more about it.

217
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:11.400
Angelina C: And I thought, you know, I don't see why not. If I have if I can get the paint the first and last month's downpayment with my taxes. What's left after I pay my brother. Back. And he and, you know, like you said once once one open

218
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:20.790
Angelina C: For it like you said it all open because then he's even said, Mom, probably won't even have you pay her back. I'm just worried about the money from rich. So once I pay that back. I know that.

219
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.650
Angelina C: You know, like you said, another door opens for me. So that's not so much of a burden on me.

220
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:35.520
Angelina C: You know cuz I wouldn't have anybody else file my taxes, but my brother. You know what I mean, last year, they went through all this. We waited waited waited when they said I could do it. And I couldn't. And they took them from me.

221
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:47.190
Angelina C: So that's when he was the one that kept getting on me about it. He's like, it's just money sitting there, it could be yours. You know, he's like, You're the one that's letting it go, not me. And so the more I sat on it and then

222
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:56.610
Angelina C: I got a couple voicemails that they kept saying it was zero percent interest on my student loan. And I was like, cool, then they say, you may have to pay zero back

223
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:04.770
Angelina C: But then it's just it right now. They're not I guess from March to sep tember 30th, whoever has a student long does not have to pay on it.

224
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:13.590
Angelina C: And then it picks up on October 1 that's one of my first $5 payment will be and then I'll just take it out every for nine months and then I'll be clear to that student. Oh.

225
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh that is just such great news.

226
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.580
Angelina C: Well, I feel like it's all happening for a reason, kinda, you know what I mean.

227
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Will tell me what the reason is.

228
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.700
Angelina C: Just to move forward to go on life. I can do this. I'm a lot stronger than what

229
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:36.690
Angelina C: I make myself obsolete and I know I can do it. It's just doing it and I am the biggest procrastinator. And the one to hesitate.

230
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:48.120
Angelina C: And I think now it's just my next day off will go in and I'll start looking at the apartments or I'll start calling them. I'm just waiting for my daughter to send me the number but

231
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:57.870
Angelina C: Other than that, I just feel that we've tried it. I've been here done this and I keep trying with it's like hitting a brick wall and there's no point of me.

232
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:07.320
Angelina C: Standing for this. And then, you know, I hadn't talked to. He stayed out we didn't say to her to each other, kept us all up all night. And then he the other night, and then

233
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:15.540
Angelina C: Yesterday when I got here. He's like, You need to talk to your mom Michaela for me remember what we talked about. I was like, Okay, let me already about it.

234
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:22.530
Angelina C: So yeah, you just can't be right here. I was like, Don't worry, we're moving. Anyway, so don't worry about Michaela already has all her stuff she's ready

235
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:35.670
Angelina C: She's ready to go so well. It's hard without reading water, but she wants to be with me. You know what I mean. And she knows I have a job and she's willing to sacrifice all this with me but we deserve better. We Yes, she does.

236
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: She do you do

237
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:45.990
Angelina C: And he came home to look at the piping to see how much of the car hit him and do anything for us. So I was just like, this is

238
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:57.120
Angelina C: You can have it. I'm good. You know, and I mean like I told my kids, you know, like I've been told is she just couldn't understand I had explained to her.

239
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:02.820
Angelina C: I just know. There used to be somebody under there. There's nobody under there. Now that I used to know, you know,

240
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:16.950
Angelina C: And he tells everybody. I mean, I'm this I'm that I you know when they're the ones that are the at I've been there. So I know like I taught Michaela. You know what I mean. And I used to lie to just like he's lying. I, I did to you know

241
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.630
Angelina C: But he doesn't see himself like that. So no

242
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody does when they're in it. So when you hear people like say, oh, we can get them into rehab. No, no, no, no, no, no. When he will come asking for help, or he'll get his butt in there on its own.

243
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:42.150
Angelina C: If he does. I mean, he's pretty out there and I told Michaela you know she knows to see. I mean, he's been with her, she she texted me at work, scared.

244
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:49.710
Angelina C: Because the way he was driving. He was toward him. And I was like, oh my god, I'm at work and she did. I said, just please let me keep in touch with me, she's like, I will

245
00:30:50.520 --> 00:31:01.560
Angelina C: Because I've been told her call your sister, if you have to, you know, come get you something. And then that he's still fighting with them. Yeah, they will have no he's losing people slowly so

246
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.490
Angelina C: And until something bad happens. I don't think he's gonna snap.

247
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:11.430
Angelina C: Yeah we driving and talking and he can't sit still. He's yelling, like I

248
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:22.050
Angelina C: Don't know. So Michaela had to put up with it. I felt so bad because he was supposed to leave yesterday, and he didn't leave till this morning and and then he's like, expecting me to talk to him. I'm like,

249
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.760
Angelina C: It's just not worth my stress. Like I told my Kayla, and that's the other thing I put first and I told my Kayla my health needs to come first right now.

250
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:36.330
Angelina C: This House we cleaned it, there's some mold and in order to get this whole house inspected. It's not even worth it.

251
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:46.380
Angelina C: So we clean what we could have it in my mom got mad and she's like no don't even touch it anymore. But we have gloves and stuff toothbrush bleach. I just feel that

252
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:53.880
Angelina C: I'm just happy to move forward again next time. Like I told my brother. Once I get all my name off of everything insurance no strings to tide.

253
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.020
Angelina C: And I am

254
00:31:55.290 --> 00:32:05.490
Angelina C: for child support, and I've never done that before either. So that's my next step, but that's after I get settled and stuff like you stay one step at a time.

255
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.330
Right.

256
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

257
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You said I've got good, bad, ugly, the whole deal. Right. So I've heard a big piece of all of the good

258
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.710
Angelina C: Yeah, well that was with the bad, and the ugly in it to

259
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: all mixed in with it.

260
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.000
Angelina C: Yeah, was pretty much it was just, you know, um,

261
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:34.800
Angelina C: I don't know why I think you can change every time, but it's just getting worse and worse. So I haven't told Michaela you know

262
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:43.620
Angelina C: It's just me and her, and if it's her choice. She's 16 if you know she wants to send it. He wants to sit or money, but I am going for him for child support and

263
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:49.380
Angelina C: I think this is I'm just and he gets mad. This is the thing. I think this is where I get confused when I'm not going to say

264
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:55.890
Angelina C: Is that he throws rehab in my face. Oh, you went to rehab for 90 days. Well, nobody said he can't either.

265
00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:04.590
Angelina C: But he swears up and down like because I went to rehab and he's just not making any sense but like my kids like yeah but at least she went

266
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:12.780
Angelina C: You know, at least I'm not blowing my whole checks on whatever and he's doing more than just pills. Because I mean, he's just not

267
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:28.500
Angelina C: I don't know, maybe. And you know what's even worse is His mom was addicted to him, his sister, and now this and he you know I it scares me because I feel like I don't know he's had to mix it with something else math or something because he just does not so he doesn't sleep.

268
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:36.630
Angelina C: He's up a nice taking that fit. No, he's not gonna and I told McHale I feel really bad. But there's nothing we can do.

269
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:44.940
Angelina C: She's like, but you did it for me. And I said, Yeah, but I he thinks that you're already an adult, like, you know, I sometimes forget. She's 16 to, you know,

270
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:52.680
Angelina C: When I'm asking her to do a million things for me. I have to stop and remember. Hey, sorry, you know, and she reminds me, and that's a good thing, you know.

271
00:33:53.010 --> 00:34:05.640
Angelina C: And she'll be the first one to tell you to Hey mom, I'm I can't. So that's what I like. Because, you know, then it makes me step back a little bit and realize, you know, I'm the only one that's going to move forward and make it better for her so and get her out of here.

272
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that like Angie for you to realize that you're the adult. She's actually a kid and asking her to make decisions is not school. What's this look into the future and say, I'm going to be responsible for rent insurance. It's going to be you managing those lists that you have there.

273
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, your daughter, it's going to be you. What does the future look like that for you. If you have to be the only adult making decisions. It's not going to do

274
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:40.950
Angelina C: Yeah, it does good too. And I know it just makes me feel like I gotta step step up 10 times more and

275
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:47.850
Angelina C: For her, I just feel bad because I and it's sad. She is 16 and she's already acting like an 18 year old, you know,

276
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:54.210
Angelina C: And it's just because she grew up so fast with this bullshit. You know, she went through it all with me through kindergarten and

277
00:34:54.810 --> 00:35:04.410
Angelina C: She went through it with me. And then because she stayed with my mom for two years and then and then now to have her back and you're not in school, my brother. That's all I see my brother's disappointed at me for

278
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:12.000
Angelina C: And taking Michaela and not putting her in school, or even online or anything so

279
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:27.600
Angelina C: I'll get her that up and get her even back in school if she wants to go back, but I sherry said she didn't she wants to do online. So, and she loves art so my brother said to heat paper whatever class. She wants to do. Now she wants to do an art class so

280
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:35.340
Angelina C: I think to that will help her and and yeah, go back and be a kid again because she grew up so fast, not not needing to

281
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:41.070
Angelina C: And, you know, she's like she says she loves to help and she likes to know what the money is. You know what I mean. And

282
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:51.030
Angelina C: And help me out. And that way we stick together as a team, but I did overwhelm her and it's good when just as x, it does. It makes me just even stronger to move forward with her so

283
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:52.470
Angelina C: But

284
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.270
Angelina C: Oh you wrap

285
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It up. Well, I want to just reveal a little bit. I did see some some tearful

286
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's even hard to see in the end tell

287
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Me a little bit

288
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it about this story that you just told that makes you cry.

289
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.800
Angelina C: I think that

290
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:34.140
Angelina C: I'm proud to move forward, but I'm so sad that Michaela hasn't had her childhood or like I look at it, and no no Christmases birthdays hardly anything. You know what I mean, I know it's the material things, but

291
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:40.920
Angelina C: You know, when we were on, I met. I know I can do it because when her and I were on our own before she had a Christmas with me. Just me and her

292
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.940
Angelina C: And we decorated our apartment together again. And so that's why I know, I know I can do it because I've done it before.

293
00:36:48.780 --> 00:37:01.890
Angelina C: And this one I just don't know any of the strings attached. And that's what I'm starting to do before I go and I'll pack up all my things I never have to come back and so it makes me feel good that I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it again.

294
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.260
Angelina C: It's just doing it.

295
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's difficult.

296
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But as often as you can.

297
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're just about to

298
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Say hey Michaela. This is my list. See if you can redirect that and text me or some just see if you can catch it right before you walk in.

299
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she is just a kid.

300
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:44.430
Angelina C: It's just, it's just turned 16 and she you know and I know my mom had her like that to, you know, write my list down, let's do this. Let's be responsible but she got McHale it's time to say

301
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:55.620
Angelina C: And I'm not, I'm not a saver. And so I when I when I looked at her like that she likes to know too, but she doesn't want all of that and I get it I feel bad.

302
00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:03.180
Angelina C: And it's kind of, She is my best friend. And that's what my brother can't stand is her and I being friends. She's not my friend. She's my daughter.

303
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:12.630
Angelina C: And he thinks that's where I went wrong with Patricia, but my girls. I know everything about them and they know everything about and I don't have anything to hide from a kid. I did tell her.

304
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:20.190
Angelina C: I'm sorry if that hurts her. But if somebody comes along that makes me happy and I i haven't left in years. I said, I'm doing it. And she said, that's going on.

305
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:36.480
Angelina C: I said, I may know if it happens tomorrow, three years from now four years from now, whatever, you know, I just let her know that I'm done. And she's like, okay, you know, and I just I that's the last thing I want to do. I just want to get her know after school.

306
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.260
Angelina C: But yeah, it, it feels good to to move forward again.

307
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Directing

308
00:38:45.840 --> 00:39:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Adrian if if you want to stop right now what is called parental education when you put the pressures of an adult life on a child. It has a name. If you want to stop it.

309
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Then right before you go look to her because she looks mature because she says she wants to know about money. She wants to know about money because she's had uncertainty in her life.

310
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's hard for you to look at that can be hard for anybody, all of us as parents have to look at that. Have I overburdened my child with responsibilities, have I overburdened a child with my emotional needs. You can have a best friend, but your job is a mom.

311
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:34.530
Angelina C: Yeah.

312
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And being mom means you're gonna have to use your resources and she gets to be a kid. So your resources are you have me

313
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go into group. And you can say, I'm, I'm feeling. I've got all these competing demands. I have all these things I need to do I feel this. I feel that you have, if you, if it is your brother, you can talk with your brother.

314
00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there are other people in your life that you can have these honest conversations but

315
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that what made you cry.

316
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you remember member healthy guilt that thing that got you motivated with your brother.

317
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Get into accountability. You can do that again with your daughter to the tears just said I need to be a parent. I took some way. It's complicated.

318
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe she's missed out on just being a child, but you have a chance to do it differently. The same way you get to pay brother back, you get to just be mom. Sometimes it means your daughter won't like you

319
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the deal with being a parent parent. They may not always like what you do but it's in the best interest of the child.

320
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know that that might be something that's a big thing for a lot of people to even think about that when the kid.

321
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Has been the best friend. It's been this ally little buddies. You guys are buddies.

322
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's something I think we may want to continue talking about because remember what was making you sad. And I said, what was it you said

323
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She missed out on childhood. And so we

324
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to use what worked with your brother, which was taking accountability and what got you motivated

325
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Repair. So this is a chance to repair also with one of the most important people in your life. Yes.

326
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.170
Angelina C: Yes, very much.

327
00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuing parental education to a child.

328
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I've been watching people for over 20 years. Right. Yeah.

329
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Those children.

330
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Are gonna be overburdened in interpersonal relationships to they're going to be perfectionist stick. They're going to be very hard on themselves, and they risk depression and they risk anxiety, they risk those things. And I know you don't like them.

331
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a chance to do screeching halt. Wait a second.

332
00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you start to do that. Do you know where you can channel like as soon as you think, oh, I want my, my daughter to solve this for me, give me the answer. What's something you could do to to redirect.

333
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:28.080
Angelina C: Dizzy to try to think about stop and think of it myself or, or, like you said, Call you earned my brother or somebody and just like whoops I was going to do this, but I didn't. So just get it out just to get it out or write it down. I'm really good at.

334
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:35.160
Angelina C: Letting a lot out and I haven't done that a long time just getting a notebook. There's time face to write. I don't even know what the heck it said, but I got it out so

335
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's probably going to be a decision. So if you write it out. Do that line thing we did it's I could do this or I could do this. What are the pros. So the title is blah, blah, blah, blah. This apartment. What are the pros are the cons and you write it out.

336
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:54.960
Angelina C: Okay.

337
00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You look at if you want to. If you want another pair of eyes, you could take a picture and send it to me. Or you could write me in a text and say,

338
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking through something right now. This is hard, really want to get my daughter's advice, but instead I am going to do this, I'm going to move through this uncertainty. I'm going to trust my own intuition going to trust myself.

339
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that something you were interested in doing.

340
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

341
