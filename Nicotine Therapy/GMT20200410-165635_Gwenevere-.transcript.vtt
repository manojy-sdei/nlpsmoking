00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your ear.

3
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.430
LG Stylo 5: Still can't hear nothing.

4
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude,

5
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm worried that

6
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.260
LG Stylo 5: I could hear a little bit like I'm starting to hear little bit more here and there, but like, and I started getting feeling so sketching.

7
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.910
LG Stylo 5: And I haven't been able to have no filling in. And the other day. Was it yesterday is itching like all day like not all day but here and there, so like I knew I was getting feeling back

8
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.930
LG Stylo 5: Okay, and

9
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.390
LG Stylo 5: But, and then like so, and I like do this, but on the on like this.

10
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.380
LG Stylo 5: Uh huh, but I'm

11
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.790
LG Stylo 5: Sure, I usually can't hear nothing but lately. I can hear like a little bit of air going in and out.

12
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.020
LG Stylo 5: And so

13
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.990
LG Stylo 5: It's not there yet, but

14
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you call the physician's office just to see what their protocol is at least

15
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.220
LG Stylo 5: Honestly, no.

16
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:31.380
LG Stylo 5: I'll do it today, after we got off the phone and say, well, but i just i yesterday I was really feeling or what was last Wednesday, I kind of just stayed in bed all day was really feeling good and Tuesday I had thrown up right towards the end of the death penalty. Notice I ran away. I went

17
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.880
LG Stylo 5: To throw up. Yeah. And so I didn't really feel good after that I stayed in bed all day after that I didn't even make my boyfriend lunch like make us lunch, basically.

18
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.260
LG Stylo 5: Um, and then wednesday

19
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.430
LG Stylo 5: I tried to force myself to eat like some cucumbers and some cantaloupe and stuff like that.

20
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.720
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, and yeah.

21
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.790
LG Stylo 5: I actually quite a bit.

22
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So get tight.

23
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Tight back is good, but the vomiting continues. I just

24
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's wrong.

25
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.970
LG Stylo 5: Yeah i had i usually got using my phone. My mom and

26
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.660
LG Stylo 5: I usually. It's usually because I'm hungry, though, or like, I don't know. It was in my ear in the morning. I'd really wake up really dizzy, especially in the morning.

27
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.820
LG Stylo 5: And then after like an hour, hour and a half, it'll go away. And I think the dizziness is just what makes me throw up because I won't even have nothing in my stomach.

28
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I will already

29
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been a common theme of you and throwing up

30
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Throughout our treatment history that's that's a common symptom for you like it shows up.

31
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.210
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I was wondering if it has like cuz I wasn't ever throwing up really much before I started taking the gabapentin

32
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.730
LG Stylo 5: I was wondering me my boyfriend were talking about that. And I don't know, like it might be, I don't know. He might have just put it in my head, but it kind of

33
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it could be, you might want to talk to her about that. I have one client that takes it and he does talk about some stomach stuff.

34
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We can maybe do a little Google search. See if some something pops up really quick.

35
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.120
LG Stylo 5: Again,

36
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.510
LG Stylo 5: And I'm sorry I was a couple minutes late. I was downloading this app to my mom's phone and then I didn't know if I had to like sign into it and then my password and

37
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.760
LG Stylo 5: I'm just gonna go to the room.

38
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.290
You're fine.

39
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.960
LG Stylo 5: Because I know that other phone

40
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.220
LG Stylo 5: This other phone I have

41
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

42
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: 11 o'clock.

43
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So sort of get a sense of what kind of

44
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.490
LG Stylo 5: Doctor mo.

45
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of focus. She was like today, just sort of tune into where you'd like to focus to be. We don't really have anything set, it could be

46
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I could pick a target.

47
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.880
LG Stylo 5: We can be working on a quick

48
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.790
LG Stylo 5: Admin. It's always good to focus on what's happening in the world just five minutes on the coven just

49
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.990
LG Stylo 5: I noticed when I'm at my mom's house. Okay, I don't think I'm at my mom's house they watch the news a lot and I was telling them this last night to

50
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.360
LG Stylo 5: They watch the news constantly and so it's always I'm watching the news. Once you do this, this is happening so many people are dying, blah, blah, blah.

51
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.680
LG Stylo 5: And when I'm at Daniel's house. We don't really we like will watch a couple things like every day to make sure we're in tune with what's going on.

52
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.590
LG Stylo 5: At my mom's house. They're watching the news all the time and I think that's why when I'm here, I'm going crazy and I drive them crazy

53
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:09.870
LG Stylo 5: Because it's just like everywhere Colby Colby Colby and wash your hands and like I know I have been very cautious, of course, but just seeing it everywhere. I think gives me anxiety. And that's what I my mom's house. I'm like, wash your hands wash everything going crazy, you know,

54
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

55
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you do with that new information that new awareness. What do you, what do you do with that I was that

56
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.910
LG Stylo 5: It gets me scared. Honestly, it's really scared to sing it constantly all over everywhere.

57
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:39.600
LG Stylo 5: And then we got a AMBER ALERT, THE OTHER DAY ON I THINK IT WAS ON WEDNESDAY, or I think it was Wednesday for New Mexico, and it was just like stay home. That's all it said amber alert stay home.

58
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.640
LG Stylo 5: Okay, so that freaked me out. So the week. Can we not go at all like, what does that mean, I guess there's like, let us know like stay home. I don't go out

59
00:05:48.150 --> 00:06:00.720
LG Stylo 5: But it scared me like they're even like sending us amber alerts. Like, it's never nothing's ever been this bad like even like when AIDS came out and stars and the flu like never in order to like stay home type thing, you know.

60
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.440
LG Stylo 5: So I guess that's just what's kind of freaking me out at the moment.

61
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So, this feels different you're not used to having it impact you on a personal level, it's always been some other states, some other country isn't happening to me.

62
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

63
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.660
LG Stylo 5: I'm fairly that boy. Yeah.

64
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Then then explain it. So it sounds like. I understand.

65
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.720
LG Stylo 5: Well, not exactly like oh it's never happened to me like, No, no, nothing like that. Just like

66
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.100
LG Stylo 5: I have never expected it to like be

67
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:53.310
LG Stylo 5: Like anything like this to be like worldwide like nationwide. Yeah, a lot of stuff happens in the US or maybe in other countries and stuff but like when it's worldwide pandemic like that. It's like, I guess it's like different

68
00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.180
LG Stylo 5: And that's what makes it I feel more scary because it's actually the whole world. It's not just one state. It's not just one country, it's the whole world.

69
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.910
LG Stylo 5: I guess.

70
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.430
LG Stylo 5: I hope I explained that right

71
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the difference between it. Let's say being just in this country versus all over the world. Why is it scarier.

72
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.340
All over the world.

73
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:34.290
LG Stylo 5: Because it's not just one area. It's the whole world. But the world is huge. That's a lot of people, a lot of people dying and just

74
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the world feel smaller

75
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.370
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

76
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.700
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

77
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So you go with

78
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You go with it to a negative place. The world is. Yeah.

79
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.600
LG Stylo 5: Of course,

80
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. But you could go to a different mindset for that.

81
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.090
LG Stylo 5: That's been that, um, what was it open minded and

82
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.410
LG Stylo 5: It wasn't closed my

83
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: growth mindset versus fixed mindset. Yeah, sure, you could

84
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.760
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, it's mindset I can ever remember that word.

85
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't quite the direction I was inviting but more like

86
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You're standing

87
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it mean to you that the world is not that big. What does it mean to you.

88
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.460
LG Stylo 5: Is so insignificant because of how big the world is

89
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.570
LG Stylo 5: But then now seeing like how fast something can impact the whole world.

90
00:08:46.740 --> 00:09:01.440
LG Stylo 5: Doesn't make me feel more significant. It just, I guess, makes me more where I've never been so aware in my life. And I guess that's kind of what scary means I've never been so aware of everything I know. And especially being Silver's like even more aware, well not sober not drinking

91
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:02.730
LG Stylo 5: Just

92
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:11.640
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, it's just like it's scary. I've never been this aware of anything. So I guess that's maybe what it is that scares me more than anything.

93
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you say to yourself, well I

94
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Am going to be worried if I can't go get high. You are getting high. So I gotta

95
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.650
LG Stylo 5: I gotta

96
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a little bit.

97
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's change some some wording.

98
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like if you and I know you instead of, hey, clean and sober, we agree on the terms what I've been feeling my feelings or

99
00:09:51.150 --> 00:10:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that works for you. That isn't a statement clean and sober, but rather, notice how you said, I'm more aware and how you feel what's going on around

100
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:00.690
LG Stylo 5: Me.

101
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll comment well line worldwide pandemic.

102
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that I have to feel it. I have to go through it and Kent bypasses skip over it numb it. I've got to feel it.

103
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what can we call that the we can go right to

104
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm having to feel my own feeling. I can't come from. But what do we call that so that each time we don't

105
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: call it something else.

106
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.950
LG Stylo 5: I don't know. What do you think we should give me off.

107
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.740
LG Stylo 5: I'm not good at coming up with

108
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.480
LG Stylo 5: Anywhere my feelings.

109
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Just replace clean and sober with another thought, what would it be clean and sober.

110
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: For you.

111
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be another term.

112
00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.190
Well,

113
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.150
LG Stylo 5: Like you said, and just like being more aware, just being aware

114
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

115
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Or even

116
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.260
LG Stylo 5: Feeling my feelings more. That's a good one to either one of those have been good.

117
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.200
LG Stylo 5: I think aware that one. Yeah.

118
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's actually here word

119
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.240
LG Stylo 5: Okay.

120
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All the more reason to use it.

121
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me

122
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.100
LG Stylo 5: Sorry, I'm kind of

123
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:26.760
Tired.

124
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have

125
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To sing justice. I was about to say how are you feeling right now. You said tired.

126
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You are

127
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Presenting with a lot of the giggle. And I'm wondering if you want

128
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself permission.

129
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: To just answer and then it's quiet.

130
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's okay.

131
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.410
LG Stylo 5: Like I

132
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: said, No, no, no, no, you're ready. Read brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief.

133
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:08.820
LG Stylo 5: Yeah.

134
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Your answer is just fine.

135
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Your answer is always just fine. It's always just as good as anyone elses. Breathe into that.

136
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just as good

137
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a great answer. It's yours, it's your first response.

138
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

139
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to see someone else's response to your response.

140
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.660
LG Stylo 5: Like sometimes. My first response isn't always the best response.

141
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So little less

142
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: A little less

143
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A little less

144
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:50.970
LG Stylo 5: If you

145
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.580
LG Stylo 5: See, there it is.

146
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

147
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

148
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:12.450
LG Stylo 5: Well that's been kind of an issue. Honestly, with Daniel my nervous laugh. And we were like thing is like last week, or maybe like a few days ago, he was like he hit a madman, I stop laughing my keep laughing

149
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:18.480
LG Stylo 5: Laughing about mentors left like, you know, I have this, I always have this. Why is it all of a sudden coming up now.

150
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:29.040
LG Stylo 5: He's like will see, I'm just trying to kick you out your habit, you can click on me. Stop doing that. Stop doing that. And I'm like, well, you challenged me so I'm not going to kick out of my happy I got so nervous laugh.

151
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.770
LG Stylo 5: Okay, and he just kind of pushing you pushing it on me, is making it worse as I don't like being told what to do.

152
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.430
Okay.

153
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

154
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.980
LG Stylo 5: I've always been, I

155
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.160
LG Stylo 5: Think I'm so sorry but

156
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's important again to to say we don't want to get rid of something unless we're bringing something in, we can understand why it got developed to begin with on it's there for a reason.

157
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.300
Hmm.

158
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:15.120
LG Stylo 5: I think it's just to feel like empty like the quiet spaces in between the conversation, even though there's not no quiet spaces. It's just, or maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm just nervous. I don't know. It's, I can't not do it so hard.

159
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.210
LG Stylo 5: Father.

160
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I saw

161
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.520
LG Stylo 5: It again.

162
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah but but you did and you did it when you wanted to. You did a little experiment, um,

163
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think it's it's informing. So this is what I've heard, I heard you say it kind of like, hey, Glenn. You know, it's interesting you you bring this up because

164
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You brought it up to, but I really didn't like him. Just saying. Get rid of it like I want to come to terms with it. I want to do it in my own way just telling me to stop isn't gonna work for me. Right.

165
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

166
00:14:52.110 --> 00:15:00.810
LG Stylo 5: Well, just like every single time I do it, he'd like pointed out, like, stop, stop, you know, stop frickin like game and maritime I frickin left leg because me off.

167
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, but you just also

168
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You identify what is possible.

169
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's the quiet.

170
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right after I say something

171
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what goes on in that space. Typically, we were doing this long before you met Daniel, it's got nothing to do with Daniel

172
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.950
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, exactly.

173
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.900
LG Stylo 5: So this got developed a

174
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Long time ago.

175
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.780
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I don't even know when I started to me. Honestly, if I have been doing it forever. I can't even I can't remember. Do I didn't do it.

176
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.410
Right.

177
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're not the only one that has these kind of

178
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.800
I call them like a tick.

179
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes

180
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not

181
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: tying in with a tip. Yeah, we have them.

182
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes people have them in there, they'll have a little thing that

183
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's after after they'll have a little bit, and in my interpretation of it what psychology offers

184
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Around these as

185
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: They there is calling undoing.

186
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And undoing. So you'll see it a lot of times, and people that have compulsive behavior.

187
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: They have to do a particular ritual.

188
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And then everything will be okay. But they have to do it and you don't want to tell them not to

189
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.580
LG Stylo 5: Go see

190
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be very distressed if they don't do it so you don't just stop it.

191
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.690
LG Stylo 5: Right, yeah.

192
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we go back and we say, well,

193
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What is

194
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The big wall it serves

195
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That men right after you say your opinion right after

196
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.170
LG Stylo 5: You speak.

197
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's roll out different people. Let's just see what would happen if you had

198
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.790
Spoken

199
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't giggle.

200
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what would happen with let's just take your mom if you stopped and

201
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't loosen it lightened it up, let's say, hey, I want everybody to wash your hands. It's really important to me.

202
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just left it without a transitional giggle.

203
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you think your opinion, your preference and what you want need just gonna do dynamic with them just really wonder for people with her. How do you think, how am I didn't, didn't have that transition after

204
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:56.670
LG Stylo 5: I guess you're saying the left sends it off was like, Okay, I'm not being serious. Oh, but yeah, you're right, people it might make it seem more serious or not. So I took it. I don't know if I like it. That's what I heard. When you're saying that

205
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:04.080
LG Stylo 5: And it was my mom, she would be fine, I should like, okay, like she's serious like my sister, my brother like that. I feel like

206
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:14.490
LG Stylo 5: I have to make it like I have to give credit to my main thing. I'm curious about. I have to get in the box. And if I'm being too serious. I feel like it might cause completion.

207
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

208
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:23.400
LG Stylo 5: We're getting so I feel like I have to, like, it's like I have to like send like a little bit of like like please like, you know,

209
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:30.420
LG Stylo 5: Like, just to make sure it would be nice, because I don't want to cross that line with anybody here at my mom's house. I don't want to get any arguments.

210
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. That one right there. I don't want to cause an argument.

211
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And part of the stories that you told me are that you have had to be the intermediary

212
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In physical arguments as in, they got very physical

213
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had to get in the middle of them, and I was younger.

214
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.430
Right.

215
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.330

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.720
LG Stylo 5: A very loud mouth.

238
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.720
LG Stylo 5: I don't know. I don't even know what

239
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.000

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:48.990
LG Stylo 5: Okay, and

243
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.080
LG Stylo 5: Kind of block out some time.

244
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't do that.

245
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It is such a mom. Yeah, because she when I

LG Stylo 5: Around well she's in she's over there and the other room in the back of the house, but she's, she's not

250
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.000
Okay.

251
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I very loud mouth and you were doing this.

253
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That is right on either side of you. Yeah.

254
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:43.860
LG Stylo 5: Yeah. And then usually my dad like swimming. So site and then I ran away. Sorry, my dad is in the water. I don't want to hear me.

255
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey guys, I can hear you fine though. Thank you for slam. OK.

256
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. And you don't want mom to feel bad because she feels bad about what happened to you. Her daughter.

257
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.880
Yeah.

258
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.340
LG Stylo 5: So I don't want to make her feel bad by like bringing the past memories because

259
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:15.330
LG Stylo 5: Past and then I like that. No more. They get along fine and they're really happy now. And they, they don't find it all in one.

260
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.850
LG Stylo 5: So like, you know, just, it's in the past but

261
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now here's what upsets aren't

262
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The laughter is unconscious. It is

263
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To the point that a boyfriend's calling you out on it.

264
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.170
Right.

265
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say

266
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something in the presence still

267
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that's what we're talking about. We're trying to get to the point

268
00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know.

269
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: See, here's the thing.

270
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be my motivation and not yours to talk about it because

271
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You might not be bothered by it. You might really love what it does not want to train thing. So I need to ask you.

272
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it something you want to understand. And do you want to be comfortable with the quiet that follows

273
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of naturally 100% on. Do you want any understanding or change around it.

274
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:30.540
LG Stylo 5: I feel like it would be healthier to understand it and understand. I feel like if we help you understand and understand why.

275
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:40.710
LG Stylo 5: I have it. It is a nervous tic and I want to know what the hell where it comes from. Okay. And I know that I have a lot of my passwords to do a lot of problems.

276
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.260
LG Stylo 5: So I know that

277
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear that say that last part again. Go.

278
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.700
LG Stylo 5: I know that a lot of my past has a lot to do with a lot of my problems.

279
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.150
LG Stylo 5: I just never know what part of my past. It is

280
00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.090
LG Stylo 5: Because even before they're doing therapy. I was talking to my elder sister one time and

281
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.110
LG Stylo 5: We're just like talking, you know, getting deep having sister talking, you know, and

282
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:15.120
LG Stylo 5: I don't know for that for some reason we got to the point where we were saying like, what's wrong with us and my sister was saying we because we got treated you growing up because he I was listening to

283
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:33.660
LG Stylo 5: And she helped me realize that myself and that was before I ever even did therapy. So that's something I had realized, you know, and I don't know. I don't know if that's just something maybe she put in my head, or maybe is that I don't know I do feel like I do feel that way though cuz

284
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.300
LG Stylo 5: I was always willing to get in the middle of a fight. So, of course, my dad was a means to me because I was always the one that

285
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.050
LG Stylo 5: Said what I wanted to say and like what you know what I want to do. Okay.

286
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on. Do you know that says kind of

287
00:24:52.170 --> 00:25:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: This connection makes it really hard. Normally you would have seen you very quickly go like this and you wouldn't have been able to say a word, but because there's a delay in the telemedicine you kept talking. I couldn't cut you off.

288
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you just

289
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: For a second, nothing thing.

290
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So please, just listen. Just listen to hold me to, I have to do it sometimes to

291
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole.

292
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This entire time. You did not

293
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.040
LG Stylo 5: Go.

294
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't say anything this entire time, all the way through my dad was always the one my sister, my heart to hearts, all the way through.

295
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one

296
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I do want understanding all the way through that.

297
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way through all the way through all the way through. You get not giggle.

298
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.290
LG Stylo 5: I also didn't breathe.

299
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: In there that was

300
00:25:50.310 --> 00:26:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But now you just let it out and I didn't breathe. So you just got it out. You got it done. So said what I want. So some really important things are coming up, though this is so

301
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Useful. Number one, I found out that my client.

302
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants understanding

303
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Lets you

304
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But I haven't heard if you have some idea of if you knew something else. Even better would replace it. Would you be interested in letting that one go to giggle.

305
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.410
LG Stylo 5: I'm confused. What do you mean like like replacing it with something else.

306
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:28.980
Uh huh.

307
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.060
LG Stylo 5: I mean, yeah, I guess I'd be willing to try. Of course I'll get

308
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: There, it's right there. Yeah.

309
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

310
00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do it again. Do it again. Just not

311
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just not, no.

312
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. You ready

313
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Because my philosophy certainly is a substance. I don't want to take something away.

314
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I have offered a skill, a new insight, some sort of resourcing

315
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So that my clients.

316
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are not left floundering

317
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: With no sense of grounding safety confidence, keep breathing, you're breathing, you're breathing.

318
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.160
So that's my philosophy.

319
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And Sam asking you, yes.

320
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I could offer

321
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that could replace nervous giggle.

322
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it was sufficient. Would you be interested in letting it go

323
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, breathing breathing. Breathing you breathing.

324
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

325
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. So now I have two things I have

326
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: A client that has like yes one understanding

327
00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that I think there's some connection to the use of the past and I have a

328
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Same idea, and might want to let

329
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It well

330
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to have something to replace it. Maybe that would make you give give you the same feeling that the giggle gifts you my onto something here.

331
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.740
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I don't know if it gives me a feeling

332
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's do some investigation around that.

333
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, breathe.

334
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathe out because I guess I wouldn't

335
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Bree Bree Bree Bree Bree Bree Bree Bree. Nice. Nice. Yeah, there it is. Everything's okay. We're okay.

336
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no wrong answer in

337
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.190
LG Stylo 5: Here that

338
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I can get them wrong.

339
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I get them all the time.

340
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't get

341
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your you're always on spot on.

342
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:50.460
Okay.

343
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're sharing what's coming up for you, what's happening.

344
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't get it wrong.

345
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can screw up. I do.

346
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Be a bad client.

347
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

348
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:07.620
LG Stylo 5: You can't

349
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Get past the wall.

350
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's look a little closer at something you said

351
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You said

352
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to say what I want what's

353
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: On my mind remembers something like

354
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:27.270
LG Stylo 5: That

355
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And

356
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.220
It was

357
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In there, so we had a little Twitter.

358
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what that kind of laughter is called yeah

359
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not without a laugh.

360
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You just say what you want and sit

361
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it has to

362
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.550

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to say.

366
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.190
LG Stylo 5: What I wanted

367
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to do it.

368
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I got pushed off to the side.

369
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.140
LG Stylo 5: I got

Gwenevere Abriel: To your dad.

373
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen

374
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:36.690
LG Stylo 5: Currently is like something like bad he, I mean it was just an argument.

375
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.770
LG Stylo 5: We would already

376
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.140
LG Stylo 5: Then apologize later.

377
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.460
LG Stylo 5: Sorry, my little bit

378
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That was great. I got to see it in real time. Shut up.

379
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.160
LG Stylo 5: On it.

380
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.290
LG Stylo 5: Especially with him, I cannot. I can't fight with my little brother. It's like

381
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't fight with me and him are

382
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:10.080
LG Stylo 5: The same. So we're both like really hot headed. So if we fight. Oh, it's a bad fight like I have to fight with him as much as I can.

383
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.480
LG Stylo 5: Not to vote them.

384
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you said we wanted to say. Shut up out of the laughter

385
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

386
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to that again. I don't know that you that you could live with.

387
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:41.910
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, it's hard. I think I feel like it'd be really hard. It's like kicking in another drug

388
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Interaction with your dad.

389
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We would argue

390
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If I told my dad.

391
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just think it's something on a different opinion than him.

392
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But something you've had a different opinion you kinda like way. I don't see a cherry.

393
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.920
LG Stylo 5: What's up about the I take the

394
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.700
LG Stylo 5: Pension and Suboxone he doesn't agree with that at all.

395
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How does he sound. Let me hear his voice Oh, Nicola Urubamba by you're still

396
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.180
LG Stylo 5: You're still on the pills and you're still taking all that crap.

397
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.450
LG Stylo 5: My and

398
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:32.280
LG Stylo 5: So it's not like you're any better than your sister told me and

399
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.390
LG Stylo 5: You're basically you're still taking pills and all this crap and he thinks he gets me all hires and thing, I guess.

400
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.250
LG Stylo 5: And

401
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:49.740
LG Stylo 5: We should she doesn't, because I'm fine. Like I'm walking around don't fuckin sorry i'll frickin nodding out

402
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:57.000
LG Stylo 5: But he makes it seem like is it is just as bad as dangerous like actually drugs. Right.

403
00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do his version. When you do this side.

404
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still on those goals you know better than you.

405
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't legal and then we went into your defense position. You did it.

406
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: When you talk your side.

407
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But not dad, not when you're in real reflection and not when you're calling something

408
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't do it.

409
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it just when you look but it's not. It's not like I'm

410
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting high

411
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's hold on to that little piece right there.

412
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not here now it's just me.

413
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I'm him.

414
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And all we're going to do is you can give as much as you want but just to see that it's at least on purpose that you have some choice in water. So it's not totally unconscious get to decide how you want to talk

415
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit just to see when

416
00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You put it on.

417
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.290

Gwenevere Abriel: You want to say, okay,

421
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:23.850

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: feel angry. I don't know what yours is going to be, but you get my point slow wave long as

423
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.320

LG Stylo 5: My football camp, sir. Okay. Oh, okay. So, sorry.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So you may want to go get you on a banana to address the cramps, you want to get in a company position. What do you need to do.

431
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.840
LG Stylo 5: No, I just had to stretch out my leg just from sitting cross

432
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.070
LG Stylo 5: So,

433
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.240

LG Stylo 5: Hi. LAUGHS

467
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.430

468
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you can tell them

469
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You just got

470
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You just got a whole bunch of giggles out just now you just

Gwenevere Abriel: Charge pension just like my brothers. So you let them out either out

472
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.990
LG Stylo 5: You brought a lot of attention to all about so

473
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:44.310
I know

474
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of the reasons why I'm asking you to actually

475
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To look me

476
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that your brother.

477
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.030
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, he has given me my cat. I'm sorry.

478
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.110
LG Stylo 5: I'm like why why even bigger to me, let me alone.

479
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.120
LG Stylo 5: So that

480
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.130
LG Stylo 5: Sorry, he left. I'm alone. We're good. I don't know where distractions.

481
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So get back to you about your process. Again, I don't care.

482
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care if you can keep your brother in there. I'm not concerned about those things, what I'm concerned about is if we're doing meaningful work. That's all. Okay, so

483
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune in again to I feel silly. So just noticed that you perfectly fine with every single statement loving

484
00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Every single one. That one doesn't bother you.

485
00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But this therapist of yours who I'm assuming I have some credibility is LCP do

486
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Something puts in place that you can speak.

487
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Consciously

488
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention to how you're feeling

489
00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you decide what she's

490
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think that's silly. I think I deliver it in a really goofy way but the intervention itself can still be useful, even though it's packaged with funny looking springs and bows and kind of fully smelly stickers. I think they

491
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Can

492
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Why does it

493
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

494
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.890
LG Stylo 5: No I your techniques. I'm not saying they're bad. I just said, my brother doesn't

495
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.110
LG Stylo 5: Know anything about therapy. So I thought you'd probably like, what the hell. She did.

496
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.680
LG Stylo 5: He's only 17 you know so

497
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to pick will pick that up. What's your 17 year old brother, but I don't want to go in this moment.

498
00:39:53.820 --> 00:40:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the things that my mouth is to look at me and it is a piece of this intervention that's important. So whatever you need to do to brace yourself if you need to hold on like this and

499
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Really get yourself protected because this is an even more vulnerable.

500
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In Washington, looking at me.

501
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Do whatever you need hard now. And here you're because you've been doing this the whole session. They want to just keep the hand here know, put it back.

502
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's no criticism.

503
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It means that you're doing something that this, this is getting to giggle is right here. So don't be surprised and just

504
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.420
Yeah.

505
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you might be able to

506
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: feel safer if this is kind of comfort in a little

507
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:53.640
LG Stylo 5: Like, I guess, and with I'm doing something that was never comfortable or something where, like, I don't remember. I feel like tension in the air like have to grab my neck. It's weird.

508
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

509
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:55.470
LG Stylo 5: I feel nervous.

510
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: To do it.

511
00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.860
LG Stylo 5: Okay, right now I don't mean

512
00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.380
LG Stylo 5: It just happens, what happens

513
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I want to do an experiment with you. I'd like to see what happens if you do it, and if the giggle pulls back a little. Okay, so let's do this again. And I know it's uncomfortable to look me right in the eye.

514
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But catches as much as you can, looking at me because it'll feel more intense. So I'm going to say to you is that, and remember, you're going to say the

515
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Word.

516
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is putting space in between the words which is perfect, but as add do

Gwenevere Abriel: So,

Gwenevere Abriel: So you're still putting

522
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, you're the same as your sisters

523
00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you're better than them. But, you know, as you're in there getting high and your through your insurance, you're no better than them.

524
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at me.

596
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:09.000
LG Stylo 5: Maybe just breathing instead of trying to maybe catch the live because even when I tried to catch it no matter what. It's still have to push yourself out of the car. I got up there it is.

597
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.760

Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll it

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It hasn't really landed when you get it that light switch will go on.

615
00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be able to stop.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The

620
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:31.290

Gwenevere Abriel: I

622
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in the moment.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting closer and closer to see me now you're observing, you're like, Oh my gosh, I was fine.

624
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And I had to just

625
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Work.

626
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no consciousness.

627
00:48:55.410 --> 00:49:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's what you you came up with the solution yourself. You said maybe I could breathe instead of giggle. Maybe I can play with all that you brought that up yourself.

628
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.570
LG Stylo 5: Did I thought you said that

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.450
LG Stylo 5: Oh, just know. Okay, I thought you meant in the beginning, I was like, when you told me that

632
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well as to the free. That's true. But I didn't say I didn't say was going to listen and came up with that.

633
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.280
LG Stylo 5: Yeah. Gotcha.

634
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What's left is

635
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There still attention.

636
00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And quite doesn't do the trick. Like, I can go. Can I have a nice nice nice charge to it's what

637
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to we'll, we'll do a little bit more around that.

638
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What I heard please you noticed I cry for one

639
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:55.890
Yeah.

640
00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: For once, and that means something to you, that means something.

641
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:10.920
LG Stylo 5: Does is easy. It's really hard for me to open up with my feelings and everything, and especially talking about that part of my past that we're talking about today.

642
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:21.210
LG Stylo 5: I usually always cry. I always no matter what, like just thinking about it makes me tear up and for some reason even right now. I'm not tearing up. It's weird.

643
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:28.200
LG Stylo 5: It's really weird. I'm getting more and more accepting it. I think maybe is what that means.

644
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so no crime equals acceptance.

645
00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:39.090
LG Stylo 5: I'm hoping I'm not sure I'm hoping so. Though It's An idea.

646
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to ask you something.

647
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You

648
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's only a guest because you probably never done this before. If I pulled today's session and I brought it up on the screen.

649
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard for me to see

650
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Self, because if this was a really cool one within

651
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.310
LG Stylo 5: Wow, while doing all these miracles.

652
00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.070

LG Stylo 5: I mean, I look horrible, horrible today. I did not want to watch myself. It looks up

676
00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen to it. Why don't you listen to, because it's really different to step back and remember recordings mess with the voice a little bit like how it sounds in your head, you can hear your own voice. And it's because it's coming from inside wrong skull.

677
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:48.690
In
