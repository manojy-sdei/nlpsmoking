40
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:55.590
Adrian Chavez: Well, it's just, it's also like going through the same stuff in the same girl all that same stuff over against

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.360
Adrian Chavez: That we met up to her ex boyfriend, the RD in town, and she went and gave him $100 but she's crying.

47
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.740
Adrian Chavez: Because I even spent $15 to fix the toilet like she's

48
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.500
Adrian Chavez: A big fight.

49
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.720
Adrian Chavez: I think I do a lot. Yeah, she did it. She actually she helps a lot. She does a lot for me but

50
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.380
Adrian Chavez: It's just a feeling like I don't, I'm not with it. I don't feel like shit I

51
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:53.370
Adrian Chavez: feel pretty good. I usually mostly it's pretty good. But there's always that week or the month.

52
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.970
Adrian Chavez: She's, she's left to works.

53
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are you thinking about things like you're thinking about some decisions, you want to make about your relationship.

54
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:20.250
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, but I don't really have no just using well I do, I love, I love everything I add in Espanol I just asked. I left everything

55
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.190
Adrian Chavez: And everything that was

56
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.940
Adrian Chavez: Started a year again.

57
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.250
Adrian Chavez: I even if I was on probation. I left off.

58
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.330
Adrian Chavez: So I gotta go back and face of that to

59
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You how far is that from where you are.

60
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.170
Adrian Chavez: Three and a half hours.

61
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:50.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, getting mixed everything's kind of far away. I'm in Florida. So Jonah, but it also again.

62
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:51.870
Adrian Chavez: Yeah.

63
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I remember

64
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The first time we met there were a lot of things that would concern me about that relationship.

65
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She said she's the hydra medication.

66
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:18.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm talk bad. It was really challenging yourself esteem, you couldn't really even get through a full session without just talking about how much stress you had a relationship with her.

67
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That was when we were in the program. And then when you came back. It was different.

68
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:45.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said that you guys were working well together. And actually, what changed the really identify what it was. So do you feel the relationship is going back to what it was when we first met, or do you think this is just a little bump in the road.

69
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.970
Adrian Chavez: I think it's just a little bump in the road.

70
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.060
Adrian Chavez: That every, every month.

71
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.720
Adrian Chavez: Same thing.

72
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.640
Adrian Chavez: It's hard because she has her son to is, that's your to with us and he sees all this and

73
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.100
Adrian Chavez: He

74
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:13.110
Adrian Chavez: Like human or they don't even like talk like human or non Jesus in his room. Once she gets on it goes to the zoo.

75
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:23.280
Adrian Chavez: And then when she leaves. He comes on sees it mean that people will go outside of basketball or something lunch she comes, you got events to Israel. I don't know.

76
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you think that means about the relationship between them.

77
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.940
Adrian Chavez: What's going on, she doesn't pay attention to him is

78
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.650
Adrian Chavez: He just says she's a bitch.

79
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you feel that way about her.

80
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.550
Adrian Chavez: Most the time no and stuff. Like I said just the week of the month.

81
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.000
Adrian Chavez: We are good. This whole I've been back already two months. And we've only thought maybe one time before this.

82
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:12.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, after the disagreement. You guys resolve anything. Are you still not speaking

83
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:18.330
Adrian Chavez: No, I try, I try it. But she's just she wants to walk out the door.

84
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:30.900
Adrian Chavez: Manage I could actually three or four times shadow makeup and when she leaves off back just to say something like, or you don't really have an appointment, you don't really have

85
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.680
Adrian Chavez: You don't really need your script alert sure that that

86
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.890
Adrian Chavez: I couldn't even for my students this morning persons last night. That's my standard to Walgreens cycle. Get it last night didn't have right

87
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.740
Adrian Chavez: And not yeah still

88
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'll see you need a ride to get your prescription

89
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.640
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, she's at the car. I don't have a driver's license.

90
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we see you try to make up what does that look like, how do you try to make up

91
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:13.350
Adrian Chavez: No, I'll go up to and I'll tell you I'm sorry but I don't even know why I'm saying, I'm sorry, but she's the one that matter for me spending $15 on something for the house.

92
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.980
Adrian Chavez: And she's giving her scores from winning behind my back.

93
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:30.810
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, that wasn't even I wasn't even caring about any recruiters even running but then when I spent the money that we had a little bit to be saved, a little bit. I spent that on she's all $15 misty guys oh yeah I went and bought this

94
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.020
Adrian Chavez: Shirt it I bought it sounds like

95
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:35.550
Adrian Chavez: Oh,

96
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.000
Adrian Chavez: Sorry. So that's where I started.

97
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm seeing what what happened now so

98
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How come she doesn't believe that you need to get your prescription

99
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.720
Adrian Chavez: I don't know. And I need her ID to take it out cuz

100
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.640
Adrian Chavez: Cuz I guess some narcotic whatever

101
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.480
Adrian Chavez: And then tell she's ready. After we on her.

102
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.780
Adrian Chavez: I'll be able to get to have my ID.

103
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:07.710
Yeah.

104
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

105
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.370
Adrian Chavez: whenever she's ready to be midnight for it, but

106
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.260
Adrian Chavez: She just says is hard to deal with, especially at this time.

107
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This time you say the one we got a month you talking about period.

108
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.510
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, that's

109
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Why you had to make me say what can you to say.

110
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. All right. So you think this is like hormonal and it's that time of the month.

111
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.600
Yeah.

112
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.660
Adrian Chavez: And I sent it before she does.

113
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.850
Adrian Chavez: She does.

114
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.590
Adrian Chavez: Already know but hopefully we'll get over it as

115
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.340
Adrian Chavez: We do have not invested in this relationship.

116
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:54.870
Adrian Chavez: I do

117
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What I'm investments in this

118
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.660
Adrian Chavez: Well, we have a house together, we have

119
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.970
Adrian Chavez: Our fields together, we have

120
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.810
Adrian Chavez: That's just kind of seems like everything's Herzog's everything's under her name, but

121
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:23.400
Adrian Chavez: I'm fine with it though, as long as I have. I just didn't nine and a half years of business. So I'm going to have a roof over my head and

122
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:24.960
Adrian Chavez: Adam

123
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:33.570
Adrian Chavez: Who knows, I might even be going back, cuz I think Justin charges last year and I left the town.

124
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:35.820
Adrian Chavez: So,

125
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I see your anxiety, you know, you're playing with the little thing you're, you know,

126
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:55.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is the time will be a walk, walk through it and develop some skills to help with that anxiety because these are real life stressors, the legal issues, the relationship challenges.

127
00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:03.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The good thing that should cut the pattern in the relationship that you know when it's that time of the month, she gets a little more irritable.

128
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:24.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so you're you're aware of that. And so then it's how do I navigate when I already see the signs that she's a little irritated. How do we still communicate and how can I help her to recognize that when it's her time in the month, she gets a little more irritated.

129
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:38.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is what you would work on and how to communicate. Because like you said this is relationship. I guess this is the force that it takes. So what would be a respectful way to communicate with you notice

130
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To girlfriend.

131
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:55.140
Adrian Chavez: I don't know what else I could do for her. I actually do everything clean. I watch a kid. I don't think she does is she works like 15 hours out of the week.

132
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.540
Adrian Chavez: I do everything else.

133
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Everything you're saying what you do, you're saying the actions I asked you, What could you

134
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.130
Adrian Chavez: Say,

135
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that's what's missing.

136
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.530
Adrian Chavez: Over all the time.

137
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.280
Adrian Chavez: Thank make her feel good. I see beautiful every day.

138
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, this is

139
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:26.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the question was, how could you help her to recognize that when it's that time of the month, she gets a little more irritable.

140
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:34.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you want to be able to communicate respectfully during this time so that it doesn't become big issue.

141
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:51.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So saying she's beautiful. That helps. But what happens if she communicates to you in her frustration, what could you say to her to help her recognize that your communication together is not healthy. What would you say to her.

142
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm her. Tell me what you would say

143
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.440
Adrian Chavez: As almost Italian

144
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.690
Adrian Chavez: I don't even know what

145
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I feel

146
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:22.260
Adrian Chavez: I feel like I'm the only one that's pleasing in all that work in this relationship and

147
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.440
Adrian Chavez: I'm doing everything like

148
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.390
Adrian Chavez: I can even with her son, I'm doing everything she needs to pay more attention to what's going on here.

149
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.030
Adrian Chavez: She just keeps she might be 66 but she needs to start

150
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.970
Adrian Chavez: I feel like she's not paying attention to.

151
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.810
Adrian Chavez: Me and her son, he should maybe that's what it is.

152
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So a way to say

153
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I feel neglected in this relationship.

154
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I need more time with

155
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your son needs more time.

156
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:20.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That we get more attention than starting off with the I feel I do everything in this relationship. So you see the difference in those statements, someone says, I feel I do everything in this relationship, the person's going to get defensive

157
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:32.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because those absolute statements like everything. Nothing. Always remember those are trigger words for defense.

158
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:39.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you don't do everything because like you said she worked 15 hours a week.

159
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know she

160
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Has the house and running.

161
00:18:44.460 --> 00:19:00.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So she's going to bring that up and because you say, I feel I do everything and her defense what she can go to one or two things. She's going to minimize the things that you do or she's going to throw in your face all the things that she does.

162
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:07.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And either way you're going to get upset and that's an argument is going to start

163
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.060
Adrian Chavez: Okay.

164
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:15.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you start with I feel and you don't use always never

165
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: EVERYTHING YOU DON'T USE THOSE ABSOLUTES

166
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:30.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right so good that you practice that with me because I was able to get from that is oh you feeling like you want more time with her.

167
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, she's always asleep. But she sits on

168
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

169
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:49.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's okay, you know, even in sickness, say, you know, I feel that I need more time with you. I understand you're sick.

170
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I need more time so I feel I understand. I need

171
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:05.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even if there's something that you can see that man she sits on my car by you throwing the I understand you said, but I need

172
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that you're speaking more towards the feelings versus

173
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:23.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Trying to balance out what you do versus what she does in that you didn't even bring her up, you're talking about everything you need.

174
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:39.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then that that gives her an opportunity to to tell you what she can do to meet those needs. So you watch you not able to make those needs or apologize for not meeting those needs and from her response that gives you an idea.

175
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of how you can navigate this conflict in your relationship.

176
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:51.420
Adrian Chavez: Thank you.

177
00:20:53.250 --> 00:21:06.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's try it again. Let's think of, I feel, fill in the blank if there's anything you want to send about the situation. I understand and i mean i feel i understand i mean

178
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is something that's bothering you right now.

179
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Practice with me, so you could find a way to discuss this with your girlfriend.

180
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:32.340
Adrian Chavez: Right, feel that we would need to spend more time together to understand each other better evening.

181
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Say, Well, what do we need to understand about each other. What would you say

182
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:46.890
Adrian Chavez: No why you feel

183
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.060
Adrian Chavez: Why we are you so much over buildings.

184
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.720
Adrian Chavez: Yes, is actually living beings.

185
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I feel

186
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our communication can be bad.

187
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand this is a hard time right now.

188
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:13.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I need for our communication to get better, so that we can work through these challenges.

189
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.660
Adrian Chavez: Because we're both kind of stress right now she's been will tip to and and I worry about her.

190
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.950
Adrian Chavez: Because she has helped me it is you've got me out of the

191
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.380
Adrian Chavez: Reason why the street.

192
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is she from

193
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:38.640
Adrian Chavez: She had

194
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:49.230
Adrian Chavez: Cancer and they took it out, which they had to take her intestines left her with like a foot and a half the distance and now she's eating. She has colon cancer.

195
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.590

196
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.240

Adrian Chavez: There's this

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.200
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, more nervous about her.

200
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:14.670
Adrian Chavez: About

201
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.950
Adrian Chavez: That I think about it, it's been a that's been like the last two weeks, three weeks I've been waiting for his appointment.

202
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.610
Adrian Chavez: Tomorrow morning, so I need to try to make me shoot right for her.

203
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

204
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:44.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You understand that she might be helped counted in a hard time. But this is an opportunity for the I feel I understand.

205
00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:58.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I feel it's very important for me to make this appointment tomorrow and disabled a lot on your plate right now, but I need to make this planet, very important.

206
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.750
Adrian Chavez: Cuz she's like 19 I have right now.

207
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.790
Adrian Chavez: Yes she does get sick. I mean, it sucks.

208
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.490
Adrian Chavez: But how does she

209
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.980
35

210
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.750
Adrian Chavez: And they took out the other other cancer like seven years ago.

211
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:36.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you ever did you ever think you're worried about what might happen with the hell is going to communicate back

212
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.760
Adrian Chavez: Oh yeah, she knows she knows all about

213
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.810
Adrian Chavez: That I am a night out all the time and she knows it.

214
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:50.100
Adrian Chavez: Because I make sure that she makes her appointments. Yeah.

215
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She has she ever expressed to you.

216
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: About her house.

217
00:24:59.460 --> 00:24:59.730
Adrian Chavez: Really

218
00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.540
Adrian Chavez: Well, there's a couple of times that she's been hospitalized all we've been together and

219
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.780
Adrian Chavez: That's what kind of scared me it up as

220
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.940
Adrian Chavez: She was pretty soon.

221
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.150
Adrian Chavez: So that again.

222
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.640
Adrian Chavez: If something happens, you know, I'll take you over. Yeah.

223
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:28.710
Adrian Chavez: Yeah.

224
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How would you get those needs met for yourself.

225
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:39.840
Adrian Chavez: To do what

226
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said you have the court tomorrow disappointment.

227
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.050
Adrian Chavez: Know her appointment.

228
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, I was your appointment. Okay.

229
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To get your, your medication.

230
00:25:54.660 --> 00:26:07.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm also hearing the trust or either. Maybe the denial helped me to figure it out when it comes to addiction, because in the past you had just the boxing and actually telling you, you don't need to be

231
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So whereas yet. And when it comes to your recovery.

232
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:29.880
Adrian Chavez: Nah. She wants me Street and she didn't want me today. I guess to be in control of everything that I do there is like Sean get my script and show given to me as needed. Like if the bottle says one day. It's all I get is one a day if that

233
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.270
Adrian Chavez: But like my Suboxone. Yeah. She'll give me those make

234
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.060
Adrian Chavez: Sure, leave them on the monitor in the morning, look.

235
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.790
Adrian Chavez: Like anything else. I have to wait until

236
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.270
Adrian Chavez: And I think that's not pretty fucked up because she gets her pills and I don't take nothing that varies

237
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:47.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You

238
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.210
Adrian Chavez: Know, she's on pain medication for pain.

239
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or pain medication. No.

240
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.340
Adrian Chavez: I don't like description like feels

241
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:13.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what do you think that coming from DC gets control that should give you the one fill that time, or is it that she doesn't trust that you will just take one. What is it,

242
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.600
Adrian Chavez: A little bit of both.

243
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.750
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, it's both.

244
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's both.

245
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.300
Adrian Chavez: She likes to be in control of everything.

246
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.520
Adrian Chavez: And

247
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.980
Adrian Chavez: Maybe there is a couple of timer so that I did abuse me but maybe like

248
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:53.100
Adrian Chavez: To have me back to well policy, we're not like three or four, nothing like that. But that was what I was in other pills. I was on Xanax and then that was different. Yeah.

249
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.270
Adrian Chavez: And then I don't know. She takes these shows are just like those

250
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the accident.

251
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.880
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, she thinks she said she thinks everything that I get is for addicts, I guess.

252
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I her mind to to be sober. That means you just quit cold turkey, you don't need the box. You don't need anything.

253
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:24.480
Adrian Chavez: She bought me lunch she yes she brought me nothing that I got on the Suboxone program with you guys.

254
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.190
Adrian Chavez: On like this. Because if not, I would have ministry. Yeah.

255
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:39.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so it's hard if she is from the mindset because there are some people that have that mindset that you should have the discipline.

256
00:28:39.960 --> 00:29:04.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To just quit. You don't need medication just quit stop doing the drugs. And so if she doesn't see that Suboxone is that support to get you to a place of sobriety, then it might be difficult. Have you ever, like kind of told her what the Suboxone is for

257
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.330
Adrian Chavez: The boxing program. Yeah, she knows all that. But she's

258
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:22.710
Adrian Chavez: She's never been through that. Yeah, she's never had a day without her appeal just been on their purposes for 10 years 12 years just never had to do without it, so she doesn't know what it's like to be

259
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.010
Adrian Chavez: Sick or

260
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.950
Adrian Chavez: I'm sure she didn't have as you buy would

261
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.230
Adrian Chavez: Have to put her on the corner.

262
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that'd be something

263
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The tables will turn

264
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:56.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's an accurate assessment that to say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that perhaps is not enough conversations about feelings in relationship.

265
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.230
Adrian Chavez: To it again.

266
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:07.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it is it accurate because based on what you're telling me I'm making an assessment. So I'm if I'm right or wrong is that you and your girlfriend, don't talk enough about feelings.

267
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You guys kind of just talk at each other and not with each other.

268
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.880
Yeah.

269
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.610
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, that's right.

270
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.880
Adrian Chavez: So how do we do that. Yeah.

271
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I feel I understand, and I need

272
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:39.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you have a calm voice Adrian. So if you just find the right words say you can be able to say in a non threatening approach.

273
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:51.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Never really, you know, again, it's group, but I've never heard you raise your voice, even when you're anxious or frustrated. I can tell by your facial reaction, but not by your tone.

274
00:30:52.770 --> 00:31:00.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's good because a lot of men have that challenge that when they get upset their tone changes and they go, yell.

275
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:09.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So if you already have the benefit that you can keep a level tone. You just need the words.

276
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:22.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so, but I feel that I understand, and I need a good and the first time you try it. She may look at you crazy because she's not used to that way of communicating

277
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:41.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There may be some resistance. But if this is this amazing girlfriend that you talked about she eventually going to catch that need to work on half of you lucky because agents talking to me in a non threatening approach and what he's saying. This actually makes sense.

278
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.720
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, that she needs it.

279
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But she may not get it that first time because this will be new for the both of you.

280
00:31:54.690 --> 00:32:00.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you have opportunity to introduce a new way of communicating in your relationship.

281
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:22.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even if the first time it doesn't go the way that you expect it, you keep doing it because you already know that man, this feels like this might be something. But even when I practice it with you, you, you, I saw something light up like my work. That's a good way to see things

282
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:32.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And right now, you guys don't have that tool of the right way to say thing. It's just like there's a conflict that you can map on a talk, or we're going to argue

283
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:47.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But how about we introduce a better alternative. We're just going to work through the challenges because okay my legal issues are going away to

284
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The financial issues aren't going away tomorrow.

285
00:32:52.770 --> 00:33:06.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our health concerns on one with a mile, but we can communicate better so that we can work through these challenges together. So over time, when they're gone. We're still together. We're still a healthy relationship.

286
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:11.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I think you want that.

287
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.260
Adrian Chavez: Yeah.

288
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.830

318
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:37.740
Adrian Chavez: Now,

319
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.870
Adrian Chavez: I don't know any other team, but being here with her really

320
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:54.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good that you have a love that makes you feel connected and makes you feel supported

321
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:04.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe start off with that you know that when she gets home you know when there's arguments, when the person comes on, you can be okay.

322
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When she gets home.

323
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe not start with the I feel neglected. If you know she very upset.

324
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You seller acting support it.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I understand you have a lot going on with your life.

327
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what you give me what I need to give me love

328
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:33.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so that starts on very positive. What is she gonna say after that.

329
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If I want me to go. My husband told me that even if I was mad. I wonder what

330
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would have nothing to say muslims on the day

331
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:51.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then maybe later on to tell her. No, I feel we can do better in our communities.

332
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Understand, you have a lot going on right now very stressful.

333
00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:03.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I need for us to do and how we talk to each other.

334
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.650
Adrian Chavez: I want to practice that on later she gets up.

335
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:08.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

336
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:20.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He is a boy. So it's always good to you know have to, you know, just all you need is the words you already have your template you just fill in the blank and you practice it.

337
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And remember, stay away from what you do the actions.

338
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because right there. That is long Arden. I do all of this, what do you do

339
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:37.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Never works well.

340
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:47.430
So,

341
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What about the job. They said, You've been working two days a week.

342
00:37:53.130 --> 00:38:00.330
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, I just been working around Nick here just doing stuff because I went and I bought us a machine to paint houses.

343
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.040
Adrian Chavez: So I've been prepping the house around here.

344
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:19.650
Adrian Chavez: Um, but yeah. The last couple weeks then at this virus everybody's like all scattered on here too. So I guess the slash couple besides work around the house. We now use that to like advertise because

345
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.760
Adrian Chavez: I know I do a good job on it. So I'll take some pictures and

346
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.490
Adrian Chavez: Because I'm going to take off the all like the

347
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:27.900
Adrian Chavez: The

348
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:34.950
Adrian Chavez: The auto paneling because it like rotted out but I'm gonna take off the one that's rather than put new ones and

349
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.280
Adrian Chavez: Take off the tree means and put new ones.

350
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:40.740
Adrian Chavez: Make it look nice.

351
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good advertising take pictures you put it on.

352
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:56.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Facebook social media, whatever you have gone on to advertise and maybe now, people will take advantage of getting some homework parents

353
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:16.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: stay busy stay busy as they occupied, because if you send the past you relax. You know, the way you prove to your girlfriend that you can be consistent that she doesn't have to be controlling is near respond to

354
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:26.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your responsibility is going to help develop trust and then she doesn't have to be as controlling

355
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:36.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The older my kids get, the less controlling I have to be if they've already proved to me that they're responsible

356
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.290
Adrian Chavez: I guess that's the reason a relationship.

357
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.300
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, you

358
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:53.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: can trust. I don't have to push for all I can tell you from a woman's perspective, you really don't want to control really want to take a break.

359
00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:09.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if we feel that we're not in control that is going to go to waste. It's going to mess up and we're going to take it on. But we're going to resent that we had to take it on.

360
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:20.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so that anger and hurt Aaron's irritability might be some resentment for for having to control me

361
00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:32.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: give her an opportunity to see that you're responsible and you're trustworthy that she doesn't have to. You might have to remind her. You can trust me, I got this.

362
00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when you say those words, you have to back it up.

363
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.580
Adrian Chavez: Yeah, no I don't, I don't abuse my stuff. I don't think I don't even have

364
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:50.970
Adrian Chavez: Like an iron everyone

365
00:40:52.530 --> 00:41:06.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just maybe tell her that more often. I'm having a good day. I don't have any pregnancies. I've been sober for however you save the day because now this is helping her to see your progress to

366
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you don't see a progress. How can you allow someone else to see

367
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:23.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can minimize your progress, even in group in the mobile, we say, oh, you showed up. You don't feel good. You like, Well, I'm always here to minimize that you're doing a good job.

368
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:25.290
Adrian Chavez: Yeah.

369
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.960
Adrian Chavez: I guess I was used to do next.

370
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:35.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah so used to the relaxing messing up and you go for cleaning up the mess.

371
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:56.220

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.220
