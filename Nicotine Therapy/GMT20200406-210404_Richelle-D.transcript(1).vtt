135
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.240

136
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.050
Richelle Direny: But just being intentional about each

137
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.030
Richelle Direny: Time that you need to decide first

138
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:14.160
Richelle Direny: Is to talk about any changes that you've identified from being on the medication as it's related to what

145
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.700
Christine Campbell: Even if there's

146
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.880

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.440
Richelle Direny: Of looking at it from a

163
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.140
Richelle Direny: I look at the whole I take like a holistic approach. Like how does your underlining

164
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:46.470
Richelle Direny: Your past events mental health and all of that. How does it relate to your addiction. What is going, how does it relate relate to your addiction.

Christine Campbell: You know, yeah.

172
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:12.090
Richelle Direny: Whatever it is. So, but, you know, I think each counselor has a different title, but it's a neat.

173
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:12.720
Christine Campbell: Neat.

174
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.310
Richelle Direny: My opinion. I think they're all

175
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.720
Richelle Direny: Interrelated and suddenly they

176
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.950
Richelle Direny: All kind of crossover.

177
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.210
Christine Campbell: Right. Yeah. I think the other more the medical standpoint.

178
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.560
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but I mean,

179
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.390

Richelle Direny: Yeah.

211
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:03.720
That's

212
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.080
Richelle Direny: Right now.

213
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:13.410
Christine Campbell: Like

214
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.680
Richelle Direny: Right now norm. So

215
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.430
Richelle Direny: But just identifying those triggers.

216
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.440
Richelle Direny: Triggers

217
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.990
Richelle Direny: Like whatever your mental health life, whatever is the

218
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:25.770
Trigger to that.

219
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.850
Richelle Direny: Mental illness, if you will.

220
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:39.510
Richelle Direny: You know it's identifying those triggers. Because sometimes, depending on how you know how overwhelming, it becomes that how much is having an impact.

221
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.620
Richelle Direny: On your hair and now

222
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.330
Richelle Direny: That can trigger

223
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.030
Richelle Direny: To use whatever it is, whatever, whether it's

224
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.310
Richelle Direny: Because it numbs that overwhelming feeling

225
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.360
Christine Campbell: Right.

226
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.830
Richelle Direny: So I think all of them. Like I said, all of them is interrelated, so I don't

227
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.610
Richelle Direny: You know, it's not like a perfect one shoe for all

228
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.000
Christine Campbell: But

229
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.060
Richelle Direny: I will definitely say what are the goal is to work on.

230
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.240

238
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.150
Christine Campbell: Myself, I usually don't win.

239
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.000
Christine Campbell: I'm really glad I did it today. I think the sun coming out helped a lot.

240
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.300
Richelle Direny: It's been overcast

241
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.020
Christine Campbell: Yeah.

242
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.600
Richelle Direny: Now, in terms of like when you talk about what's your

243
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:35.010
Richelle Direny: Depression, you said that one of the things that you're happy about is that you got up and you were able to get my house.

Richelle Direny: No.

248
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.250
Christine Campbell: It's not that I feel sad. I just don't have any energy

249
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.300

250
00:19:53.010 --> 00:20:06.720

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:22.590
Christine Campbell: Today though it didn't bother me not to do. Sometimes I just think, I don't know why that bothers which and it ain't nothing but it's stupid phone call, but sometimes just think like it's too much.

252
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.960
Christine Campbell: Stupid but

253
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.500

Richelle Direny: And there's no underlining medical issues, right.

258
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.530
Christine Campbell: All about

259
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.630
Christine Campbell: Long time ago.

260
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:55.620
Christine Campbell: Because I had a return on Friday, they get it done to be on the Humira they have to do your blood work and he found a Pepsi.

261
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.000
Christine Campbell: And so then what for extensive bloodwork

262
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.530
Christine Campbell: Tonight I want you to a specialist and he said, I didn't have it.

263
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.340
Christine Campbell: 30 years later I will go into the blood bank give blood to $60

264
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:25.350
Christine Campbell: They also do take blood work to to live a couple times and they got stuck. You know, the back from their people. And he said, I still have the antibodies, so I can't do that anymore.

265
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:32.490
Christine Campbell: So we're back to my doctor and I told her, you know what, I wouldn't know if I have it or not, you know, because now it's

266
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.150
Christine Campbell: Up to me out and I think cuz

267
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.430
Christine Campbell: I would like to know that.

268
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.960
Christine Campbell: Feeling if you come back, say WAY. Dave came back 30 years ago because I want to one place

269
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.400
Christine Campbell: And they said, If I don't understand, like,

270
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.810
Christine Campbell: Oh, again, I

271
00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.340
Christine Campbell: Had the antibodies, but I don't have any

272
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.780
Christine Campbell: Body.

273
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:22.380
Christine Campbell: Or, you know, get the data like the specialist did years ago, but I feel necessary. It has to be right now with all this stuff going on. I'll just wait.

274
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.540
Christine Campbell: Really want to go and where we're there. You know, bunch of people are so

275
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.020
Christine Campbell: So that's it.

276
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.280
Richelle Direny: So we can work on like

277
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.620
Richelle Direny: Because you have such low energy, I

278
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.000
Richelle Direny: Don't really have the energy

279
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.840
To do anything.

280
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.360
Richelle Direny: So one goal we could work on is identify at least one town.

281
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.560
Richelle Direny: You can complete each day each one task.

282
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.770
Richelle Direny: And how you're going to go about doing that is that you're going to set

283
00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:03.240
Richelle Direny: Like on your phone, you're going to set up on a reminder and at a certain time, every single day.

284
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.860
Richelle Direny: When your alarm goes off.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.100
Richelle Direny: You have to complete at least one task.

286
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:21.750

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:32.640
Richelle Direny: So, then maybe we can work on. Maybe I'll set this goal for because the other goals. I'm doing for four months I'll set this goal in the next two months we'll check in each time that we meet will check in to see, you know, what is is to be able to identify what

421
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.080
Richelle Direny: I don't want to say something about like what is hindering you from

422
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.540
Christine Campbell: Paint before them.

423
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.730
Richelle Direny: But then you can work, because remember, you say you have no energy right now.

424
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:59.430
Richelle Direny: Because now you're going to the five high trust, you're going to set an alarm to get a pass on each day. And now we want to work with, you know, what is something. What do you think

425
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.130
Richelle Direny: is holding you back from being

426
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.650
Richelle Direny: Able to buy each time that we meet will check in.

427
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.500
Richelle Direny: Each time that we meet, whether it's an individual or group.

428
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.660

429
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:26.940
Richelle Direny: Back from pursuing your dream like what you love. What's stopping what's holding you back like what are identified, being able to identify those those things that stopping you're holding you back from pursuing the things that you love and you'll share that each time that we meet

430
00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:30.690
Richelle Direny: Being able to identify them and let's talk about food.

431
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:32.850
Christine Campbell: Because I

432
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:46.680
Christine Campbell: Love it, love it. It's time consuming. I like you've watched his joy painting and they, the guy or paint something in half an hour takes a month, two months I

433
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.770

434
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.090

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.770
Richelle Direny: They do the weirdest like artwork like somebody

436
00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.140

437
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.270
Richelle Direny: Like this whole like village and how they do it.

438
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.410
Richelle Direny: Which I liked.

439
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.120
Richelle Direny: Shot shining on something.

440
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.410
Christine Campbell: And then the stance.

441
00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.940

443
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.630

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.800

445
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.040

447
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:23.430
Richelle Direny: But I've seen something like that that's that's pretty. I think that's pretty cool. But hold on let's write down this goal.

448
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.330
Christine Campbell: That's definitely a goal and get to

449
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.350
Christine Campbell: Husband, you're not going to go upstairs.

Richelle Direny: Were you like an artist were like, that's what you did for a living.

460
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.390
Richelle Direny: No, you did it as a hobby.

461
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.350
Hobby

462
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.890

Richelle Direny: I mean, it goes back to me.

469
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.130

471
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you can say, but sometimes you know I think we all get to a place where

472
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.450
Richelle Direny: When we get frightened about something.

473
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:42.870

770
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.650
Richelle Direny: All right, let me pull up here so I'm kind of like using this arm.

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:21.630
Richelle Direny: You don't see a psychiatrist, do your branding.

778
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.230
Richelle Direny: So you see her parents were for

779
01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:47.850
Brandon H: Him, but I will see in Tokyo scene and Andrea conquest.

780
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:53.370
Brandon H: inform you that since you guys are doing the same. Are you considering the same counseling as her

781
01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:08.250
Richelle Direny: I was explaining. I was explaining that to somebody else, because that's it seems like it's a, I don't know if it's in Ohio. When you see a psychiatrist that they recommend that maybe that psychiatrists have a therapist in their office.

782
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:16.710
Brandon H: Know this, the separate. This is conquest, where I had to switch over to get my message. My Suboxone when I wasn't on probation.

783
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.640
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I mean, I recommend this is what I recommend.

784
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:37.560
Richelle Direny: If you're seeing that person outside. You know, I can just see you once every couple of months just to do your treatment plan, but, um, it would be the same thing. That's why I don't, you know, to have two therapists consistently that you're seeing all the time.

785
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:38.700
Richelle Direny: It's like

786
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:45.570
Brandon H: I might get charged because I'm on Medicaid and they might charge me if I see the same type of person twice.

787
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.010
Richelle Direny: Well,

788
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.010
Richelle Direny: No, it wouldn't be a charge to the same time person would all be it would be all about the treatment plan and what what

789
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:55.950
Richelle Direny: So like, let's say that to be a mental health counselor.

790
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.660
Richelle Direny: And then maybe this would

791
01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:57.810
Be

792
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.450
Richelle Direny: That was

793
01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:02.640
Richelle Direny: She was

Brandon H: He was counseling me through my Suboxone doctor

795
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:10.230
Richelle Direny: So yeah, then it will be the same thing. Yeah, then it wouldn't be the same thing.

796
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:18.750
Brandon H: I told her I check it out and stick with you guys, but I just want to see her anymore so charged me privately, because I'll be seeing same person.

797
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:34.260
Richelle Direny: type person, good one. Yeah, you're doing the same thing. You're it's like double billing just two different arm. I think the only the difference between her and in this is that this you're doing over zoom meeting where her it was her you would you would go to an actual facility. Yes.

798
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:42.270

Brandon H: I'm a novena almost a character since I was 20 years old.

806
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:21.690
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.920
Brandon H: Last 20 years

Richelle Direny: Okay. Do you feel like your anxiety or your depression has gotten any better, it's like kind of stuck.

809
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:35.970
Brandon H: With the current with the current meds are helpful. I've had a lot of measure wer now phone, but these are pretty helpful.

810
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:39.390

811
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:43.380
Brandon H: Hey vilified is kind of

812
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:53.490
Brandon H: Stabilizes my mood and was this road is kind of takes a little bit the job selling a benzo but it does similar effects.

813
01:13:56.970 --> 01:14:15.690
Richelle Direny: But as it's related to being able to being in a stable place, mentally, emotionally, how has it improved overall where you're able to be more in control. I am in identifying and being in control of your anxiety and your depression.

814
01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:20.970
Brandon H: They're just as effective drugs. I've taken I've taken a lot of different antidepressants like home.

815
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:31.560
Brandon H: Yeah, there's not many anxiety drugs are taken like visual effects in or whatever. What helps with anxiety or there's another one to help with anxiety.

816
01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:35.640
Richelle Direny: It helps to take the edge off to be anxious

817
01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:46.260
Brandon H: Yes, the Mr specifically hydroxycut specifically does anxiety. There's like been affecting does that. And there's another one, but it also helps with anxiety.

818
01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.070
Richelle Direny: takes the edge off. So it's kind of like it's somewhat

819
01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:59.070
Brandon H: Are actually antidepressants are known to help with anxiety.

820
01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:02.550
Brandon H: Is actually made towards it.

821
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:12.540
Richelle Direny: But in terms of but in terms of being able to identify those triggers and those um

822
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:15.480
Brandon H: Yes, social setting.

823
01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:24.030
Brandon H: social settings triggers me to get anxious

824
01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.280
Richelle Direny: It wasn't now that you're saying like there was this, there was this movie that I watched

825
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:42.780
Richelle Direny: Like the kid had like really bad anxiety. I'm not arguing like really action movies like with a lot of these movies that they're taking from comic books, and they're making them out there making them and

826
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:53.430
Richelle Direny: So there's this one particular one where the movie started and he had like really, really bad anxiety.

827
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.780
Richelle Direny: I don't know at what point that you recognize it, but like you could tell like he had really, really, really, really bad anxiety and he would take the medication and

828
01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:11.640
Richelle Direny: It was in the setting where he lived right next to our train station and it was, I can't think of the name of the movie. It had Samuel L. Jackson in there, but he played like the bad guy and

829
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.440
Brandon H: Oh, okay.

830
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:16.020
Brandon H: Bruce Willis.

831
01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:19.590
Richelle Direny: Was Bruce Willis like that father

832
01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:23.940
Brandon H: Yeah, he was the guy who was super strong, he had to be in any other guy was

833
01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:26.790
Brandon H: Like 25 personalities.

834
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:35.700
Richelle Direny: I can't, I can't even think of it was Bruce Willis, because it was towards the end of the movie he found out

835
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:52.230
Richelle Direny: That the person that he was fighting or the person that you know they had sent him to like fight or get rid of was actually his father, but he had, like, super, super hearing. He has he had the ability to, like, super focused on something I'm

836
01:16:52.710 --> 01:17:00.630
Richelle Direny: Like, I can't, I can't, I cannot for the life of me think of the movie. I can't envision the movie in my head and I can't for the life of me think of the movie, but he was

837
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:07.260
Richelle Direny: Talking metal, but it was a more of a recent one. It was more of a recent one. Um, wasn't

838
01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.820
Brandon H: New Joker's amazing it's about psycho men's

839
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.990
No.

840
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.830
Richelle Direny: No, this is the Joker.

841
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.710
Brandon H: Joker. The new one. It's about him being

842
01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.910
Brandon H: City taking them away from the funding he loses it dude not being on his medication realistic.

843
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:31.800
Richelle Direny: Oh really, I mean,

844
01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:33.690
Brandon H: Very realistic.

845
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.460
Brandon H: For you, is that good.

846
01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.190
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but I think it also did something to his psyche, the actual movie person, the actual

847
01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.220
Richelle Direny: Actor. It did.

848
01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:48.510
Brandon H: Die. That was he's legend as as you did the Joker previously.

849
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:59.880
Richelle Direny: Yeah, like the psychological impact it had no the new person I heard an interview that it did something saying psychologically works. He said he has to consider whether or not they will. He will do it again, but

850
01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:08.670
Brandon H: Oh, crap. Lauren free into a heavy sugar, Jay. Jay, do a QPR can you I am o'clock when Kathleen finish.

851
01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:12.180
Richelle Direny: The Harlequin

852
01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.770
Brandon H: Know the data jumpers of Phoenix hawkwind Phoenix.

853
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:18.720
Richelle Direny: I can't say it right

854
01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:32.820
Richelle Direny: Yep, no. But then in this movie. I was thinking about like the way he had like really bad anxiety. But the one thing is that no matter how much he took these medications to control his anxiety.

855
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:46.140
Richelle Direny: At some point in the movie he realized that what he was suppressing was whatever what was really going on in him and throughout the movie he learned to identify

856
01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:51.780
Richelle Direny: That his anxiety was due to something that can kept triggering

857
01:18:52.350 --> 01:19:00.930
Richelle Direny: His anxiety attacks like he kept having anxiety attacks, but it's just one thing. Like you know you have anxiety, you know, something, something is making you anxious

858
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:09.150
Richelle Direny: You're taking these medications to lessen the effects or the impact or the intensity of the anxiety attacks.

859
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:18.720
Richelle Direny: But it is the medications are to bring you to a stable place so that you're able to get to that place where you're to identify what is the source.

860
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:30.960
Richelle Direny: What is causing these anxiety attacks, whether it is people a particular smell something that you hear what exactly is causing these anti anxiety attacks. If it's a sound.

861
01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:49.710
Richelle Direny: Is it something that relates back to something that occurred in your past that every time you hear this particular sound. It reminds you of something in the past. And that's what brings on the anxiety. Those unresolved issues from the past, that reminds you of these things that you may

862
01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.270
Richelle Direny: You know,

863
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:59.820
Brandon H: Mines earlier sounder incident or specific little thing is more when I was young and social settings I got real nervous and know what to

864
01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:03.210
Brandon H: Say I was quiet and I'm still have that today, sometimes

865
01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.270
Brandon H: You get older, but some of it was natural. Some of it I just had to get over

866
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:10.770
Richelle Direny: Sometimes, and

867
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:12.690
Brandon H: I am who I am.

868
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:16.710
Richelle Direny: So for you, it's people is social settings.

869
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:22.560
Richelle Direny: So let's come up with a goal for. So let's talk through this because I'm going to come up. We're gonna have some goals.

870
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:32.970
Richelle Direny: Like maybe two or three goals that will work through you being able to, so like okay for you specifically their social settings being

871
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:47.430
Richelle Direny: It's the difference in understanding. Is it just is it that you're shy or is it that you just don't do well with changes or being in social settings or for you. You have to slowly gravitate to a change because

872
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.230
Richelle Direny: Change is something that you welcome so quickly and so readily

873
01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:00.390
Brandon H: Is on a social setting. I mean, sometimes words are like family exist on

874
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:03.600
Brandon H: Right in

875
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:22.140
Richelle Direny: So that. Okay, so then it goes to and it leads right into, like, um, so I have this I have two sons. I have middle son and for him. I read I recognize from he was younger. He doesn't adapt to changes very readily

876
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:32.490
Richelle Direny: I would always notice that he's okay with being around people, but you can't just take him and just put them in a new

877
01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:46.650
Richelle Direny: In a new group of people in a new setting just like that and expect him to adapt to that new environment and that new set of people that he doesn't know you have to slowly, kind of like baby steps introduced him to the setting.

878
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:58.110
Richelle Direny: So I thought to myself, you know, even for my child when I recognize that being a fully aware of it and recognizing it. How can I combat that without it having

879
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:07.770
Richelle Direny: A such a negative psychological impact on him in the moment, or even something that will have an impact on him later in life where he doesn't recognize

880
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:19.590
Richelle Direny: That these anxiety attacks or these feelings of anxiety or these certain these things in life that that has an impact on him and he doesn't recognize it. It's all about why address it.

881
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:25.830
Richelle Direny: When younger, kind of like you with social settings. So one of the things that I did notice it's that

882
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:35.250
Richelle Direny: If, say like if you came around him. It's not like so, like you said, let's say you're his uncle. It's not that he has a problem with seen his uncle or being around his uncle.

883
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:50.100
Richelle Direny: Is that each time that you come, it's a slow reintroduction to being in the presence. So I noticed. Every time someone would come over you know this person, like, why are you running away. And why are you hiding

884
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:56.700
Richelle Direny: He seemed like he would run and he would hide, he will go in the room and he would close the door.

885
01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:03.660
Richelle Direny: And we're like, what are you doing come out of the room, kind of the room. It's not like you don't know the people you know them. Like, why are you doing, it's your family.

886
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:13.470
Richelle Direny: So that I had to learn. It's that I had to talk him down. I had to be able to identify it and then say, Oh, let's do this together.

887
01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:23.610
Richelle Direny: And it's not like forcing you into the situation because sourcing you into the situation, it's only getting deeper fear. It's like injecting deeper

888
01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:32.190
Richelle Direny: In you about being around because you're so self conscious about doing something wrong saying something wrong or person looking at us, sir.

889
01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:51.750
Richelle Direny: So it is identifying what is caught like what cost, even to your anxiety. Is it fear is it anxiety is it you thinking your, your, your, your, it's. Is it a self esteem issue. It's identifying. It's kind of like peeling it back like it's working. That's how you work through

890
01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.300
Brandon H: Very reserved

891
01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:59.760
Brandon H: Like I said, we're not gonna be awesome. It's not good.

892
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.390
Richelle Direny: No, no. And you and that's it it's. That's it.

893
01:24:04.890 --> 01:24:10.920
Richelle Direny: Not having a day for you, have you just kind of met. So did your parents ever tell you

894
01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:22.950
Richelle Direny: That you were just kind of like that child in comparison to your brother, cuz I know you said you have a brother in comparison to your brother, you were just always more of an observer and China.

895
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:27.000
Brandon H: Yeah, he was more time than Iowa's

896
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:30.450
Richelle Direny: You were he was an extrovert. You were more of an introvert.

897
01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.730
Richelle Direny: In growing up. Do feel socially. He was more accepted, then you weren't

898
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:52.170
Brandon H: Allowed it around this was this was who I was. I was popular and stuff with all different groups of my school people I was a jock shows a Java guy didn't want to

899
01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:53.850
Richelle Direny: Just get good grades your

900
01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:54.840
Shiny

901
01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:57.810
Brandon H: Yeah, I didn't pick on people.

902
01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:06.630
Brandon H: Affiliated with the form kids the Dell, the kids. It was nice. Everybody this popular that way.

903
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:08.850
Brandon H: But did you

904
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.860
Example, not by talking

905
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:12.780
Richelle Direny: Okay.

906
01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:27.390
Richelle Direny: So for you, did you own and accept who you are and thought in the end cured. Not much about how other people start in responded to you.

907
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.310
You being an introvert.

908
01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:37.680
Brandon H: And that's the point where I just accepted that was quiet when when I got to college. It was a whole different way they taught you to communicate.

909
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.060
Brandon H: A lot of BS goes along with education, I believe, and

910
01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:49.410
Brandon H: How fancy, you can talk or how you know what I mean, I didn't care for that like to put others down

911
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:53.040
Brandon H: So so college was

912
01:25:55.020 --> 01:26:10.800
Brandon H: clicks and colleagues were like they'll try to talk around you were above you. And really, they're just using fancy words and stuff. And it just they make people feel real small like normal people, but then are uneducated is to me. I was wrong.

913
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:14.040
Brandon H: So I didn't participate well with that.

914
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.190
Brandon H: Understood. When you hear a lot about people.

915
01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:19.740
Richelle Direny: So you care a lot about people.

916
01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:23.700
Brandon H: Yeah kind person very caring person.

917
01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.700
Brandon H: being mean to people.

918
01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:43.980
Richelle Direny: Okay, so with you being it's funny. You're just treat it as much as he introvert, just like that same issues have a problem with being mean to people or unkind to people or saw the injustice is of other P. Yeah.

919
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:46.410
Brandon H: Some people get picked on. Right.

920
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:47.340
Richelle Direny: Now,

921
01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:47.970
For you.

922
01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:51.840
Richelle Direny: So you stuck up for a lot of people

923
01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:57.600
Richelle Direny: But then for you, having such a great quality of being a

924
01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.420
Richelle Direny: Warm hearted.

925
01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:12.810
Richelle Direny: Person who saw the injustices of other people and wanted to offer your assistance in some way, maybe, hence why you kind of work in the field or the environment that you work in now.

926
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:23.520
Brandon H: The problem was, for myself, old time I take a lot of seven people I knew they were talking about me or down on me and I just kind of ignored it like so we're

927
01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:38.280
Richelle Direny: Now in you ignoring it. Did you ignore it with confidence that hey you know what it is what it is. It's like your opinion, your perspective, I am who I am. Did you do it that way.

928
01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:47.850
Brandon H: Sometimes when I reflected back on it, it was negative, like I should have said something or I should have never associated with the cool kids or whatever kids and

929
01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:56.130
Brandon H: The party crowd and this and that. But now I'm just like accepting it is it is what it is. People are

930
01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.760
Richelle Direny: What did you do you accept it to you, except school, you are now.

931
01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:18.840
Brandon H: Now, I do not totally confident, but I have a lot of issues for conference. I got dentures at 40 overweight losing my hair, I don't have a wife. I don't have my own kids you know my own family. I should have my age.

932
01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:32.700
Richelle Direny: So for you, your perspective of how you think life should be for you at this point in time. It's not what it is. So a lot of yourself.

933
01:28:33.570 --> 01:28:36.420
Brandon H: I've learned to come to terms with it like I got a simple one.

934
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:43.590
Brandon H: When I first got that chance program. The, the, whatever those clothes.

935
01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:58.290
Brandon H: We did you, Tony raised, I really went down on myself and was terrible to myself. Like, I'm all the things I said I was like crying all the time and stuff. But now I just can't deal with it.

936
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:11.220
Richelle Direny: Would you say so. Because I would think that your, is your low self confidence leads back to some low self esteem, because as you just pointed it out, you're

937
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:13.230
Brandon H: Getting better now.

938
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:14.700
Brandon H: I went through.

939
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.020
Brandon H: Things going on. I mentioned, but I just take it as it is. People don't like it, so be it.

940
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.550
Richelle Direny: But are you confident in what you just said.

941
01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:28.530
Hmm.

942
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.960
Richelle Direny: They take whatever

943
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:48.540
Brandon H: Yeah, they get to that point. All right. And finally, just say it don't matter. Um, no I don't worry about when my parents think so much anymore. I don't worry about what my grandmother, whoever thing sure people in society or people who judge you. I don't care.

944
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:53.880
Richelle Direny: Do you think that way. I mean, I care about myself. I don't

945
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.380
Brandon H: Care what others do.

946
01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:57.060

Richelle Direny: You've done things in your past.

969
01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:04.410
Richelle Direny: You can't do anything about it. But now you're on this road of recovery. This road of

970
01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:11.160
Richelle Direny: I'm just having a renewed mind and just a new view of life.

971
01:32:12.930 --> 01:32:13.890

976
01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:48.300
Richelle Direny: The turtle have a baseball season. Well, yeah, it ain't nothing going on outside, outside of work. You're an essential worker.

977
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:58.380
Richelle Direny: Oh, so and having social anxiety. Hey, I mean, there's not really a whole lot going on there, either because you can't go anywhere.

978
01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:00.300
Brandon H: Right. Why don't you

979
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:20.340
Brandon H: Just in this like intimate. Intimate settings I guess where it's more intimate more up close in a store out and about it, don't bother me, but I get along quite well with my kids to be more touchy. I guess I get more anxious

980
01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:27.420
Richelle Direny: If you had if you if you had a partner. Do you think that your anxiety would be less

981
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.220
Richelle Direny: Or

982
01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:31.590

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.430
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

984
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:41.160
Brandon H: I had a girlfriend. I think I'd be less usually I had long term girlfriends in the past that was helpful.

985
01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.450
Brandon H: Right one fits perfectly though.

986
01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:50.010
Brandon H: I don't know, just having somebody there judging back all the time and helpful.

987
01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.050
Richelle Direny: You said, have the right one that fits perfectly. If you find the perfect one. You just need

988
01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:00.330
Brandon H: Enough to where I can say okay I can lose this rest of my life.

989
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:02.550
You know,

990
01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:09.360
Richelle Direny: Well, I guess it comes down to you, identifying what is it that you're looking for.

991
01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:14.310
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because everything is all about perspective. Yes.

992
01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:15.030
It is

993
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:28.410
Richelle Direny: It's about how you view life. It's about how you view everything and based on the lens that you're looking through that determines you know the next move you make it determines just how you view the world.

994
01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:33.480
Richelle Direny: Yes, and how you think the world should operate and how you fit into that.

995
01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:48.120
Brandon H: Well, speaking of partners. I'm going to go on matter the harmony or something. But I was waiting to finish that Miss program. So I was financially able to have a girlfriend is right now I can early. I can take care of myself. That's it.

996
01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.640
Brandon H: I couldn't afford a girlfriend.

997
01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.880
Brandon H: You know, I mean, I'm being honest.

998
01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:55.260
Brandon H: So once I get

999
01:34:57.630 --> 01:35:05.220
Brandon H: That right now. No, I couldn't afford to take somebody else out the pay the tab and by him movies and nice things and

1000
01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:21.510
Richelle Direny: He's okay. So you just played right into exactly what I just said. The lens of life that you're looking through you have this it's giving you this perceptive this perspective, this perception.

1001
01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:43.260
Richelle Direny: That you did. A B C D E F G in order to have a girlfriend. And if you don't fit into this description. You can't have a girlfriend, because the reality of it. The reality of it is, if two people have a mutual interest in each other and it starts off as a friendship. Do you think that

1002
01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:48.690
Richelle Direny: Each person will not say hey you know i understand i mean

1003
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:56.160
Brandon H: Yeah, I have a girl like that. I'm really good friends with. And are you still there. Oh.

Brandon H: But we shall remain friends, off and on.

1008
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:10.440
Richelle Direny: Throughout the years,

1009
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:20.760
Brandon H: And she's gonna probably need a place to stay at and I've offered her, she could probably come to my place, you know, and never went back out again. Who knows, I mean,

1010
01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:27.630
Brandon H: I'm just saying I can't afford a girlfriend right now if we went out and said, hey, you want to go on a date. We don't pay for to

1011
01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.280
Brandon H: Do that.

1012
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.170

1013
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.550
Brandon H: Extra things for myself, let alone a woman.

1014
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:53.400
Brandon H: Or after that, or anything, but I am a gentleman I prefer to pay for the meal and pay for the movie and pay for whatever else goes on.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.370
Richelle Direny: Working on trying to know develop

1057
01:41:01.650 --> 01:41:02.430
Richelle Direny: Your treatment plan.

1058
01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:13.110
Brandon H: Plan or whatever it was I forget what she said to the plans record. I've done a lot of those my past, we had to make a new one is sick as same as your one. Hopefully, but

1059
01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.990
Brandon H: ISP or record.

1060
01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:03.840
Richelle Direny: Self care routine.

1061
01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:08.160
Brandon H: So care, we mean you

1062
01:42:09.450 --> 01:42:23.190
Richelle Direny: Know self care like for you. I'm like, how do you, what is your own self care what are like a hobby or something that you do because the reality is, especially with someone with social anxiety I can definitely see different depression.

1063
01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:39.000
Richelle Direny: Because when you're sitting to yourself, you know, more isolated mean unaware isolation, you tend to stay in your head, you're not really doing anything that you enjoy. And so you sit with those thoughts, all the time and

1064
01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.100
Brandon H: I was doing that last

1065
01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:56.400
Brandon H: Spring. I was walking every day at the parks really helps a lot achieve to get back to doing stuff like that I do in Planet Fitness. But I can't go there because of the corona. But I got some weights in my own home. I can use. I got a

1066
01:42:57.990 --> 01:43:00.810
Brandon H: Whatever those are called versus a be

1067
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.920
Brandon H: Fancy Dumbo that and lounge and bicycle.

1068
01:43:14.010 --> 01:43:16.590
Brandon H: Me if I get active. It helps me 100% good

1069
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:22.470
Brandon H: I spending my own mind is saying there for mountain moving around. It doesn't have it goes away or

1070
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:26.010
Brandon H: You know, like you're saying

1071
01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:41.790
Richelle Direny: But, but even if to be an active like whether it's exercise, like you were saying that for you. Your kind of your self image, how you view your, your yourself, your physical self as being what you're saying you've identified as being overweight.

1072
01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:43.290
Richelle Direny: If you feel like that.

1073
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.890
Would be

1074
01:43:45.090 --> 01:43:59.160
Richelle Direny: But then if you're not able to go to the gym, you have a lot of these channels that you can do little things like maybe before bed or when you get up before work or you come home after work, and you do like maybe a 30 minute exercise, whether it's a power walk in place.

1075
01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:01.110
Brandon H: The matter of knowing. Yeah.

1076
01:44:01.770 --> 01:44:15.990
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. So then one of the things that is identify at least at least one daily self care routine set an alarm for yourself whether it is whatever is more appropriate for you is before work after work.

1077
01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:22.620
Richelle Direny: at whatever point in the day that you're intentional about you know what every day when I wake up.

1078
01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:27.870
Richelle Direny: I'm going to set my alarm. I'm going to wake up and I'm going to turn since I can't go to the gym.

1079
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:42.600
Richelle Direny: I can either walk around the community for maybe 30 minutes or I could turn on the TV where they have so many different workout programs that you're now doing and you can just watch it into it. I remember years ago.

1080
01:44:44.730 --> 01:44:46.200
A when the we came out.

1081
01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:52.170
Richelle Direny: I think it was the it was one video game like I was playing with some kids and

1082
01:44:53.880 --> 01:45:08.790
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yeah, with all of the with the game itself because you're using your body was picking up your body like I was playing with a kid and I remember, I think it was my husband and I like when I say the next day. My body was in so much pain.

1083
01:45:10.230 --> 01:45:16.380
Richelle Direny: And then we thought we thought to ourselves, we should get this video game for herself. Because that you're you're

1084
01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:28.260
Richelle Direny: Involved in the movement of your whole body to play this game. It was a great exercise routine. So we thought to ourselves, we will get the video game. And this is what we will do as the way to exercise.

1085
01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:40.080
Richelle Direny: And encouraged now whether I did a conversation. What the thought was, it's to get in in your homework. You're not physically having to get up and go out

1086
01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:42.780
Richelle Direny: Find a way to do it.

1087
01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:49.500
Brandon H: It's just a matter of motivation to do that within my own

1088
01:45:51.810 --> 01:45:55.080
Brandon H: Started to do it several times and I'll do it again.

1089
01:45:56.790 --> 01:46:02.820
Richelle Direny: What what what what I'm hinder you if you set an alarm, what would be the best time if you do it in your home.

1090
01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:04.590
Brandon H: To motivation to get up.

1091
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:10.830
Brandon H: at 6am came home and did is then then just go to bed after that then do a little bit evening for

1092
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.590
Richelle Direny: So, what time do you usually get home.

1093
01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.530
Brandon H: After six in the morning.

1094
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:20.400
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you live. So you work with pretty fairly close to where you live.

1095
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:22.800
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Okay.

1096
01:46:22.830 --> 01:46:23.100
Yeah.

1097
01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:39.150
Richelle Direny: So, like, maybe I'd like 630 or 615 your alarm goes off in your remind you to do some type of like maybe a 10 minute, whether it's a job or walk in your community.

1098
01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:43.980
Brandon H: Need to I was using for a while. You ever heard of those

1099
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:47.310
Brandon H: The rocking chair.

1100
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:49.740
Brandon H: rocking chair. It's very yeah

1101
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:50.910
Brandon H: For the stomach.

1102
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:55.710
Richelle Direny: I have one. It's something you have to pull yourself up. Yeah.

1103
01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:58.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah yeah

1104
01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.390
Brandon H: I have an exercise bike and I have the

1105
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:16.200
Brandon H: research was that pleases fantasy waves all the kinds of gyms and stuff, but they're adjustable dumbbells. So I got 55 down to five, I can adjust them with way to use dumbbells.

1106
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:26.790
Brandon H: As can think of the name owner, the brand names are very expensive. A pretty like $600 for you guys from five to 55 two and a half.

1107
01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:29.670
Brandon H: Yeah, just to know different ways.

1108
01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:31.080
Brandon H: Yeah.

1109
01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:37.410
Brandon H: And then you just have to wait to you have a whole set of dumbbells that are packed into one dumbbells that

1110
01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:43.710
Richelle Direny: So it sounds like, Oh, wow. So it sounds like you have some

1111
01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.000
Brandon H: Motivation.

1112
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:51.090
Brandon H: I had a hand grip, things like that. He got 100 times or 50 times or me time to give them

1113
01:47:51.750 --> 01:48:07.800
Brandon H: The hand. It has a knuckle breaths and he just like a triangle. He just grip on like a suck up with us tennis ball bus and grips. I started on those a little bit different is wiped me out. But I want to get stay in the banner and sheep movement.

1114
01:48:09.150 --> 01:48:13.920
Brandon H: And then three days of roughing it killed me. But it felt good to be my body's loosened up again and I'm

1115
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:15.840
Brandon H: Moving again.

1116
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:19.740
Brandon H: For to all week and it killed me. I can go to bed.

1117
01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:34.380
Richelle Direny: So then it brings me into so like the one goal here is to at least identify at least one daily self care routine objective set a daily alarm after work at 6:15am

1118
01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:48.630
Richelle Direny: To remind selves to complete a 30 minute exercise. But then your other goal kind of goes into it identify those triggers to decrease motivation. Like, what do you think are some of those triggers to your decreased motivation in doing any of it.

1119
01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:56.370
Brandon H: What do I think he's being lazy talking myself out of it, no excuse.

1120
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:58.560
Brandon H: You know, I didn't do it.

1121
01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.970
Richelle Direny: And that is the truth. That is the truth. Yeah.

1122
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:11.340
Richelle Direny: We do talk ourselves out of doing something all the time, so maybe I'm for you is, you know, and it's

1123
01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:24.510
Richelle Direny: It's like positive self talk to the minute you will have for one negative thought you identify two or three positive things to come to counteract that negative self talk

1124
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:25.050
Brandon H: Yeah.

1125
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:26.640
Richelle Direny: Or that negative self talk

1126
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:28.740
Brandon H: Yes matter no

1127
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:43.200
Brandon H: I got 1000 excuses, especially in the morning. If I don't do it first thing in the morning. I'm not going to do it because I'll just say like it all day I got from 6am to 1030 at night. I got all day and next thing you know it's 1039 to noon. Awesome.

1128
01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:58.980
Brandon H: You know, as well. I'll tell myself I can do it after I take a nap or I can do it after lunch, or do it every shot can do it, but never do it. So I gotta do it right in the morning. First thing to get it done whatever going to get in the routine.

1129
01:50:00.690 --> 01:50:06.060
Richelle Direny: Do you have, do you have when you for a support accountability partners.

1130
01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.110
Brandon H: And nobody really I'm by myself when I see my parents are supporter. But isn't that really I

1131
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:22.170
Brandon H: They sold their home or go on to do their own thing and I get all involved in their stuff again.

1132
01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:30.450
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I have. So let's, let's just do this for now just these few um

1133
01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:34.350
Richelle Direny: These few goals without over on

1134
01:50:35.490 --> 01:50:44.580
Richelle Direny: So we're going to work on, you know, identifying how your overall social anxiety has an impact on your decision making skills.

1135
01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:58.350
Richelle Direny: Because, because you have these exact because you're, you have this in the anxiousness. It has a bigger impact on your decision making skills like how you like you determine how you do things because

1136
01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:02.970
Richelle Direny: Even something like you said, you think about, Okay, you know what, I'm going to go on match.com

1137
01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:20.430
Richelle Direny: But because of the anxiety of all when I can't even take care of this. The negative self talk you lose motivation in fulfilling what it is that you desire. So for the one negative thought something negative self thoughts, you're going to find three things to

1138
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:32.850
Richelle Direny: Overcome or combat that negative talk so that you can make a more informed decision of how you're going to push forth push past this anxiety to do something.

1139
01:51:36.150 --> 01:51:39.510
Richelle Direny: So like all your goals are kind of like intertwined with each other.

1140
01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:40.470
Brandon H: They are

1141
01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:41.940
So,

1142
01:51:43.590 --> 01:51:50.010
Brandon H: Looked at, like you're examining right now and I know what you mean. I agree with you. Hundred percent just a matter of that motivation.

1143
01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:55.710
Richelle Direny: It's a matter of motivation, because even if you want it to go on.

1144
01:51:57.270 --> 01:52:01.020
Richelle Direny: What did you call it, what is the thing. What is the dating site called match.

1145
01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.730
Brandon H: Or winning here, whatever.

1146
01:52:03.210 --> 01:52:04.620
Richelle Direny: Whatever any one of those songs

1147
01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:05.280
Brandon H: Here on

1148
01:52:06.150 --> 01:52:15.810
Richelle Direny: Any one of those those dating sites if you want it to go on it. No, not that I'm promoting any. But if it's something that you want to do.

1149
01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:30.450
Richelle Direny: You just the one idea of doing it. You just identify something negative. Oh well, I ain't gonna have no money to pay for him. I gave him a hard to take care of myself. You see how that negative talk just

1150
01:52:31.710 --> 01:52:36.510
Richelle Direny: You're like, oh, you have no motivation to go forth and do it. So now you're going to find

1151
01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:48.030
Richelle Direny: Three nuggets and venue talks about, okay, my weight. I have this and I have that. So you have all these things that is kind of pulling your these triggers that's pulling away your motivation so well.

1152
01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:58.620
Richelle Direny: I have AB lounger I have a TV. I have all these different things to do it. And like you said, I get off work at six in the morning. If I don't do it.

1153
01:52:59.070 --> 01:53:13.110
Richelle Direny: Let me just throw myself into right after work. I'm already up in a way. Let me go to my workout routine. I could go lay down afterwards. Now I feel energized, I feel better now. Overall, you're going to now feel good about yourself.

1154
01:53:14.730 --> 01:53:21.030
Richelle Direny: You're going to be you're going to feel good about yourself image and that alone will give you a boost of self confidence.

1155
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.990
Yeah.

1156
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:37.650
Richelle Direny: So I think that um you know even whether we meet individually or we meet in group that is something that you can talk about we just throw out there you know what it is that for that day.

1157
01:53:39.090 --> 01:53:42.450
Richelle Direny: Is that you identify it was a trigger to

1158
01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:52.320
Richelle Direny: Your anxiety for you, your social life. What was the trigger for that. Was it because you went in a place and people were looking at you, longer than expected or somebody

1159
01:53:53.100 --> 01:54:03.000
Richelle Direny: You have you ever been in a place where somebody gave you a look and use you you personalize that look that person wasn't even thinking about you. They had no thoughts with you.

1160
01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:09.150
Richelle Direny: You just happen to walk right in the moment when they just had a look on their face.

1161
01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:10.470
Richelle Direny: And they're looking

1162
01:54:12.810 --> 01:54:13.320
Richelle Direny: At you

1163
01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:16.890
Richelle Direny: Like

1164
01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:26.370
Richelle Direny: Excuse me. What are you talking about, I didn't look at you. Yes, you just did. No, I didn't. But you just took whatever saw they were having and whatever grimness they

1165
01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.000
Brandon H: Couldn't hear

1166
01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.690
Richelle Direny: For themselves. You just personalize it

1167
01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:36.780
Richelle Direny: And now, guess what that did to your anxiety. Guess what that did to your depression.

1168
01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:38.340
Richelle Direny: That's what you

1169
01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.020
Richelle Direny: It made it all worth simply because of your perception.

1170
01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:55.080
Richelle Direny: How you view the world the lens in which you're looking at the world in because you're already going about looking at this lens with us with a negative self image with a negative everything

1171
01:54:56.610 --> 01:55:00.030
Brandon H: personals I used to. It looks like that. I can't get a friend or

1172
01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:03.240
Brandon H: Whatever.

1173
01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:04.590
Richelle Direny: But

1174
01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:06.660
Brandon H: Anyway,

1175
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:24.270
Richelle Direny: I caught myself. The other day I was talking to a few people. And someone said something, but in the moment, someone said something I had this look. But then my look was actually connected to a message that flash across my screen.

1176
01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:26.760
Richelle Direny: Right, so I read the message that flashed

1177
01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:34.350
Richelle Direny: Across my screen. And I was like, but then the person who said what then I was like, oh, I hope that person didn't think my Grimace was related to what they said.

1178
01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:44.580
Richelle Direny: It's like two things happen simultaneously I showed a reaction to the one and then I'm like, man, I hope. But then sometimes we can't. I think

1179
01:55:45.150 --> 01:55:57.330
Richelle Direny: I think, as a society, we have learned we have come to that place where we personalize everything that everybody does that had nothing to do with you. And so that overall just

1180
01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.060
Richelle Direny: It increases our anxiety.

1181
01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:01.590
Richelle Direny: So,

1182
01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:09.930
Richelle Direny: I'm going to leave it with those just took those two goals, those three goals and then we'll check in on

1253
02:03:14.490 --> 02:03:14.730
Rhi Rhi R: No.

1254
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:22.140
Rhi Rhi R: We had a meeting here, you know, I mean, I've seen our meetings here like at the church is stuff day or in a

1255
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:24.120
Rhi Rhi R: You know,

1256
02:03:25.170 --> 02:03:26.370
Richelle Direny: So you still go to any

1257
02:03:27.330 --> 02:03:29.550
Rhi Rhi R: Oh yeah girl. Sometimes I have to go because

1258
02:03:32.850 --> 02:03:48.420
Rhi Rhi R: I don't. It's not that I have cravings. Now, I never really have prayed that we clean so darn long, long, I don't have created. And I feel like I can help like everybody that I see addicts are so bad at your social bad and

1259
02:03:49.590 --> 02:04:02.880
Rhi Rhi R: Oh my gosh, are everywhere. And then the clinic, they run up here are just awful. Like, literally, like for instance a difference today would be Dr. Day. Okay.

1260
02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:15.420
Rhi Rhi R: They'll all be at the clinic all see the doctor and you literally hear them talk about what they're going to do with their medicine and trade. It is this answer right at that. It's awful. So

1261
02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:17.820
Rhi Rhi R: I was thinking about trying to

1262
02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:26.970
Rhi Rhi R: Look into doing like some training to be like a life coach. I think it'd be clean, five years or something like that. Right.

1263
02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.910
Richelle Direny: So I don't. I think everything in every place is different, how they go

Richelle Direny: And it annoys the crap out of me. It's like it bothers my eyes because it seems like they're always moving, I think, who else does it, I think, Natalie, does it her background is a virtual background.

1322
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:57.150
Rhi Rhi R: Hi, Sheena.

1323

Richelle Direny: Yeah.

1327
02:11:08.070 --> 02:11:10.710
Richelle Direny: It bothers my eye because it seems like you're always moving

1328
02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:12.210
Yeah.

1329
02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:25.290
Rhi Rhi R: Why didn't even know there was such a thing I was talking to a breakout guy and he was like I say, dang. Your house is so nice anything. Oh, that's just a background I

1330
02:11:27.090 --> 02:11:28.260
Rhi Rhi R: Don't you know you can do that.

1331
02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:37.320
Richelle Direny: Yeah, there's a way there's a way of my kid. They were someone was showing them. They were doing this video chat with church.

1332
02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:41.610
Richelle Direny: And they were showing them how to do it, but I don't have no clue.

1333
02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:42.930
Richelle Direny: I have no clue how to do it.

1334
02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:44.490
And

1335
02:11:48.570 --> 02:11:55.050
Rhi Rhi R: I'm glad because it looks the background looks nice, though. I just wanted to know if it was real or not.

1336
02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:57.150
Richelle Direny: No, it's real.

1337
02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:05.280
Richelle Direny: I mean, look at your treatment plan if we did one. No, they don't. Do you see a psychiatrist.

1338
02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:10.410
Rhi Rhi R: Now I have a family physician. I see him every month.

1339
02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:19.470
Rhi Rhi R: Why are you talking about the antidepressants.

1340
02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:24.810
Richelle Direny: That's what gives you your antidepressants.

1341
02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:31.740
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah, the anxiety and depression and anxiety. Yeah, I've been taking that for

1342
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.930
Rhi Rhi R: Seven year

1343
02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:44.370
Richelle Direny: Alright.

1344
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:48.420
Richelle Direny: So, um, what is something that you know

1345
02:12:49.650 --> 02:12:53.160
Richelle Direny: You said that your antidepressants are the only things that you've been like

1346
02:12:54.990 --> 02:13:09.030
Richelle Direny: Identified thing for you that when you when you think about like your triggers to, you know, your past addiction. Is it the because of your depression.

1347
02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:29.490
Rhi Rhi R: I wouldn't say depression about maybe some of it i a lot of guilt. A lot of guilt is true. You know, it's always you know I say that this is what I go by. It's hard to be sober.

1348
02:13:30.690 --> 02:13:41.130
Rhi Rhi R: But it's not as hard to get sober to stay sober. You know what I mean. Because then once you're sober. You really think about how you screwed up and hurt everybody and

1349
02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:51.780
Rhi Rhi R: And, you know, back and you have to apologize and deal with it, you know, and stand up, but just, you know, be be human mean elicit

1350
02:13:53.610 --> 02:14:06.660
Rhi Rhi R: Change your life. I literally had to get rid of my phone move out of my apartment. You know, I had to or it was never that not, I would not go to the clinics, because it's just bullshit. I think their bullshit.

1351
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:11.250

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:25.050
Rhi Rhi R: I think Dave Yeah I would be triggered into. No, I just

1354
02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:53.250
Rhi Rhi R: Know, I used to sit and listen to people like I was really trying to stay clean, you know, and this was, you know, 2000 2013 14 sound like that. And I was sitting in there. I would just hear all of them and then beside me a girl is not now and I was like what the hell.

02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:01.320
Richelle Direny: So you have you have anxiety is one

02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:19.140
Rhi Rhi R: Yes, very much so. I mean I it's been so bad were like, for instance, like the store. If I was in here shopping and I, we have a manufacturer, I would literally just walk away from the car and walk out this door and look crazy girl just crazy.

1358
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:25.050
Rhi Rhi R: But I know a lot better. I yeah I handle it. Oh gosh, I

02:15:26.250 --> 02:15:31.080
Rhi Rhi R: Close this app me like zoom will be closed off actually why

02:15:31.650 --> 02:15:38.460
Richelle Direny: Okay, good. Okay, if, if he says, okay, and it makes you just come right back in. It does just just hit OK. And then I'm

1361
02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:39.600
Okay.

1362
02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:41.790
Rhi Rhi R: I'm sorry.

1363
02:15:42.090 --> 02:15:43.590
Richelle Direny: No, no, that's fine. You're good.

1364
02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:58.320
Richelle Direny: Are you still there.

02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:29.640
Richelle Direny: Okay, you're

1366
02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:30.600
Okay.

02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:33.270
Rhi Rhi R: Sorry I kicked me out like

02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:35.490
Richelle Direny: Oh, we keep twice.

1369
02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:39.690
Rhi Rhi R: Yes. Then my phone was overheat. But now outside. So I don't think it should

1370
02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:42.300
Richelle Direny: It was overheating.

1371
02:21:42.840 --> 02:22:01.080
Rhi Rhi R: It said, You're my phone was overheating. It was going to kick me out of zoom. That's why you said if it keeps you out if I can pull in LIKE YOU I CAN I SEE. Danielle for like a half a second, and then I see my breakout girl, and then I phone shut off. So to turn it back on. Now I'm outside

1372
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:05.490
Rhi Rhi R: Weird and I just got this phone.

1373
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:09.990
Rhi Rhi R: You have it on charge

1374
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:13.440
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah I did see now I don't

1375
02:22:14.310 --> 02:22:27.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah, sometimes I think when you when you have it on charging you're talking on it. It tends I find that my phone gets very hot. So whenever I do that I put it on speaker, because if I hold it to my ear. It gets very hot. Yeah.

1376
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:32.490
Rhi Rhi R: Actually, you know what, now I'm outside the car. It is totally cooling down everything

1377
02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.580
Richelle Direny: The first time I saw that on my phone. I was freaked out. It was like cool me down cool me that it was like

1378
02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:40.800
Richelle Direny: It says, Call me down.

1379
02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:48.090
Rhi Rhi R: I know right. I'VE NEVER SEEN I'VE NEVER A we've had meetings, it's ever done before. I'm like, What the heck is it

1380
02:22:50.130 --> 02:22:54.120
Richelle Direny: I think once I fell asleep, and that's where the danger. Once I fell asleep.

1381
02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:59.610
Richelle Direny: And you know, when you fall asleep. Your body goes, relax. Everything goes relaxing so

1382
02:22:59.610 --> 02:23:00.240
Rhi Rhi R: Now,

1383
02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:02.850
Richelle Direny: I think I'm a rollover on top of it.

1384
02:23:03.630 --> 02:23:05.310
Richelle Direny: And I don't know if I felt

1385
02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:19.230
Richelle Direny: Getting hot or what I wrote. And when I got it. I held it and kept it and it was saying cool me down because I guess I was laying on top of it. It was really hot, and it's something, it says cooling down. So can you imagine if it had blown up.

1386
02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:23.760
Rhi Rhi R: With. Yeah, I know, right. That's what I said. I just got to start. I've never seen.

1387
02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:24.630
Rhi Rhi R: Nothing like that.

1388
02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:37.140
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I've seen it once. I think I had like I was out in the open, son. I think maybe at the beach or something like that. Some years ago and it's and I saw it on top of it. It just said, Cool me down. I'm very hot.

1389
02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:39.180
Rhi Rhi R: Wow.

1390
02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:41.670
Rhi Rhi R: Well, it's interesting. Um,

1391
02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:50.010
Richelle Direny: So what I have here in terms of like when when looking at your goals. You were telling me about your anxiety because you said like your depression.

1392
02:23:50.580 --> 02:24:01.050
Richelle Direny: Um, and so, like, one of the goals is being able to identify how your overall depression has an impact on how you make decision.

1393
02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:13.470
Richelle Direny: Because it does have an impact both, I think both anxiety and depression. Does that it has an impact on it so you know they've got the objective is, is that each time that we meet

1394
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:33.240
Richelle Direny: We're going to pick apart that we're going to talk about that. Like, how does that has an overall impact on your decision making skill, because remember those the impact that it has on your decision making skills, was one of them was ultimately how it your addiction.

1395
02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:34.260
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah.

1396
02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:39.930
Richelle Direny: Because when you got really depressed or you have this feeling of hopelessness, you felt helpless.

1397
02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:50.340
Richelle Direny: You felt like you know you're the only one you isolated didn't want to have anything to do with how you combat those thoughts those feelings of uncontrollable where you lost control.

1398
02:24:51.000 --> 02:25:07.470
Richelle Direny: Oh, you gave up was, what would be your addiction, like what it is that you were addicted to what helped to numb those feeling those thoughts those, you know, just the way you were feeling not wanting to feel anymore now wanting to think anymore.

1399
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:10.320
Rhi Rhi R: He completely numb and I deal with anything.

1400
02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:12.390
Rhi Rhi R: From long time

1401
02:25:14.370 --> 02:25:33.750
Rhi Rhi R: Then my cousin OD and then that was really bad, like she was like she lived with me for 15 years and she was like my sister, sister and she OD on Xanax and Benadryl and that really screwed me up, like I can I go

1402
02:25:35.850 --> 02:25:41.340
Rhi Rhi R: Through to throw a whole year over that and then Ryan for that. My son died. Yeah.

1403
02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:53.970
Richelle Direny: So you think about, you know, like you said it best, you are because though whether you have dreams of it, whatever it is. Anything that can numb the thoughts of feeling

1404
02:25:54.390 --> 02:26:07.140
Richelle Direny: Anything that can kind of just block all of it kind of like that. It's non existent for you. But the reality of it is like. It's like taking a pain medication what eventually happens to that pain medication.

1405
02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:12.510
Rhi Rhi R: It runs out, you get addicted sometimes

1406
02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:18.090
Richelle Direny: Exactly. Because, because you're trying to numb the pain you're trying to stop the page by

1407
02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:26.730
Richelle Direny: That statement is not meant to be a permanent fixture to your pain. What it does, it just numbs it temporarily it wears off. So

1408
02:26:28.470 --> 02:26:29.820
Rhi Rhi R: I thought like

1409
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:38.160
Rhi Rhi R: Like with my son I instead of just not dealing with it, like with my cousin. I actually went to

1410
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:48.570
Rhi Rhi R: Because I was on another program. So I had a counselor or therapist, like you. And then I had, I went to a grief counseling to and they were teaching me

1411
02:26:49.650 --> 02:26:54.210
Rhi Rhi R: Breathing exercises and stuff like the other ways to deal, you know,

1412
02:26:55.230 --> 02:27:13.290
Rhi Rhi R: I think if I didn't have them. I could have never talked about my son, like I do, now you know we've never because he's like he's my brother almost died in a car accident to not read the whole damn car died, except my brother. I know he has survived. You know, he's 25

1413
02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:16.140
So,

1414
02:27:17.730 --> 02:27:28.440
Rhi Rhi R: I mean, it's a big thing here they close down the road for two years in a row. There's like 450 people at my son's funeral and he's 21 I didn't know you knew that made people

1415
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:30.330
Rhi Rhi R: Do

1416
02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:38.430
Rhi Rhi R: That is a lot of people, but I did do a lot better. A lot better and not what

1417
02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:39.060
You

1418
02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:42.810
Rhi Rhi R: What they did was

1419
02:27:44.310 --> 02:27:54.900
Rhi Rhi R: It so sad because there's a 20 year old kid with names that drove them from there went to Ashland, which is like 20 minutes away from where we live to a club.

1420
02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:05.730
Rhi Rhi R: And they kicked it over there and that the driver was a non drinker. So he did not drag and drop drove them all the way back here too. And so

1421
02:28:06.690 --> 02:28:28.410
Rhi Rhi R: I'm on the south side which is where my mom I caught outside and then they decided to go to a friend's house over there and that's when the boy that didn't drink. He opened the beer and to go drink and they decided to get back into this car and go all across town door to my house.

1422
02:28:29.550 --> 02:28:39.810
Rhi Rhi R: And that's what my son drove because of course everybody else was drinking. Even my son was drinking, but nobody else would drive with drinking. You know, I mean,

1423
02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:53.850
Rhi Rhi R: My brother even put his teeth on in the backseat. So that tells you right there. They should not you know hardly anybody and they were 21 you know i mean 2021 2321

1424
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:55.440
So anyway.

1425
02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:04.530
Rhi Rhi R: What happened was they they come to my house and I guess a decided to go back across town to my mom's house.

1426
02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:10.830
Rhi Rhi R: Which is where my brother stayed at the time, and his best friend. The 20 year olds. They drink. They built the road.

1427
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:18.180
Rhi Rhi R: And my son was going to stay with the girl that was was around a car because they were all real good friends. You know, they grew up together.

1428
02:29:19.170 --> 02:29:39.870
Rhi Rhi R: And then they stopped at McDonalds at four in the morning at 406 30 where he went off to the side of the road. And then we come back over the overturned my years of big field where he was and three little tiny trees but if he hits trees and maybe they were in a nap.

1429
02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:42.120
Rhi Rhi R: So,

1430
02:29:43.410 --> 02:29:44.760
Rhi Rhi R: It was awful girl all

1431
02:29:46.140 --> 02:29:47.400
Richelle Direny: Everyone in the car died.

1432
02:29:48.030 --> 02:29:55.110
Rhi Rhi R: Everybody but my brother. And what happened is the guy the trouble that lives at the house.

1433
02:29:56.490 --> 02:30:00.150
Rhi Rhi R: Woke up to the crash. The guy had a prosthetic leg yet but

1434
02:30:01.380 --> 02:30:10.020
Rhi Rhi R: When you get outside there was so much smoke. I guess the way that state trooper explained it to me, versus a house fire in a car fire.

1435
02:30:11.370 --> 02:30:16.830
Rhi Rhi R: it. Goes way faster. You know, I mean, so when a guy got outside

1436
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:33.480
Rhi Rhi R: He only her my brother. You see there's a girl in the market. So, and she burned to death. But from what I heard she already gone. That's what they said, My son flew 55 feet out the air and he was in the field.

1437
02:30:34.530 --> 02:30:49.500
Rhi Rhi R: And the boy that was 20 he flew a 50 year. The other one, she made them pack way of, I guess, once you make one hole. They all go the same way. She was headed that way, but her feet deep and my brother was in a depot.

1438
02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:58.620
Rhi Rhi R: So the guy with the prosthetic lay came and knocked the back window out because all the other one does potty mouth the back way.

1439
02:30:59.070 --> 02:31:08.640
Rhi Rhi R: And he told it, you're gonna have to help me get you out and my brother Martha kicked and his pelvis was broke all where the seatbelt would have you it was broke

1440
02:31:09.390 --> 02:31:09.900
Rhi Rhi R: Me.

1441
02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:13.800
Rhi Rhi R: And he missed all the funerals and it was so

1442
02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:23.580
Rhi Rhi R: Nice use I've used in the hospital for a month and then he had physical therapy and he got gout at 22

1443
02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:33.660
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah, it was, it was something and then his girlfriend him had a baby and it really like

1444
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:45.660
Rhi Rhi R: It wasn't his baby, but he was going to take care of the baby and then she died right afterwards. It was awful. It was like we were hit, left, right, left, right, left, right, but I didn't die.

1445
02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:47.820
Richelle Direny: That's good.

1446
02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:50.850
Richelle Direny: So why not. What was your support system.

1447
02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:54.030
Rhi Rhi R: To be honest with you.

1448
02:31:56.610 --> 02:32:15.090
Rhi Rhi R: My mom is like a guardian angel girl and for one thing, my last counselor was telling me. Do not turn her into your sponsor you tell her too much stuff she Your mom, your mom. And then I caught on to. I was really toner way too much stuff you know it is your mom.

1449
02:32:16.410 --> 02:32:26.220
Rhi Rhi R: And so I had to get a sponsor and I did and you know any helped me a lot. And then I had two cousins, which were

1450
02:32:27.810 --> 02:32:45.060
Rhi Rhi R: My cousin that passed away. God, her sister and her brother. We all grew up real close today. I had a really good sports with my son, and he was into racing and all that, when he was younger. He 40 years old he was first place in, you know, dirt racing and

1451
02:32:46.110 --> 02:32:48.780
Rhi Rhi R: So I had a lot of people healthy. I mean,

1452
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:50.160
Richelle Direny: What about spirituality

1453
02:32:51.330 --> 02:32:59.640
Rhi Rhi R: What, oh, well, this and I remember it's funny that you brought that up my son, Stephen, the one that passed away, his name was

1454
02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:06.720
Rhi Rhi R: He there was a church up the road remarks and they were all going and they were into play. You know, as

1455
02:33:08.250 --> 02:33:19.620
Rhi Rhi R: Go step is three wise men and all that stuff itself. My son within two months to come to that church got 60 people to follow him to lecture.

1456
02:33:20.910 --> 02:33:22.440
Rhi Rhi R: So that pasture.

1457
02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.000
Richelle Direny: Fix the people

1458
02:33:24.270 --> 02:33:30.180
Rhi Rhi R: They see people started going to church and I signed because they were they wanted to see, you know, and they were all gone.

1459
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:33.510
Richelle Direny: What he looked like he had such a large following

1460
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:48.840
Rhi Rhi R: Girl. He I guess he his hair is is pure. Sure, I guess, and my brother and ham, or six months apart so they look like 20 and then the neighborhood kids. I mean, there was

1461
02:33:49.890 --> 02:33:57.930
Rhi Rhi R: At least 15 neighborhood kids and the day had friends. So when the time was play came there were 60 additional people that Stephen

1462
02:33:59.100 --> 02:33:59.520
Rhi Rhi R: Had

1463
02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:10.770
Rhi Rhi R: You know anyway. So the pasture meta moment and he moved to Texas. So I my son passed each car accident. He did the, you know,

1464
02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:12.630
Rhi Rhi R: The service.

1465
02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:16.920
Rhi Rhi R: At church did it for free. And it was nine.

1466
02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:19.110
Rhi Rhi R: Your summary.

1467
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:23.340
Rhi Rhi R: So that's I want, I want to take my son's up there. The Herald.

1468
02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:27.420
Rhi Rhi R: So you said like so. So

1469
02:34:28.110 --> 02:34:38.610
Richelle Direny: When you say your spirituality and like your son and going to the church like for you, like, how does that your belief in God.

1470
02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:41.640
Richelle Direny: Um, how you know

1471
02:34:43.650 --> 02:34:45.870
Rhi Rhi R: I just okay to be on

1472
02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:47.070
Richelle Direny: What you believe

1473
02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:54.810
Rhi Rhi R: I do believe you. I believe in God. Yes, I do. Very much so. I believe in Jesus Christ. I do.

1474
02:34:56.460 --> 02:34:59.850
Rhi Rhi R: I believe we are in it. We are in the paint or weird. Okay.

1475
02:35:00.810 --> 02:35:01.350
Rhi Rhi R: Right now.

1476
02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:01.980
But

1477
02:35:04.170 --> 02:35:05.250
Rhi Rhi R: When that happened,

1478
02:35:06.450 --> 02:35:07.080
Rhi Rhi R: I did.

1479
02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:12.840
Rhi Rhi R: For a split second I blamed him Jesus, but

1480
02:35:13.950 --> 02:35:24.120
Rhi Rhi R: I couldn't because he saved my you know he don't he didn't create that my son was drunk. I sent my son de Paul level was awful. I may have missed like

1481
02:35:25.020 --> 02:35:38.490
Rhi Rhi R: Point one eight for something and they had a video. The video from make down on they figured they they found out they went to McDonald's, because when they pick my son, there was a sandwich with one

1482
02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:59.100
Rhi Rhi R: So when I watched the video you can see in the video, my son was just way too much moving around and laughing and giggling and no seat belt and, you know, I mean, he was just, it was awful. And for my brother. His alcohol level was point 09 and he had a seatbelt on. Exactly. So

1483
02:35:59.730 --> 02:36:01.230
Richelle Direny: So he had all his wherewithal

1484
02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:05.670
Richelle Direny: So he wasn't he a drink, but it wasn't enough. It wasn't anything to talk about

1485
02:36:06.450 --> 02:36:11.670
Rhi Rhi R: Right. And now check their blood. So you know that it is what it is. Yeah.

1486
02:36:12.390 --> 02:36:24.780
Richelle Direny: And I go from like what helped you in terms of because of your belief your spirituality, how it has an impact on your journey is you're saying that initially you were upset with God.

1487
02:36:25.050 --> 02:36:30.060
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah. But then you're like, Well, God didn't do that you made that informed decision.

1488
02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:30.420
Richelle Direny: Now,

1489
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.980
Richelle Direny: So I believe in.

1490
02:36:32.010 --> 02:36:33.420
Rhi Rhi R: God, I believe.

1491
02:36:34.530 --> 02:36:50.280
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah, God put that man in Motion to put his prosthetic leg on and take my brother. It's not my brother be dead. I do believe that I really do. And I think Jesus Christ. Every day that I think to wake up. You know what I need to wake up and not be

1492
02:36:51.570 --> 02:37:04.980
Rhi Rhi R: Searching for a panel and, you know, wondering. Oh god, where am I going to be sick in the morning and not worry about my kids and not doing, you know, and this happened with my my oldest son now he was

1493
02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:19.170
Rhi Rhi R: He at the time. So he seen me awful, you know, the East enough. OK, so now he's ever seen me do anything. I got pregnant, and that's what saved my damn life.

1494
02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:35.040
Rhi Rhi R: I was pissed. I certainly don't get me wrong. And I thought, the guy was was for 11 half years. And we get pregnant and we split up. Is he got a 22 year old girl pregnant. I was like, Oh, hell no. No, they're not. He has a brother that six months younger

1495
02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:42.390
Rhi Rhi R: And and and MY SON'S FATHER. It was the scholastic girl disgusted Renee was so mad.

1496
02:37:43.530 --> 02:37:50.790
Rhi Rhi R: Because he's got to nori on and then Kingston, which is my son, and now he has the lyric, and he's not none of us.

1497
02:37:51.570 --> 02:38:06.330
Rhi Rhi R: None of us and he, you know, first he thought he was going to be the last girl, but he wasn't. I knew he wasn't. He's a good guy. He's just just not there for relationship for 11 years, you know, and he was good, he treated me good, he just to

1498
02:38:07.350 --> 02:38:07.830
Rhi Rhi R: Be just

1499
02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:13.980
Rhi Rhi R: Like to be with other people, you know, I have

1500
02:38:14.610 --> 02:38:15.120
Richelle Direny: A crap.

1501
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:22.710
Rhi Rhi R: And then when I got pregnant. I thought, Oh my God, I'm on drugs and what am I going to do, and he didn't know it, you know.

1502
02:38:23.670 --> 02:38:34.740
Rhi Rhi R: I was working, you know, I still worked. He were and it was easy to get them and then I got fired eight and a half months pregnant and by then I was already on submitted.

1503
02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:43.680
Rhi Rhi R: But that doctor that I was seeing then wanted me to take the three a day and I cut myself down because I figured

1504
02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:53.760
Rhi Rhi R: God if I would stop taking these I would feel it when when sinful it, you know. So I cut myself down but stone. It matter.

1505
02:38:54.270 --> 02:39:01.320
Rhi Rhi R: Because they treat you like a drug addict idiot. Anyway, I was up there for 17 days. And there's a score sheet, which I'm sure you're familiar with maybe

1506
02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:11.160
Rhi Rhi R: If they score eight three times in a row. They had to be phone to Akron again and phenobarbital and murky and all that stuff and

1507
02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:21.990
Rhi Rhi R: He scored an eight, one from Season two much. That was it. That was it. He never had any thank God, though. Thank God for that, you know, as it could have been way worse.

1508
02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:35.580
Rhi Rhi R: And then after that I had to take it serious because I there's no way no way and Stephen this my son that I lost was very close to him. He was to when Stephen past and girl.

1509
02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:47.790
Rhi Rhi R: Every day for four months in a row, he get all esteem to choose out of line up and he put a wife beater on and gene fights do we're working on a car.

1510
02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:56.190
Rhi Rhi R: It was and I try, you know, bring me a trigger be a trigger me in terms of Stephen dying so that

1511
02:39:59.100 --> 02:39:59.820
Richelle Direny: I wouldn't made it

1512
02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:10.140
Rhi Rhi R: And then God I prayed to him and pray to Him. Every time I prayed him. He's crying, and he I've never heard him talk should be. You know how some people sitting here.

1513
02:40:11.550 --> 02:40:14.760
Rhi Rhi R: And I can't wait for that day, but I do know this.

1514
02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:22.830
Richelle Direny: I think it's how we think. I think it's how how you think about the hearing him. I think you're looking to hear him like you hear me talking to you.

1515
02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:27.690
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah. And now I believe he does talk to people.

1516
02:40:28.410 --> 02:40:31.140
Richelle Direny: And I believe people through situations through

1517
02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:44.880
Richelle Direny: Circumstances, or that still small voice or you'll say, you know, I feel like something just told me to do this. It's how we're thinking of we're thinking of like a loud audible voice, not to say that that can happen.

1518
02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:51.510
Richelle Direny: But I think that's just how we think the conversation should always be but there's many different ways to

1519
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.840
Rhi Rhi R: Get it.

1520
02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:58.320
Rhi Rhi R: Yes. Yeah, I mean I I don't believe I would be here today, if it wasn't

1521
02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:03.030
Rhi Rhi R: For those Lord engines just I don't believe

1522
02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:04.350
I mean, there's

1523
02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:24.360
Rhi Rhi R: No, I'm just now getting Kingston into it like he he'll be eight and then you don't want it now. Listen dear EVER BEEN LIKE SIX, SEVEN YEARS OLD AND LIKE AT seven years old. You know what he asked me, hey mom for my birthday. We take me to a lot nicer.

1524
02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:25.860
Rhi Rhi R: Girl.

1525
02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:31.950
Rhi Rhi R: I don't ever ever remember at seven years old, even thinking about that.

1526
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:41.940
Richelle Direny: You know why no you know why because you think about it, the time that we're living in now in comparison to when you were younger.

1527
02:41:42.450 --> 02:41:42.930
And

1528
02:41:44.310 --> 02:41:46.500
Richelle Direny: Of all how children. Talk to adults now.

1529
02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:48.150
Rhi Rhi R: You would never know. It's great.

1530
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:49.650
Rhi Rhi R: Oh,

1531
02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:51.360
Rhi Rhi R: My mama my ass.

1532
02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:53.730
Rhi Rhi R: Yes.

1533
02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:54.030
Rhi Rhi R: And

1534
02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:55.530
Richelle Direny: She. I mean, if we

1535
02:41:55.710 --> 02:42:01.890
Richelle Direny: If we if you take children. Now if we were like that. I'm sure we would all have dentures today simply

1536
02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:03.450
Richelle Direny: Has no teeth.

1537
02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:04.110
Yeah.

1538
02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:08.070
Richelle Direny: I mean, we would have been seeing out of bifocals because

1539
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:11.010
Richelle Direny: By the time we finished and getting told me

1540
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:11.850
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah.

1541
02:42:12.330 --> 02:42:16.260
Richelle Direny: The by the time you can again talk because back then you could have gotten told

1542
02:42:17.130 --> 02:42:17.640
Rhi Rhi R: Yeah.

1543
02:42:17.850 --> 02:42:18.840
Rhi Rhi R: I thought, what was the

1544
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:27.210
Richelle Direny: Girl. Remember, remember what the exposure to what's on TV. The, the music that you listen

1545
02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:29.760
Rhi Rhi R: To Mine wasn't back then.

1546
02:42:30.060 --> 02:42:33.030
Richelle Direny: So, you know, a lot of the language, the explicit and

1547
02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:34.350
Richelle Direny: Then the music.

1548
02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:36.090
Rhi Rhi R: Movies all that

1549
02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:41.460
Richelle Direny: It's all of that. Remember they're there, they're exposed to everything where it's

1550
02:42:41.490 --> 02:42:42.870
Richelle Direny: A lot of that.

1551
02:42:42.930 --> 02:42:49.230
Richelle Direny: Then was like, you remember pay per view to everything was on pay per view on enough

1552
02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:53.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you can watch now everything is out in the open.

1553
02:42:53.610 --> 02:42:54.870
Richelle Direny: Yeah, everything is

1554
02:42:55.260 --> 02:43:00.450
Richelle Direny: Open. So, you know, children today are very exposed in

1555
02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:02.580
Rhi Rhi R: Everywhere and it is scary.

1556
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:07.260
Rhi Rhi R: It's very scary. It's scary to the point where

1557
02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:10.500
Rhi Rhi R: You know a lot of people don't even

1558
02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:19.020
Rhi Rhi R: Know, they don't know about Jesus. You know, it's awful. I mean, like, I'm just

1559
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:22.470
Richelle Direny: It's, it's not that they don't necessarily know in

1560
02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:25.530
Richelle Direny: This day and age in our society in America.

1561
02:43:26.370 --> 02:43:45.810
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's not that they don't know it's a matter of whether or not they believe, um, and it's also it's believing it's accepting. It's also when you go through different things, like you said, natural human instinct says when something bad happens, how can there be a god.

1562
02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:47.910
Richelle Direny: Who allows all happen.

1563
02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:48.630
Rhi Rhi R: How can

1564
02:43:48.690 --> 02:43:51.630
Richelle Direny: I believe in a God for allows all of this to happen.

1565
02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:57.840
Richelle Direny: So that, that's what it's kind of like what's going on now with all everybody who's sick and

1566
02:43:57.870 --> 02:44:10.020
Richelle Direny: was dying. How can there be a god and all of this happens. But like you said it's being at that place, like you said, it happened it's bad. It hurts like oh my gosh

1567
02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:25.230
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's coming to that place going through the emotions and coming to that place and saying, Okay, how do I allow the person to take responsibility for their role that they played in their ultimate

1568
02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:34.170
Rhi Rhi R: Right. And I said, like for two years in a row. Like I said he had the right road down and we walked from

1569
02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:56.730
Rhi Rhi R: The school to the site and I made a speech, and I know people are pissed at my son, you know, they took me took their lives and it and he was a loving everybody knew he was a loving popular kid. And, uh, but he still took their babies and I, as I said, You guys, I apologize. I know you're angry.

1570
02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:18.300
Rhi Rhi R: And I'm sorry for that and Stephen. Stephen when we so you know if you've been alive today. I mean, like my mom. My mom. My mom don't understand why is it talks about like to you. I, I haven't tried yet it. She can't even mention it was on prior will get this big you she makes me cry if we

1571
02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:30.240
Rhi Rhi R: Talk about it, but I've had. I tried to tell you these accounts like she don't believe in doing accounting, but she does listen to a retry mine, thank God, but you know she believes in God, it's just

1572
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:35.040
Rhi Rhi R: I feel like he took him for a reason.

1573
02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:42.210
Rhi Rhi R: And he's preparing me for something to converse, I think. I don't know. That's just how I feel.

1574
02:45:42.900 --> 02:45:43.320
