Gwenevere Abriel: What a crummy day. What is going on, my dear.

Lyndsey Lorett: Listen.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.010
Lyndsey Lorett: I just don't even know how to explain what's going on.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.670
Lyndsey Lorett: It's like such a deep story.

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.450
Lyndsey Lorett: But I'm so we you know we lost my fiance. About a year ago and I feel like

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:54.660
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't smoke pot a lot. I have my medical card. Um, I don't like to do it. I only like to do it at night when I can go right to sleep and not have to be around anyone but when I'm in really bad pain once in like a great while I will do it during the day. Right.

10
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.990
Lyndsey Lorett: So I feel like every time I do it during the day. My in laws.

11
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:15.870
Lyndsey Lorett: My in laws, put on the same video home video every time and make me think that we haven't watched it before when we have and I know this sounds crazy.

12
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you're not crazy. Just tell me.

13
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.290
Lyndsey Lorett: They make the same dinner every time.

14
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:34.290
Lyndsey Lorett: They see the same things every time. And I feel like I can't say anything because every time I do they say no, no, no, we haven't or I'm

15
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.180
Lyndsey Lorett: Just make me feel like I am crazy

16
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so listen

17
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's their message to you is, it is the message.

18
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I you shouldn't be smoking weed. No.

19
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Son, does my brother in law does it every day all day.

20
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but is that their message to you.

21
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.940
Lyndsey Lorett: Know, because they tell me to do it like go pressure me to do it.

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So what meaning. So, so I'm off.

23
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning, does it have to you that it is the same movie it's same food and it's the same content what meaning. Let's just see what it is because it's really upsetting.

24
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.930
Lyndsey Lorett: Did it

25
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning. Does it have

26
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:38.160
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know what I know they think my memory isn't the best. Oh, and I might be stuck in some type of type of trauma survival think OK, OK, OK, OK, gotcha. Because of this whole last year.

27
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay. Ah, OK.

28
00:02:44.430 --> 00:03:02.100
Lyndsey Lorett: But I'm always control. I'm always aware of when I'm feeling. I didn't tell you what I'm feeling and this is not normal for me. And I feel like we're reliving it like every so many days and that they're purposely messing with me.

29
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:17.610
Lyndsey Lorett: I know they want all of her. I know they want my son because it's the last thing may have a clint. I know that, but I have to believe there's some good in there and that they do care about me.

30
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You're feeling like you're going a little crazy.

31
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Okay.

32
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So something. Now I gotta tell you something. Lindsay

33
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I tend to believe you. So you're seeing something happen and just now, you touched on a really important piece and you haven't shared it with me before. And that is, I know they want to keep my son.

34
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, is that about it's

35
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Just all part of this last year.

36
00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:01.530
Lyndsey Lorett: You know you if you live with your in laws, who should live with your spouse there, too. I just don't think you're supposed to be with your in laws without your spouse.

37
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.500
Lyndsey Lorett: And

38
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What might. So what's the fear, right, notice you have a you have a strong belief about something, if I'm living with my in laws. I shouldn't be, because I don't have my spouse. I'm with my in laws.

39
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And there you are, you're living your wisdom and you don't have your spouse. What do you think will happen if you keep living there.

40
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.080
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know. I know that it's not healthy for any of us okay but nobody talks about anything.

41
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.290
Lyndsey Lorett: They argue, but not in front of me, they do it in private.

42
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.030
Lyndsey Lorett: I know stuff is going on, but nobody tells me

43
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.640
Lyndsey Lorett: And they want to know everything that I'm doing. But I don't get the same Curtis courtesy.

44
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, all you know what, now all I can think about is that pink elephant stuff.

45
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you know what I mean. Now I want to know what stuff. You think they're talking about is it is the stuff they're going to try and get custody of my son.

46
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.010
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm deep down I think so, yeah.

47
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

48
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so listen here, missy. You're the mommy that

49
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.490
So,

50
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.870
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm broke. I can't care for him on my own.

51
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.830
Oh,

52
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me here. Let me hear what you mean by that.

53
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't get up.

54
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.890
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I know I get up.

55
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.000
Lyndsey Lorett: I get

56
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There, you don't prepare any food. Correct.

57
00:05:48.840 --> 00:06:02.340
Lyndsey Lorett: No I prepare food I buy the food and prepare the food. Um, I can't bend over to give him a bath at night. I can't put him in his crib after I've gotten him to sleep.

58
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:16.260
Lyndsey Lorett: Just a lot of the heavy lifting. I can't do. And, well, I know that I've given over control willingly to them because I felt like I had no choice.

59
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.950
Lyndsey Lorett: And now I'd like to fight to get some of that back. I know.

60
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's step back from it for a second. Let's try a different angle.

61
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So all of a sudden, as soon as you said. So notice how I

62
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I said some things and you immediately said not true I buy the food prepare the food I get up so so let's talk about workman's comp for a second. Let's come at it from a

63
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes we hurt our bodies and we go to a workmen comp doctor. This is an analogy. By the way, I know, I know I'm off topic, but

64
00:06:52.110 --> 00:07:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This will bring some perspective, we go to our Workman's Comp and we say, this happened on the job and I literally like a camp will go with lifting

65
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: The doctor writes, he does these tests and he says you know what you need to stay home. You need to heal. You're not going to lose your job.

66
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to heal. You're going to use some of your, your FM la benefits. Make sure you apply for that and then

67
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When you come back, come back, I need to be meeting with you every two weeks, and I'll check if you're healing if you're following the treatment plan if you're doing the research on the physical therapy. Okay, great. You seem to be looking at you, you've improved 80%

68
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're running out of benefits. And honestly, I've talked with your youth your GM and they said that you can actually do some clerical work and you don't have to do any lifting

69
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the workman's comp rights can't lift more than five pounds and will be able to sit more than two hours a day and needs to be stretching and walking dead today. So there's this real itemize thing.

70
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The employers not going to fire this employee.

71
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So you're in a similar situation. Your doctor has probably said and written don't bend over.

72
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So why do you think that a family's going to take your children away when the only limitation in writing by a medical professional

73
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't matter what nonsense. Someone says, and we'll talk about what it feels like to live with the person that you think they're conspiring against you will get into that, but just, let's just the logic for a second.

74
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You have it in writing that the limitations. The physical limitations are bending over

75
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

76
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. And so you already told me cook clean care for and frankly, if you absolutely had to right it's just to put we can figure out a way to even if you had to bait that child.

77
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.660
Lyndsey Lorett: I try to the other night, and like, take it away from me.

78
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's different, that's over here we're going to get into their behavior in two seconds.

79
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I were gossiping. Right now we're talking. We're just they're not even in the room.

80
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had to bathe that child.

81
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you do if you needed a tiny little body planes. How would you get it done.

82
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.400
Lyndsey Lorett: I would bake them. I would put him I would bend over in the bath and give him a bath.

83
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Or what else could you do if you couldn't bend over this. Think about sleep or be creative here. Could we get the water somewhere else.

84
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Could we do it in this sink sink.

85
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.520
Hello.

86
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Hello, saying, hey, right there. Yeah, yeah.

87
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And we've got bathing through we've got wet.

88
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: wet towels. We've got bathing, don't they do that in a hospital.

89
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:48.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

90
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Lunch bath.

91
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, they do a sponge bath. Yes, they do.

92
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So just on that one thing that child is taken care of.

93
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now are you has that that level of anxiety come down even 1%

94
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay right now let's let's talk about

95
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All the neat things that you did you remembered that you have me as a resource and I'm really proud of you.

96
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Really proud of you.

97
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad I had the time I had some little thing right at the end. And I'm sorry I was late.

98
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.150
It's okay.

99
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to talk a little bit about the culture of this home.

100
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How it is that you have a suspicion that this family may want to

101
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Take them away. Tell me about your suspicions.

102
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.990
Lyndsey Lorett: I, I feel like

103
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:13.110
Lyndsey Lorett: They just are really attached to all of her and the idea of even me moving out and doing things on my own is like not allowed.

104
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're showing more capability and they keep removing the option for you to do the mommy thing.

105
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:36.690
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, but it's not worth the fight my brother in law has OCD, his mother. The, the grandma's very controlling. I mean there's just certain factors in the situation.

106
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.340
Lyndsey Lorett: I got you.

107
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So if now OCD, fine. We got some compulsive behavior and now we've got controlling behavior. So, grandma gets to be controlling

108
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone gets to be obsessive compulsive and it has nothing to do with all of her there's something else going on. What is this that stuff existed before all of her was here.

109
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.150
Lyndsey Lorett: It did. That's why I'm wondering, like, if the function

110
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: They were doing it to each other. It was probably just

111
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.580
Lyndsey Lorett: Nuts. How it. How did they do it.

112
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but those are different than they miss their son Oliver's the last of them.

113
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Is though, right, he's right so now around that. That's really getting into it.

114
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.130
Lyndsey Lorett: That was controlling

115
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Obsessive Compulsive Behavior that that's probably been there pre existing. So now let's get into. Hmm.

116
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about the thing you started with.

117
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like they're trying to make you crazy with the whole playing the movie. Every time you smoke weed what

118
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that

119
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:06.210
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know. That's the theme that's what I'd like I am so drained right now. I've put every ounce of energy into figuring this out.

120
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.140
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know what why someone would do this to another person.

121
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And the doing is I'm assuming you're talking about playing the same movie having the same conversation.

122
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.260
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, okay.

123
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you, it sounds like you've tried on one hypothesis, which is. It's to make you crazy to feel crazy. Is that what you're thinking.

124
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.440
Yeah.

125
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me let me understand that a little bit more because plenty of people do that kind of thing. It's called gaslighting and plenty of people do it. So let me just see how it a little bit more detail. What's the movie they keep playing.

126
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.630
Lyndsey Lorett: It's a home video of them on a trip.

127
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Through Illinois

128
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.840
Lyndsey Lorett: And

129
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:07.140
Lyndsey Lorett: They have a lot of fun and they learned a lot of neat things. And each time that I watch it. I'm trying to

130
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.580
Lyndsey Lorett: Pay attention to everything that's going on what they're saying about each

131
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.690
Lyndsey Lorett: Thing that comes up on the video like

132
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.120
Lyndsey Lorett: They say the same exact things at the same exact time

133
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What are they saying this is so interesting. What are they saying

134
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not ready for

135
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: All that if this might be how they're communicating to you. I really am curious to know, what is it, what are they saying at the same time.

136
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:45.570
Lyndsey Lorett: They say the same like what they're doing. They're explaining what they're doing. They're explaining what the boys are doing they're

137
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Just they laugh at the same parts they cry at the same parts.

138
00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:11.370
Lyndsey Lorett: And what I what I'm tripping out about is that like I can tell you last week at this time. This is what I was doing. But with this situation. It's like I'm blocked somewhere and blocked from remembering when we did this. Okay.

139
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Let me see. So let me see if I'm getting this right.

140
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's Monday, and here I am. I have a lot of pain and in the middle of the day I needed to take some some marijuana

141
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:27.900
Lyndsey Lorett: And then

142
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The videos on

143
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:29.850
Yeah.

144
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And does it have

145
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your husband in it as a little

146
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.920
Lyndsey Lorett: Boy, as a little boy.

147
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

148
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And the people in the room, his parents in real time, not in the video.

149
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, in real time, are laughing

150
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're crying at the same time as they're watching the video.

151
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:02.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

152
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're preparing the same lasagna on a Monday, same as just saying as the video or just always on that same day that you smoked marijuana and they turn the video on

153
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.540
Lyndsey Lorett: It's always meatloaf. And it's always, there's always something wrong with it.

154
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what

155
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.540
Lyndsey Lorett: I believe yesterday had beat freezer burn and Lori wouldn't eat it.

156
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.280
Lyndsey Lorett: Lori wouldn't need it does

157
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Does the family get to argue a little bit around the meat, love, do they get to have a little argument about the freezer burn no arguing

158
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.080
Now,

159
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.880
Lyndsey Lorett: What

160
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.050
Statement.

161
00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the same. It's not freezer burn, but maybe it's dry. It's greasy doesn't have enough. There's always somebody, but it but does the person that makes the complaint is it always Lori, or does it

162
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:09.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

163
00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:14.640
Lyndsey Lorett: So I

164
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.860
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know how to tell myself that I'm not going crazy.

165
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Like this, so unhealthy.

166
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.740

Lyndsey Lorett: That physical pain. Yeah, okay.

169
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.890

Gwenevere Abriel: You smoked marijuana read edibles, or however you ingesting the THC.

171
00:17:48.750 --> 00:18:01.950
Lyndsey Lorett: I can't, I can't, I have no pain and that's okay. It's like a plus, but a con. Like, can. They're not be something out there that takes away the pain. Yeah, I know.

172
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were feeling crazy and there was pain. Was it today.

173
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.570
Lyndsey Lorett: No, it was yesterday.

174
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I so it's it's it happens on Sunday. So that's, that's what's going on. It does it always happen on Sunday.

175
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

176
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.290
Lyndsey Lorett: I believe so, yes. The thing is, is that

177
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Are you gonna so think I'm crazy.

178
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think so. I don't

179
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:45.330
Lyndsey Lorett: I tried to document things in my phone and it'll, it'll just be deleted like

180
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:56.610
Lyndsey Lorett: Just completely gone. Not there. I've had come parts of conversations deleted just, I don't know. Okay, okay.

181
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.420
You're okay.

182
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're trying to document.

183
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're gathering evidence for what's culmination what what will be the finale that you're caught you're gathering the conversations and pictures of things. What were you kind of hoping to do with it eventually

184
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.690
Lyndsey Lorett: I would just like to know that they're knowingly doing this.

185
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.560
Lyndsey Lorett: To me for a reason.

186
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So we would see meatloaf again and you would hear always Lori making a complaint about the meatloaf. Right.

187
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.700
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Okay.

188
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And we would hear laughter Right at the same point in the video right

189
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, make and they would make the same kind of comments they would cry and they would make the same comments and they say it at the same time.

190
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.550
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, but why can't I remember this.

191
00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't remember you're telling me now. So it sounds to me like you're remembering it.

192
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.420
Lyndsey Lorett: I even remembering it happening.

193
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.970
Lyndsey Lorett: But I can't tell you the last time that happened.

194
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You told me this happened on Sunday.

195
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:19.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. But as I'm reliving it today. I can't tell you when the last time this happened.

196
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. Okay, so you can't confront them. You can't say, Oh my gosh, this is like deja vu, um, y'all. Did we just do this last week.

197
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Can't do it. You are now let me understand what is the emotion that you feel

198
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: When deja vu right when all of this is being done like all at the same time. What's the emotion.

199
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:57.570
Lyndsey Lorett: I just like I'm hurt, who would go to these types of links to like if they're concerned about me, why not help me or you know help fix the problem. Why are they making it worse.

200
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And who who's the worst person that is seems like they're really making it worse.

201
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:22.470
Lyndsey Lorett: All of them. They would all have to know. We're gonna do this to Wednesday at this time on this day and CPC.

202
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.650
Lyndsey Lorett: And I know that sounds crazy.

203
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.750
Lyndsey Lorett: So I don't know what the solution is. Okay.

204
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I think we're I think we're getting there. We got we've got we came in really feeling flooded. We got some some perspective on

205
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, a judge, right, we got some perspective right there. Now we're trying to get get a an angle at

206
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

207
00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How that pattern is happening, how often is happening. And you also mentioned something I'm blocked on remembering

208
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're adding a chemical so you're adding marijuana each time you're doing this.

209
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.020
Right.

210
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.300

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.720

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned the word I feel blocked that it's trauma related there's something going on right

217
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You have marijuana and you have you're seeing

218
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Your now deceased husband.

219
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.180
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

220
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:55.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

221
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever tried to walk out of the room. Do you know if you don't remember, that's fine. Just

222
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:09.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Like, you know, I try to walk out and they will pause it and, like, make sure I'm coming back.

223
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:18.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Because when I talked to my mom. My mom said why don't you just walk away and I try to

224
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you do walk away. They now they're every family has its own culture. So I want to just check on something.

Okay.

226
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.690

Yeah.

229
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What question. Would you ask me if you knew I could say nothing mean I could say nothing that would make you feel crazy

230
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:45.660
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

231
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And but right, you could say you could ask me anything you want.

232
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But not a, why not a why question ask an informed question really zero in on what you want to know.

233
00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.360
Why

234
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Is the why that's bugging me

235
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we do it that way. Why don't you tell me instead of a question, why don't you tell me what's funny.

236
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.580
Lyndsey Lorett: That it's bugging me that

237
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.830
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean, I know I'm an outsider into this family.

238
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.330
Lyndsey Lorett: And I don't know how things went on before I wasn't there before I was there.

239
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.780
Lyndsey Lorett: So I don't really have anything to base it off of the

240
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Lindsay. Yeah.

241
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This is even in your magical fantasy that I just set up.

242
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't give yourself permission to do it even in here you know you did that, even in fantasy. You don't give yourself permission. You went to

243
00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's bugging me and you didn't say why you made excuses, you made excuses. Well, I know I'm an outsider and maybe this is how it always was, it's just me. It's one of here.

244
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm not gonna say anything nasty. I won't say anything that makes you feel crazy

245
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanna, I actually want to hear about what I'm doing, that's bugging you

246
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I actually want to know, see if you can

247
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Worry what Lori is doing to bug me

248
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Go for it. Tell me.

249
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:50.640
Lyndsey Lorett: I feel like you Lori are very passive when you are trying to tell me to do something, you will see it through the cat or through all over, but with Drew you'll come right out and say it. You need to do this.

250
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: With drew i'm i'm direct with

251
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Barry, yes.

252
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So with the cat I do this. Oh, wouldn't it be great if we just all this some happy together without have Lindsay be such a happy house. I'll talk to you on that.

253
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:13.230
Yeah.

254
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:16.380
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah yeah

255
00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.000
Lyndsey Lorett: And I don't like confrontation I oh

256
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you don't. I can tell.

257
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I guess, I guess who's banking on that.

258
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.040
Lyndsey Lorett: They are

259
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:30.540
That's right.

260
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm glad I met you, because I got some

261
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Confidence around this concept of how to change.

262
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: perspective on what confrontation is

263
00:26:51.900 --> 00:27:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And a lot of my clients have people in their lives. Know that might not be what your, your in laws are but a lot of them are

264
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm labeling for now because I don't know much about them gaslighting

265
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:07.380
They didn't

266
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: They weren't always like this.

267
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:11.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

268
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. That's okay.

269
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.350
That's okay.

270
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.090
Lyndsey Lorett: All right.

271
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's happening now and you're feeling a choice. Do I go crazy.

272
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not. And that's what gaslighting intends to do. Now, maybe they haven't been that way. That's fine. I accept that. But it's happening. You're feeling crazy passive aggressive behavior. Someone denying your reality is how we make people feel crazy by saying it didn't happen and you

273
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Never do that to someone, though like I could not imagine doing that so

274
00:27:51.750 --> 00:28:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I treat people every day all day with the families that did that. What do I do with that these are facts. It's happening all across your state all across the state. All across the planet.

275
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.330
Lyndsey Lorett: It's a sad.

276
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It is sad. But I don't give up. There's a way through it.

277
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:12.150
Lyndsey Lorett: But

278
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But you get to decide I'm either going to go crazy.

279
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we have some choice here and that's what I'm interested to know, do you want to see that there's another way to do this.

280
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, absolutely could go crazy for them.

281
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Do what

282
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You could go crazy for them plenty of people do what they do is they go nuts right

283
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:36.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Because they

284
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: They start denying their own reality and a lot

285
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Of things happen. They get kidney stones, they get ulcers.

286
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Substance abuse addiction, right. They now have process addiction during domestically violent relationships they start to write we act out. We can't stand it. We don't want to go crazy.

287
00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:58.980
Yeah.

288
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what do we do, because we can't stand it is we try and numb ourselves. We want to get out of that feeling. And we escaped into drugs and alcohol and other process addictions.

289
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how much you know about process addictions foods. One of them sex pornography sleeping working gambling. I mean, we can pretty much darn near overdo anything.

290
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:20.790
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

291
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we don't want to have our reality denied. We don't want to go crazy.

292
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:27.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

293
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have a choice.

294
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to go crazy.

295
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Or do I want to be assertive. So I want to go crazy or do I want to speak my truth in a loving sweet polite way to, I want to go crazy.

296
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Or can I speak my truth.

297
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Why does it have to be the one thing I struggle with.

298
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the way life is, girl. That's what it does to us.

299
00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's the one thing you hate that's that's that's why life like it's our classroom, it messes with us like that. It's the very place that we need to grow that we fight. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. And there it is. The teacher again.

300
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:12.360
Lyndsey Lorett: We

301
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Could look at these in laws.

302
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: As a teacher, what if you're learning this ability to assert yourself assert your truth communicate your truth. It's not conflict.

303
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: There's fancy little ways we can wiggle around so that you're not igniting confrontation. Okay. That's little tricks we can do, but it's just the philosophy itself. We've got to start somewhere.

304
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:41.040
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I don't want this is too bad. No, no.

305
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do this, you can opt out of going crazy. And you can have this inner really beautiful self love defiance inside and not go crazy.

306
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. Wouldn't that be nice. Yeah.

307
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe you. I believe you're seeing what you're seeing

308
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe that this family in their grief response, maybe, resulting in some really odd hyper controlling behavior and I've never met them, but you've already told me grandma's controlling and guess what OCD is trying to control. So they cannot control the loss of this

309
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, man.

310
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.090
Lyndsey Lorett: Hey,

311
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: They can't but they can do this.

312
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.580
Lyndsey Lorett: But I feel like if they just knew my heart is not to hurt them.

313
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:44.820
Lyndsey Lorett: And that I don't want anything bad for always or to take all the from them that they wouldn't be it wouldn't be like this.

314
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If your in laws new a healthy way to grieve, they would already be doing it.

315
00:31:54.630 --> 00:32:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't know what to do. Are they good are they seeing professionals are they going to their minister, are they getting professional help.

316
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:03.150
Lyndsey Lorett: The old

317
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is what they're doing and you either keep denying it. Right. And I don't know, but I'm not there. But if our hypothesis is true.

318
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That this is going on. This is what they're going to do this ritual because it sounds like a bit of a ritual.

319
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.130
Yeah.

320
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like to think this is their grief response, I wouldn't do it this way.

321
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't like it.

322
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of their conspiring to take my son away from me. Look at the difference on how it feels inside. Now I don't know if either one or true, not true. How can I know I'm over here in Florida. Right.

323
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.380
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

324
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to do with how you feel about the meaning of it number I started and I said what meaning. Are you making out of it what meaning memory started there. So I'm back at that point trying to say, well,

325
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one do you want to think about more having compassion for these people as they work through their grief in a kind of an odd way it's bit mean mean spirited. I'm not your style, not how you would do it, and it does have an effect on you. It hurts. Yeah, okay.

326
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Rather than spinning around. And why would they conspire to try and take. Why would they continue. Why would they conspire to take my son. Look, this is not. Is this happening is it's not happening.

327
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now instead, the whole thing, the whole ritual. The whole thing is just lumped into grief response.

328
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you don't have to think about anymore. It's already got a category. It's already got a label and until you come back and something, it really deviates from that label, well then you and I'll talk about it again. But for now, you don't have to overthink that that's an odd grief response.

329
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.770
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so this is where me putting things in boxes helps

330
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.060
Lyndsey Lorett: In the box of ritual.

331
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.790
Lyndsey Lorett: Compassion.

332
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:07.710
Lyndsey Lorett: And

333
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I put a lock on that box.

334
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.320
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't have to open it again. I hope it doesn't happen again. But

335
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like it's gonna happen every time you're

336
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:19.560
Smoking

337
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, but one of the critical pieces. So, I, I've noticed you've got a little giggle. Now it's a little tiny bit later, just a little later. Yeah.

338
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice to know you're not going insane, right.

339
00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.390
Yes.

340
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

341
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That space that piece around

342
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm already grieving. I don't want to fight with these people that love that love Ali. I don't want to fight with them right that right it's

343
00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in there.

344
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.620
You don't have to fight.

345
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It just, it. I don't know how you grow up and I'm probably going to learn where this disdain for conflict comes from. But just because we assert our preference.

346
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To not go insane for someone else, because we have a need because we have a want does not mean we have to stuff it down and not speak it doesn't mean we have to go crazy for other people. We have a right

347
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a right to our own preferences.

348
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:34.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

349
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now watch this is this is the hard part.

350
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: They have a right to do this odd grieving process. I know that seems just while like How dare I say that, but the freedom that will come when you accept

351
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, I can't change them. This is what they're doing. I don't

352
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Bought you get to grieve, how you want to grieve. It doesn't look the same as the way they're doing it.

353
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This requires radical acceptance radical acceptance that this family system that you're a visitor in was constructed long before you got there.

354
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.110
Yes.

355
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand it.

356
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:24.960
Lyndsey Lorett: At home.

357
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:27.480
I

358
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Don't

359
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Have facts on their side. If it turns out that this this theory about them trying to take Ali, if that is the underlying motivation.

360
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That all you have is some limitations.

361
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:51.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I don't have any real reason that a judge would say, I'm going to take your time. I know that I know I'm a good mom.

362
00:36:52.260 --> 00:37:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course you do push you do. Okay, so it's about this confrontation. So let's just imagine because I got to see it in real time, right, because I pretended to be Lori and you just couldn't do it. She just danced around it and didn't just say

363
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm Lori. I can hear you talking through the cat. Is there something so little my smile.

364
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

365
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just something that you want to ask me.

366
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, right now, that wasn't mean spirited, but it's calling out this odd behavior. And I asked, is there something you want to ask me, or is there something you want to tell me

367
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's it. Now, let that be just have a little silence with that.

368
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say to Lori a your real label label label, you're a turkey for your passive aggressive that's so cruel habituated that into any of that, what I did was I named that odd behavior by saying right

369
00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I name it with my laugh.

370
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

371
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: He will see my shoulders.

372
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

373
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.050
He Lori.

374
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there something you want to ask me instead of cat.

375
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Is there something you want to tell me instead of the cat. I'm not sure he understands English

376
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice now I have access to a lot of playfulness. I have sarcasm. I have a lot of humor sort of readily available with my personality doesn't mean that's available for everyone.

377
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But just the idea that there's another way to identify this it's passive aggression that thing of talking through someone

378
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We name it and we say, Are you sure the cats, the best person to interpret those feelings, you know,

379
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We can make. But we name it.

380
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: We, we call it out obviously talking to the cat like what's up.

381
00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

382
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, now that way. I just did that won't that won't work. Probably that would probably feel very confrontational right

383
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that would work for some families when they're already punching physically punching each other. That would be nice.

384
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Every family's got their own way and you know best, actually how to navigate that I won't know you will. So that's why I'm giving you concepts and you do the finesse. You get to decide how can I safely label this

385
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Call you know

386
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's worth it. The little thing with the cat that might not be worth your time and you're going to get up and you're going to be like, Oh, good grief. What it goes ball.

387
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:44.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

388
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay that's passive aggression, maybe getting group, you can talk about it when passive aggression communication even like I've got a doozy. Listen to this one and then you

389
00:39:53.640 --> 00:40:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Go girl. They're trying to make you crazy. Don't do it. Don't do it. Hang on to yourself and you can come in group and you can talk about it. If there's one this one with the video and we meet love and

390
00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the one. This might be the one because look how far it pushed you

391
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:18.540
Lyndsey Lorett: It does. And then I feel like I the next day I go through the same thing.

392
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Like when I'm not high and I know what just happened wasn't right.

393
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.500
Lyndsey Lorett: And

394
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you call them out. Have you ever called them out.

395
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: On other days when you weren't hot

396
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.250
Lyndsey Lorett: No, no, I don't call never caught them out on anything.

397
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You just know it in your mind and you're like, Okay, I'm not crazy. I know what I saw, I saw when I saw, I heard what I heard.

398
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, okay.

399
00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if it's chemical

400
00:40:54.120 --> 00:41:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What if there's a chemical piece. What if marijuana does something chemically to that what normally is a really confident woman that knows herself knows her truth.

401
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But something chemically happens with that particular substance. It wouldn't surprise right that a paranoia is a pretty common like feature.

402
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know I'm trying to say like a memory. Forget about it.

403
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The pruning that happens there's actual facts. That's why I you know I don't want kids SMOKING WEED WHEN THEY'RE TEENAGERS because they're trying to learn new information their brains developing it has the same pruning effect as when

404
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know I'm 80 years old. If you can't retain information. It proves it says why right and like

405
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want people smoking weed when their kids because you're not a good learner and your little brains trying to grow. So it's not good. You're not gonna

406
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to learn new things you'd be stuck as a 15 year old, but that's lecture for another day. But some, but the marijuana does have an effect on memory.

407
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, clearly, something's going on.

408
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's all that's marijuana. We talked about communication. We talked about gaslighting passive aggression communication skills will we haven't talked about it.

409
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Trauma

410
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:10.950
Yeah.

411
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But how far do we have to analyze it to see that you have an 11 year old and have your deceased husband. Why would they keep putting that on

412
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Me asking why I can't believe I just did that.

413
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.530
Lyndsey Lorett: Good. Now you want to know like

414
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:29.790
Lyndsey Lorett: What's

415
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about that. But so the difference between me and that house. What do you think I would do.

416
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:48.930
Lyndsey Lorett: I think that you would you would be like y'all are no I think you would be loving and compassionate and say something is not right with this. You guys probably need to see a council.

417
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't dare

418
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say, Okay, this is really weird.

419
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I could have sworn we literally like I'm smelling the meatloaf cooking and watching this video and I just heard you guys giggle and then cry.

420
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Did we just do this last Tuesday.

421
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Week. This watching this video makes me sad. I'm not ready to watch it. I'm going to go in the other room.

422
00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:22.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

423
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm here with you.

424
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. See how I I named it

425
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't call anybody a name I

426
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Took myself and I left the room and I named it and I said, I'm not ready to watch this and

427
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not comfortable. In fact, I'll let you know if I want to watch this video you guys keep playing it if you want to. I just, it just struck me, you guys appear to be putting it on pause for me somehow and then finishing it. I don't want to watch it. It makes me really sad.

428
00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you guys love you guys so much, but I can't. It's such a heart. It's too hard for me. And I'm going to go take care of myself and I'm going to go pray or I'm going to meditate or I don't know what your self care routine is but

429
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That is one of his version of assertive what you might label confrontation.

430
00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:16.710
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

431
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You're telling me, that that would have resulted in Lori doing one. What would she do to me in the family system that's there. What she said to me.

432
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:34.890
Lyndsey Lorett: So she has a tendency to just like blow off the handle with anger in her voice gets a lot louder and

433
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:46.110
Lyndsey Lorett: Her husband and drew like just cater like they just stop whatever they're doing and focus on her, but she tends to lock herself in the bedroom.

434
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me let me understand this, what I just did, where I said I can't watch it and I think I was polite and I go exit and I go into another room, what would it what's happening outside the door.

435
00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.370
Lyndsey Lorett: yelling and screaming

436
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then what

437
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.360
Lyndsey Lorett: People go to their rooms and I want to address the day

438
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what does that mean to you.

439
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:20.550
Lyndsey Lorett: It means that something I did cause this like bowling ball effect of upsetting people

440
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

441
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

442
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:33.690
Lyndsey Lorett: yelling and screaming when I was in the room.

444
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Lori.

445
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't respect a boundary. That's why they're yelling and screaming

446
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Has nothing to do with you that has to do with individuals respecting and honoring that not everybody wants to eat a Dorito, sometimes people want to eat as a cheese it

447
00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sometimes I gotta have me some chocolate and other times I actually want those sour patches, like they make my cheeks hurt, but I want them. Okay, and you can't be trying to throw chocolate and you and I want the sour patch.

448
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, keep your chocolate.

449
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody has their preference and so fancy talk fancy talk is boundaries. Lori does not know how to handle when someone else's certs themselves.

450
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:30.870
Lyndsey Lorett: How to assert myself. So it's like the perfect combination of a

451
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: perfect marriage of you guys just you sacrificing yourself and now she's snow.

452
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: When we call bulldozing everyone so nomination.

453
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But you almost went crazy. Are you sure you want to do it again.

454
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.110
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I don't want to do it again.

455
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is what a therapist might call a boundary issue and the self talk is this

456
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: This a knee problem or a you problem. We don't say that out loud because I don't really piss people off.

457
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But you want to say to yourself. Go.

458
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There's actually no problem here. I just don't want to watch the video right there's so okay for her. It's not a me problem. I'm taking care

459
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: They obviously want to watch this video and run this really odd ritual through. I don't want to be here. So I'm going to gracefully sweetly because I already know. I don't have to teach you how to talk

460
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You already have this really sweet way about you. It's about you paying attention that you have a preference and it's worth you going and taking care of yourself.

461
00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to watch a video you get up and you say, you guys are watching this video again it's make it. I just get so emotional. I'm going to go, go take take a nap. Please don't pause it, I noticed you guys paused it last time, enjoy it. I can tell it means so much to you guys.

462
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: How is anybody. How does that have anything i'm just i'm honoring the fact that it means a lot to them.

463
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Um, but I'm going to take care of myself. They can exist at the same time, Lori.

464
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what her story is

465
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But her having a little hissy fit. That's what people are going to remember that this poor dear doesn't know how to emotionally regulate but you with your graceful exit is taking care of yourself clearly grieving.

466
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But you did it in a really beautiful way, and you're going to go do it. And you're going to do it again and again and again and they're going to get used to it and all of that controlling weird thing is going to get directed to somebody else and off of you.

467
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.000
Lyndsey Lorett: But when it comes down to actually doing it, Glenn.

468
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:53.340
It for it.

469
00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think I probably told you this. And it's true on, you're going to know it in real time. It's the breath that gets you there.

470
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:03.810
Lyndsey Lorett: It's the one

471
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Graph. It's the mindful breathing. It's the box breathing belly breathing diet dramatic reading whatever you want. As soon as and this is typically the sequence. So you're like, how in the moment, am I supposed to do that because you're reliving

472
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: A fight confrontation loss if I fight. I'll lose love I'll lose this relationship. I'll lose the support it happens instantaneous. I get that. But there's something communicating to you right away. And this is where we got to tap into.

473
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body registers something before all those words come up. It knows it. Now, I happen.

474
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're good. Yeah.

475
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:47.430
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm good.

476
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So I happen to register.

477
00:49:52.680 --> 00:50:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here, I have these little. The doctor will tell you what they are. I keep forgetting them every time, but I know exactly they pinches if somebody's taking little needles.

478
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: In here, if I have something that I wanted to say and couldn't when someone's judging or some I just have this weird I just look and feel this little pinch right here.

479
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:14.340
Yeah.

480
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I've spent a lot of time figuring that out. It used to be vague, I would get strep throat all the time. That would be on here. The like

481
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:23.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Wow. Yeah.

482
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a long time. And now I can feel it so sharp and I'm like, Okay. Something important really going on. And I brief.

483
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:33.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh,

484
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Which means, then I'm in a relaxed body Brett blood goes back to the fancy parts of my brain, not just the reptilian part goes into fantasy parts that have all those cool things that you and I are talking about a role plays our little mantras of, is this me problem you problem.

485
00:50:53.700 --> 00:51:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So boundary. Oh wait, what, oh, I have a right to my preference. Okay, Kevin. I don't know how to say it, I forgot how the heck did she say it.

486
00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.430
I can be sweet.

487
00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.670
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, the sweet item. Sweet.

488
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: comes naturally to me. Yeah, I can validate probably what why they're doing it for you guys.

489
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I know how much that video means to you. It's just really hard for me to watch it. You guys go ahead and watch it tonight. I'm going to take a nap. I'll see you tomorrow and you walk out.

490
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The body will know before you come up with words.

491
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll zap you. And so the our research is, where does it happen. Do you know where your body registers something's at stake.

492
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.730
Lyndsey Lorett: My stomach. Yep.

493
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.290
Lyndsey Lorett: That's the one. Yeah.

494
00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it duty. What does it feel like

495
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.430
Lyndsey Lorett: I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

496
00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowledge of

497
00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.960
Lyndsey Lorett: It. Yeah, yeah.

498
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When you feel that nasza. What's the next thing you do.

499
00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.210
Lyndsey Lorett: I cave and walk away.

500
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well that's what you've been

501
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:02.040
Lyndsey Lorett: Doing

502
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your therapist wants you to do.

503
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.830
Lyndsey Lorett: My therapist would like me to calmly assert myself.

504
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No you skipped it up. Nope, even before that.

505
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:14.550
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, sweetly.

506
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.360
Go.

507
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't I teach you belly breathing.

508
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.680
You did.

509
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Leave it or not. I'm telling you it's magic in there.

510
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's no bad number I'm talking to you about the brain.

511
00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Is

512
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a philosophy we store information in this mushy thing inside our skull.

513
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Give we need some blood

514
00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

515
00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's covered in cortisol, you're not going to remember it unless you have a relaxed funny, you won't remember it.

516
00:52:51.480 --> 00:53:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to do what you always did, you're going to respond with a threat response, you're not going to remember the sweet calm it, you're going to get locked in paralysis. You're just going to lock up

517
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The breath will give you memory.

518
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:18.060
Lyndsey Lorett: So do you think that in the moment I'm not breathing and so it's not registering in the head. No.

519
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:19.230
I think

520
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the way of course you're breathing, if you'd be dead right

521
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you're doing is you're breathing short and shallow

522
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not doing the diet for matic breathing. Now I taught you that right you into

523
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:33.510
Lyndsey Lorett: No, no.

524
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So remember this other type of

525
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Reading these the air goes low. Hopefully it's not causing you pain, but look what it's doing. And the very thing that's upsetting you, is the stomach. It's the one sending the message you know what we're going to do.

526
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: All that arrow is going to smash down on that. So making we're going to send that message up the Vegas nerve.

527
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:51.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Hey,

528
00:53:52.050 --> 00:54:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We're okay. We're okay gotta send that message up to the brain and say we're okay. It's okay. Let's get some of that blood that's in our biceps and in our thighs, let's get it over to

529
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Other parts of our brains to the pole, the different parts of the brain stored knowledge on the left side.

530
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is communicating with the emotional intensity of the right side, the executive function in the frontal lobe is communicating. We can see the present moment. We can look into the future. All my gosh, the brain is of this amazing thing.

531
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I want everybody working together. I don't want to have to impulsively. I won't betray myself. I will not go crazy and in this moment.

532
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I can validate, I can validate this family, I can say you guys

533
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I know how much this video means to you.

534
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm gonna let you watch it. I need to kind of pull away for a little while, but go ahead and run it all the way through. Don't wait for me enjoy your evening K. I'll see you guys later.

535
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't remember that stuff.

536
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're in a stressed body.

537
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When you stay tense. Keep sending the message that response.

538
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that response.

539
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It may seem really silly that that a therapist who telling you to relax the body but

540
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It will work.

541
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if you can, because notice it took a few times freak kept saying no.

542
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel your body. That's the first step is you're going to feel the gut. Turn the gut knows because right that's where intuition lives. That's where

543
00:55:44.040 --> 00:56:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just an amazing metaphor. So the gut turns gets gets its najah and the message to you something important to say we do the belly breathing and then you're going to remember all validate. I'll just speak sweet to the people around me, and then I'm going to take care of myself.

544
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.200
Lyndsey Lorett: I like that. I like that a lot.

545
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How is that offensive. That's not offensive.

546
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.750
Lyndsey Lorett: That's not offensive now.

547
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:12.810
Lyndsey Lorett: And the same

548
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue. It's weird little antics and a lorry will have her tantrum. But that's not your problem to solve, and it certainly is touch your fault.

549
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.180
Lyndsey Lorett: Certainly it's not

550
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course not.

552
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:53.190
Lyndsey Lorett: And I kind of just put some stuff out there like I feel like you guys have seen the show before, or the video and I you guys are really making me feel uncertain and I was crying and upset and

553
00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:58.920
Lyndsey Lorett: So they know something's going on and they know that I'm talking to you.

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I can't teach everything, all in one session.

556
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got, it's okay, I've got great ideas about what to do with something you just said they make you feel, and I feel like I can already tell in the language that you're using inside your mind. It's a sorry a setup.

Gwenevere Abriel: There's there's ways out of it. There's yeah there's ways out so

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, dude. So this quiet this this need for boundaries is very present with everyone on the planet right now we've got to set them over and over and over and over and we'll talk more about the importance of boundaries. We'll talk about communication.

576
00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There are really lean really exacting ways to communicate that leave no room for question about what you're going through. You do not have to go crazy.

Gwenevere Abriel: And there's lots more to do.

597
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you get that part done you'll be able to sort of hone in on. How's my body doing something's going on something important going on. Okay.

598
