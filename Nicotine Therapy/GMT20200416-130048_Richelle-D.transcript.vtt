Richelle Direny: I'm now in when it comes on to the Suboxone because I, one of the things that I do find that a lot of people so that also helps with pain. So then you develop

321
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:28.650
Richelle Direny: Then you become where you like you really need this box. And so working towards. Eventually we have locks on is not an option because it has replaced

322
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.960
Richelle Direny: What the plane pills will do for you. What is your goal for that is concerned.

323
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.210
Rhonda S: On

324
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.450
Richelle Direny: This is one thing to just want to say

325
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.170
Yeah.

326
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.180
Rhonda S: I'm helping me to get office of awesome Sunday to

327
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.400
Rhonda S: Really want, I don't want the pain down anything

328
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.430
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you want to

329
00:29:54.570 --> 00:30:00.300
Richelle Direny: Your you want to be able to meet independent on every anything, just to be able to

330
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:15.450
Richelle Direny: Me. Now, given that it's all from a medical point where for you with the the the beginning 13 years ago with starting on the pain meds. It was on pain related

331
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:26.070
Richelle Direny: And this is where you have to be realistic in your goal is, that's the reason why I says, what does that mean for you. Because I think when we say we want something

332
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:37.410
Richelle Direny: We don't really look, you don't really take into consideration all that comes with it and we'll go into it. We just make this blanket statement.

333
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:55.500
Richelle Direny: So when it comes on. So given that you were on it. What you're saying that you were on it because of pain, you're not on it because of your don't past trauma pass this like other people who have different reasons why they became dependent to something

334
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.640
Rhonda S: Yeah, I am. I'm on because I know if

335
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.260
Rhonda S: If

336
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.400
Richelle Direny: You're breaking it.

337
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:14.970
Rhonda S: Actually blocks and Johnson heels and I said and done that, then I would stay on the ideals.

338
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.130
Richelle Direny: You were breaking. You said you said actually the something and then he said,

339
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.990
Rhonda S: Actually that

340
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.410
Rhonda S: On Suboxone because I don't want to be on the ballot box and

341
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.290
Rhonda S: I definitely be on high heels.

342
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.560
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, so you have replaced

343
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:46.080
Richelle Direny: One, the dependency on the kind of pain pills that you were on. Now when you were on the pain pills. How many pain pills were you taking

344
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.080
Rhonda S: Um, about father your

345
00:31:53.730 --> 00:32:00.000
Rhonda S: Father, that actually go down and then stop that still wasn't enough.

346
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.760
Richelle Direny: Okay, now

347
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.780
Richelle Direny: When you speak with the doctor.

348
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:30.720
Richelle Direny: When, in terms of whatever your pain when it's related to your pain, what has the doctor said to you, is it something like is it an underlying condition like what is causing your pain and in identifying what is causing your pain. Can you live.

349
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:41.580
Richelle Direny: One day become pain free or can the whatever is causing your pain if it's through surgery or what have you, like, what, what is from the medical perspective.

350
00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:46.470
Rhonda S: What does the doctor had surgery, but I won't have it because

351
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.110
Richelle Direny: What is causing you put

352
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.120
Rhonda S: The my back and and

353
00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:05.970
Rhonda S: It would be my back and they have requested surgery. And so no, because a lot of people had is a lot of shit out of stuff comes with it like a paralyzed for one and I

354
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.100
Rhonda S: Want that

355
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.080
Richelle Direny: So you fear the idea of if you had surged back surgery, you can compare

356
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.610
Richelle Direny: Yes.

357
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.160
Rhonda S: Okay if I had it. I will be

358
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.290
Rhonda S: pain free. So if they said

359
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:20.640
Now,

360
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:28.530
Richelle Direny: I know, understanding that, yes. Other people has have become paralyzed. Now, when you have had. Have you had

361
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:40.170
Richelle Direny: A in depth in forums getting educated on your type of surgery not other people's surgery or what they've gone through what you are, because

362
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:47.790
Richelle Direny: You're, you're you. You're as an individual is different. Your situations circumstances is different. You can have back surgery.

363
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:58.680
Richelle Direny: You come on fire. I have back surgery article in Paradise and he can happen. So in having this very informative conversation with the doctor.

364
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:09.150
Richelle Direny: Did he say that in granted, they cannot promise and they can't swear for anything, though some doctors think they can. But in having this very informative conversation with Dr.

365
00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:17.310
Richelle Direny: When you express your thoughts about or your fears surrounding having back surgery.

366
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.940
Richelle Direny: What was the feedback you guys

367
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:31.620
Rhonda S: Tell me himself that I would have there was that city pursuits that that I want to walk so

368
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.430
Rhonda S: So it's a high percent

369
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.140
Richelle Direny: That's a pretty high percent

370
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.450
Rhonda S: Yeah, no.

371
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:45.960
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, but if you had the surgery, you would be pain free.

372
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:47.340
Rhonda S: Well,

373
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:57.630
Richelle Direny: So in this case, you're up. Not to have the surgery. So then therefore without the surgery you pretty much will have to manage your pain.

374
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:03.270
Richelle Direny: And so right now you're using the Suboxone to manage the pain.

375
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:18.180
Rhonda S: Well so lot about. I know if I had the Suboxone I'll be on the painkillers, because I I was addicted to Springfield, and I know that was because I took more than I was supposed to

376
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:24.420
Rhonda S: When I was in a clinic shut down about them off the street.

377
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:40.020
Richelle Direny: So with I'm going to shut down you bought the most of the street. So the intensity of the pain was so great that you have to take more than the required amount to subside to at least get

378
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:45.750
Rhonda S: Yo, yo, I'll take a nap for the pain and I just took more than I was posting

379
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.540
Richelle Direny: Did. That's what I mean. That's what I mean. If you

380
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:56.610
Richelle Direny: Have your pain if they say, take one. You're like, now I got to take to because to helps me better with the pain. That's what I guess what I mean. Um,

381
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:06.330
Richelle Direny: So when you think about your goal is to eventually if the doctor is saying, the only way for you to come out of the pain.

382
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:20.400
Richelle Direny: Or not be dependent upon any kind of pain medication is to have surgery. And if you're saying surgery comes with a 75% chance of loss in mobility.

383
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:41.010
Richelle Direny: Your face with two things. So realistically speaking when you're looking at a goal. You have to think about a realistic goal because based on what you're saying from the medical provider. He is saying that you will never be out of pain. You can only manage your pain. So then therefore

384
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.190
Richelle Direny: What has he recommended to help you in managing your pain.

385
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.310
Rhonda S: The sergeant as it

386
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.800
Richelle Direny: But outside of no remember

387
00:36:53.010 --> 00:37:01.740
Richelle Direny: They said surgery, he rejected that he says well you could take a medication, but then you're saying, I don't want to be dependent upon a medication.

388
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:15.840
Richelle Direny: What is an alternative or something that I can add to help me would rehabilitation, help me like hockey not occupational therapy, physical therapy, is there something that can be implemented.

389
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:27.150
Richelle Direny: In conjunction with the pain medication to help to be able to manage because right now. Your goal of care is how can I manage my pain.

390
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:35.760
Rhonda S: I never thought that way. I mean, he didn't say anything except for just physical therapy.

391
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.540
Richelle Direny: And have you ever. Have you ever done the physical therapy.

392
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:40.440
Rhonda S: Yeah.

393
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.210
Richelle Direny: Yeah. How was that for you.

394
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.190
Rhonda S: It.

395
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.440
Rhonda S: Didn't seem to help me anybody I see the thing that it does so.

396
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:55.650
Richelle Direny: No physical therapy. I hear everyone say physical therapy which were more pain than what you went in. Yeah.

397
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.000
Rhonda S: Yeah yeah

398
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:10.800
Richelle Direny: And a lot of it, it has to be aggressive. You have to, you know, feel the pain in order to get through it, but oftentimes we feel so much pain going into it that you just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel because

399
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.460
Richelle Direny: Right now.

400
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.560
Richelle Direny: Is just its pitch black. So

401
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.280
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I can't see any kind of life, but

402
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:30.600
Richelle Direny: When you're thinking about a goal. You're thinking of what you actually want to work on just making like a general blanket statement of I want to be independent of this particular thing.

403
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:43.980
Richelle Direny: That's fine. And that's a nice goal, but is it a realistic goal, is it a goal that you're never going to be able to attain. Is it a goal that you're never realistically ever going to be able to reach simply because

404
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.930
Richelle Direny: The things that requires for you to get to that goal.

405
00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:58.890
Richelle Direny: It's like, it's like if someone is saying, you know, like those people who do the hurdles, like they're running a race in the hurdle and you have to jump over this bar.

406
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:07.590
Richelle Direny: You are not at the height and the level in your legs are not long enough for you to really go over this hurdle, but you're like,

407
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:16.200
Richelle Direny: I think I can. I think I can. I think a kid and somebody is coming. I know you can't. No, you can't. You too short. Your, your legs is too short. It's never going to be able to work.

408
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:26.130
Richelle Direny: You have to come up with another way to get her to reach this goal. And that's what I'm basically saying is that realistically, I mean,

409
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:39.630
Richelle Direny: It's nice that you want to be able to have that independence and I mean I am in support of that for you to be independent of anything. However, for you, not for everybody else. But for you.

410
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:52.020
Richelle Direny: Is that a realistic goal in comparison to work to in addition to managing your pain, you have to take these medication.

411
00:39:53.610 --> 00:40:00.330
Richelle Direny: What in taking the medication. There are other things that you need to do. So you have high blood pressure.

412
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:06.690
Richelle Direny: You don't like the idea and concept of taking a pill every day to manage your blood pressure right you don't like the idea

413
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:15.720
Richelle Direny: But realistically speaking from a medical standpoint, what is going on inside of your body. Unfortunately, I know you don't want to pop a pill, but you have to

414
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:25.440
Richelle Direny: However, instead of taking instead of the doctor say I have to increase your dosage, or you have to take more you have to pop more pills per day.

415
00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:34.260
Richelle Direny: What the doctor is saying is you could take this medication and you can stick with once a day tab. But these are all the things that you have to do.

416
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:43.200
Richelle Direny: To be able to keep your blood pressure at a stable level where we don't have to implement other things to manage the stability of your blood pressure.

417
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:54.090
Richelle Direny: You understand I'm saying, and that's and I'm not necessarily encouraging that you continue to take the meds. I'm just saying from a medical perspective.

418
00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:02.640
Richelle Direny: Are you going to work with the medical provider or are you going to work against the grain, because then all you're going to do is may create more have it for yourself.

419
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:09.540
Richelle Direny: So when thinking about a goal. And this is something to think about. So when we meet in two weeks, three weeks.

420
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:20.520
Richelle Direny: Um, when we meet to discuss like your goals. It is to take that piece of it into perspective to say, you know, I want to eventually

421
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:25.410
Richelle Direny: Come off, but then hey, if the doctor is saying, well, you're always going to be in pain.

422
00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:33.420
Richelle Direny: Because I understand, like, you know, you want to come out of pain. You want to come off these pain pills. All right, well, have the back surgery because of what was going on with your back.

423
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:42.750
Richelle Direny: And you have to didn't say, Do I really want to take this chance. Um, and have the surgery. So I'm not dependent upon anything

424
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:56.520
Richelle Direny: Well, no, I rather just manage the pain. So having an informed decision with the doctor, with a physical therapist with everybody else and say, How can I manage the pain. What are some things that I can do by myself.

425
00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:11.880
Richelle Direny: To manage the pain without getting to the point where I'm not abusing this or I become so dependent on the Suboxone because anything can be abused Tylenol can be abused, anything that you get can be abused.

426
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:20.490
Richelle Direny: Well, it's like my big My little son he abuses, the little gummy vitamins, why you think he did these little gummy cuz I can't

427
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:26.550
Richelle Direny: Play candy right now, but he already took it already for the day.

428
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.320
Richelle Direny: And so you have to monitor it.

429
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.440
Richelle Direny: So, anything can be abused, it's

430
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:33.810
Richelle Direny: A matter of being aware, like what

431
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:39.720
Richelle Direny: What is your goal. And let's discuss the realistic piece of that goal. Okay.

432
00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:41.760
Richelle Direny: So,

433
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:52.650
Richelle Direny: So something to think about. But we're, we're talking about it a little bit more get into depth and then we're going to create something when it comes on to your treatment plan of what your goal is.

434
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.890
Of

435
00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.100
Richelle Direny: Managing your pain.

436
00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.160
Richelle Direny: Okay.

437
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.030
Richelle Direny: Do you have any questions for me.

438
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:05.640
Rhonda S: Oh,

439
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.430
Richelle Direny: No. Okay.

440
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:17.790
Richelle Direny: All right then. So I already scheduled you, for I believe it was the sixth at nine if we have to make

442
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.350
