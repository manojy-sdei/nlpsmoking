28
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And using I messages or something. I don't, I'm not a tech person. So I'm just doing the best I can hear.

39
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was a weird for me. So what it means is if you send me a message, you won't know if I received it because also like I can. I'm looking right now at, yours, yours got here at 5:02am

40
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.120

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

46
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So communication. So sit there for a second communication just took 50% hit, it's going to suffer and I really like having this nice flow that I have with my clients, it's still frustrating for me and it may end up that you're a little frustrated, too. I won't mean to be

47
00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But it means an increase in email. Maybe if if you get a call from bright heart health, like Angelina, is my assigned care navigator

48
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I, you know, so maybe she'll call and say, hey, Gwen, blah blah blah, is just confirming appointments. Do you listen to voicemails ever. Some people just never check up I

50
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:26.010

142
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Hmm, let me get in this note because I want to understand that more

143
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That surprises me.

144
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.620
Shaun W.: I don't know what it's just like these, like, little shifts morning

145
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it primarily happened around

146
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.410
Shaun W.: Can't stand my mama.

147
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

148
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.210
Shaun W.: Yeah.

149
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you've got it.

150
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.720
Shaun W.: I was wonder if she had like Tourette's or something. But she has to see like like messed up things to people all day long. I guess you can't help it, or something like it's it's weird.

151
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But have there been settings where you've seen her like be super polite to a neighbor that she wanted something from

152
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:38.310
Shaun W.: Yeah, even me. She's doing to be nice, sometimes, but she's Weird. Weird.

153
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no pattern to it. There's no predictable way.

154
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see, when is your next review, do I need to do a treatment plan review.

155
00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's interesting.

156
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though we may know why someone's doing what they're doing, it's still, it's just so painful to hear so much criticism and negativity.

157
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.110
Shaun W.: Yeah, I told him.

158
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.180
Shaun W.: I said, now you're always negative. What do

159
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.390
Shaun W.: You also really bugs me.

160
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she have any psychological mindedness to her where she can sort of have humility and say, yeah, I kinda I am Bad Company. Today I'm going to kind of stay in my room and just no awareness.

161
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.010
Oh,

162
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.270
Shaun W.: They were going over there. What, what, why are you secluded there someone in your family kitchen.

163
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm not one to really share. As you've noticed about my personal life, so that will remain

164
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: With Shawna want to take in that it sounds like you're you're concerned and kind of want to know what

165
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.210
Shaun W.: Are your right

Shaun W.: Everybody's actually, your kids, your kids are good.

169
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: At yeah everybody's okay

170
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:55.890
But thank you

171
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Know I i probably

172
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: About the only thing I said one time and group was I said I said it last week actually. It was really cute because people like people like, oh, she's going to tell a story about herself. She's gonna talk about herself. Wait for it, wait for it, and I was like, Nah, I'm not gonna tell you why.

173
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: When I said I said I'm feeling sad. I said I have, I feel sad and and then of course I crack some jokes and

174
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's my coping mechanism. Right. I use humor and sarcasm and levity. Yeah.

175
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.400
Shaun W.: Me too, me too.

176
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this law. Yeah. And I said, in a little I go a little over the top with some attention seeking behavior. So I said, let's let's take, let's take the focus off of me.

177
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.060
Shaun W.: My wife, you just told me that everything being funny, Sean.

178
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you know what, we our mind actually takes in information, much, much better when we're in that state of finding things humorous.

179
00:14:54.270 --> 00:15:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: light hearted, because then we're not in this right perceived threat. Um, so it's actually a good mindset to take in new information, it'll get in there when we're in kind of our giggle.

180
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me just see. I think it was the 12 so I think we're good for now as far as reviewing your specific goals, although that's not true because 528. So why don't I BUY ALL RIGHT. A LITTLE statement for each of these I want success in life, last time we spoke

181
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You were working target mapping okay to spontaneously this week, so just your own assessment went because, again, this is your defined goal. I want to succeed in life is your goal.

182
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about kind of where you're you're seeing some progress in that

183
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:53.460
Shaun W.: All right, now I'm not seeing progress. I'm just stuck where I'm at. So I'm just waiting for them to get hired on, give me a raise, and they should that's coming up pretty soon. So once you get up.

184
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, looking forward to getting raised, we could say

185
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, now wait a minute. I'm wondering if you're minimizing come you have kept this job you do see that right like

186
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You told me straight up when we first met, I don't like jobs for long.

187
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're staying with this one. Don't you think that's part of how you succeed is not having to constantly trying to re higher than de de then rehired of of it right, it throws us off.

188
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're spending money to your there's no way to save during those periods of time. So I think I happen to think that you're taking an amazing step with the succeed in life by keeping this job but but you don't see it that way.

189
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.460
Shaun W.: No.

190
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.660
Shaun W.: I just think I'm kind of stuck. Well, good job.

191
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So succeed is is it truly about the income like ASEAN I make this amount of income, then I'll be successful or is it about being living in my own place like if you had a

192
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Measure, which is why others.

193
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:58.920
Okay.

194
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So when. How about I go like this when I get

195
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: My

196
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.970
Shaun W.: Own fighter for you within the next week three to four weeks or should be a mom, please.

197
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what I'm writing but this has to be your kind of wording okay when I get my own place that will be, is it a sign of success. I'm succeeding. How would you work that yeah

198
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.220
Shaun W.: I'll feel like I'm succeeding days.

199
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's that. There we go. I that will feel

200
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm succeeding.

201
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So all I see Sean is just you're minimizing what you're doing a

202
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.230
Shaun W.: Meeting shoulder criminal you're minimizing your involvement.

203
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless I'm either me then.

204
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're, you're minimizing the work that it takes. Look how close you are three weeks, a month, two months away from getting my own place. You already have the car. Dude, you have, they have this job when I'm when I say minimize

205
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Your yourself props for

206
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: How far you've come. Okay, this is all it takes, it's not great big magical thing. It's just this one day at a time step up show up for work, man, we just show up.

207
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what, it's not as bad as I thought. Guess what, hey,

208
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm getting into groove at work. Hey, I had a kind of a fun interaction with some of the days over and then you go do it again and you eat you hang with the people. And then you get up and do it again. It's nothing fancy. Right.

209
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.630
Shaun W.: Yeah.

210
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's going to get you what you want.

211
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that that race thing.

212
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, is this the place that's going to keep you for another like year. So do you think

213
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.040
Shaun W.: No, no, keep it. What if I get hired on know dokey me forever.

214
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this could be

215
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:55.740
Shaun W.: What it is, I worked for at Tim service they had this company I worked for only HIRES TO THE GYM service. They don't hire, no one like you come and ask for a job, you have to go to the service.

216
00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:04.920
Shaun W.: I went to the company and asked her job and making me think, said, hey, we only hire to this Tim service. So I went through this Tim service and see when I get hired on I'll get a $2 and 50 cent raise

217
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I like that.

218
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.820
Shaun W.: So that's what I'm waiting on and especially once I get hired on man. I'll be living comfortable in my own spot.

219
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now when did they say they're going to do that performance review and assess you

220
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.020
Shaun W.: Oh, they said they're gonna do that pretty soon. They just said soon you're gonna be hired on soon.

221
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I don't like some, like, see I need specificity, but you're comfy with

222
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes me nuts. I got. I'm like, well, if you break that down for me and weeks, please.

223
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.460
Shaun W.: They don't, they don't say tell you the exact time because I don't think they even though they just one day.

224
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can tolerate that uncertainty, you're okay with that just was soon.

225
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.370
Shaun W.: So it's I think about luck. Sometimes I think. Damn, I work hard and most mass. What if they don't hire me on

226
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.790
Shaun W.: You know, I mean, because there's people that have been there longer than me to

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's play that one. Let I'm gonna, I want to play with that one a little bit

230
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What if they don't hire me on, I want to look into that. I've got increased anger retail know what if don't hire me. Okay.

235
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

236
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.830
Shaun W.: We started talking yesterday. Oh yes, just

237
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.080
Okay.

238
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

239
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's daughter, and are you are you. But before you do the defensive part of already, you know, no. Do you see that she wants more of you, you can you hear that part of it though.

240
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay, that's a good thing, that's a positive thing wanting you to write because we're the parent. So we do that, we're the ones that reach out

241
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not on our children to to sort of take care of us, but rather, we're going to do the reaching out, we're going to connect with them. That's just what we're going to do.

242
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's a good thing that she wants it. That's a great sign

243
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You taking that in and not, you're not getting defensive by that or are you getting a little hurt. No, okay, because that's a compliment to the relationship to the trust that you've built in that she's looking forward to hearing from you more.

244
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what about a son.

245
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.840
Shaun W.: Oh, last time I talked to him. We played online video games for like three hours.

246
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

247
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how you guys kind of connect right

248
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.330
Shaun W.: Yeah, we just jump on

249
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know there's there's a poet, that I won't read your poem don't have a panic.

250
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And basically, my Angelo, and she basically says you know when it's all said and done, you know we we won't remember the things that people did for us, but we will remember how we felt

251
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Around the people in our life. So your son gets to feel your presence. He gets to feel the playful nature he gets to feel connection, whether you do or you don't buy her right it's how he feels around you that will linger for years to come.

252
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that thought.

253
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:57.900
Shaun W.: He's my son, the good kitty works, it works. He just graduated already are working full time, but he worked his whole high school like part time in the same company.

254
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:06.240
Shaun W.: Like three years I think worked and then now he's up he's working full time she's doing good. I'm really proud of him.

255
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.040
Shaun W.: I just wants to be

256
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.110
Shaun W.: Wants to be a real estate agent.

257
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, sweet.

258
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to be able to fund this graduation.

259
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.340
Shaun W.: That these they were telling me that they're not. They don't know if they're having one

260
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

261
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:32.490
Shaun W.: Because I asked my P. O. If I could go and he said that you're gonna give you off the ankle bracelets. I'm doing good in that that once I got the English I might be able to go, but he told me that they don't you know through how

262
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people's are cancelled.

263
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're putting up

264
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Like banners in front of their house and sort of acknowledging you know what a way to go. And then whatever anything but also there are doing things through through teleconference where people are able to have ceremonies.

265
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll be able to pull something off like that.

266
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You could see like a live stream. I know it seems crazy, but at least you're they're going away.

267
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope they do something like that for them. Our kids are being robbed of these these sort of important memories.

268
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.650
Shaun W.: My nephew graduated to my nephew here who graduated from Sandia

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.470
Now,

270
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:27.990
Shaun W.: Yeah, so it's against him. I never had the prom or wins for that because I went to the boys school, but also to Kenyan I didn't get out. So I was eating. So we didn't have problem.

271
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.730
Shaun W.: And I bet I regret that I take, and I really wish I went through all that

272
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:41.310
Shaun W.: Because I end up marrying my my middle schools. We are like we're together since middle school and have married and having two kids.

273
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Let's, um, let's turn to stop eating goals now and I'm going to go to

274
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: More relevant stuff right to not that it's on relevant, but rather what you started with, which had to do with I'm noticing increased irritability, kind of, you know,

275
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:06.390
Like

276
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that.

277
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.700
Shaun W.: Yeah I noticed it like it's been getting bad like

278
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:14.040
Shaun W.: Like

279
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:22.470
Shaun W.: The other day I was one of the points of my or my toothbrush, and I was getting my two boys, I gotta go to work and they're getting showered is my little niece. My nephew little homie.

280
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.080
Shaun W.: You go now as well and see nothing but in my head around what places for fish.

281
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you remember any of the skills that you've learned here.

282
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:41.070
Shaun W.: No, you know what the other day when I was driving. I was feeling like anxiety real bad and I started doing really well. I was writing

283
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I

284
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.230
Shaun W.: Was like trying to

285
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.140
Shaun W.: calm myself down because I was getting my bad anxiety.

286
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Did in through the nose, big belly breath and try and hold it and then really intentionally deflating that balloon and the sort of stomach deflate develop deflate.

287
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And really focusing on how the body feels. And did you notice that the intensity of the Ellery elevated heart rate sweaty palms tight chest it decrease

288
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:17.940
Shaun W.: Yeah, I was basically trying to control my breathing to control my heart rate, like I do in groupies. When we do Murphy's you got to control your heartbeat to keep going with your breathing.

289
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:25.170
Shaun W.: And that helps. Well, that's what I did. Yeah, so I just started doing my breathing like to like to slow my heart down

290
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. And did you then. So that's what we call sort of a bottom up that's using the body to regulate the mind you sent a contradictory message to the brain, saying, hey, it's all good.

291
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody's trying to kill us here. You can chill. You don't have to have a racing heart. No one's coming after us. They're not threatening life and limb.

292
00:26:46.230 --> 00:27:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And then curious. Did you do any of the top down, which is like a self talk a mantra, something that you said to yourself to make it okay that you'd not whatever the fear was what else you had money. What do you think to yourself,

293
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.420
Shaun W.: Yeah, I do that all the time. I talked to myself all the time to call me.

294
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:03.870
Shaun W.: Right now.

295
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:11.370
Shaun W.: I'm tripping. I've been doing that for years. That's what it's helped me calm down a lot.

296
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.770
Shaun W.: Just talking to myself. Yep.

297
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So well, so I'm tripping right so is the translation of that, like I'm blowing something this big into this big, is that what tripping. Okay.

298
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.270
Shaun W.: Beautiful. So hey, are you know my homies doing that and screen as long. He has a traumatic brain injury starts blowing up to

299
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.920
Shaun W.: The reasonable time I told me. What are you doing,

300
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.720
Shaun W.: You to chill out.

301
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's that part of the brain that meant that inhibits impulses, he's gonna have a really hard.

302
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Time.

303
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it like, did he have yeah right here. Oh.

304
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.380
Shaun W.: Right here across the top of his forehead.

305
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no.

306
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.360
Shaun W.: So what does that mean, because if it is i is all like gone

307
00:27:54.750 --> 00:28:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so he's probably it's affected the prefrontal cortex, which is where we really do need to have that impulse control. So you were you and I

308
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We might say,

309
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and we might have a pulse thought he probably will. Like, that's disgusting. You know, he's going to say it before his

310
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Frontal Lobe comes online and says, okay, that would be rude. That's going to cause a conflict and he can't inhibit the impulse to pump something throw something

311
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: He's going to have maybe a hard time with that and and this bloviation and it's just as soon as you have a thought it's getting said, so I don't know if that's what's happening for him.

312
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:45.000
Shaun W.: Yeah, just threw me out. I was like, is also, you gotta Chill out, man. He started freaking out over nothing like his phone. He broke it.

313
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:51.810
Shaun W.: He's calling his mom every day, every call bars. Are you sure it's coming today or sure it's going to do is a mom's by one committee I was a urinal down. So why do you keep doing that.

314
00:28:53.400 --> 00:29:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So here, so there might be. And I don't know if it's you did use point to the left side, where'd you go just now. Show me what you where

315
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.660
Shaun W.: Where is his car is on the right side.

316
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's on the road. Right. Yeah.

317
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I will tell you I'm not a neuroscientist, but

318
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's the hippocampus on both the left and right side, left side. Typically that's why I talk about the most. I talked about stored memory over in her hippocampus, it's

319
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's on both sides. So on the right side is more of the emotional memory. So what might be happening to him as maybe he's only

320
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not getting just the stored knowledge with no emotional intensity, he might just be activated from a really a memory of

321
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The Oh my gosh, the fear response of whatever I don't have my phone on my phone. I don't have it. It's this tight little loop that just stays over there. When I my phone is we offer this would be awful. This is the awful. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

322
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's not going to remembering plain and simple.

323
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I already have a plan. I already have. And that's the sequencing that

324
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.880
Shaun W.: shows exactly what's going on.

325
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So that's the left side. So just stored knowledge sits on the left side of the brain where

326
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We have stored information and sequencing. This is where we kind of think of our just like it's just the facts, please that sits over here on the left side, the right side is the emotional side that feels like all the emotion of fret and anxiety and what have you.

327
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So it sounds like he's that's just getting really activated on

328
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm so sorry.

329
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.720
Shaun W.: But for you. Hey Mommy, I grew up with the first grade.

330
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can see you can see for him. Oh, that's, that's just his brain injury happening right now. You can step back from it. You won't pop off with him right

331
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.580
Shaun W.: Because I already know. I'll just walk away. Are you always on Mr.

332
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.300
Yeah.

333
00:30:50.100 --> 00:31:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good, good, good. Now I wonder what the differences between him and when your mom's talks, what happens, how we can kind of use that same

334
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Note, I'm saying

335
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:11.640
Shaun W.: Nobody's like she just talk shit out of nowhere for no reason. I can't explain it. Like, I can't even explain to you what she does right like

336
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:19.290
Shaun W.: It's weird, like out of nowhere to just start talking shit about something or so about you and she'll try to get real personal for no reason. She does it all day long.

337
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:29.550
Shaun W.: And then everybody anybody to go there. And everybody's like, Damn she's crazy. Like, that's weird. Like, I don't understand why she does it. It's, it's, she's very hateful and mean

338
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.100
Shaun W.: I can't explain it on

339
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: As it been worsening or is it been like your whole life.

340
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.150
Shaun W.: I think it's gotten better because you don't drink.

341
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Better

342
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.330
Shaun W.: You don't even know I can't even explain you would blow your mind.

343
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.740
Shaun W.: She gets cancelled security and mental disability.

344
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: They survived this

345
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.610
Shaun W.: She is. Whoa. My whole family's photo done the head every kid that she's raised his

346
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:04.290
Shaun W.: Arms.

347
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.690
Shaun W.: What am I see sisters was a prostitute 16

348
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: One all across the whole country.

349
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.610
Shaun W.: She blond hair, blue eyes. She's pretty. She's going across the whole country prostitute.

350
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.810
Shaun W.: The Feds game garter stuff.

351
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: In your family history. Is there anyone that you know she has a history of having been touched in appropriately.

352
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:42.960
Shaun W.: That says so. You know why she's told me stories where people like my parents, friends have tried to hit on her life. And she was older, like, I don't know. She has, she's told me stories. Yeah, most of them only a girl knows what the go to like

353
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.560
Shaun W.: Things like, does he see a car.

354
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it isn't actually boys boys get hurt to

355
00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't just happen.

356
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.940
Shaun W.: Yeah, no, that's great. I told my little niece, all the time. So anyway, touch, you can

357
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.670
Shaun W.: Tell someone told my children.

358
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And right in the moment, you know. No, no matter, no matter if they say, I'll hurt all hurt someone in your family all her to get out.

359
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.180
Shaun W.: All you gotta do is tell me they ain't gonna hurt, nobody

360
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. Well that's typically what what folks do is they say, well, if you tell then I'll hurt.

361
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:34.080
Shaun W.: You know, what if someone did that. I don't think I would call the police. And I think that I'll get acquitted after I killed him.

362
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, well,

363
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Take this conversation.

364
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:52.200
Shaun W.: You know why because I seen a man a drunk driver hit him in his car and killed his kid. He went to the man's house shot and killed in and took it to trial, the jury agree with him and let him and acquitted him.

365
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: In New Mexico.

366
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.350
Shaun W.: Know in the United States.

367
00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.840
Shaun W.: Like Connecticut or somewhere.

368
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah y'all would go down here. I've heard so many stories about New Mexico, la, oh, I'm like,

369
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to try and drive the speed limit almost got to check it out. I was like, well, I'm gonna do

370
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.090
Shaun W.: You know what they do, they, they, they, they are they are

371
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:17.340
Shaun W.: You talking about

372
00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I think in a trap me set up a trap to catch me speed on

373
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.630
Shaun W.: The team at the cost of the some of the columns.

374
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Out, they did something

375
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.720
Shaun W.: You don't

376
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.370
Shaun W.: Check this out. I'll be looking at our friend. I've known three years I'll be standing out about like what is his name.

377
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.760
Shaun W.: Oh, like what the hell is his name. This shift happening to me a white lady.

378
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.030
Shaun W.: And I know exactly who he is he gonna be like, What is his name.

379
00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:42.090
Shaun W.: I can't remember his name.

380
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't heard that one in a while. I forgot my friends. Yeah, yeah. I it's I think it's stress. I really do. That's that cortisol.

381
00:34:53.610 --> 00:35:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Messing with your hippocampus, we can't think straight. You ever noticed that, like right when I really need all my facts. If I'm stressed or anxious I can't pull them up. I just can't. I can't pull up what I need and I

382
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to be in a relaxed body so that our brain works better, faster, stronger.

383
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.540
Shaun W.: Guys calling me right now. But that's dramatic brain injury.

384
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.190
Shaun W.: He was calling right now.

385
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to see what little phrase.

386
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: In the power to take what you just said, I'm tripping. So I want to use that I'm going to put that under healthy coping skills. I'm going to put self talk

387
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Which means I might be blowing something out of proportion. Is that what that is. Okay.

388
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there's a lot that I've said that you've probably heard

389
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to use another one like maybe with maybe with your mom.

390
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, it's self talk. We don't really say it out loud.

391
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds like a huge problem.

392
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Not any problem.

393
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, it's on her shoulders to work out if she has a complaint about someone something that's for her to work it out.

394
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not for you to solve, it's not for you you to feel blame so that that mantra right there. Just saying. A lot of people use this one. Is that a me problem are you problem they're thinking in your head. Don't say it. I was just gonna piss her off.

395
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I like that one for your relationship with your mother more than things like don't infer intention from outcome because

396
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The other one just keeps it really simple. There's nothing for you to do when you're around ugliness and hatefulness that is her problem.

397
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not for you to. And that's where we really put up our boundary. We don't want to have it porous. Whatever she says just bounces off of her and sticks to her. Instead, it has to because

398
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:17.250
Shaun W.: You small family will tell you, tell us it's really real.

399
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:18.780

Shaun W.: Okay.

404
00:37:53.010 --> 00:38:05.340

405
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That is literally an investment in you.

406
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you give in to the nasty and ugliness of your mother and other people

407
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: They're literally stealing your life from you. They're taking basically money, resources in your psychological stability when you get hooked like a fish, right, like, You're right. You're so maybe hungry for needing to be right needing approval or whatever. Don't bite.

408
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just don't bite.

Shaun W.: So what I had here this week.

442
00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna see if we can review.

443
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If all you can remember is, I'm tripping, that's fine. But I'd like to add that additional one

444
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna you're going to register the zing of someone's assault, you're going to register it that's going to happen to all of us. We all register, someone is attacking me criticizing me you're still going to feel it.

445
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We humans. I won't be able to there'll be no medicine that will skip over that our body is wired to self preserve so that initial smack like fuck right we're going to get that hit first and then the trick is

446
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just even one deep breath than our mind is going to remember just me problem, straight up, did I really forgot to turn the water off.

447
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's on her. That's for her to work it out. All I need to do is just have a half smile. Just smile. Alright, sounds like this. Now this is a phrase, if you actually want something to say out loud in those moments because you got to say something after someone's been. Wow.

448
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say this, this is memorized.

449
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah mom, that sounds important you've got a lot going on.

450
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not kidding memorized.

451
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

452
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.540
Shaun W.: We got a lot going on.

453
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know it's funny.

454
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I got one. I have, I have a client. This is going to crack you up. You want them will end with this giggle but we already confirmed individual therapy so

455
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's what we say and there's what we think. Right. So this is a little hack. This is a little in therapy. It's paradoxical intervention, but

456
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We stay we say is that sounds really important

457
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what we think the rest of that sentence is to you.

458
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you didn't get what you have, you have your giggle. And now you're not going to punch anybody right

459
00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.370
Shaun W.: No, no.

460
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why this stuff works.

461
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is. It's true. But we can't say something unless it's a little bit true, there is some part of you that realizes that whatever is going on for her. It is important to her.

462
00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is important that that conversation. Stay chill and not not escalate. So in a way, you can find some truth in it. You know what mom what you're talking about does sound important

463
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a lot on your mind and we say shit all after that literally shush, shush.

464
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

465
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.590
So we think

466
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The sequences I breathe. I get hurt and offended. Yep. That's probably going to happen, then I breathe. Then, I think, is this a me problem or her problem, then you know what I say.

467
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: YEAH MOM IS A LOT GOING ON, HON neutral. I said I didn't name call didn't tell her. Do some I didn't defend myself. I just said there's a lot going on. And I know this is really important to you for it right now.

468
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.360
Shaun W.: I think you're lost in there.

469
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.300
Shaun W.: I think you're lost in there and you need to fix that.

470
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. Nope.

471
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't do

472
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't say anything. You cannot label a single thing you stay neutral.

473
00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Way through it's just because you know what, as soon as she gets

474
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Ah, no. You give content. So there's one is a process once a process response ones, the content as soon as you say. And you got to work your shit out.

475
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. Now they're going to the only thing they're going to focus on. They won't hear

476
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That you that you just validated, your mom is going through something important to her and she has a lot going on. She won't hear any of that and said she's only going to hear your work, your shit out, you got in your last

477
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: She was only here that I promise you, all of us do that. We hear what's after the comma me. You see none of us here. The first part.

478
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.120
Shaun W.: We only hear comma

479
00:44:54.720 --> 00:45:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think you're a great guy. You know what I mean. I mean, you don't don't all these things. So watch it. You don't need to you need to step it up, but you can hear us out in the front end.

480
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.920
Shaun W.: But

481
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:12.510
Shaun W.: Here's

482
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: comma, comma, but is the rug.

483
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're standing on is being pulled out from under you.

484
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And

485
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all we're going to focus on is someone just criticize me said I'm not enough. And so don't give it to someone else.

486
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I will see you

487
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.410
