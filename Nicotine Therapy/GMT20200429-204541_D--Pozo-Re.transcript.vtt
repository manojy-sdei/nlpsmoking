00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.660
Dominique Pozo: Eating, go for it. It's okay.

2
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.880
Martin Price: There's your breakfast there.

3
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.210
Dominique Pozo: It's a very late breakfast. It's almost 11

4
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.260
Martin Price: Yeah, okay.

5
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.530
Dominique Pozo: So,

6
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.940
Dominique Pozo: Um, so what happened yesterday. What I I've had so many emails. I'm not remembering why you weren't able to make it to group.

7
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.190
Martin Price: I just completely forgot it.

8
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.770
Martin Price: I don't even have an excuse. I was just working around the house and all of a sudden, I was like, oh,

9
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.030
Okay.

10
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.040
Martin Price: No problem.

11
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.910
Martin Price: No excuse I thought she might have an appointment or a meeting again this week at group meeting that you didn't say

12
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.290
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

13
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.950
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm glad you're, you know, you're following through and just

14
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.110
Dominique Pozo: Wanting to get some sort of support. That's great.

15
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.200
Martin Price: Yeah, it's, um, you know, I just was thinking about it. It's like

16
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.390
Martin Price: You know, just continually beating yourself up about the past.

17
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.270
Martin Price: Is very you know counterproductive and

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.130
Martin Price: I don't know, I just get into these my mind gets like like kind of stuck a eight track tape, you know,

19
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.080
Martin Price: Keeps like saying like, I really

20
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.110
Martin Price: Critical things

21
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.830
Martin Price: Know about

22
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.540
Martin Price: You know, like I

23
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.980
Martin Price: Kind of not gave away, but I just made a lot of unwise decisions about money, you know,

24
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.450
Martin Price: And it was

25
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.190
Martin Price: I do like that was my dad's whole existence. Gradually, he was a CPA and he was all about money, you know, and saving it.

26
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.640
Martin Price: And I didn't really well. And even after the divorce. I was doing really well. And then I just

27
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.480
Martin Price: Like spent like a drunken sailor or something, you know, I don't know what got into me, but

28
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.550
Martin Price: It's certainly a lesson in frugality now.

29
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.420
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

30
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.840
Martin Price: And it's, you know,

31
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.550
Martin Price: I keep

32
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.890
Martin Price: Like the

33
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.580
Martin Price: With Michelle, you know, and

34
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.140
Martin Price: How

35
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.030
Martin Price: I don't know, dishonest. She was and then today. I was just about on the verge to rent a

36
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.020
Martin Price: This really great deal in Janesville, you know,

37
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.320
Dominique Pozo: Because

38
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.650
Martin Price: One back to Janesville at some point and

39
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:19.620
Martin Price: Actually, it was this girl that I've been, you know, my pen pal or whatever. She said, That sounds too good to be true, you need to check it out. And, you know, finally called the realtor, and somehow SOMEONE DROVE by and saw this house is for sale and

40
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.220
Martin Price: The guy who the owner had died and he like jumped in and was pretending that he was the guy.

41
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.750
Dominique Pozo: That we're

42
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.670
Martin Price: Going to rent it and

43
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.210
Martin Price: How do these emails. He sent me Elise and he and then I finally was like

44
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.850
Martin Price: This is so weird. And I called him and he could barely speak English. And I said, is this Stephen Kramer, you know, it's a real Midwestern kinda

45
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.720
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

46
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.260
Martin Price: apple pies, you know, and he was obviously like Mexico or hundreds or something and

47
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:09.420
Martin Price: I was just like that people will just go to some, you know, there's a lot of scammers out there just that's a clean carpets thing to do. I'm sure it's common but it

48
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.710
Martin Price: You know who's on Craigslist, so I thought it was all right.

49
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.120
Martin Price: But so like the whole thing with Michelle really has taught me a lesson not to be so impulsive with money, you know, and

50
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.950
Martin Price: And

51
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.010
Martin Price: I don't know. I am

52
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.950
Martin Price: I'm just trying to, like, look forward. Instead of back and stop criticizing myself.

53
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.210
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

54
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.060
Dominique Pozo: And taking and paper. Yeah. Well, one of the first things that comes to my mind is

55
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.750
Dominique Pozo: I wonder if you

56
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.480
Dominique Pozo: Are also grieving and this is, you know, the part of

57
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:08.880
Dominique Pozo: The part of you that is coming down on yourself. I wonder if it's I could be totally off, but it's just the thought that came in. That's why I'm naming it, you know, I wonder if it's a part that's saying, Gosh, you know,

58
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:25.530
Dominique Pozo: That was a really hard. I don't want to do it again. I'm actually really upset about that, that things played out like that. And so this is why this tape keeps running like, don't you know don't do it again. Is the message, yet the words are, you know, how could you have done that.

59
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.770
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you know, but I think the the message underneath the words are, you know, don't do that again.

60
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:41.520
Martin Price: Right. Um, I you know I think after the divorce. I really wasn't ready for the divorce and and

61
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.750
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

62
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.010
Martin Price: You know, because I

63
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.510
Martin Price: I, I still think my ex, and I both loved each other, but we just

64
00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.900
Martin Price: Couldn't handle my relationship with with Wiley, you know, and going and

65
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:15.750
Martin Price: And so, I think. Then after that, I was like, Okay, I'm going to go like party it up, and I've got all this money and I'm going to have fun and

66
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:28.500
Martin Price: And I did some good things with it. You know, like invested in the house and invested in Wiley's treatment center and all that. But, you know, then I hooked up with Michelle and gave her money and

67
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.390
Martin Price: You know we signed an agreement for a business.

68
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.790
Martin Price: Investment and

69
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.170
Martin Price: And that's still kind of hanging out there. I don't think she even

70
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.040
Martin Price: Believes that

71
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.360
Martin Price: It's her responsibility, you know, so

72
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.450
Martin Price: So I've got a lawyer involved in that, but

73
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.700
Martin Price: Yeah, when I look at it I guess I just can realize that I went through a lot of

74
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:11.160
Martin Price: You know, it was the daughter getting skits with her having schizophrenia for eight years. And my wife kind of saying she couldn't take it anymore and

75
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.370
Martin Price: And I blew out my back and I lost my job and it all happen like over the course of like five or six months and

76
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.270
Martin Price: It was just a lot and

77
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.210
Dominique Pozo: You know, there's this I read this book long ago by a

78
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.620
Dominique Pozo: Man.

79
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.270
Dominique Pozo: named Bill plotkin and when

80
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.500
Dominique Pozo: As we go through life we we develop these these parts of self called loyal soldiers and

81
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.130
Dominique Pozo: The loyal soldier is a part that is like they take care. They're the they're the protectors of us.

82
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.630
Dominique Pozo: And they come out in different ways, you know, sometimes maybe they're fighters and they just, you know, they're very defensive and they fight a lot or

83
00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:08.520
Dominique Pozo: Or they they recoil and they pull away because that's, you know, a defense mechanism. And then I think I'm wondering if this part that keeps giving you the negative self talk if it's the loyal soldier that's like, you know,

84
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.490
Dominique Pozo: I don't want you to make a mistake again. So I'm going to make sure you hear me every day, many times.

85
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:26.850
Dominique Pozo: Sometimes with the loyal soldiers, what we need to tell them is, you know, thank you so much. Thank you. I hear your message. I see it's coming from a place of care and I don't need to hear it every day anymore i don't i

86
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:35.160
Dominique Pozo: I got the memo. It's clear. It's like, and these parts. Sometimes they back off a little you know cuz they're just trying to protect

87
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:36.480
Dominique Pozo: You know,

88
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.880
Martin Price: Any media in your head.

89
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:49.560
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, totally. And you know the other ones that maybe act out in different ways. It's, it's, and we all have them. And I wonder what other loyal soldiers, you have

90
00:08:50.280 --> 00:09:01.770
Dominique Pozo: You know, it's, um, it's such a good thing to remind them that that was then and this is now you're not living, even in the time that you were when you were with Michelle, you are here. Now Michelle is not in the picture and

91
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.030
Dominique Pozo: Right, you don't need to hear this every day because you're not in the same dynamic

92
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.040
Martin Price: Yeah, I think, like, just kind of focusing on the here and now and

93
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.090
Yeah.

94
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.430
Martin Price: Future. I mean, I like this job and

95
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.210
Martin Price: You know, I'm pretty sure there's some longevity associated with it. And I can

96
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.510
Martin Price: Get back on track financially.

97
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.870
Martin Price: But it and you know i i think part of is like

98
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:42.570
Martin Price: That was my dad's favorite criticism was about, you know, my financial responsibility when I was younger and

99
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.140
Martin Price: You know, and then it just all comes back.

100
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.910
Martin Price: It's like that wiring is left Dorman in there and then all of a sudden the circuit gets reconnected and

101
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.300
Martin Price: Just starts playing away, you know,

102
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.960
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. I mean, I think what you said is the

103
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:14.220
Dominique Pozo: Key is getting present to the here and now. And this is a this is a constant practice doing it every few minutes, remembering bring myself to the here and now, you know, and just making that conscious

104
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.590
Dominique Pozo: Shift

105
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.430
Martin Price: I have a, like a little prayer, I say, but you know it doesn't

106
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.780
Martin Price: doesn't cure it. And that's for sure. It just read it. What's

107
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.910
Martin Price: The title of it in the right way.

108
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.800
Dominique Pozo: To share the prayer.

109
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:46.350
Martin Price: Oh, it's you know God. The past is behind us in the future isn't here yet. So thank you for giving me this moment.

110
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.440
Martin Price: To be in your divine spiritual presence, your wisdom, your love and your grace.

111
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:53.820
Martin Price: And

112
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:04.050
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean, I've got a lot of prayers that I say like that when I start coming down on myself last night was really bad for some reason, I was just

113
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.450
Martin Price: Out there.

114
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.870
Martin Price: And then I keep thinking like must have something to do with a buprenorphine or something but

115
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:22.230
Martin Price: You know, I've talked to counselors before then it was like know that it's you. It's you beating yourself up.

116
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.500
Dominique Pozo: On all one. Are you open to a reflection that I just had

117
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.730
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. When you read the prayer it. My experience was you, you read through it really fast and I

118
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:36.600
Martin Price: Like

119
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:51.720
Dominique Pozo: I almost didn't get it. And I'm wondering how much you're actually connecting to it like conceptually. Sure. It's an idea, but to really feel it. And I wonder if you're willing to reread it and really feel it as you read it and let it in

120
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.560
Martin Price: The past is behind us in the future isn't here yet.

121
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.840
Martin Price: Thank you for giving me this moment to be in your presence.

122
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.710
Martin Price: Oh, thank you for this moment to be in your divine spiritual presence love wisdom and grace.

123
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:38.490
Dominique Pozo: Think slowing everything down. I hate. That's the key. You know, right now, to becoming president is or slowing it down and really being with not not only the concepts, because they're great ideas and concepts but feeling them like really bringing it down from the head down into the body.

124
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:47.310
Martin Price: Yeah, I probably said it kind of cynically because I don't you know it's like I feel like it's not working. Yeah.

125
00:12:48.030 --> 00:13:07.710
Martin Price: Yeah, but I keep going. You know, I keep mentioning this other counselor. I had, and he just said you have to intervene. Every time you know that negative. He calls it the shadow or the voice. It doesn't love you and he just says you need to intervene. Every time that voice kicks in and

126
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.260
Martin Price: You know, recognize that it's like programming from early childhood or something.

127
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.820
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

128
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:18.930
And

129
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.340
Martin Price: So that's, you know, so I tried to intervene, but

130
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.760
Martin Price: Yeah, it's just like a daily battle.

131
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.710
Dominique Pozo: I think for a while. It probably will be and then it doesn't have to be anymore.

132
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:44.490
Dominique Pozo: I mean, and I'll just share from personal experience, you know, with different things that have come up for me around the past. It is. It's like, oh my gosh, this is a daily. It's a practice to keep

133
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:58.080
Dominique Pozo: You know, bringing myself to a different space and and way of moving through the world. And then eventually, it's like, oh, well, actually this is who I am now. You know, it just takes such work.

134
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:06.450
Dominique Pozo: And you and you're doing it. I mean, you show up every week for group. This week, you didn't and lucky reached out per session. So you're totally showing up for yourself.

135
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.680
Martin Price: Yeah, cuz I was I was getting kind of

136
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.350
Martin Price: I felt that gone as far as I could, with the spiritual counselor guy. He just

137
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:26.040
Martin Price: I mean, everything was about, you know, it's all a lesson. You got to be gentle with yourself. The forgiving and

138
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:38.490
Martin Price: You know, God will take care of you. And I just, I felt like I could grasp it intellectually, but I wasn't feeling it, you know.

139
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:46.260
Dominique Pozo: So this is great. So this is helping me see where to go next in the session. So let's do a little somatic work. So when you

140
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.180
Dominique Pozo: When you

141
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.020
Dominique Pozo: Hear the self talk

142
00:14:53.220 --> 00:15:08.400
Dominique Pozo: What part of your body either reacts response or are you able to identify what part of your body that the message is delivered from just think of maybe the most recent negative self talk you you told yourself.

143
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:16.800
Martin Price: Like last night. It was just, I mean, I didn't really like feel it in the pit of my stomach or anything. It was just

144
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.240
Martin Price: spinning around in my head. And then I get in a really

145
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.480
Martin Price: I get in a bad mood and

146
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.870
Martin Price: So then I just kind of run around and try and get things done and stay distracted, you know,

147
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:39.570
Martin Price: Yeah.

148
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:50.280
Dominique Pozo: So, so go back to if you if you are willing to last night before you started running around distracting yourself. What part of your body.

149
00:15:53.850 --> 00:16:03.750
Dominique Pozo: Experiences, the self talk like when you when you hear the words and then something happens, what part of your body. Is there a response happening.

150
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.930
Martin Price: I'm trying to say. It just feels like right there.

151
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.920
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay. So put your hand right there. Let's just stick with that.

152
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:14.970
Dominique Pozo: So just

153
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.040
Dominique Pozo: Just be with this taking a few deep breaths.

154
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:26.340
Dominique Pozo: And really noticing. Like, what does this feel like, what, what does this remind you of what does this feel like what's going on in here just describe it as much as possible.

155
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.250
Like this.

156
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:44.400
Just keeps

157
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.920
Martin Price: Broadcasting

158
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:57.540
Martin Price: You know, I should take revenge or I should, you know, how could I have been so stupid and

159
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.460
Martin Price: You know, just like here and it just sort of

160
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:10.050
Martin Price: Consolidates in that area of my brain and just won't stop transmitting

161
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:22.110
Dominique Pozo: So do you want to just look at me, I'm going to, I'm going to mirror what what I'm seeing. And you can take your hand if y'all just tell me what you see. I'm going to mirror you know as much as I thought in you.

162
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.600
Dominique Pozo: What do you see when you look at that.

163
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.880
Dominique Pozo: That's what I see, I see the image I get is somebody else's hand like

164
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:43.020
Dominique Pozo: You know, Penny you down and holding you down. But tell me more, tell me what what you see what comes to mind.

165
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.680
Martin Price: Just like

166
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.650
Martin Price: hooked into my brain or something.

167
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:12.210
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm gonna do this, I'm going to take it away. What, what, what can you imagine what happened if you took this out.

168
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:33.060
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean this is such a great image to keep in the forefront of your mind when those thoughts come on boom that hook is in there. And so it's like okay, gently taking this hook out and giving yourself the space to just be

169
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.600
Martin Price: Well, I mean,

170
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.830
Martin Price: So like the only. What I'm saying is the only way I know

171
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.830
Martin Price: That works is

172
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.930
Martin Price: Well, time and

173
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.140
Martin Price: Exercise helps and

174
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.570
Martin Price: Sometimes

175
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:14.490
Dominique Pozo: Let's understand this hook a little more if you're willing to get a piece of paper and write, and write from this place, say I am dot, dot, dot, let's let's understand it more. Let's see what this is where it comes from, what its motivations are

176
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.870
Dominique Pozo: So if you can just say I am dot, dot, dot. And think of this

177
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.240
Dominique Pozo: You know this very intrusive and kind of domineering hook

178
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.110
Martin Price: Okay.

179
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.120
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

180
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.520
Dominique Pozo: What it, what do you got

181
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:40.830
Martin Price: It's kind of like I am, your protector in your Savior. You're fucking up and this is all going to end badly.

182
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.160
Martin Price: You know, it's

183
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.710
Martin Price: I guess it's like this part of me like times in my life when I messed up and either

184
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.960
Martin Price: My brother, my father kind of had to intervene and

185
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.120
Martin Price: straighten me out.

186
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.820
Martin Price: Or, you know, to a certain extent.

187
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.000
Dominique Pozo: Do you think you're currently fucking up

188
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.760
Martin Price: With the buprenorphine. Yeah.

189
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.650
Dominique Pozo: How so

190
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.160
Martin Price: Well, I just, I'm

191
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.720
Martin Price: Like, I went to a treatment center.

192
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.550
Martin Price: About two years ago and

193
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.460
Martin Price: It was

194
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:45.900
Martin Price: I had been taken pain pills are mostly pain pills, but some Suboxone and

195
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:55.470
Martin Price: It was like two weeks to hell to get up to get, you know, to withdraw whatever you call it.

196
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:56.940
Martin Price: And then

197
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.750
Martin Price: You know, probably another month or two.

198
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.280
Martin Price: Just like pretty bad anxiety and

199
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.630
Martin Price: Like weakness and

200
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:14.580
Martin Price: I just

201
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.380
Martin Price: Was really fatigued, all the time and get getting sick.

202
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.640
Martin Price: Ron keel stop and everything like that.

203
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.330
When

204
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:36.870
Martin Price: You know, I remember I was probably clean for like five months and then got some cough syrup with coding in it. And that just seemed like it just started the whole cycle again.

205
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:43.380
Martin Price: And then I threw out my back and had this car accident, everything like that. But it's like

206
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:53.820
Martin Price: I just feel like I'm not accepting that I'm an addict and that this isn't this is gonna if I don't

207
00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:02.430
Martin Price: Get off this stuff right away, it's going to lead me to a really bad place. And yet,

208
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.950
Martin Price: I don't know, I've been able to, you know,

209
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.350
Martin Price: I don't want to call it control it, but I'd like I'm functioning well and I'm not

210
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.560
Martin Price: I'm able to take it within the prescribed amounts but

211
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.040
Martin Price: It just doesn't feel right.

212
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:32.880
Dominique Pozo: So this is actually this is making more sense to me why this voice keeps coming in because there's something that doesn't feel right. And it's really the it's the

213
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.690
Dominique Pozo: It's like the voice of that like this doesn't feel right.

214
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.130
Martin Price: Yeah, I want to and and and like I want to

215
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.450
Martin Price: I don't know if I need to go to like a

216
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:55.050
Martin Price: Place, like a detoxing to get off of it or just keep trying to taper things. Only thing I haven't tried you know and

217
00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.650
Dominique Pozo: So you haven't been tapering

218
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.720
Martin Price: Know what I'm trying to say is at the treatment center was like cold turkey.

219
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.400
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Do you

220
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.290
Dominique Pozo: Psycho.

221
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:14.040
Martin Price: Anyway, and this time it's more like, okay, just a little bit. A little bit. A little bit and I am reducing it and

222
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.270
Martin Price: I get crabby, like in the afternoon and stuff like that.

223
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.050
Martin Price: I really have the will, you know,

224
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:33.600
Martin Price: And I'm also worried that someday they'll start drug testing at work or I'll need to find a different job where they drug tests and, you know,

225
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.040
Martin Price: And I won't be able to do it.

226
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.620
Martin Price: Because I'm the person

227
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:45.300
Dominique Pozo: Yep. Um, do you did you experience that quitting Cold Turkey was effective. And it worked. Was it long lasting.

228
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.300
Martin Price: No, I mean lasted five months. Yeah. Which isn't bad, but I mean,

229
00:24:52.320 --> 00:25:00.390
Martin Price: The previously when I went to a treatment center in 2000 you know I was clean for 16 years

230
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.230
Dominique Pozo: Oh, wow.

231
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.570
Martin Price: You know, but I stopped going to na meetings and stuff like that and

232
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:09.540
Martin Price: You know,

233
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:23.550
Dominique Pozo: To me, the sounds, correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds less about, you know, your choices and decisions around money and more about currently that you're not really in alignment with what you're doing.

234
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.040
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean,

235
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:35.130
Martin Price: I don't know. I like the way I feel on it and I'm I like that. I can still

236
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.490
Martin Price: You know exercise work and

237
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.410
Martin Price: That kind of thing. But I just

238
00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.450
Martin Price: Like I don't. Sometimes I don't feel like it's the real me

239
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.140
Dominique Pozo: You know,

240
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:54.360
Martin Price: I think it's like my spirit is kind of like trapped. Yeah, because I'm on this drug, you know,

241
00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:04.200
Dominique Pozo: So what do you think it would be helpful to set a goal for yourself to really just continue on the tapering process and

242
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.990
Dominique Pozo: And get off of it by certain date.

243
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.770
Martin Price: Yeah.

244
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.190
Martin Price: I was using June 1

245
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.960
Martin Price: I don't know if a month is too quick or not.

246
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.180
Dominique Pozo: Is that realistic. How much are you taking

247
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.650
Martin Price: Like 3.4 something like that milligrams

248
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.320
Martin Price: This will be a good stuff.

249
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.430
Dominique Pozo: I would talk to the doctor, you know, they, they know more, I don't, I don't really know about this stuff, but

250
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:50.340
Dominique Pozo: I think setting some goals for your tapering so you have kind of an end in sight, and you don't you know your psyche doesn't keep beating yourself up saying, you know, this is bad. You shouldn't be on it. This is going to cause problems, you know, blah, blah, blah. Whatever the talk is

251
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.210
Dominique Pozo: Just knowing I wonder if that might help a little to

252
00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:05.430
Dominique Pozo: Have a container of time so that your psyche knows. Okay, this isn't an open ended thing. This is going to end. So maybe you know lighten up a little bit hot voice.

253
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.200
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know how long of a period to use either

254
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:22.470
Martin Price: I got the idea, or I got the sense that it was months, you know, for a lot of people have, like, just trying to reductions in those

255
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:31.200
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah, I mean, it's been some people have been tapering for years. So I'm not saying that will be your case and some that have gone through quite quickly.

256
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:43.560
Dominique Pozo: You know, so it's different. It's just, you know, how bad does somebody want it. How much are they taking care of themselves in the process to make sure that they're getting through the tapering without too much discomfort, because there's gonna be a little

257
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:56.310
Martin Price: Yeah. Part of it is like I know if I tried to do a cold turkey thing it would take me usually takes at least a month to kind of get to the point where you could say sit in the office all day and

258
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.880
Martin Price: Usually I end up getting a lot of anxiety.

259
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.990
Martin Price: So I don't know. I

260
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:18.780
Martin Price: It was strange to me when I started this job that it's the first place I've gotten that they don't have badges or do

261
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.120
Martin Price: Drug testing.

262
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.970
Martin Price: I think it's because they're on a really tight budget and they

263
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:35.280
Martin Price: They don't plan to do drug testing until they get their licensed operator or something, which would be years down the road, but

264
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:46.590
Martin Price: If I get this job ever. If I like if they ran out of money or I lost this job. I need to go somewhere else and they would definitely have drug testing, you know,

265
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.550
Martin Price: So, okay, yeah, that's a big part of it is

266
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.490
Martin Price: Me beating myself up for being on

267
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.790
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I can't hear you.

268
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:09.540
Dominique Pozo: Hear me now. I didn't hear you. What was that, yeah. Now, I hear you. Yeah, yeah.

269
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:16.770
Martin Price: It's just a big part of it is me beating myself up over the viewpoint of her friend and then combine that with like

270
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.520
Martin Price: beating myself up for the past

271
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:26.820
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. What I'm hearing is there's a part of you that's really not proud of where you're at and what you've done.

272
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.340
Yeah yeah yeah

273
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.340
Martin Price: I mean, I'm

274
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.880
Martin Price: I'm trying to relate to the part of me that

275
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.260
Martin Price: You know, turned it around and got a job and

276
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.060
Martin Price: You know, is making an effort to

277
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.710
Martin Price: get my life back in order, you know,

278
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.520
Martin Price: But it's just like

279
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.530
Martin Price: You know until I

280
00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.510
Martin Price: Get off that buprenorphine. I just feel. I don't feel like I'm there, you know,

281
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:04.680
Martin Price: I know

282
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:16.560
Martin Price: You know, I'm kind of like sometimes in group, I want to ask, you know, don't they drug test you at work. It's like, you know, people who work for the state or construction companies or whatever.

283
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.070
Dominique Pozo: Go ahead and ask them. This is what group is for please ask them.

284
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.220
Dominique Pozo: This is a place to exchange ideas and, you know,

285
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.230
Dominique Pozo: Share your lamenting around certain things and

286
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.040
Dominique Pozo: The wind just blew something

287
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:43.110
Dominique Pozo: And I think also sharing what you're sharing with me. You know, if you're willing to share with the group, you know, you're not alone. This we just had this conversation.

288
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:53.670
Dominique Pozo: Actually, I wonder if it was in your group someone was being so hard on themselves about being on Suboxone and and really judging themselves. So this is not

289
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.070
Dominique Pozo: I mean it's unique because it's your own experience, but it's not uncommon.

290
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.870
Martin Price: Yeah and if our na groups here.

291
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:15.450
Martin Price: There's a. It's very, it's a very divisive issue. They don't, there's the old timers who did it without medically assisted treatment, and then there's everybody

292
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:22.560
Martin Price: Who's on some form of medication assisted treatment like keeping our fan or medical marijuana or

293
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.160
Dominique Pozo: Right.

294
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.110
Martin Price: Or whatever, and

295
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.770
Martin Price: It's created a huge split and

296
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:35.070
Martin Price: You know, I don't feel comfortable talking about it in meetings, you know,

297
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:42.990
Martin Price: The, the groups that through bright heart are the only way I can relate. Yeah.

298
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.810
Dominique Pozo: I think it's good and and

299
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:55.740
Dominique Pozo: You know what it comes down to is everyone has their own unique chemistry their own needs, their own history, their own

300
00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:07.950
Dominique Pozo: You know dreams for the future. So it's different for everyone like one person said, I've accepted, I may be on this forever. And I'm accepting it because it helps me to function. And I want to function and another person was saying.

301
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:13.230
Dominique Pozo: I don't want to be honest anymore. I want to be free from feeling like something has a grip on me.

302
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.310
Martin Price: You know, right.

303
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:25.860
Dominique Pozo: So this is, it's a it's a really important topic to discuss when someone is on medicated assistant, you know, assisted treatment with medication.

304
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.820
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean,

305
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:34.500
Martin Price: That's just weird. It

306
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:51.450
Martin Price: I have. I feel like about a third of it of me taking it is for pain. And then the other two thirds is for 30 minutes from for for physical pain is that the other two thirds is for emotional pain, you know,

307
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.500
Dominique Pozo: That's why you're here in the therapy and that's why this is so important, so that you're not

308
00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:05.400
Dominique Pozo: You know, relying on that to to whatever skip over or outer pretty much deny the other payments president

309
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:11.670
Martin Price: And then the other thing I noticed is that when I do taper. I actually

310
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:19.770
Martin Price: Feel it more, if that makes sense. It's like when you're on a lower dose, you're much more aware of how you're feeling

311
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:25.710
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh, uh huh. Yeah, this is, this is the hardest time to this last little

312
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.170
Dominique Pozo: Window.

313
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:34.680
Dominique Pozo: The final step of tapering that what I've noticed to people. This is the hardest part. So,

314
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.530
Dominique Pozo: If you're getting closer to the end of that on here.

315
00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:44.460
Martin Price: Yeah, it's probably once you get down to like one milligram every other day. It's like, you don't want to let go of it, you know.

316
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:45.810
Yeah.

317
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:56.280
Dominique Pozo: All the things that come with that, you know, the fear, the anxiety, the worry the desire to not go back to the life you had before. I mean, all these things.

318
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:07.650
Dominique Pozo: So I think, and I think you alluded to it at some point in the session today that you know it's really choosing where you focus your energy and your attention.

319
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:17.580
Dominique Pozo: So choosing to focus on the things that you are accomplishing and have accomplished and that you are proud of. Not fixating on the things you're not proud of.

320
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:39.840
Martin Price: Yeah. Dang, you know, and I tried to, like, get my mind.

321
00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:49.890
Martin Price: Distracted or diverted and try and think about work or something. I need to get done at the house or, you know, I try and think about what's going right and

322
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:57.480
Martin Price: Sometimes it's just hard to get out of it and it's not till the next morning, they get some sleep that I'm

323
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.290
Martin Price: In a better place.

324
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:11.100
Dominique Pozo: I wonder, can you slow it down. Can you just slow down, like when you do start to think about all the things you have accomplished where you're at.

325
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:21.810
Dominique Pozo: And really let it in. It's almost like the prayer. It's almost like that prayer that you read in the beginning, or that you that you said you said you kind of like cynically read it said it and

326
00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:40.350
Dominique Pozo: Same with all the things you have done well and accomplished and that you are proud of, see if you can just be with them and feel like what is that experience of praising myself, Where do I feel that in my body. What is that feel like and, you know, the more that you're able to track.

327
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.320
Dominique Pozo: The positive

328
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.170
Dominique Pozo: Responses that you're having. I think the better because it seems like that's the good direction to move in.

329
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.300
Martin Price: That is that I've done right.

330
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.650
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. What is it that you've done right and as you start to consider these things.

331
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:05.190
Dominique Pozo: Feel it really feel it in your body and go through it slow. Don't I think it's easy to rattle off. Well, I

332
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.270
Dominique Pozo: You know, I went to college. I got a job, I was able to support my family, blah, blah, blah, blah. But really feeling into

333
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:29.280
Dominique Pozo: What was that experience of going to college, you know, the stimulation. The excitement. The meeting of friends and new ideas and feeling all that. And then I had a family, you know, that's, I mean, there's a whole universe of richness to to tap into and and really

334
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.790
Dominique Pozo: Deepening with the positives.

335
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.220
Martin Price: To be in. Yeah, it's like I feel like a not in a state of gratitude.

336
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:52.710
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Well that's, I suppose. Feels like deja vu, have I invited you to do a gratitude practice every day and maybe even just as when you wake up five things you're grateful for. And when you fall asleep five things you're grateful for.

337
00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:08.220
Dominique Pozo: That has been super effective, I'll just speak personally in the past for me when I've been in a really big funk and read that it pulled me out. That was the only thing that pulled me out was giving thanks for the things in my life.

338
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:24.480
Martin Price: And it's also being patient, it's a slow things don't just change overnight. You know, you have to like if you want your finances to improve, you really have to

339
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.400
Martin Price: Practice cost cutting and

340
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:40.320
Martin Price: I've never really been into like shopping or eight or gambling or anything like that.

341
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.110
Martin Price: So I don't really spend that much money, you know, so I feel like I'm

342
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.130
Martin Price: Coming back, but it's just a slow process, you know,

343
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:51.690
Martin Price: Trying to

344
00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:02.520
Martin Price: I know I'll have to work for the next five years, which I'm okay with, to tell you the truth, I don't mind work, but it just would be nice to have that cushion. I used to have.

345
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:10.020
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I, I really think that patience is a keyword, you know, being patient with your process.

346
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:19.110
Dominique Pozo: Because I think if you rush it or try to get somewhere prematurely one. It may not happen, and you're going to get very frustrated and maybe backslide even worse.

347
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.790
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean I am going to do some small investments like I bought

348
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.300
Martin Price: An entire Bitcoin now so

349
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:28.050
Dominique Pozo: Oh, cool.

350
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.190
Martin Price: It's going out.

351
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:36.090
Martin Price: I mean I have to, like, for me, I just feel like I have to have a couple

352
00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:41.370
Martin Price: I don't know what you'd call little grow pots or something.

353
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.890
Martin Price: Where I can do stuff like that and see some improvement, you know,

354
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.710
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know if I get shut down because I am tapering or

355
00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.890
Martin Price: Or why and I just don't know.

356
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.410
Dominique Pozo: I think this is a good thing to talk to the

357
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:12.030
Dominique Pozo: Doctor about to physiologically, you know, what are some of the signs and symptoms as people do taper because it could be, it could be that there's

358
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:16.260
Dominique Pozo: That that is impacting you in some way and

359
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:23.100
Martin Price: is temporary. This is not a forever. Yeah, your brain. Your brain once read it used to get

360
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.010
Dominique Pozo: Wondering about to the document and Sir

361
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.340
Dominique Pozo: Are you there, oh, I lost you. Oh, there are you. Can you hear me.

362
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:43.320
Martin Price: Yeah, it's just this. I couldn't hear what you said something about dopamine and serotonin receptors or something.

363
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:54.630
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering, I'm wondering if this is a part of the process, because you know when when someone's doing opiates. It really messes with the body's capacity to naturally produce the dope mean

364
00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:11.490
Dominique Pozo: And then all those good feelings of endorphins as well. So it takes time for that to start happening on its own. Again, and you may simply be and that's for the doctor dance or not me, but you may simply be in this process of, you know, it's uncomfortable. It's not comfortable

365
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:16.080
Martin Price: No, no. I mean, I think the tendency is to want more or less.

366
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.550
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, exactly.

367
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.690
Martin Price: But then, I've noticed that I just feel like I've got

368
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.730
Martin Price: I don't know a little bit more serenity and

369
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:32.160
Martin Price: Person I ran at lunch and they track me down at work of my

370
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:40.980
Martin Price: First my buddy. One of my co workers, call me and then my boss called me right after that, you know, you need to sign this thing.

371
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.520
Martin Price: It's got to be done in 10 minutes or something that's of

372
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:51.630
Martin Price: Course I told him the truth that I was running, which was like, What do you mean you're running orange, you're in front of your computer.

373
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.710
Martin Price: So it's very

374
00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:04.680
Martin Price: I man like this one guy just seems like he's working 24 seven I don't feel like I'm that busy, but

375
00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.450
Martin Price: I do work a lot

376
00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:18.000
Martin Price: Yeah, anyway, I'm not really. I guess I'm not ready to just accept being on buprenorphine for the rest of my life, you

377
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:31.950
Dominique Pozo: Know, and you don't have to. I don't think that has to be the way it is. I think it's just recognizing that it's not going to happen overnight. And it may be a longer than you're wishing for but you know I really

378
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.230
Martin Price: Probably do have a little bit of time I

379
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:43.890
Martin Price: You know, like I said, it's I like this job and hopefully I'm pretty sure I can keep it in some form or fashion and I just don't think they're going to start

380
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:52.860
Martin Price: Drug testing for quite a while. They like the cheapest for building a brand new nuclear production plan, it's the cheapest company I've ever worked for because it's a

381
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:55.980
Martin Price: Startup.

382
00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:01.440
Martin Price: Venture Capitalist venture capital funded startup.

383
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.870
Martin Price: The man they really

384
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.760
Martin Price: WATCH THEIR MONEY.

385
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.350
Dominique Pozo: So what do you think you can do different in the next week.

386
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.560
Martin Price: Definitely, I really like the idea of five things you're grateful for.

387
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.220
Martin Price: At bed time

388
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:29.610
Dominique Pozo: In the morning

389
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.220
Martin Price: I have been trying to

390
00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:50.340
Martin Price: Look above. If I wake up at like 530 or five or something. I'll just kind of sit up in bed and try and meditate, or at least do repetitive or something like that.

391
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:59.010
Martin Price: I don't know what to think about like attending the NA meetings because I like I said, I just

392
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.580
Martin Price: Feel like I can't like fully

393
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.060
Martin Price: I can't really talk about what I want to talk about

394
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.580
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it sounds like

395
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.980
Dominique Pozo: There's some there's definitely there could be some judgment in there. That's not going to help

396
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:18.390
Martin Price: Your situation. So, I mean, I guess what I'm saying is, I don't know if

397
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:25.650
Martin Price: It is Wednesday.

398
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.900
Dominique Pozo: Today is Wednesday. Yep.

399
00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:28.830
Yeah.

400
00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.280
Martin Price: It is like I've kind of gotten connected with this church.

401
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.480
Martin Price: Back in Wisconsin that

402
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:44.430
Martin Price: It's called the heartland.

403
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.510
And

404
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:51.180
Martin Price: It's like this whole Celebrate recovery program and they're kind of all about

405
00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:01.170
Martin Price: Everyone's a mess. You know, we've all got some issues either addiction or behaviors or something, you know, and

406
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:11.610
Martin Price: They have like these kind of breakout groups and stuff like that. And that's actually tonight. So I think that would help me to do that to go to that.

407
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.390
Uh huh.

408
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:22.020
Dominique Pozo: That sounds like a good support and a you know a place where you maybe can divulge a little more and Sharon.

409
00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:27.720
Martin Price: WATCH THEIR

410
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:41.730
Martin Price: The sermon and it's kind of an evangelical there's a band and everything like that. And that's every Sunday morning. It's pretty white bread, though. It's not like you know black GOSPEL SINGERS or any

411
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.350
Martin Price: Christianity.

412
00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.670
Martin Price: Sound like Aretha Franklin.

413
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.640
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, how about um

414
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:14.160
Dominique Pozo: Do you, do you think and feel that you're getting out enough doing the things that you love, you know the the hobbies that you have and I hear that the outdoor being outdoors is huge for you.

415
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.720
Martin Price: And moving around to do or hike or you do that I

416
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:19.860
Dominique Pozo: Was Uh huh.

417
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:28.680
Martin Price: Yeah, and working out in the yard. And that's really good. I, I definitely don't do well sitting inside all day in front of a computer.

418
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:34.410
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Well, I haven't having an idea to. I wonder if it could be helpful.

419
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:44.370
Dominique Pozo: On your walks. Like, I don't know if you have audible or if you can download some podcasts, but start filling your mind with something else. Because I imagine I know you know

420
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:58.770
Dominique Pozo: Going going hiking. It's like, you can go hike and beautiful you're outside and a person can really ruminate around the things that are upsetting them or what and just keep doing circles, when they have that time and space to do it so

421
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.550
Dominique Pozo: You know,

422
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.310
Dominique Pozo: Maybe filling that space rather than

423
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.090
Dominique Pozo: You know, repeating that pattern filling it with new information that's actually going to be helpful to create the

424
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:10.920
Martin Price: So,

425
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.630
Martin Price: Just like a

426
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.080
Martin Price: New beliefs decided to get just from

427
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:28.740
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so there's two one, that's really good is called on been like, oh, and b i n g and the woman who lead that is her name is Krista Tippett

428
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.440
Martin Price: And then another one being.com or something.

429
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:39.210
Dominique Pozo: I think if you just look up on being it'll you can get an app for it and

430
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.070
Dominique Pozo: Okay. And then the other one is sounds true with Tammy, Simon.

431
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.310
Martin Price: sounds true or sound true

432
00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.250
Dominique Pozo: sounds true. I'm pretty certain what color.

433
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.400
Dominique Pozo: Maybe it took it off my phone today.

434
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.070
Dominique Pozo: Did

435
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:14.760
Dominique Pozo: A pretty sure it sounds true, but if you look it up with Tammy Simon TA I time

436
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:16.500
Dominique Pozo: It'll come up

437
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:17.550
Okay.

438
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.100
Martin Price: Yeah I did get like a

439
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:33.300
Martin Price: Deepak Chopra seven Spiritual Laws of success and

440
00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.140
Uh huh.

441
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:44.640
Martin Price: I think I need something not quite as altruistic, you know, something more kind of teach on the ground stuff.

442
00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:59.610
Dominique Pozo: I think of the on being, I think you might appreciate it. It's not so lofty, you know, the concepts aren't so there. It's just, you know, some of them are really inspiring. Some of them are really encouraging. Oh, here's another one. It's called Future Primitive

443
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.310
Martin Price: Future Primitive

444
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.240
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, with

445
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:12.270
Dominique Pozo: I think Joanna something, but if you look up Future Primitive you'll find it.

446
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.670
Dominique Pozo: That one's cool there's some

447
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:24.180
Dominique Pozo: Really interesting speakers and it is, it can get a little lofty and spiritual although it's really interesting, just, you know, filling your mind with other things.

448
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:25.830
Martin Price: Okay, yeah.

449
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:36.990
Martin Price: Yeah, lots of times it happens like, you know, I think I've mentioned this before it happens like it search at three or four in the afternoon.

450
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.950
Dominique Pozo: Right, right.

451
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:45.990
Martin Price: The, the stress of the day. I don't know what the hell today. I went out, man. So I feel a lot more relaxed day

452
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.350
Dominique Pozo: At that time, no, because it's only 245

453
00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:51.300
Martin Price: I mean, I ran at lunch and

454
00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:56.460
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, just, yeah. Great. Well, the exercise. That's great. I think that's the other thing I think is

455
00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:06.090
Dominique Pozo: Well, the podcasts don't really support this, but moving the energy away from your head and into your body more. So that is where the physical activity is so good.

456
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.230
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

457
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.620
Martin Price: Yeah, and it just kind of settles down a bit. So I'm not sure.

458
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.330
Martin Price: So my expectations are so high, you know,

459
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

460
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.390
Martin Price: Yeah, more grateful place.

461
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:33.210
Dominique Pozo: Well I, I actually think this, this thing is a very valuable voice saying you know don't keep fucking up whatever that means to you. It's like it really wants you to

462
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.650
Dominique Pozo: Keep for flourishing and just having a better life.

463
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.430
Martin Price: Yeah, it's just it

464
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.950
Martin Price: It really gets me down.

465
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.480
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

466
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.170
Martin Price: That's supposed to fight it then or intervene.

467
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:57.720
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think by doing I think by doing the gratitude practices by, you know, going to the church group that you're that you go to, by

468
00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.720
Dominique Pozo: Potential listening. That's intervention for sure.

469
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:19.710
Martin Price: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I feel like I'm trying. I just, and then I'm like, why, why don't you feel any better. And it's because, you know, then I, you know, if I can't beat myself up over the My shitty finances or the stupid things I did and I beat myself up over taking buprenorphine.

470
00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.800
Martin Price: I'll find something

471
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.020
Martin Price: But honestly I feel pretty good this afternoon so

472
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:31.950
Great.

473
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:44.130
Dominique Pozo: And I really, I really see your desire. And I think that's the most important pieces. The desire for the change. And then the rest will follow. And you really want it. I can tell.

474
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.080
Martin Price: Yeah, I do. I am

475
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.740
Martin Price: You know, I just

476
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:54.990
Martin Price: I guess I kind of feel like

477
00:50:56.190 --> 00:51:00.840
Martin Price: Pretty much the time is gone. I don't know how quickly I can do it. But the my best.

478
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:02.190
Yeah.

479
00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:06.000
Martin Price: All right.

480
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.650
Martin Price: I probably had to get back to my favorite

481
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:13.200
Martin Price: Thing which is

482
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.930
Martin Price: Doing emails or whatever.

483
00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:23.790
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's, I'm just going to pull up my calendar really quickly. So I have you down. So we had a session today.
