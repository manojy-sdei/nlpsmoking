THE QUEENS LG: Oh yeah, yeah, probably. Are you know i mean she like her kids were like my kids and my kids were like her kids and I mean we were close. We used to see each other every single day and

46
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:14.340
THE QUEENS LG: Then I moved away and then, you know, we kind of lost contact for a couple years. And then, oh this is wonderful. My third ex husband is her husband's

THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, I wish I would have found that a long time ago before the world exam. It

84
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah definitely understandable.

85
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.550
THE QUEENS LG: I was on those when I was 13 and 15 I was taking those the doctor gave him to me.

86
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

87
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.000
So, yeah.

88
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's young

89
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.810
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, I wasn't taken like a large amount, but I was taking them, you know,

90
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.810
THE QUEENS LG: At least once a week, so I can go to school and stuff.

91
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.950
THE QUEENS LG: And back then. I didn't know what was wrong with me. But now I know

92
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.910
THE QUEENS LG: For the Muslims. Good. Yeah, for the most part, I could talk myself through it but

93
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.890
THE QUEENS LG: There are those days.

94
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are those days for everybody, that's for sure.

95
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me some things that are working for you in your recovery that you've been doing cleaning

96
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.860
THE QUEENS LG: Our gardening.

97
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.040
THE QUEENS LG: That's about it.

98
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:29.790
THE QUEENS LG: I just stayed. I just basically stay away from the people that and it's hard but moving helped a little bit that I just stay away from the people that are doing that kind of stuff.

99
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.680
THE QUEENS LG: You know,

100
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.800
THE QUEENS LG: Basically, that's what helps me

101
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And are you going to any change of friends. Yeah, just

102
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.280
THE QUEENS LG: Online stuff what I do. The boys are

103
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right.

104
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:59.670
THE QUEENS LG: I used to. I used to have a counselor. I mean, because I went through a bunch of crap, you know, back in the day, because I was an alcoholic and I like drink every day for five years and I mean I do it.

105
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:08.010
THE QUEENS LG: And it was after my dad died that I started doing that and but I stopped that. And I was telling

106
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:21.090
THE QUEENS LG: Dr. Jamison, the other day that I did that. And I was a bartender and never touched a drop. I did. I still. I mean, I can now I can drink like a cocktail or something, you know, and stop but

107
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:29.070
THE QUEENS LG: There are those times that you know you go over three and it's parties on, you know, but I just try to stay out of this.

108
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.780
THE QUEENS LG: So, and I haven't had a problem with it since I stopped really

109
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how long goes out.

110
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.830
THE QUEENS LG: In 1996 I think

111
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.110
THE QUEENS LG: 96 or 95

112
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:53.850
THE QUEENS LG: But I drink and my dad died in 89 and I drank non stop for five years. I stayed drunk Morgan tonight. I mean, I went to work drunk.

113
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.530
THE QUEENS LG: You know,

114
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.760
THE QUEENS LG: nobody even knew I was drunk.

115
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:57.840
I was

116
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.880
THE QUEENS LG: I'm sure they could smell it, but they never said anything.

117
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:03.930
Yeah.

118
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.920
THE QUEENS LG: I think that was probably the drug that

119
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.130
THE QUEENS LG: Like ran me probably you know like I lost the job over it.

120
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.970
THE QUEENS LG: Because eventually, you know, found out

121
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

122
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that was a long time ago. So, so you engage in in bright heart. You go to one group, a week. Right.

123
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you're going to start engaging with individual therapy with me right

124
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So let's talk about some of the things that you and I can work on together.

125
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some of the things that you would like to work on while we, you and I are working together.

126
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.090
THE QUEENS LG: I don't know, probably

127
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.150
THE QUEENS LG: I have trouble with aggression, like I get his easy

128
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.010
THE QUEENS LG: You know,

129
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.640
THE QUEENS LG: I don't know why I you know like certain things.

130
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.100
THE QUEENS LG: Nobody knows I'm mad. I'm just, you know, insight on that.

131
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.120
THE QUEENS LG: I don't know. That's about all I could think

132
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.180
THE QUEENS LG: I don't think that I'll ever go back to pills. Again, I don't have the

133
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.570
THE QUEENS LG: Oh, sure. It's in the back of my head. Sometimes that

134
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.360
THE QUEENS LG: I never want to go through that again.

135
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.760
THE QUEENS LG: The sick. The word fulfills

136
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.980
Every day.

137
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you currently on Suboxone maintenance with us. Yeah.

138
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.280
THE QUEENS LG: I've been on Suboxone for going on three years next month.

139
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how is that been working for you.

140
00:11:49.110 --> 00:12:00.480
THE QUEENS LG: Good. Great. Don't ever try to get off it by yourself. No, not a good idea. I ran out one time and I couldn't find a doctor to give it to me. So I thought,

141
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:07.890
THE QUEENS LG: Let's just stop taking it and and then I was staying with my niece. And while I lived in a house on her property.

142
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.110
THE QUEENS LG: And I didn't want to tell her you know that I was taking Suboxone because you know how people are like,

143
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:28.980
THE QUEENS LG: Oh, she's a heroin addict little boy I've never touched ever touched heroin. And I'm like, so I was afraid to tell her you know that that's why what was wrong with me. So I figured, well, I could go like five days. She went on vacation, so I know I'm gonna go five days.

144
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.730
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah. No, that didn't work. I was so sick.

145
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.140
THE QUEENS LG: But so I went back on and that's when I found bright heart.

146
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.540
THE QUEENS LG: I got back

147
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.520
THE QUEENS LG: And he helped me get back on.

148
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's been working ever since.

149
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.000
Yeah.

150
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

151
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.640
THE QUEENS LG: I mean, I did have another doctor that gave him to me that he was tired.

152
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:58.110
THE QUEENS LG: So I had to go. I went to the street for a while, but then film right are

153
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:00.660
THE QUEENS LG: Way better

154
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Way better so

155
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me walk me through a little bit of your anger.

156
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry, tell me how it how it starts, and how it gets out of control.

157
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.720
THE QUEENS LG: You know, like I don't fly off the handle and okay that's

158
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:30.900
THE QUEENS LG: Um, I don't know, just maybe I'm spoiled or something, I don't know, I just like I get something doesn't go my way

159
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.400
THE QUEENS LG: I'll break things I like to break things will and then

160
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.410
THE QUEENS LG: It usually buy stuff and I'll be more but

161
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:49.140
THE QUEENS LG: Just stuff like that. I really haven't had an issue since I got separated from my current husband.

162
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:56.490
THE QUEENS LG: Because he's just a lot like not coming home and stay in God and working supposedly

163
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.530
THE QUEENS LG: Whatever else. It's kind of funny, you learn all about them when you leave, you know,

164
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. You never really know somebody 100% sure

165
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, that's for sure. Um,

166
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm having

167
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:14.460
Good.

168
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.330
THE QUEENS LG: Oh, I said, and I can't get like a straight answer. You know, like

169
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:31.350
THE QUEENS LG: He says he's gonna bring my stuff down here in a couple weeks. I can't never get an answer like when or how much of my stuff or he says he finds a trailer, but he doesn't tell me what the fray looks like.

170
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.640
THE QUEENS LG: He calls on his own terms, you know, and that just yeah

171
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:48.750
THE QUEENS LG: And I mean, you know, what is the trailer look like, where's the trailer at, you know, stuff like that, because it's like my life that is in limbo. You know what I mean.

172
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

173
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you currently in your, in your own place.

174
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.430
THE QUEENS LG: No I stay with my daughter and her husband and father

175
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:06.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay. And everything has been going. Okay. Yeah. Okay, good. How long have you been there.

176
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.240
THE QUEENS LG: Since the end of December.

177
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Since and that's when you and your husband split up. Yeah. No. Okay, God, yeah.

178
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

179
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I think that it's going to be important that we identify. First off, the triggers that that cause you know your anger flare ups and really be able to develop some kind of

180
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:47.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Action Plan for you to be able to recognize when it starts and being able to disassociate yourself from a situation before it gets too too much out of control. You know, because you don't want to be

181
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't want to be aggressive to people. You don't want to

182
00:15:52.410 --> 00:16:02.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, throw things and break things. I mean that's aggressive behavior. And obviously if you're breaking your own things you've got to turn around and, you know, replace those those things. And so you kind of want to

183
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be able to stop doing that. And therefore, save yourself some money in the long run. Right.

184
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:19.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and really identify when you start getting frustrated or start getting angry. Is it based out of hurt or is it based out of fear and

185
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:20.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

186
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.250
THE QUEENS LG: Probably both

187
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.950
THE QUEENS LG: A little bit of both. A little bit of both. Yeah.

188
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:39.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, being so and being able to identify the underlying the issues of it. You know, is it hurt, then what is exactly, you know, what is it exactly that you heard about, or if you're

189
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in sitting and fear in that moment, what exactly are you afraid of in that moment, but really being able to identify those aspects of it to help you learn how to

190
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:59.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Identify it before it gets too much and detach yourself from the situation calm yourself down until you're able to communicate and talk about it in a manner that's

191
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's helpful rather than hurting you or hurting you know the relationship any further than, you know, that kind of communication has in the past doesn't make sense.

192
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:18.600
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, yeah. Because, oh, I'll say things that I'm like, oh, God, why did I say that that was stupid.

193
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.740
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, because it doesn't help the situation it was bad.

194
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:23.940
Yeah.

195
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:36.870
THE QUEENS LG: Well, we were the other day. The other day I talked to him for about an hour. And of course, we talked about everything he wanted to be talked about. And when that was done. He wanted to go. And I'm like,

196
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:47.460
THE QUEENS LG: I got it, I got questions, you know, and I still haven't been able to get a hold of them. And it's like, oh contract me out. So, you know, I wrote this stupid letter, you know,

197
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:57.600
THE QUEENS LG: It was all pissed off and now i wish i wouldn't did it, but I still don't have any answers. You know, so how do you get over that. I mean,

198
00:17:59.130 --> 00:17:59.430
THE QUEENS LG: How do you

199
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.900
THE QUEENS LG: Because the next time I talk to them. I'm gonna flip out. So I already know it.

200
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, and it's really saying, you know, how, how is it that I can get my needs, or my answers from him in the best possible manner that he hears

201
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And sometimes, you know, we have to be okay with knowing that we're not going to get them there are some personality types that

202
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are just, you know, not forthcoming, and not able to give us what we need in that moment.

203
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:36.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And being able to identify that piece. Okay, this is how this is part of his personality. This is has he always communicated that way with you. Has he been

204
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:48.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the person that at one point in time you were able to get answers from or has he changed that part or if is, is this something that he's continually always, you know, done.

205
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because what we do is is are we, we put expectations on things. We put expectations on conversations

206
00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We put expectations on on relationships on people and when they don't meet that expectation. That's when we get irritated. We get hurt disappointed and that's when we react to

207
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:19.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That situation. Knowing going in that we're not going to get our needs met. And so that's how it becomes easy for us to act out in anger.

208
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, instead of saying, Okay, I know, I know this much about this person he you know he cannot answer a straight question and you know he's never been able to do that so

209
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I either need to accept him for that piece. And no, I'm not going to get the answers that I'm looking for, or find a way to communicate our needs and get our answers met in a way that meets his personality, which is, you know, can be

210
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of work and sometimes it doesn't work because there are some personalities that just can't give us those things that we need

211
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:08.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so being able to really kind of identify that whether or not he's that person that has never been able to give you the responses that he needs that you need, you know,

212
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is he that

213
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.280
THE QUEENS LG: He never

214
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:20.880
THE QUEENS LG: He never he is no he doesn't answer anything. You know, it's like he answers with a question or he answers with

215
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:35.640
THE QUEENS LG: Basically with a question. It's always like, well, if I asked him, did you go here, here, here, and he's like, well, did you go here, here, here, you know, it's, yeah. He's never given me and I would been with him for 17 years

216
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.940
THE QUEENS LG: And he's never answered me,

217
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Never giving you the straight. No.

218
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:49.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: straight answers. And that's kind of an evasive tactic to be able to turn the tables around on you.

219
00:20:49.980 --> 00:21:03.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exactly. Instead of, you know, giving you the information that you're looking for. And I'm sure I just have no doubt that you have told him, you know, or repeatedly, you know, many times. Can you just answer my questions right

220
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:12.420
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah. Oh, it's just like when we split up. It's and and he even and now he even act like we're not even split up. I'm like,

221
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:25.770
THE QUEENS LG: You're the one that told me they you know you didn't want to do this. I said it when we were getting ready to, you know, when we had to move and stuff. So he's going to try to put me in this shitty trailer. And I'm like,

222
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:35.190
THE QUEENS LG: I'm not living in some $500 broken ass trailer, you know, and I mean I've already lived in several situations where I didn't have water for almost two years and

223
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:44.880
THE QUEENS LG: No electricity. And I mean, you know, and I learned how to do it. Oh, Pat, Lori on the back because she learned how to do that stuff, you know, and I did it well and then

224
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.070
THE QUEENS LG: So I wasn't about to go back into that situation because I did it for a long time.

225
00:21:50.760 --> 00:22:07.620
THE QUEENS LG: Right. So when you know so for like the year that we stated as nice as on her property. I asked him all the time. Is this like he kind of like dropped me off there and took off, you know, went back up in the mountains and worked up wherever he's working he's working on a week.

226
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:15.990
THE QUEENS LG: And I'm like, you know, if you want to go up there and stay up there for four weeks or what however long you know, just let me know what you're doing.

227
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:21.240
THE QUEENS LG: Oh no, that's not what I'm doing. I'm just doing it long enough to make money to get a truck. Well, he gets a truck.

228
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:31.140
THE QUEENS LG: And then, you know, he's still doesn't come back home and and I'm like, you know, I feel stupid living it as nice as house because it's not my family, you know,

229
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:42.720
THE QUEENS LG: And we didn't really get along in the first place. And so anyways me. And as these become good friends. And then, you know, she's putting little bugs in my ear. And so I'm asking them questions all the time like

230
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:51.480
THE QUEENS LG: Well, is it, you know, do you just want to separate. I mean, you know, it might be better if we aren't even together because you're never here, you know, well, is that what you want.

231
00:22:52.470 --> 00:23:01.410
THE QUEENS LG: You know, I'm asking you, you know, don't, don't read counter with a question or whatever. That's called don't come back at me with a question if

232
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.230
THE QUEENS LG: If I wanted to leave. I would have said, hey, I want to leave. Is that what you want. You know, that's what I would have said.

233
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:18.960
THE QUEENS LG: But oh man, so like two days before I get to where I'm at now i i'm asking them all the way up until then for months, you know, is this what you want and then

234
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:28.020
THE QUEENS LG: He's like woman, he had to take one of my dogs to the pound. And he's like, So what are you going to do, dude. I'm waiting for you to buy me this.

235
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:42.840
THE QUEENS LG: Trailer that I found that was really nice and supposedly it wasn't in his eyes. But anyways, I said, so what are we going to do, you know, once I get down to the Bay Area. I mean, it's not like are you gonna, we're going to be together. What, no, I don't think so.

236
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:51.240
THE QUEENS LG: Don't tell me this eight months ago when I started asking you, you know, wait until the day before I leave, which I thought was crap.

237
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.940
THE QUEENS LG: And so now, and that's where it's been left. It's like, boom, that's where I'm left

238
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:16.590
THE QUEENS LG: He's got my stuff in storage. It's under his name only. It's not under my name, so I can't even pay it. I can't go get it. You know, so yeah I'm left in limbo that pisses me off. And I'm just like, I don't like that somebody else will the cards for me, you know,

239
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.890
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, I gotta be in control of that. So yeah.

240
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:28.590
THE QUEENS LG: And he doesn't get it. Well, don't worry about it. Don't let stuff go well he's up was already. Last time I talked to him. He was two weeks later and the the

241
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.160
THE QUEENS LG: Bill to the storage and I can't get the lady won't let

242
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.690
THE QUEENS LG: Whoever doesn't want accept money. I don't know, but

243
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.820
You know, it's like PayPal.

244
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:49.890
THE QUEENS LG: And I can't get my name, put on it, unless I go down there in person with him. He can't even give me a time to do that, you know, it's like, I don't get nothing out of them.

245
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:57.480
THE QUEENS LG: He was supposed to send me money. He doesn't send me money. Oh, I'll send you money in a couple days. I haven't heard from in a couple weeks maybe

246
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.270
So, yeah.

247
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's totally. I understand that frustration, big time, especially when he's holding all the cards for all of your stuff, you know,

248
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.800
THE QUEENS LG: And so how I mean how do you approach like the next time I talked to him. It's going to be like, why am I talking about

249
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:27.000
THE QUEENS LG: You know what I'm going to freak out because I don't like being left like that, you know, and this I promise I'll call you right back, you know, and I knew he wasn't going to call back

250
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:41.820
THE QUEENS LG: So I wasn't really mad at the fact that he didn't call back. I was mad at the fact I still haven't got an answer. And he's supposedly bringing my stuff down here in two weeks, but who knows, I don't know, I'm not going to go look for a storage. If I don't know.

251
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.920
THE QUEENS LG: You know, I'm not gonna waste my time.

252
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:54.180
THE QUEENS LG: So, and he'll be the type that just pops up over here. And he's like, no, here's the stuff. Deal with it, you know. No, I can't do that either.

253
00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.600
THE QUEENS LG: So yeah, you're

254
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:00.660
THE QUEENS LG: Right.

255
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're definitely stuck and are your plans to

256
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get a divorce or

257
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.690
Are your plans minor

258
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:29.040
THE QUEENS LG: Minor. Well, I don't see any sense of being with them. I mean, not with his actions, you know, I mean, I don't even care what he's got going on. I don't, you know, but I just 17 years of this, what I'm going through now you know I'm just I can't take it anymore. I don't, I don't want to do it.

259
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's a long time to be in

260
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.760
THE QUEENS LG: Right, and then to just, you know,

261
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.500
THE QUEENS LG: Basically just like oh well doing to me. He's I'm in the same position. I was 17 years ago.

262
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:51.630
THE QUEENS LG: What am I doing, I don't know. He holds all the key you know all the cards since I've met him I haven't been able to work.

263
00:26:52.140 --> 00:27:01.890
THE QUEENS LG: Well, not because of him, it's not his fault, but my health and stuff too. So I went on SSI and that doesn't pay me anything not compared to what I'm used to.

264
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:12.030
THE QUEENS LG: And so I can't really go out and rent my own place. Oh my god, the rent here is insane. But, you know, so I'm just basically stuck.

265
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:24.990
THE QUEENS LG: You know, without his money or contribution which I really wasn't getting anyway because he's not the type to I never even knew how much money he made so 17 years of Laura's never know what his paycheck.

266
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.850
