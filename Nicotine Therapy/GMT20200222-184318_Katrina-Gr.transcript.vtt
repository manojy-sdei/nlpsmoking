00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.820
Nokia 3 V: Because literally I was in bed. I was, I lived here for for three weeks I'm less

102
00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.910
Katrina Groves: Hope you drink fluids.

103
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.460
Nokia 3 V: That was all I could, yeah, that was all I could do is drink water. Everything else I threw up.

104
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.070
Nokia 3 V: Even the water sometimes

105
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.680
Nokia 3 V: So, I mean, I would have to drink water and then throw up and then drink water and throw up and

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:29.160
Nokia 3 V: Good stuff. I need to go and do that. Yeah, I didn't, I didn't do it last year. And yeah, I usually do. So I'm gonna I'm gonna start doing that again.

108
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:39.840
Katrina Groves: The reason I'm looking over to my right is because I have your del Norte clinic record on my other computer and I'm good at memory, but I know all this stuff about you.

109
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.330
Katrina Groves: But yeah, your last

110
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.910
Katrina Groves: What's your last shot pneumonia, you still smoke cigarettes Johnny or pot.

111
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.690
Nokia 3 V: Now I just started smoking. Again, I don't really smoke pot.

112
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.610
Nokia 3 V: Anymore.

113
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.860
Nokia 3 V: I know it's stress lately I had quit.

114
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.270
Nails.

115
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.550
Nokia 3 V: I didn't buy a pack of cigarettes until like it was like three days ago. Wow.

116
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.070
Nokia 3 V: So I just need to stop.

117
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:21.210
Katrina Groves: Yeah, you do. And you should get the pneumonia vaccine every time you light up one of those cigarettes. Just think about how horrible you felt with that pneumonia, because you will get it again like that. If you're smoking.

118
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.640
Katrina Groves: It just wipes out all your, your body's ability to get that virus out of your system.

119
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.430
Nokia 3 V: Yeah, okay. That's something to think about. Because I didn't, I didn't feel good at all. Yeah.

120
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.920
Katrina Groves: Alright, so any other problems you have high blood pressure. Did you get your hep C treated or do you still have Pepsi.

121
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.970
Nokia 3 V: It's treated as far as I know, it's undetectable.

122
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.060
Nokia 3 V: Yeah, I was pretty happy about that.

123
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:59.280
Katrina Groves: And then I have spinal stenosis L for five that you had your surgery on two and a half years ago. Oh, sleep apnea still

124
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.270
Katrina Groves: Yep. I bet with that 30 pound weight loss that might better

125
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.760
Nokia 3 V: Um, I probably did because I laid in bed and that's all I did was sleep.

126
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.090
Nokia 3 V: But I don't know. Sometimes I used to use the mask. Sometimes they don't.

127
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.190
Nokia 3 V: It like when I have it on it tries my mouth out

128
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.220
Nokia 3 V: To the point where it's when I wake up, it's

129
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:31.290
Nokia 3 V: It's uncomfortable. Like, I mean I drive my drives my mouth down my throat out and everything to the point where it's uncomfortable.

130
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.900
Nokia 3 V: So sometimes I don't wear it.

131
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.480
Nokia 3 V: But it helps with the snoring so

132
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.220
You should

133
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.560
Katrina Groves: Try to talk to the Lynn care or whoever they can maybe fix they get a humidifier for you. There's a way to

134
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.370
Katrina Groves: Play with

135
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.540
Nokia 3 V: Another thing I wanted to talk about

136
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.070
Nokia 3 V: I don't know if I talk to you about this or just in that

137
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.630
Nokia 3 V: I need to find someplace where it's happening.

138
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.310
Nokia 3 V: When I'm taking notes at school.

139
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.910
Nokia 3 V: Like it's like I go to sleep, or I lose consciousness or

140
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.770
Nokia 3 V: I don't know what it is man, but it makes me start writing funny.

141
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.450
Nokia 3 V: And

142
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.980
Nokia 3 V: It's like I write small smaller letters and

143
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.850
Katrina Groves: Are you like asleep while you're writing

144
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.250
Nokia 3 V: I think it's more that

145
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.690
Nokia 3 V: It's not just going to sleep. I don't think because when I come to you. It's like I have a funny feeling

146
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.410
Nokia 3 V: So thing. I mean, I don't feel normal.

147
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.750
Katrina Groves: Realizing that starting to happen to you. Do you feel something funny like

148
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.640
Katrina Groves: What's happening.

149
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:57.270
Nokia 3 V: I'm starting to notice when it's when it's gonna happen. And then when it does happen it like tends to happen for that.

150
00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.820
Nokia 3 V: For that entire morning

151
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.050
Nokia 3 V: And then usually by the afternoon. It doesn't really

152
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.250
Nokia 3 V: Define what it is that

153
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.500
Katrina Groves: You actually lose sense of time, like you wake up like you just fell asleep, kind of thing like

154
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.640
Nokia 3 V: jerkily. Yeah.

155
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.760
Nokia 3 V: Well, because normally I write really clear.

156
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.840
Nokia 3 V: That it close and I have I have really good handwriting, or I take notes really clear.

157
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.590
Nokia 3 V: Yeah, so I could not, I noticed the difference. I can tell the difference when

158
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.640
Nokia 3 V: It happens because it ends up looking like

159
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.910
Nokia 3 V: Like this.

160
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.800
Nokia 3 V: Like this on top.

161
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:50.730
Katrina Groves: Of turns a little more right okay there. So okay, so you can't even read what you're saying.

162
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.050
Nokia 3 V: Nope.

163
00:12:52.680 --> 00:13:01.740
Katrina Groves: So there could be a possibility of a. It's called a partial complex seizure. It's no no that is what it is but need to go show that

164
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.130
Nokia 3 V: To us, okay. Yeah.

165
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.940
Katrina Groves: And they can do any eg you know you've had a lot of brain injury in your life and alcohol and the drugs and

166
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.700
Nokia 3 V: Recently just had a concussion.

167
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.740
Katrina Groves: Oh, did you I didn't know about that.

168
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.280
Nokia 3 V: happened last year at the end of last semester.

169
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:32.610
Nokia 3 V: Me and Jen were down there during finals week and some crazy guy jumped out and like started attacking and I got hit in the head with a

170
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.950
Nokia 3 V: With one of those butane. It's like a butane tank and had a torch.

171
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.100
Nokia 3 V: Attached to it. So I got hit in the head like four or five times and then he hit the side of the truck and

172
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:52.020
Nokia 3 V: It was kind of a big ordeal, I guess. Yeah, so that you had some damage to that part of the brain.

173
00:13:52.650 --> 00:14:02.340
Nokia 3 V: Well, definitely. Um, it affected my final skills. I mean, at least on two classes. I went into those classes with AES. So I was going into finals with AES and

174
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:13.200
Nokia 3 V: Really, all I had to do a score like above 85 or something to maintain that and I score so low that every like drop my grades down to almost barely bees.

175
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.640
Nokia 3 V: TAKE IT THAT ARE YOU STILL

176
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.930
Katrina Groves: So what are you

177
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.450
Katrina Groves: Tell me about your college

178
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.170
Nokia 3 V: I'm going, I'm going to college now for

179
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.010
Nokia 3 V: I got accepted to the social work program.

180
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:40.170
Nokia 3 V: Right. And so now I'm in my second semester of my junior year and going through things. It goes by fast goes by really fast.

181
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.130
Katrina Groves: That's all to help troubled youth.

182
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:45.930
Nokia 3 V: Um,

183
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.520
Katrina Groves: Are you changing that.

184
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.760
Nokia 3 V: No, I think that's part of it. I think I might want to get more into just like the entire family.

185
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.820
Nokia 3 V: Um, but then I started thinking shit if I can't keep my own fucking family together. How am I gonna help anyone else.

186
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.300
Katrina Groves: You have good experience and

187
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.670
Katrina Groves: You learn from that. Yeah. Some of the best best

188
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.550
Katrina Groves: Pony has been through it. Yeah.

189
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.630
Yeah.

190
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.240
Katrina Groves: Don't give up on yourself.

191
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:24.360
Nokia 3 V: Yeah, so that's what I'm going to continue doing. I'm going to try to get into the master's program and and go, it would be a year longer than

192
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.170
Nokia 3 V: Just my bachelor's so I go for one more year

193
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.000
Nokia 3 V: Masters.

194
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:37.110
Nokia 3 V: I'm having are like if I select them having a harder time processing.

195
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.820
Nokia 3 V: Like what I read, sometimes I will read it and

196
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.820
Nokia 3 V: I gotta read it again because I mean I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to tell you what the hell I just read

197
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:53.730
Nokia 3 V: Mm hmm. So I'll go through it and then I'll even I'll even do is like flashcards and stuff for all the

198
00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:04.830
Nokia 3 V: For all the vocab words and I'll go through read the chapter, and I'll look at the questions at the end of the chapter in life. Fucking for the life of me I can't

199
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:20.580
Nokia 3 V: I have to go look it up. I would just, I won't know it off the top of my head. And this is right after reading it, you know, it's like, I don't know about an hour. I guess sometimes an hour and a half, it takes for you to read the whole chapter or go through a chapter

200
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.590
Nokia 3 V: But it seems like I would retain that i mean you know he's had before.

201
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.020
Nokia 3 V: I've never had problems with like tests and

202
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.330
Nokia 3 V: Just lately I have class for sure. Yeah, and it

203
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.280
Katrina Groves: Obviously, you've got several things going on, emotionally and physically so

204
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.040
Katrina Groves: It can do they have

205
00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:53.040
Katrina Groves: That disabled students thing where you could just say hey you know I had that concussion. I've had, I've had my phone. I need to have longer for tests and

206
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.450
Nokia 3 V: Yeah, I get. I get, they call them accommodations, I guess.

207
00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.470
Nokia 3 V: That's

208
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:07.650
Nokia 3 V: Where I get like time and a half, and then I take my tests in the testing center. So it's quiet and no there's less distractions.

209
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:19.380
Nokia 3 V: But like for the classes I'm taking, we don't really ever lot the last semester when we barely had any tests, maybe one or two tests. I think the whole thing, but they just kind of

210
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:26.610
Nokia 3 V: kept track of our progress through like a lot of talking, you know, they just talk to you.

211
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:39.210
Nokia 3 V: So, you know, they figure out whether you're reading or whether you know the material or, you know, so they don't really test all that much. So it seemed like it was a lot of homework, either.

212
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.060
Nokia 3 V: But then when there was there like huge papers like 10 page papers. We got it right.

213
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.030
Nokia 3 V: Which isn't a problem. I got a paper do this Sunday, and I haven't even started yet.

214
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.680
Katrina Groves: One of those

215
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.240
Nokia 3 V: Yeah.

216
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:03.810
Katrina Groves: Let me pull you back to medical stuff to any allergies to anything that you're allergic to, like,

217
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.810
Nokia 3 V: More morphine. I'm allergic to

218
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:07.920

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:19.020
Nokia 3 V: itching and I have spoke yeah like breaking my face breaks out my face, everything gets so hot around my neck area. I'm just scratching.

221
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.630
Katrina Groves: And then back to your

222
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:29.040
Katrina Groves: Surgery histories, you've already told me about the back in the hip replacement. Did you ever have your tonsils out or

223
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.270
Nokia 3 V: ankle surgery. Oh, ankle and how long ago was that

224
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.460
Nokia 3 V: That was in 2000

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.120
Katrina Groves: Any other hospitalizations.

226
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.870

228
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.020
Nokia 3 V: Which happened three years ago, four years ago.

229
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:11.130
Nokia 3 V: Maybe four and a half, five years ago, um, other than that, there was a there was a time in 2006 that I got stabbed 17 times and my all of my side right here in punctured my lung.

230
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.520
Nokia 3 V: So I had to get reinstated and neighbors life flighted me out by helicopter. Mm hmm.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.090
Nokia 3 V: Like hardware. I guess installed in her body like

236
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.170
Nokia 3 V: A really bad wreck.

237
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.540
Nokia 3 V: She wasn't supposed to walk again. But she's kind of stubborn.

238
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.190
Nokia 3 V: When they told her she wasn't gonna walk again. She just kind of said you

239
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.440
Katrina Groves: Have drug and alcohol issues.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.850
Nokia 3 V: Stop drinking

245
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.710
Katrina Groves: Now, your dad also did drugs and alcohol. And so he's still living.

246
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:29.550
Nokia 3 V: Um, no. My dad died when I was 18 or when I when he was 18 and I was five months old.

247
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:39.750
Nokia 3 V: So I guess he didn't really do much drinking buddy. He drank. I don't think he could be considered an alcoholic yet. Yeah.

248
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:47.310
Nokia 3 V: But my mom, my dad side there is history of substance abuse or sugar.

249
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.270

256
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.830
Nokia 3 V: Oh yeah, I asked how I go about that. Do I go to the ER, I think.

257
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:34.380
Katrina Groves: No, I think they have ordered you those labs at the clinic. If you told them, you're a patient at the donut. Can we help center than they should affects them there. Some people

258
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.610
Nokia 3 V: Get it back.

259
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:41.880
Katrina Groves: To Sutter and I'd rather people go to the clinic so you can go next time you see Tony just go to the lab. They

260
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.590
Nokia 3 V: Will they'll know they'll know which labs today.

261
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.890
Nokia 3 V: Okay, all right, but

262
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:56.400
Katrina Groves: Cholesterol, my good friends in your family, you know, you've lost 30 pounds. That was kind of a good thing, but you should get your

263
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.600
Nokia 3 V: Last time I got check for it. I was, I was pretty good, actually. The

264
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:16.050
Nokia 3 V: Last time I got check for most everything but I mean I'm worried now though I've gotten a little bit older, since last time I like went to a complete checkup. I'm pretty fearful of like

265
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.500
Nokia 3 V: Certain things, I guess, cancer, like terrified of cancer.

266
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.180
Nokia 3 V: So,

267
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:24.930
My grandma.

268
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:34.620
Nokia 3 V: My grandma, my grandma passed away from cervical cancer and are just maybe the complications from it.

269
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.260

271
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:56.070
Nokia 3 V: So I don't know, like most of my dad's families all they all died that was 12 kids and I think there's two of them that are still alive. Well,

272
00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.890
Katrina Groves: While you are, you know, we're on the planet. As long as we're on the planet. So

273
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.590
Katrina Groves: You can until then.

274
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.140
Nokia 3 V: It is all part of the cycle.

275
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.790
Katrina Groves: Is so

276
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.300
Katrina Groves: You're not working now. Just going to school.

277
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.120
Nokia 3 V: full time student. Yeah, I do.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:32.430
Nokia 3 V: Um, I haven't found a place are having the started but I'm supposed to start doing internship hours as well. At some point throughout. I'm not sure if we do it this semester. But last semester I did internship hours to Europe food distribution.

279
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:33.690
I

280
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.060
Nokia 3 V: Was kind of filled up my days, I guess, like I am in the days I wasn't going to school.

281
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.690
Katrina Groves: For your substance abuse history just start from the beginning. I know this is something you've gone through a few

282
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.350
Nokia 3 V: Times that

283
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.850
Katrina Groves: You can give the abridged version. At what age you started using anything

284
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.310
Nokia 3 V: Alcohol pot and okay

285
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.400
Nokia 3 V: First thing I tried was marijuana

286
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.550
Nokia 3 V: That kind of started when I was about seven

287
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.910
Nokia 3 V: Alcohol, I guess.

288
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:11.940
Nokia 3 V: I remember when I was like the kids like I was five years old or some I would go around and like my parents had parties and stuff.

289
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:21.570
Nokia 3 V: And I would go around and pick up all the beer cans of stuff. And sometimes I would take drinks of it. But I don't think that I actually started drinking until I was

290
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:29.430
Nokia 3 V: Like 11 or 12 maybe like, I mean, drinking regular regular just meant the weekends.

291
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.630
Nokia 3 V: Went to school all week party on the weekends.

292
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.970
Nokia 3 V: So I'll call started then best started when I was 18

293
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.180
Nokia 3 V: Like heroin started when I was 35

294
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.880
Nokia 3 V: And like aftermath are after heroin.

295
00:24:54.990 --> 00:25:01.110
Nokia 3 V: I got hooked on heroin and prison. When I got out. I didn't know where to find heroin and so

296
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.950
Nokia 3 V: That's when I got hurt. And so I was prescribed a whole bunch of North Coast and

297
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:10.440
Nokia 3 V: Sending off.

298
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.960
Nokia 3 V: And so I guess that kind of took the place of heroin at the time and

299
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:25.020
Nokia 3 V: But I still relapsed on it. Even then, so that's basically my history. I never, I never really tried anything else.

300
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.860
Nokia 3 V: Acid. I guess I did acid, a couple of times when I was

301
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.750
Nokia 3 V: In high school,

302
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.520
Nokia 3 V: And

303
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.150
Katrina Groves: You did IV drugs as well, not just by eating.

304
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.530
Nokia 3 V: Yeah.

305
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:38.400
Nokia 3 V: And

306
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.770
Katrina Groves: You get HIV testing.

307
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.400
Nokia 3 V: Know, oh I got I got tested for HIV. Yeah, every six months when I was in prison and I've gotten it tested.

308
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.550
Nokia 3 V: A couple of times since I've been out

309
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.420
Katrina Groves: And then the current dose of Suboxone. How is that working for you.

310
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.320
Nokia 3 V: I don't know.

311
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.810
Nokia 3 V: I don't know what it is but

312
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:11.190
Nokia 3 V: I don't want to say after like anymore because I to me that makes you sound like a real drug addict.

313
00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:11.910
Katrina Groves: Right.

314
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.650
Nokia 3 V: I know I am a real drug addict.

315
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.400

Nokia 3 V: I'm not a fake ones, but

317
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.080
Nokia 3 V: I guess there's pride in that

318
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.450
Katrina Groves: So how do you go strips.

319
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.780
Nokia 3 V: Um, I usually take them.

320
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.640
Nokia 3 V: Take them pretty regular sometimes they take two at a time, though.

321
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.110
Nokia 3 V: So,

322
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:47.490
Nokia 3 V: Yeah. Throughout the day, while I'm in the morning when I wake up, that's when I'll take you and then like throughout the day, I'll take the rest of them. So sometimes I take more than what my prescription is and I end up at the end of the week kicking half of like I have to

323
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:54.750
Nokia 3 V: I have to stretch it out. So I am yeah so I end up like either cut them in half and just kind of

324
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.050
Nokia 3 V: Stay on like a maintenance, I guess.

325
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.780
Katrina Groves: How does that feel when

326
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:10.650
Katrina Groves: When you're taking more at the beginning of the month and then you're down to less I, how does that affect your mood, your everything your physicality when you're having

327
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.510
Nokia 3 V: Me time towards the end of the month.

328
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.920
Nokia 3 V: I feel like I'm constantly hired regardless of how much sleep like it.

329
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.640
Nokia 3 V: Was a except for like 12 hours straight, and then I woke up and I was still falling asleep during school

330
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:33.450
Nokia 3 V: So I was like, I still felt tired through the whole day and that feeling doesn't ever really go away like I'm I feel like I'm constantly tired.

331
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.370
Katrina Groves: Even when you take more than you're willing to take for

332
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:45.120
Nokia 3 V: Know when I take more oh my god I got energy, I'm able to stay up I'm able to, I'm able to

333
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.580
Nokia 3 V: do my homework.

334
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.360
Nokia 3 V: Get everything turned in on time.

335
00:27:52.860 --> 00:28:00.900
Nokia 3 V: On me was like focus. I don't forget about my meeting and I realized that I missed it and have to make it up.

336
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.230
Katrina Groves: Anyone ever tell you that you had a DD

337
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.240
ADHD.

338
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.700
Nokia 3 V: Nobody's ever told me that

339
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:17.940
Katrina Groves: You feel like that you have tendencies towards that, as far as not being able to focus or pay attention or losing concentration, things like that.

340
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.170
Um,

341
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.730
Nokia 3 V: I guess sometimes I've never really thought about it.

342
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.010
Nokia 3 V: So,

343
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:38.310
Nokia 3 V: I don't cyclist certain like when I was when I was in jail and reading a book I could sit there and read a book for hours and never lose consciousness.

344
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:50.070
Nokia 3 V: But now it's like it's different. Now when I start reading. I was like, I want to go to sleep. And I can almost like I can lay down almost at any point throughout the day. And within five or 10 minutes, obviously.

345
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.380
Katrina Groves: And that's even with your see pop

346
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.610
Nokia 3 V: Yeah.

347
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.110
Katrina Groves: That's for a while. You weren't using it right there was a week you were borrowing. Those are some weird

348
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.200
Nokia 3 V: Yeah, I ended up getting a mask so that, but the one I borrowed from Lance

349
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.750
Nokia 3 V: Was a lot smaller. So like it didn't fit like is

350
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.830
Katrina Groves: You're out

351
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.240
Nokia 3 V: Yeah, so I ended up

352
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.750
Nokia 3 V: I ended up with another one that I had borrowed from

353
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.740
Nokia 3 V: Jen's a dad. And so I gotta replacements, but it's like every time that

354
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:31.800
Nokia 3 V: Lynn care costs and I put the order in for the replacement parts. You know, I hardly ever shows up. Yeah.

355
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.510
Katrina Groves: I think you just gotta keep pushing on that because sleep apnea. If you don't get good sleep at night.

356
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:47.250
Katrina Groves: You are falling asleep in your soup, literally, so you they need to work with you. You need to be pushing them to get you the right kind of fit. Maybe you need the nose pillows. Instead, I mean, who knows.

357
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.730
Nokia 3 V: Yeah.

358
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:53.190
Katrina Groves: But that's so important because otherwise you have no you have such that

359
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.420
Nokia 3 V: It's it's bad. It's bad.

360
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.630
Nokia 3 V: I know that at some point. I'm not one of my uncle's had to end up getting a

361
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.160
Katrina Groves: Oh wow, a trick.

362
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:17.160
Nokia 3 V: Yeah okay because of his and I mean I think that was due to the weight that he gained. Mm hmm. And I used to think he was just huge. But I'm not so far behind them. At this point, like 280 pounds.

363
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:27.900
Nokia 3 V: And there's the biggest I've ever been so mobility. I want to start exercising and then it's like the motivation. I don't know where to find the motivation.

364
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:38.940
Nokia 3 V: And this is strange to me because my entire life. I've been an athlete. I've always been able to like exercise was. It was a huge part of my daily routine. I would do it every day.

365
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.800
Nokia 3 V: Well, I played football. I was on the wrestling team. I played basketball. When you and I played baseball

366
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:53.220
Nokia 3 V: played soccer, but I played EVERYTHING I CAN everything I could really

367
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.230
Nokia 3 V: I mean, I was good at hamble I was good at, like, all kinds of others.

368
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.650
Nokia 3 V: Like physically active things racquetball

369
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.360
Nokia 3 V: You know,

370
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:08.280
Katrina Groves: So what one thing. Could you do. Now that's a baby step that you could

371
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.740
Katrina Groves: Do to try to increase your, your exercise.

372
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:26.520
Nokia 3 V: Right now, like I feel like I'm constantly stretching, if that makes sense. You know, I'm like I'm constantly. Yeah. So I mean it's usually to deal with my legs.

373
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:36.540
Nokia 3 V: My back and my hips and so all these all stretch and it's like, all day from your home sitting just sitting and watching TV.

374
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:49.380
Nokia 3 V: I'll figure out how to throw my leg up on the chair Simon's just stretch, but I still feel like I'm like so tight that if I tried to run on a ride a bike or anything like that. I feel like that hurt myself. Yeah.

375
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.130
So what

376
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.770
Katrina Groves: What is something you can do besides that's not running or riding a bike. What is what is something

377
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.910
Nokia 3 V: Like walking on the beach. I'm sure we'll just walking

378
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:00.900
Nokia 3 V: Yeah.

379
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.040
Katrina Groves: Get out of the house and go for a walk. It doesn't matter where it is.

380
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:05.970
Nokia 3 V: Just stop.

381
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.120
By the liquor store and not to the gambling casino.

382
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:30.090
Katrina Groves: Nature with nature is one of those coping skills you have you can get out on the ocean or look, you know, walk out be with nature and that will that will do two things. Three things. Number one, it gets you out of your head and out of the house and out of your spiral of depression.

383
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:30.990
Nokia 3 V: Yeah.

384
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:37.320
Katrina Groves: Number two, it will start conditioning, your body. You're not too old. You're only 45

385
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.040
Nokia 3 V: Yeah.

386
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:48.870
Katrina Groves: Your heart will start pumping your blood will start moving your, your lungs will breathe. Your bones will feel better. You're going to feel it will increase those endorphins and you're going to feel better just walking

387
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:56.010
Katrina Groves: And you know you don't push it right you do the first you go out for a blocker. So, you know, I come in. I'm so tired you stop and you wait

388
00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:06.600
Katrina Groves: Okay, fine. After weeks after weeks after weeks. It's like anything else, you know, you have to like how you studied for your classes, you just didn't get your bachelor's degree by

389
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.150
Katrina Groves: On your butt right yeah to work.

390
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.230
Yeah.

391
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:11.820
Katrina Groves: But I think

392
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:21.780
Katrina Groves: If there's anything that you could do would be just to walk a little bit start walking and that will help everything mind body spirit.

393
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.340
Nokia 3 V: I'm gonna try

394
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:32.520
Nokia 3 V: I get it. Well, I just, I got to schedule it in. Yeah, if I don't schedule it and then you know

395
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.290
Nokia 3 V: missing out on something else.

396
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.060
Katrina Groves: Where would you schedule that in

397
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:42.240
Nokia 3 V: Like I'm I'm I'm Monday mornings or Monday, Wednesday or Friday mornings.

398
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.980
Nokia 3 V: What happens on Thursdays.

399
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:50.370
Nokia 3 V: On those days I don't go to school. So I'm here. And that's, those are the days I usually just stay and do homework.

400
00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.010
Katrina Groves: You have kids to school.

401
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.150
In the morning

402
00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:06.120
Nokia 3 V: But they're, they're gone from my air at eight o'clock or 805 and by then they're both awesome at school. So from then until about 1250 I don't have

403
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:15.090
Nokia 3 V: I don't have any kids here to watch. So during that time would be the perfect time to go out and I don't know. They probably want to go with me.

404
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.940
Katrina Groves: Do you think it would be

405
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:25.440
Katrina Groves: A good to do in the right right after you drop the kids off or do you think it would be

406
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.790
Katrina Groves: Better when they get home from school or

407
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.720
Nokia 3 V: I think that I think that um

408
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:36.060
Nokia 3 V: I don't know.

409
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.350
Nokia 3 V: I don't know if they like. They like to exercise to the like walking down to the park and

410
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:44.010
Katrina Groves: You can do it.

411
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.950
Nokia 3 V: I could do it. I'm thinking

412
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.900
Katrina Groves: In the morning, you're up. You're getting the kids to school Monday, Wednesday, Friday, maybe just make like a

413
00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:57.630
Katrina Groves: Schedule IT IN THAT THAT'S WHEN JOHNNY takes is walking. That's your meantime

414
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.540
Katrina Groves: Yeah, that's your time to process stuff.

415
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:08.790
Katrina Groves: And think about the day. And what you're going to do. And that gets your heart and your body going and then you'll study better. Actually, you're probably more awake and

416
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:15.750
Katrina Groves: And then you can do it again. When the kids get up a school, but I like the idea for like what you said. Morning Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

417
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:19.740
Katrina Groves: I'm going to ask you about it next time we get together.

418
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:20.820
Okay.

419
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:32.880
Katrina Groves: I'm going to go through some calls. We're almost done, but a review of systems where I'm just going to start at the top of your head and go down and you just tell me yes or no. If you have any of these things in the past.

420
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.910
Katrina Groves: week or two, not like the whole life.

421
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.670
Katrina Groves: So any Fevers or chills.

422
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.010
Nokia 3 V: A little, yeah.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:56.160
Nokia 3 V: It's like an air purifier. I guess I'm so I got it sitting right next to me, I always have it on high.

427
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.890
Nokia 3 V: And then sometimes even sleep at the window open

428
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.080
Nokia 3 V: Because I get. I get so hot that

429

435
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:23.610
