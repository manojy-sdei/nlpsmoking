Lauren Anderson: Okay.

12
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.610

13
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.780
Lauren Anderson: That's weird. Yeah.

14
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But I watched people and they're like, well, one side work. So I'm just pass it along. Oh, you just seem like you feel better. Are you feeling a little better.

16
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Your insurance is covering that

17
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.330
Lauren Anderson: Oh, well, the good Rx coupon. It's pretty reasonable. I still haven't my insurance has lapsed right now, and it'll be cheap.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Cheap. Okay.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, let's we'll get into that maybe a little later today. I've got to just dive right in and get into some of these questions so

22
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be quiet for just a moment, as I do this opening up the record.

23
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.810
Oh, that's not it. This is an initial assessment.

24
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: All my coffee has not been digested. I went out and tried to do a shopping

25
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually found toilet paper.

26
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.260
Lauren Anderson: Ones. It's always empty.

Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like a lion cougar, you know, life site. Yes.

28
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.570

Lauren Anderson: People are panicking on

31
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: A boy. So yeah, I went into Costco and I just went by to see if there was a long line I walked right in and I got one of the big, big toilet papers. I just feel like, like a conqueror.

32
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.380
Yeah.

33
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.140

Gwenevere Abriel: Variable. Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm jumping on here without doing my shower so I'm just a little Trudy doubt I like I shouted. I haven't showered yet but I'm

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.110
Lauren Anderson: Part of the beauty of the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Medicine. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

40
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so today I just, again, I want to apologize. It's gonna it's gonna sound like this.

43
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is the bio psychosocial and I've got to get, you know, where were you born

Lauren Anderson: That's okay. I tend to go on and on. You got to cut me off. I know, right.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool, cool, cool. So remember, this is just, it's going to be just the facts, the story is going to come later because I want to give that a lot, a lot, a lot of respect in time and we want

53
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.310
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

54
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to dive right in. Just a super quick introduce myself. So at least you have a little idea of who I am.

Gwenevere Abriel: As you know, my name is when you can call me when one of your hey you my therapist that counselor lady, whatever you want. I'm not going to take it personally, I've been doing this for over 20 years licensed in Florida. Right, right, hovering around 21 years, New Mexico, it'll be three in

00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: June lot a lot a lot of enjoyment, working with population that have struggled with whether it's process addiction chemical dependence big piece of the career was 14 years and felony drug court.

57
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've pretty much heard all the stories.

58
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.850
Lauren Anderson: Right.

59
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know, I know. I looked like kind of Pollyanna like naive and and a pushover. But let's see.

60
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.120
Lauren Anderson: Never. It's hard to I'm pretty bad at judging people at first.

61
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.010
Lauren Anderson: So,

62
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I will tell you one thing that's important. One thing really really important is this phone.

63
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my personal cell, but we won't treat it like a chit chat and what I'll do is I'll send you. Hey, a week. Good for tomorrow's appointment. You just as we have, yes, we're good.

64
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do it 24 hopefully hours in advance and write me back. Because if you don't, what will happen is, I'll go oh

65
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't earn a living. If I don't have a client booked at a certain time. So I might be reaching out to someone who's on my on call list and say, Hey, I'm

66
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I might have an opening so so I really want that 24 hours in advance, we can't, we can't fill that spot and I can't, I can't pay my mortgage

67
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.610
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

68
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I only I only earned it. When you and I are here. I don't, um, so on a on a cell phone. This is a pretty critical piece because people forget it. We're so used to quick text quick text.

69
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't do therapy through texting. So you might have a big feeling like I'm so triggered right now having a big I'm so angry. I'm so sad and you'll what you'll get back might feel cold, but it won't intend to be. It might sound like this. Hey, when can we meet in zoom

70
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then you go up, you know, yes.

71
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: How about how about an

72
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Hour. Or how about it, three o'clock tomorrow, and then I'll write back and say yes.

73
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.210
Lauren Anderson: Okay.

74
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's pretty quick appointments happen pretty quick. Sometimes

75
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

76
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.700
Lauren Anderson: Awesome.

77
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's totally cool.

78
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. This totally works.

79
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Especially right now.

80
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

81
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people don't have bars and have any money right now and it's total chaos, but we can still kind of get our emotional state regulated and that's neat.

82
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.450
Lauren Anderson: Super cool.

83
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. The other thing is, I think you're seeing doctor brielle for the medication assisted therapy. Correct.

84
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.930
Lauren Anderson: She's allowed us. Yeah.

85
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.040
Lauren Anderson: Long

86
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: gray hair.

87
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.780
Lauren Anderson: Uh huh.

88
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So this piece is important. Um, She is my mother.

89
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you won't see it in here. It's my role to protect the clinical boundaries, it's not her. So you may hear her talking about family. She may over disclose her role is not quite the same as mine, mine is

90
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to protect boundaries is to make sure the relationship stays where she sort of stays in her medication lane and I stay in my psychotherapeutic claim.

91
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.160
Lauren Anderson: But

92
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But she won't watch it the same way. I will. So something comes up and make sure that you use. I want you to feel welcome to bring it up to me because

93
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.410
Lauren Anderson: We

94
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Have mothers or we have fathers and we we see dynamics. And it's like, what was that and what

95
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.160
Lauren Anderson: You can

96
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.520
Lauren Anderson: Do you want me to let you know if she gets a little too personal. You mean

97
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:25.170
Lauren Anderson: Well, I lost. Oh, there you are. If I go talk to me. I think she needs water. Sorry.

98
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, go for it.

99
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.530
Lauren Anderson: I'm taking you with me.

100
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:36.060
Lauren Anderson: So it's already gone so mom don't see personal. Okay.

101
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's more like this year, the client.

102
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.770
Lauren Anderson: Right.

103
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Comes up for you, like I felt this or that. When I heard this or that or saw this or that or just seeing a parent child together may trigger something

104
00:08:53.670 --> 00:09:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And it would be, I think, a poor decision for me to not tell you that that existed but my point is, you people have not known for years because they forget this conversation.

105
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.600
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, I actually guest your last name for up the other day and I guess I thought my mom and

106
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.890
Lauren Anderson: Daughter, but

107
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not going to reference you won't know much how many kids, you won't know my family won't know that because this will

108
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.600
Lauren Anderson: Help you. All right.

109
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't want my clients to think they have to take care of me so that part's really really really clear up front.

110
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.830
Lauren Anderson: But if anything

111
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Comes up. You are so welcome to talk to me about it. And without further ado, I've got to dive right in. So

112
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You're coming to bright heart health. And were you already on buprenorphine off the streets. We're coming straight from heroin from fentanyl I heard some cocaine history.

113
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Just focusing on the opiates, for a moment, we're just going to start writing the opiates. What brought you in to bright heart health.

114
00:09:53.220 --> 00:10:08.070
Lauren Anderson: I went to a seven day detox and got off heroin and onto subs. So he checks. And then I thought I had a plan for when I left. And that's, I called you guys kind of in a panic because I had didn't have an option here really

115
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.780
Lauren Anderson: That's how I found you. Okay, and

116
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This as it is now. How many days if you've been

117
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: On the buprenorphine.

118
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:28.890
Lauren Anderson: Today's the what the 28th. So a month and a day. Oh, no, no, you know what, exactly, a month because I got them 27th and they started me on the next day. So since the 28th of February.

119
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm also I'll sound kind of weird, because I'll say things like this please transcribe verbatim. Or I might take time to nice lifetime history of it because it's being transcribed because I won't be able to catch everything you're saying. So that's why I'll sound funny.

120
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.390
Lauren Anderson: You're talking to your computer.

121
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So alright so let's transcribe

122
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Client history, all the way through. So we can catch all these details. So here we go.

123
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Age of first use of and I differentiate short acting opiates between long acting so you're on what's called a long acting opiate

124
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is buprenorphine it's it stays in your bloodstream out on paper. It says it's 36 hours you guys tend to feel it start to wear down about 24 so that's long acting, whereas you know with heroin, bam, you get straight up right you like last

125
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:25.590
Lauren Anderson: Night.

126
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I need it right away. So same with the Percocet, the Aussies the hydrogen is a short acting. Same with fentanyl so short acting so it's all jumped into most of them are short acting and then

127
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: In here, I'll just be referring to that buprenorphine Suboxone is a brand name, so I won't always say Suboxone because they're also stopped ready. There's Sandoz

128
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is a brand. So it's going to be buprenorphine is the active ingredient that's long acting. Here we go, as your first use of first opiate when was that

129
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.830
Lauren Anderson: Long or short acting

130
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: As a Jew first short acting

131
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.200
Lauren Anderson: I'm

132
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.050
Lauren Anderson: 3435

133
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.770
Lauren Anderson: Okay, well,

134
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it

135
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.890
Lauren Anderson: Heroin

136
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and so you used it like once and fell in love with it or how did it come about.

137
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:26.640
Lauren Anderson: Um, no. I was on subs for a long time, actually. And then, and then I got off of them. And then I've kind of lost my insurance and all my

138
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:35.310
Lauren Anderson: Medication. So I started taking them again on the street and after like two years of that I couldn't find them anymore and I gotten sick enough. I started buying heroin.

139
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So your orders pretty

140
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.550
Lauren Anderson: pretty unique coming to flip it.

141
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Around and I'm going to start with. So your first use of opiate wish was long acting

142
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Hello, Maria

143
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.860
Lauren Anderson: Um, let's see. I was like 2009 so it's like 28

144
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What and where you prescribe this

145
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.800
Lauren Anderson: At the beginning, know your boyfriend. I tried it from

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.970
Lauren Anderson: Okay, and then shortly after that, I started getting it prescribed. Yes.

147
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.440
For what

148
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.190
Lauren Anderson: I had told them that I was I was an ex heroin addict in order to get the subs and unfortunately

149
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How long were you prescribe the buprenorphine.

150
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:22.410

151
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.250
Lauren Anderson: You know, I think it was in like November 2011

152
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And then boyfriend maybe introduce you to heroin at 34

153
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:47.670
Lauren Anderson: No, I, I had a real traumatic relationship. And I was just using I started using really heavily and I started instead of snorting cocaine. I started shooting it. And then I started by subs and including the subs with it.

154
00:13:48.120 --> 00:14:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to say it back. I'm just, just looking at it at opiate right now. I know it's tricky. Here we go. The correct, correct me if I'm wrong first use buprenorphine 2009 boyfriend introduces it then I get it prescribed through 2011

Gwenevere Abriel: Then I can't quite tell the opiate use. I can't

157
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:24.810
Lauren Anderson: Then there's none, I just started drinking real heavily and I'm still doing coke and then it gets bad enough, once I start shooting the Coke, I start buying subs to to help handle the huge up

158
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Use it as a downer.

159
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.230
Yeah.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:29.820
Okay.

161
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So, because I can't do the math in my head quickly. I'm just going to stick with the year because I, I can't, I don't know where he calls in

173
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:48.240
Lauren Anderson: Um, well, I was buying from 2014 I was buying it on the streets and I could not find it anywhere. Um,

174
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:56.250
Lauren Anderson: And so let's see. It was actually April 29 of 2017 I did the heroin, for the first time.

175
00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and how did it progress for

176
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:15.360
Lauren Anderson: It was immediate switch, pretty much. I couldn't find sub. So I started doing heroin and I did it from then until this February, pretty much. I did a detox once and tried another time and didn't complete it. And then the third time with the most recent so it's pretty much

177
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I heroin was done I intervene.

178
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.870
Lauren Anderson: The first one

179
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.990
Lauren Anderson: I'd be okay.

180
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And at its worst, you were doing, how much

181
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.520
Lauren Anderson: Um, well, at the end, I was doing it.

182
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:43.560
Lauren Anderson: Emily, actually, because I couldn't even shoot it anymore. So I was doing a lot more at the end, maybe a at least three grams a day or something and

183
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And your last use was we're thinking February 2019 to

184
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:55.200
Lauren Anderson: Ya know, my last few. So is this year 2020 2020

185
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:55.860

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.010
Lauren Anderson: Early morning before I went to treatment that morning. Yeah.

187
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: At its worst, it was right up there at three grams and that's that's right up in February, was that three ground us

188
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:14.100
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, but that was I was only doing every 12 hours because it was up my butt. But before it was actually more of a nightmare. When I was unit because it was every fucking three hours.

189
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:27.090
Lauren Anderson: And I felt I had more, a little more leeway. I didn't get as anxious and stuff. Once I switched it, but it was just became so unmanageable financially and I was just miserable. I was just so unhappy with myself in my life. So, you know,

190
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.910
Lauren Anderson: Probably pretty common. Yeah.

191
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.210

200
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:05.190

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.700

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.600
Okay.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Like yeah like RK started at 14 and oh my gosh I was partying every weekend and then it went to every day. And so just big chunks of time as we can so

229
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:12.720
Lauren Anderson: Uh, let's see a fall of 95 through a spring of 97 and I would just be occasional like a weekend party that was fresh freshman, sophomore in high school and

230
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.590

233
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.250
Lauren Anderson: Oh, gosh.

234
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.230
Lauren Anderson: I'm not sure. Maybe 2006 ish

235
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.960
Lauren Anderson: Okay, okay, okay.

236
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.880
Lauren Anderson: All right, why

237
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't we go to 1997 weekend partying.

238
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:51.030
Lauren Anderson: 9597 and then I went on drugs substances well cigarettes. I still do. But, um,

239
00:20:51.510 --> 00:21:01.080
Lauren Anderson: And then it wasn't till I started cocaine 18 and a half that drinking slowly got introduced don't think it really start drinking till like age 19 and then

240
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:11.880
Lauren Anderson: I don't know, just kind of often on it was more like benders I do drink pretty like light beer here and there, and then I'd go on a bender goodbye bottle. The day you know

241
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:13.470
And

242
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you ever have results in you developing what a chemical dependence on it where if you weren't drinking in the morning, maybe you'd get the shakes the DTS.

243
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:38.220
Lauren Anderson: I never had the shakes, but I got hung over every time I drank, even if I didn't get drunk and the really the only thing that ever helped it was to drink again usually like a police. The Bloody Mary or something.

244
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So often are in the morning, kind of

245
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.150
Lauren Anderson: Yeah yeah

246
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:49.920
Lauren Anderson: Okay, I was always a morning drinker. But when I did drink. Could that be the first thing I do to feel better. Basically because they have over

247
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

248
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:58.290
Lauren Anderson: What a nightmare. And basically I quit drinking all together when I started this up within like a week I was not drinking anymore.

249
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.360
Lauren Anderson: When the boyfriend. Sorry. Give me subs.

250
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, quit drinking. I got to see when it was here like

251
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.560
Lauren Anderson: To play 2008 2009 ish

252
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.490
Guy doesn't

253
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. At its worst, how much were you drinking a day.

254
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.670
Lauren Anderson: A bottle bottle and a half plus six to 12 pack of beer.

255
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how many ounces. We're in the bottles and then they make small bottle.

256
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.930
Lauren Anderson: It's like the regular the fifth or whatever the regular bottle. Yeah.

257
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:43.470
Lauren Anderson: Yeah I don't keep her in the house. I didn't know if I got a gallon, I'll just keep drinking it take naps drink it take naps till it's gone. So really easy to get on the bad cycle liquor quickly, you know, happens fast.

258
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When was your last step or drink.

259
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:57.630
Lauren Anderson: When I first got out of detox. This time I I really I think I told you guys on Monday, you know, in the doctor.

260
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:06.900
Lauren Anderson: That I really still does wasn't feeling that great on two and a half of them. The 20 milligrams a day. So when I first got out of the detox that I was feeling that and

261
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:15.150
Lauren Anderson: I had like five beers. My fridge and I drink those over the course of like two and a half days. I was just miserably sick. The whole time from

262
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: A week ago, right, or two.

263
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.990
Lauren Anderson: That would have been on March 5 march 5 sixth and seventh

264
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.650
Lauren Anderson: And it was just total about five beers. So

265
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote it. I wrote

266
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.760
Lauren Anderson: For Dale's pale ales and one green Foster's

267
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.680
Lauren Anderson: Okay but malleable.

268
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to just a little bit more around the alcohol. You ever have people say, Hey girl, you really need to cut back and you were kind of annoyed.

269
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.810
Lauren Anderson: Know my mom's calm into a couple times. But other than that, no.

270
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.630
So we'll go with endorsement.

271
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What about did you ever try to cut back and you're like, No, this is so hard. I can't do it.

272
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:15.390
Lauren Anderson: Uh, it was kind of an all or nothing thing for me because like I said I have even when I first start like that we can just the one beer that first day I had to drink. The next day, or I felt like I did to feel better. So

273
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:20.550

338
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So remember I mean here. I can't feel where that is. I've got two

339
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:07.440
Lauren Anderson: To one by 2009 mid 2009 I was done with go well for that interval.

340
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

341
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.390
Lauren Anderson: Kevin, you

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Know 2009 and then

343
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:18.060
Lauren Anderson: And then it was about the same with the other one. Let's see my meds run

344
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:30.360
Lauren Anderson: It, but definitely by the spring of 2013 I was back to snorting cocaine and probably I you know it was sooner than that. I think by the summer of 2012

345
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.740
Lauren Anderson: So, and it was

346
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Once or twice a week.

347
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.720
Lauren Anderson: Point two. Okay, point, five again once or twice a week.

348
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:50.310
Lauren Anderson: And then by the next summer 2013. It was almost every day. Same amount each day. Point two point five or something, but pretty much almost every day.

349
00:31:51.930 --> 00:32:12.840
Lauren Anderson: And then I had a friend introduced me to doing it IV and I start. So that was like maybe mid 2013 or fall 2013 and I did it that way. Pretty much every day, but only like five or $10 worth. So that's like what point oh five 2.1 I guess a day.

350
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:20.250
Lauren Anderson: And that was pretty consistent. That's what I did. Each day was just that amount, but it was every day for

351
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.420
Years.

352
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:29.070
Lauren Anderson: Until about two years ago I went back to snort enough

353
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:40.560
Lauren Anderson: Maybe three years ago. It's about when I started doing heroin I they all pretty much exactly I never really did them together IV. So okay, so hold on.

354
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not you, it's me, I, I'm

355
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.910
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, okay.

356
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:57.960
Lauren Anderson: I think it was like, okay, April 29 2017 when I started heroin so that with that's about when I went back to snorting cocaine. It was almost exactly like same day that made the switch back

357
00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Though, so is it safe to say 2017 I'm

358
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing using powder cocaine and using heroin.

359

421
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:25.980

Lauren Anderson: So spring of 94 fall 95 seven or eight times and I hallucinated off of it and threw up so badly that I quit all substances, that's what led to me quitting the drinking and stuff. You know what though.

427
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:23.610
Lauren Anderson: And pretty soon it became more medicinal where I wasn't making me sick and freak out. It was just helping me calm down and then it became regular use like every day.

493
00:45:45.300 --> 00:46:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But just thinking about whether you received outpatient treatment for your substance abuse history. Do you remember just going and seeing a counselor in his or her office talking about thoughts or feelings. Did you ever have a period of time where you were seeing someone

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:21.150
Lauren Anderson: And that was kind of in a nutshell what my problem with most of those were and if it wasn't that is a lot of them like the Zoloft maybe fucking crazy. And, uh,

533
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:29.790
Lauren Anderson: And like a vomiting like violently, and then also just like going off the deep end screaming and crying and you know making people's lives miserable.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: tracker circle so love Paxil Prozac lithium vilified Depakote. You made you to even keel made you to chill to calm didn't like it.

535
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:48.600
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, the Depakote was one that scared me when I wouldn't take my meds right away. I'd remit it would remind me because I start getting new like

536
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:57.840
Lauren Anderson: Electrical like I don't know weird like pre seizure feelings in my head. It scared the hell out of me. I'm actually kind of

537
00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:06.450
Lauren Anderson: Grateful I took a bottle and they they pumped it out of me when I tried to kill myself. I didn't even I was worried about how is he going to get off of that medication.

538
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:13.830
Lauren Anderson: And that that did the trick. So that would scare me in that way. Otherwise, I was pretty stable. The Depakote was very helpful.

539
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.990
Lauren Anderson: But I didn't like that electrical

540
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.990
Lauren Anderson: Association with not taking it, that scared me.

541
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I'll make a little so we got that, but

542
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:31.050

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:32.790
Lauren Anderson: Right, yeah.

544
00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:38.310
Lauren Anderson: Seems like a dangerous withdrawal kind of symptom was what that was.

545
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: When you didn't take it.

546
00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.570

547
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:54.780
Lauren Anderson: And I knew it was prescribed for also for epileptics or and I was wondering if that was the association of why I was feeling that way. And so, yeah, really scared me so I wanted to get off of it for a long time.

548
00:50:55.770 --> 00:51:07.770
Lauren Anderson: Finally, that was the way it happened, you know, I didn't plan it but taking the bottle and then getting the charcoal throwing it up and getting the charcoal put into me. That's that was the last time I use Depakote. So, yeah.

549
00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:14.100

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.340
Lauren Anderson: The wrath of Pam is out of band right

555
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.570
Lauren Anderson: And the

556
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.760
Lauren Anderson: koala pen. And I think, yeah, they tried those kind of pretty much back, to back, to see if they were helping me

557
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.020
Lauren Anderson: And they just really

558
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.130
Did nothing

559
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:57.480
Lauren Anderson: But the only the only thing I noticed was I had no memory of when I was taking no fucking short term memory and that as a pianist memorizing big pieces was also very scary to me.

560
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.250
Lauren Anderson: So, yeah.

561
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got you. Okay. All right.

562
00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so now we've touched on. We touched on medication Buddy Buddy, buddy. Let's go over to

563
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, now let's do this, what have you. What labels. Another huge I don't land on labels very long. I use them for discussion, but I don't get too too hung up on them. I'm interested in the symptoms. I want to know kind of what's going on for you.

564
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But ours labels along the way. What psychiatric diagnoses. Have you been assigned

565
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:52.320
Lauren Anderson: Excuse me I'm to severe depression and it's pretty clear shortly after that is more manic depression like bipolar.

566
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:59.610
Lauren Anderson: Okay, and then some attending things with that. But it was thought to be part of that all together the anxiety of

567
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Any early on. Did anyone ever diagnose you with an attention deficit piece where often labeled with a DD ADHD any of that.

568
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Know any learning disorder around math, reading language.

569
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.120
Lauren Anderson: Know,

570
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To identify through school. We see it sometimes as an impulse control challenge.

571
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:31.410
Lauren Anderson: Uh, yeah, that's definitely been a factor for me to really pull it through the whole semester and stuff, but is that what you mean.

572
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.970
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, this is waking up at the same time every day, stuff like that. Yeah.

573
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Eating Disorders controlling like eating.

574
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:40.200
Lauren Anderson: No.

575
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Here and then purging it okay no eating disorder in any compulsive behaviors. It's always got to do this sort of routine piece of your day in order to feel okay any new rituals or obsessive sort of pieces.

576
00:53:53.970 --> 00:54:06.330
Lauren Anderson: I guess kind of using was that, especially ones with the heroin, it became such an often needed thing. But, I mean, I guess my piano practice is kind of like that the practice several hours a day.

577
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, let's say on your mother's side or your father side any history of schizophrenia or suicide attempt or completion.

578
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:34.440
Lauren Anderson: Of, um, let's see, my dad's sister's son. So my cousin schizophrenia like real bad, really bad. And then he's had a couple. My dad has had a couple ants that are institutionalized.

579
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:41.970
Lauren Anderson: For psychotic behavior or something like that. I don't know, kind of unclear.

580
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:51.990
Lauren Anderson: I didn't know about the suicide, I guess not. Um, and my mom's dad was an alcoholic.

581
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, please transcribe verbatim.

Lauren Anderson: Up until I guess.

602
00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:06.480
Lauren Anderson: I think probably not past the the spring semester of 2013 but it was probably a little earlier than that, that I stopped going to him. And I think we started around 2010

603
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh you you songs for like three years.

604

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, you first started having and I distinguish suicidal ideation planning behavior I separate that from self injurious behavior which is cutting the skin burning the skin.

610
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Punching yourself that is self injurious behavior. So I moved over. In other words, there's no intent to die.

611
00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There's just psychiatric relief from the physical dimension right physical pain can relieve psychic psychiatric pain for some people, folks, kind of find that I'm going to send a quick message to my next gal because I I'm not into my I'm running late.

Lauren Anderson: No.

629
00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It stayed in just the thinking for age 11 and 12 for about how many years did it stay in the thinking level.

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:40.350
Lauren Anderson: till late co i with

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:51.840
Lauren Anderson: Going more serious.

633
00:59:53.940 --> 01:00:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Years at that point. So, at what age did it move from just thinking to I'm starting to kind of

634
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Think plan. Yeah.

635
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.660

636
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. Ah 14 suicidal kind of planning and did you want to die at that time.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.510
Lauren Anderson: I wasn't really sure how to how to go about it. Yeah.

640
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: They did not take action.

641
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.550
Lauren Anderson: I did not take action now I that's about what is very exciting.

642
01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's when okay so age before. So I'll dip over here for a second to the self injurious stuff. But I want to go back to suicidal, if we can, so

643
01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do this part, if you want. We'll go into the self interest so age 14 started cutting where, where did you cut

644
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:49.050
Lauren Anderson: Up my arms.

645
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, did any of them require sutures.

646
01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:56.340

Gwenevere Abriel: Over here, your director each time progress age 20 you had a suture.

650
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.730

Several okay

654
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.900

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And

657
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: When was the last time you engaged in the self injurious behavior.

658
01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:54.180
Lauren Anderson: No.

659
01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:08.940
Lauren Anderson: I've thought about it, but I really haven't in a while. I guess I was like the summer 2018

660
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. How long do you think about it.

661
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:28.740
Lauren Anderson: Um, well you know the the opiates really kind of cut it off for me when I was on opiates and subs. I wasn't, you know, cutting myself hurting myself and maybe even killed enough or I wouldn't, I wasn't upset enough to get go there, you know, to me,

662
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.080
Lauren Anderson: Yeah. What was the question.

663
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. You're doing great.

664
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I was trying so you kind of answered it, but I know you're saying using the opiates meant that I don't have these thoughts of self injury. When was the last time was it 2017 was the last

665
01:02:52.770 --> 01:03:00.450
Lauren Anderson: Thoughts of self and it's probably within a day or two from today, but the last time I actually acted on. It was the summer 2018

666
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.400
Lauren Anderson: I feel like year and a half ago.

667
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're different for me. So we've got a year and a half. So we've got please transcribe, a year and a half ago client didn't engage in self interest behavior with ongoing

668
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Thoughts of doing it, but she's inhibiting it

669
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:19.410
Lauren Anderson: Mm hmm. Okay.

670
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.160
I got it.

671
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:32.340
Lauren Anderson: I guess it's also add I started. Also, I mean sometimes I would slap myself. I've always done that. But with that behavior, but

672
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:39.450
Lauren Anderson: In recent years, like since 2011 2012 I started thrashing my head into

673
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:52.770
Lauren Anderson: Walls and things also like really hard so bad I my friends were joking calling me nor wall for about a month because I had such a huge bump on my forehead. It was like a unicorn Norton sticking out, you know, the narwhal the whale with the

674
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: lemons. The last time you get that cuz we're seven minutes after. So I've got a really persevere with here.

675
01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.700
Lauren Anderson: I was a year and a half ago 20

676
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Hour ok ok ok and

677
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back. Remember we dipped into the cell phone. Oh, go ahead.

678
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:20.520
Lauren Anderson: I think I was more recently, actually it was about a year ago. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. The problem is the neighbor was frustrated and through my head in the door. Okay, sorry.

679
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's go back to 2014 you had suicidal plan, you want it to die weren't really sure how to do it. Um, tell me about suicidal thinking and behaviors from age 14 on

680
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:40.620
Lauren Anderson: Well,

681
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:51.060
Lauren Anderson: I mean just the just the self harm, really. And I think careless behavior to reckless behavior.

682
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:52.110
Lauren Anderson: So,

683
01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:59.610
Lauren Anderson: No real plan. I think a lot of times when I was cutting. That was my plan and but then I would feel better. The second I

684
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:09.330
Lauren Anderson: You know, made any painter blood that it just didn't. I didn't end up going through that. So a lot of times, so self harm. It started out as a plan to slit my wrists.

685
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:19.530
Lauren Anderson: You know what I mean. And then trying to curb it, I would cut myself here instead to see if it would offer really and usually it would so I wouldn't have to do it all the way. You know what I mean.

686
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So the pain would sort of curb the Follow. Follow through of taking your life.

687
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:36.930
Lauren Anderson: Yeah, say I'd cried for sometimes days straight. Literally, not just we've been not be able to control and then we get so

01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to set lots of them as many or as little as you want but they're going to steer what we do because what you want out of this program is very central okay

1034
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about your substance use. I'm going to be putting it in quotes. I want to hear from you sort of in the I want to, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. When you think of your

1038
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So, since you're on an opiate now that's going to confuse a little bit. Tell me.

1039
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.420
