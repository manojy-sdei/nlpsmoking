00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you tried it.

132
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.890

136
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:55.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The root

137
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.080

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.700
Robert Hammond: Is it

140
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Worry

141
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Control. Give me some ideas of

142
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.490
Robert Hammond: Like just the worry of

143
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.210
Robert Hammond: being grounded.

144
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.340
Robert Hammond: In general, just, I mean, from what I grew up with.

145
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.800
Robert Hammond: Like I wasn't

146
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.790
Robert Hammond: I was never supposed to be that see in her her from

147
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.740
Robert Hammond: So,

148
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.910
Robert Hammond: You know, when I was out in public, like I was supposed to be silent and

149
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.210
Robert Hammond: Not seeing stuff like that is weird.

150
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:45.780
Robert Hammond: Yeah.

151
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:53.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like that, in all aspects when it comes to social interactions or just through

152
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.180
An individual

153
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is everywhere.

154
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.170
Robert Hammond: Like, even when I

155
00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.760
Walk down the street and everything.

156
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You take medication. Sounds like social anxiety.

157
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.620
Robert Hammond: No, I don't. I don't think

158
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.620
Robert Hammond: I actually this sponsors, with which been helping out a little bit.

159
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Boxing is more so to treat

160
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:27.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The craving for the opioids and the drugs, it's not going to treat you know the service levels within your brain.

161
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's creating that anxiety. So

162
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:39.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then maybe let's apply some more practical skills. So the breathing that we talked about and then also kind of identifying

163
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:55.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The diffusion of those thoughts. So with you are accustomed to growing up, you know, not being seen not being heard, kind of like this isolation. This non existence and now your adult life.

164
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Being present being existed, and if the expectation is that you will participate. This is all different from years of childhood experiences. So identifying that fact that what is producing anxiety for me is the fact that this doesn't feel more this is it something that I'm used to.

165
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:32.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so we have that from what you told me that's what I heard that this is just different for you, considering your drama. So this, this doesn't seem normal

166
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:32.880
Robert Hammond: For you.

167
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What else is it, what is the fear behind this isn't normal.

168
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are you afraid.

169
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.470
Afraid might happen.

170
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.170
She

171
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.540
Robert Hammond: Was just being left. You know, I mean, I was always getting beyond

172
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

173
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:54.900
Robert Hammond: But now,

174
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.570
Robert Hammond: I don't even remember.

175
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.100
Robert Hammond: Yeah yeah

176
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:08.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you've already eliminated one thread and, you know, and this adult life. I don't have to worry about me left behind. So that's one threat that's removed.

177
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From the scenario. So I don't know if you remember that scale I showed you about the

178
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Unit of distress.

179
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.050
Robert Hammond: You know,

180
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The thermometer can go down just a little because

181
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of them being left behind, has been removed.

182
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:28.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what are the worries or fears might come up when you have to login for group or individual there.

183
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.790
Robert Hammond: The other one we just stand alone.

184
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me more about being alone because you're in a group setting.

185
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then you're with me one on one. But the knowledge

186
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.050
Robert Hammond: Just

187
00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.410
Robert Hammond: I feel like that.

188
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.330
Robert Hammond: Just had that

189
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.900
Robert Hammond: the Brooklyn Bridge.

190
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it a fear of being alone, or is it

191
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, you're breaking up.

192
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can you hear me okay

193
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.600
Yeah.

194
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:39.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you set the alarm part helped me to understand, is it the fear of being alone, or is it you have a preference.

195
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.750
To be

196
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:43.410
Robert Hammond: Alone.

197
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.220
Yeah.

198
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Except

199
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.180
Robert Hammond: I don't mind.

200
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.140
Robert Hammond: Being alone again took me a while.

201
00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.970
Robert Hammond: jump from one to another.

202
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was that last part, Robert. We want to make sure I hear you.

203
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hey, here. Yeah.

204
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

205
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Repeat, repeat back to me what you were saying, I couldn't hear you.

206
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can't hear me.

207
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You hear me okay started coming in there.

208
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:07.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, you're, you're better now just barely anyway. You are you sound better now.

209
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I said, helped me to

210
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:17.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Understand, um, and you told me that it is not a preference, you feel alone so

211
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me, times where you haven't felt alone.

212
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

213
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:48.360
Robert Hammond: I still feel it like now even with my relations everything you know it's something that I've always wanted for permission to be gone.

214
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.140
Yeah.

215
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So well would be needed for you.

216
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To feel like

217
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.050
Robert Hammond: incorporating into my

218
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:12.960
Robert Hammond: Present.

219
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:21.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Present and having

220
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are you able to identify and when you show up for group.

221
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:35.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That people are present that there's a doctor and a therapist that's present there that you can trust.

222
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To go does feel natural to you are right now.

223
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.580
Robert Hammond: Yeah, well those words like

224
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:51.300
Robert Hammond: Like it, I gotta read people I know. So people are, you know, still using her

225
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.530
Robert Hammond: Yeah, you know, some people are born screening, things like that. Like, you can see

226
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:55.680
It.

227
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.150
Robert Hammond: At the same time, I mean Uber still showing up so

228
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:01.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

229
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.410
Robert Hammond: Yeah, that amount of, you know, respected, even then that's good enough.

230
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm hearing you say that the group setting.

231
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:22.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Create some level of mistrust for you because you feel that there are some people in the group that are still using but also on the other side, you still have empathy for them.

232
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.150
Because at least they're showing

233
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.770
Robert Hammond: Right there. So dragon bell

234
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Exactly. So do that. Does that assessment.

235
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Limit you in any way within the group setting.

236
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.630
No, not at all.

237
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:48.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Alright, so we've already dispelled two minutes already from the group dynamic right that

238
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: being left behind, you know,

239
00:22:53.850 --> 00:23:01.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's not going to happen. And also you're an adult. So you have the means to now and show where you will go where you want

240
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then also

241
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The mistress.

242
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:21.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Isn't as dominant in that group setting. If you have the doctor, you have a therapist, even though there are some people that are questionable in group, you can operate from a sense of empathy to see in the spec that at least they're showing up now.

243
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:36.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For this setting, tell me your path because I know when we first started, it was the doctor telling you that you need to come here. So how did trust play a role in this dynamic in our individual therapy sessions.

244
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.370
Robert Hammond: Honestly, I was gonna

245
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.600
I know

246
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.620
Robert Hammond: I was kind of still upset with my medication called that how they're

247
00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:48.270
Going all that

248
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:55.050
Robert Hammond: I think I probably was just be like trying to latch on them just for them messing up

249
00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.090
Robert Hammond: More than it was me, actually, not wanting to them.

250
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:08.940
Robert Hammond: Because even before it ends with my other cancer. I was, I was talking to him and I even told him that I needed groups and stuff like that. Sure.

251
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.370
Robert Hammond: So that's why I was doing some of those IPs on it.

252
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:30.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even though you know it was unnatural to be told to come to individual therapy, you were able to see some of the benefits of it.

253
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:42.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it seems like that's your ongoing thing that even if there is some mistress, or something that you observe that you may not like you try to see the other side and and relate some empathy.

254
00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:49.050
Robert Hammond: That's a positive skill to have. Because most people see it through a filter lens, they only see what they want to see.

255
00:24:49.920 --> 00:25:01.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then, but look at the bigger picture I'm seeing that in this course of your sobriety in your emotional growth, you're trying to see more of the bigger picture.

256
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:14.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's continue to develop that bigger picture when it comes to the enzyme really search to figure out what is the root of it. So some hypothesis you gave me is being left behind.

257
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:21.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You are already able to split that out on trial and realize that there's no evidence that supports that you're going to be left behind.

258
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:39.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Individual group then we already mentioned trust is very important for you. So even though there's some elements where there may miss trust in a group setting and you're able to still see the empathy. Now, in these individual sessions. Are there any

259
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: any situations where you feel like you may not be able to trust me.

260
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.660
Robert Hammond: No, not at all.

261
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know at the beginning when we first started, you talked about the other therapists that kind of

262
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:18.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mentioned Something that you said, and then I reminded you of, you know, wow. Everything is confidential in therapy because of the licensure. There are some things that it limits the confidentiality has to be adjusted right and you are a threat to yourself or to others. But aside from that,

263
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want you to hear that, what is said in our session stays here.

264
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:36.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So now we dispel that myth. When it comes to the individual sessions. So we've gotten out to the threats that you assess when it comes to your anxiety.

265
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it's still showing up because you said every time you log in and smoke.

266
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that tells me

267
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That there's more thoughts associated with your anxiety.

268
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so keep searching and tell me what else have you identified what else is this

269
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.540
Anxiety.

270
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.060
Robert Hammond: Is the smoking itself.

271
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:12.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When it begins. Mm hmm. So kind of

272
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:12.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Kind of

273
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anxiety as a clutch to say this is why should smell.

274
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that what I heard.

275
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.450
Robert Hammond: Pretty much, yes.

276
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, that's very

277
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.740
Robert Hammond: Honest, but I'm already like it just

278
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:29.610
Robert Hammond: Important right now.

279
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:39.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. Okay, that was honest. So now you can see that the smoking is my preference for you. It's a habit that you want to be.

280
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:48.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But when you attach it to a designer. It almost makes it more compromising and acceptable but continuously

281
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.150
Robert Hammond: Very

282
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.750
Robert Hammond: Good. I don't want to do with with using just like trying to justify

283
00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.790
Neuberger, yeah.

284
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's what happens. You probably noticed you're smoking and take increase

285
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you stop using because what happens is, you know, your brain has this dependency. It's been activated by a drug. And so now that it's been condition.

286
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You replacing it with something that you feel is perhaps to say for drug. But now what's concerning is saying, I haven't identified something else that I have to give up. I'm not ready to give up.

287
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.240
Robert Hammond: Right.

288
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:56.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so you justify rationalize well not doing drugs. I'm taking my Suboxone doing everything else. So if I just, if I just say the things it is reason why smoke, then I can, I can continue on with this as a coping. Now in this revelation. The two separate things.

289
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:06.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anxiety is a part of your mental illness and the smoking is just the way that you've been coping.

290
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's actually a preference for you.

291
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To have it now.

292
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.520
Robert Hammond: Right.

293
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:23.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We just pulled that this was a science experiment on part two different experiments. They are not together. We're not connected

294
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:47.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the next time you smoke. It's identifying is this really associated with some anxiety. I'm having and then assessing what are the roots attached to this anxiety and doing what we just did. If you can dispel all the threats, then you realize, oh, I'm just, I'm just smoking because feeling

295
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and that discovery alone.

296
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:57.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is going to help me with reducing some of the smoking.

297
00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:03.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some people, they don't have a goal to quit altogether. They just want to reduce because they think it's it's better

298
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, over time, and then eventually you know

299
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are your goals. What do you want when it comes to yes

300
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:12.720
Robert Hammond: I actually want to

301
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.730
Robert Hammond: Be like to play lead frequent smoking.

302
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.710
Robert Hammond: Especially once I get my kid back

303
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:17.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, yeah.

304
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.950
Robert Hammond: That was one of my big things when I did.

305
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:20.850
Robert Hammond: Have unless

306
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

307
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.110
Robert Hammond: I went smoke around it.

308
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.230
Robert Hammond: No, I never met him see me smoking.

309
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.790
Robert Hammond: I even told him you know that

310
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.910
Robert Hammond: That was a Sunday. He shouldn't do.

311
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.090
Robert Hammond: Cuz I mean my grandfather died of a

312
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.790
Robert Hammond: Lot of my family members have died from it.

313
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So motivated, Robert.

314
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now.

315
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It can't be an attachment to it.

316
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:59.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You just, you just helped us us to come to that discovery that it's different. And so the motivators are okay I realized that it's really not anxiety. So, smoking is not going to help the coal mines it

317
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:08.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, I have a pre existing condition within my family that when they smoke, they end up dying.

318
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:16.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I love my son and I want to be a healthy version for him and I don't want him to become a smoker for three reasons.

319
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:25.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And with those three reasons you've already put in place some things to help you, the pins in your pocket.

320
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:41.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, distracting yourself. What other things have you tried. I know Dr. Adrian. She's one of the doctors, she was trying to send different informational products to help patients that want to stop smoking.

321
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you ever contact with her.

322
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.200
Robert Hammond: No, actually I haven't. Okay, so what

323
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.970
Robert Hammond: Does my laptop turn

324
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:57.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, if you're interested, I could send an email with your name included letting her know that

325
00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're interested in

326
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know her smoking cessation program and see what she has to

327
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.500
Offer

328
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.410
Robert Hammond: A reminder

329
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.000
Robert Hammond: You're going to be okay with the door.

330
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:29.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See her having a challenge. What I'll do is I will email. Dr. Gabriel about it. Tell her your doctor is and then she can connect all the dots and figure out how to get you connected with that.

331
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:40.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, okay, I'll leave you out of the email, I'll just discuss it with her, with your permission, and then from there, she'll figure out the way to get you connected with what you need.

332
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:43.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Better

333
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.510
Robert Hammond: Yeah, I was just gonna work. Like I said she was my my other doctor

334
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, okay.

335
00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:00.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, this is totally isolated and she probably won't remember whatever challenges. It was so

336
00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, what, what are your takeaways from this session.

337
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.420
Robert Hammond: Smoking all that and then

338
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.810
Robert Hammond: Just how I justified it

339
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.280
I use

340
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My dancing.

341
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.050
Robert Hammond: Good job, and doing it. There you go.

342
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nice biting your nails.

343
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's, that's better.

344
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For you know I am nails over having to deal with smoking.

345
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:52.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I think that that to just that analysis was good and we wouldn't have been able to come to this if it wasn't for you, really, to be able to say, this is really what anxiety looks like for me.

346
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And being able to see like

347
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whoa, smoking.

348
00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:07.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: These are two different images that are created. So we think about smoking. Again, just think about this, do that analysis do some of your belly breathing.

349
00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:18.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where we put one hand on your heart on your chest, one hand on your belly and if your hand on your chest is the one that rises first that tells you that you're doing shallow breathing.

350
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:26.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which you want to do is deep belly breathing to help with the relaxation. So that means the belt. The breathing is coming from the stomach.

351
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:36.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you'll notice the difference and just getting that carbon dioxide flow through the body to get the blood flowing and to give you a more relaxed mind.

352
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:40.920
Robert Hammond: Right.

353
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you have any plans for Memorial Day.

354
00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.480
Robert Hammond: No, I don't even know what's coming up.

355
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:54.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All the day kind of seem the same I'm just been looking for a date to not work. So that's the only reason

356
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:02.250
Robert Hammond: I know my debug investing at all because I keep on working the weekends and everything so

357
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.930
Robert Hammond: Yeah yeah

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Six o'clock that works for you or you want to do earlier.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I was thinking either five or six o'clock. What do you think is best for you.
