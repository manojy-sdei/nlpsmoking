Johnny Roberts: Which is the Committee of 50

175
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:16.440
Johnny Roberts: It's about it's 50 foot old man to get together and they make all the rules and so have them gaining stay awake, five minutes to make a rule.

176
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.540
Johnny Roberts: But they but they run the town.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh wow, that's good.

180
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.840
Johnny Roberts: As long as you don't get long as you don't give them a hard time I don't bother you.

181
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.450

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be on guard to pay attention to your house and your belongings.

184
00:12:52.020 --> 00:13:02.100
Johnny Roberts: Yeah okay go what I mean. I go to my friend's house work on my truck. And I'm like, I need to go buy the house because why should I got a bad feeling most of time when I get a bad feeling something's going on.

185
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:08.520
Johnny Roberts: You know, it's like, like I said, My roommate and I was letting stay here to help him out. Right.

186
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:26.220
Johnny Roberts: Because he just got out of jail, and I've known him for a while, and he was clean. I was gone for two hours Thanksgiving eve and went over my friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner right good when friends come together. He took the gate hinges off the gate to get my generator of the backyard.

187
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.080
Johnny Roberts: And steel generator. He sold for $200

188
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.710
Johnny Roberts: You lied to me straight to my face.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you ever get it back.

Johnny Roberts: Know, kind of like, you know, I got friends here. It's just the people that come by here.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.740
Johnny Roberts: Oh yeah, I probably they broke in here.

208
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.210

236
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.040

Johnny Roberts: Okay.

239
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, well, I wish that we could figure out some things to work on in these

240
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In our individual sessions, but

241
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe if you can think of something, then we can start developing a plan around it.

242
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But just doing a check in with you and making sure you're okay and that you're not experiencing any

243
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.360

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: physical ailments or anything else.

245
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At this point I think is what you know we've been doing

246
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.220
Johnny Roberts: Right.

247
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:06.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah, because it's kind of hard to work on any work on anger. When you have to stay in that fight or flight mode because of, you know,

248
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Area.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, with the area.

256
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:30.570
