4
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.340
Richelle Direny: So,

5
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.060
Richelle Direny: I know whole I haven't changed from now on, from

6
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.340
Richelle Direny: Tuesday to today.

7
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.620
Richelle Direny: OK, let me look at your treatment.

10
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.140
Richelle Direny: I think what how often we meet now like once a month, right.

11
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.940
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, like that's what you said.

12
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.820
Richelle Direny: Yeah. You know, honestly, Chris.

13
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.660
Richelle Direny: I think I'm thinking maybe we can

14
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.930
Richelle Direny: Answer this. I'm going to look at your goals here.

15
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.540
Richelle Direny: Have both you and your girlfriend are doing the Instacart.

16
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.440
Chris Padrutt: Not just me. She's a during the day she

17
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.320
Chris Padrutt: Works with auto parts stores.

18
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.780
Chris Padrutt: Just go out whenever she goes to work and

19
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.020
Chris Padrutt: It's been paying the bills.

20
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.750
Richelle Direny: How's your sister doing. I know you said like she was sick, right.

21
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:11.610
Chris Padrutt: She was hoping to get back to work today she was waiting for them to clear. So I heard forever, but it was supposed to be today she's supposed to go back

22
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.990
Richelle Direny: What she had and she a contract with the cronyism

23
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.980
Yeah.

24
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.360
Richelle Direny: How did she get the common already some kind of work, she

25
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.520
Chris Padrutt: Works in a nursing home.

26
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.390
Richelle Direny: Oh, OK. OK. I know with a lot of positive

27
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.670
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, a couple people died.

28
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.060
Chris Padrutt: She was squatting and shit. But I'm sure. Nobody listened to her because she's a hypochondriac, so

29
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:46.410
Chris Padrutt: But she had squawking about baby one. Let me get one lady tests that turned out she had, you know, she's probably kicked everything off there.

30
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.960
Chris Padrutt: But a

31
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.320
Richelle Direny: Cool. If you're there telling everybody and they don't want to

32
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.940
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, but she's a hypochondriac, so I don't blame them, you know,

33
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.370
Chris Padrutt: Like that every day.

34
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.940
Richelle Direny: But then as a hypochondriac. There's some truth to what you're saying.

35
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.420
Yeah.

36
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.450
Chris Padrutt: She got lucky. This one, one time, but

37
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.770
Richelle Direny: She got lucky. Does it sound like you don't even have mercy on her either

38
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.880
Richelle Direny: Your you don't have mercy. It's like she called wolf so many times, you're just like, whatever.

39
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.820
Chris Padrutt: I'll say, not in the her occasionally

40
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.630
Richelle Direny: Um,

41
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.290
Richelle Direny: Okay, let's see.

42
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.470
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, and some of the things that we have talked about in the past.

43
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.120
Richelle Direny: Is that you wanted to work on being more present and avoid worrying about the future.

44
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.900
Richelle Direny: Or did you find yourself trying to be more in the present.

45
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.380
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, yeah, I'm just

46
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.160
Chris Padrutt: Worried about what's in front of me and that's it and

47
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.600
Chris Padrutt: Not stress out about everything else.

48
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.890
Chris Padrutt: About

49
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:21.420
Richelle Direny: It so. So let me ask you this. And given that you have, you know, you're sleeping a lot better and use you can associate number one. And I think you

50
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:36.240
Richelle Direny: You did say that after getting those medications and getting enough or better sleep or a little bit more than you were getting in the past, you did find that things were looking a little bit up and then the second thing was

51
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:47.550
Richelle Direny: You know, being a you said that because people weren't as much people weren't out. But let's starting with the first, do you find that it helps a little

52
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.480
Richelle Direny: With being more present focus now that you've gotten a little bit of rest.

53
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.850
Richelle Direny: And help present focus

54
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.720
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, when you're tired, you tend to just focus on one time and

55
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.620
Chris Padrutt: You know, in the right in your head when you ain't get no sleep so

56
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.850
Mm hmm.

57
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:21.240
Richelle Direny: Now, the other thing is I would, I would think, is that even especially the fact that you are about magic. And that's pretty controlled right

58
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.770
Chris Padrutt: Yeah yeah 30 years but

59
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:36.210
Richelle Direny: Even with, you know, the, the lack of rest and like the grouchiness and everything else that kind of comes with lack of rest because even that it's amazing how our body functions like one thing

60
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.840
Richelle Direny: One thing is off, it throws the rest of the body off and you would never think like that one thing would have thrown everything else off.

61
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:51.030
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but, um, do you with that lack of sleep did it. Did you find it hard to somewhat control.

62
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.570
Richelle Direny: Your sugar levels or just even just having that under control fully on the control

63
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.340
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, that lack of sleep. Don't help that either. I mean,

64
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.160
Chris Padrutt: I've been dealing with that for so long. It's kind of

65
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.780
Richelle Direny: second nature.

66
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.450
Chris Padrutt: It does. It makes you fit you know when you're

67
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.600
Chris Padrutt: When you show there's high whatever you you feel like dog shit, I'm sure you're gonna be grumpy, but

68
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.710
Richelle Direny: What are your insulin dependent

69
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.340
Yeah.

70
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.950
Richelle Direny: No. Okay.

71
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:36.270
Richelle Direny: So overall, you, you just find that everything is kind of not what you would want it to be at this juncture of your life for where you are right now.

72
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.070
Richelle Direny: It's definitely better

73
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.820
Chris Padrutt: Yeah.

74
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.720
Richelle Direny: It's definitely better. Okay. Well, one of the things

75
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.000
Richelle Direny: That

76
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:54.990
Richelle Direny: I think I said in our last group, I don't think so. But one of the things like one of the things that we've been discussing.

77
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:07.650
Richelle Direny: And I think it goes right along kind of with one of these goals that talks about being more present focused on a word worrying about the future. It's

78
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:25.470
Richelle Direny: It's this little blurb here. Hold on, I still have it is this little worse. I said, sometimes you have to let go of the past and what you thought life would be like, and learn to enjoy the story that you're actually living in which, you know, talking about your life right now.

79
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.510
Richelle Direny: Being able to find a way to enjoy it. What

80
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:50.280
Richelle Direny: The past did it keeps or like what sometimes our minds allows us to go to the past and think about and lament. And really, truly focus on what or create this image in my in your mind of what you think life should be or work should be at this point in your life.

81
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:59.010
Richelle Direny: But with everything that's going on. You try so hard to kind of recreate that image or that picture of what your mind has created

82
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:15.210
Richelle Direny: How have you learned even during this time because you've come a long way. I mean, we've been meeting together for some months now and I have really definitely in the growth, your, your, your aspect is definitely much more brighter.

83
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.800
Richelle Direny: How are you finding joy or your definition of

84
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.470
Richelle Direny: Peace and stability.

85
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:37.170
Richelle Direny: In this part of your life and this juncture in this story as of the end says like, how are you are you finding that even keel.

86
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.250
Chris Padrutt: That's a

87
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.580
Chris Padrutt: Lot focus on focusing on

88
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.270
Chris Padrutt: The things that are further out.

89
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.600
Chris Padrutt: Things I can control anyway.

90
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.310
Chris Padrutt: Well, he said, living more in the now and

91
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:09.630
Chris Padrutt: I think that was probably one of my biggest things before was worried about other ship that put me in a different mode than I would have been and

92
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.590
Chris Padrutt: Now living in the now and just dealing with shape when it comes

93
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:29.520
Richelle Direny: It's funny the way you say it sounds like I was telling someone in a group, earlier I said for one listening to what you're saying. They may say

94
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:42.960
Richelle Direny: Oh, it's real easy for you to say that, but not knowing that that statement is loaded because you had gone through a lot to get to that point of saying, I just need to live in the now.

95
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.610
Richelle Direny: It's just like, Okay, I come to this place where I'm saying

96
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:56.580
Richelle Direny: I have to live in the now because I was always living in the past or the what ifs or what I could have done different or what I want to control or

97
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:09.870
Richelle Direny: When you've been living in that so long and you've come to that that place of awareness and ultimate acceptance of I can't do anything rather pass. I can't really do a whole lot about the future. I can only control right now.

98
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.400
Richelle Direny: That's all I can control, nothing else.

99
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.440
Richelle Direny: So it goes to one of the big things.

100
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.310
Richelle Direny: Even going along with this to some degree. When you think

101
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.260
Richelle Direny: You know the song, and everybody curse. Everybody knows

102
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.780
Richelle Direny: I'm sure you know this.

103
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:41.520
Richelle Direny: I can see clearly. Now the rain is gone. I can see all the obstacles in my way.

104
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:53.190
Richelle Direny: It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day it's you. When you think about those words. It's when you think about it, can you identify

105
00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:01.650
Richelle Direny: Maybe the storm that you were in that you can say that you're out now and you're seeing all the obstacles in your way.

106
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.500
Chris Padrutt: Just

107
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.710
Chris Padrutt: Just focus on other shit.

108
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.840
Chris Padrutt: And

109
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.620
Chris Padrutt: Yes, it's

110
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.400
Chris Padrutt: That was what was bothering me before is even though I've tried to do some of these things on my own and

111
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.010
Chris Padrutt: You know,

112
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.810
Chris Padrutt: Try to have another relationship with my kids open

113
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.430
Chris Padrutt: The dumb shit and her heads subsided, or

114
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.740
Chris Padrutt: Whatever you know

115
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:07.740
Chris Padrutt: Going, going into it failing grade and vegetables more dumb shit.

116
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.850
Chris Padrutt: So instead of always being repetitive nonsense.

117
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.850
Chris Padrutt: Don't think about it anymore, you know,

118
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.810
Chris Padrutt: Least amount that you know okay

119
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:33.000
Richelle Direny: So is it till then, is it that you don't think about it anymore or you've just come to realization that I have no control over it, so I'm not going to

120
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.070
Richelle Direny: Worry myself or stress myself over it because I have no control over it.

121
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.120
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, that

122
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.400
Chris Padrutt: 40 times prior chilling will change. You know, you

123
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.540
Chris Padrutt: People what they all are in, I

124
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.590
Chris Padrutt: Mean, people can change the most people don't

125
00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:04.350
Richelle Direny: And you're absolutely right. People can change. The question is, are they want to. Are they willing to and you sure can't make them change. They have to come to that reality on their own right.

126
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:18.690
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like in therapy. I mean, each of us have to come to reality and accept the what, you know, it is what it is. I mean it's it's your choice. If you want to let go of the past or

127
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:27.420
Richelle Direny: You know, look towards having a brighter future by living in the present and dealing with the president is really up to you.

128
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:40.980
Richelle Direny: And so, so when you look back at the storm that you were in and kind of what kept you in the storm when you found that willpower to come out of it. Um,

129
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.610
Richelle Direny: What what what

130
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.050
Richelle Direny: What do. Can you identify that gave you that willpower to come out of it.

131
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.760
Chris Padrutt: I think

132
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:02.880
Chris Padrutt: That having the sleep, you know, not feeling as bad as I'm physically as it normally do.

133
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.150
Chris Padrutt: And

134
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.350
Chris Padrutt: You know, realize lessons don't change so

135
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:32.460
Richelle Direny: But, but getting that sleep giving that mind dress was what was able to allow you to come to that determination that you know what I'm fighting for is not going to change. It's making me more tired to fight.

136
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.130
Richelle Direny: So,

137
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.430
Richelle Direny: Now, when in living in the now.

138
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:47.190
Richelle Direny: And in your now what's in your circle right now it's just you and your girlfriend. Is that correct,

139
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:54.780
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, we got a little garden out back aren't a mom like to do flowers in the yard and

140
00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:04.020
Chris Padrutt: So we pretty much on a nice days that we're not working around the you're doing shit or

141
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:14.610
Richelle Direny: And and do you find joy in just spending that quality time with her, whether it's gardening, whatever, whatever it is.

142
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.500
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, definitely. One

143
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:22.350
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. And you said to her mom so her mom is very involved in your life.

144
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.840
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, she lives. She lives with us.

145
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.980
Richelle Direny: And how was that for you because I know in your past relations.

146
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.560
Chris Padrutt: Oh yeah, she's fine. She's

147
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.120
Chris Padrutt: You know she does her own thing and

148
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.820
Chris Padrutt: You know, occasionally does stuff but you know might want to come to a store with us or something.

149
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.580
Chris Padrutt: But it's not anytime

150
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.290
Richelle Direny: Completely night and day.

151
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.530
Chris Padrutt: More normal, you know,

152
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.590
Richelle Direny: Was it I'm coming into that situation. Was it a little bit scarier for you.

153
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.650
Chris Padrutt: Know I'm more in a mindset now.

154
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.630
Chris Padrutt: I'll try to

155
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.920
Chris Padrutt: Dance through the bullshit. You know, if it's not working. It's not working. I mean,

156
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:20.910
Richelle Direny: They became a straight shooter before you sugar coated it now he's just like, whatever. Boom. There you go. You with you like it. You like you don't you don't

157
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:33.270
Richelle Direny: Gotcha, gotcha. Hey, you know what it is what it is. And like you said, it's very important to TV and now you have your

158
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:44.340
Richelle Direny: Who was I heard say say this, Well they, the way they put it, it's that if you you have one foot in the past and one in the future, your piston in the present.

159
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.210
Richelle Direny: Because it really is you what's within the presence

160
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.640
Richelle Direny: Nothing. So you have to stay in the present. Enjoy the presence

161
00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.750
Richelle Direny: You know, right, you're still begin your story in the present right you're storing in the presence. What are you enjoying today.

162
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:11.700
Richelle Direny: And knowing that we've been, you know, working together for a little while now and just even see you

163
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:21.270
Richelle Direny: I'm not necessarily Lion King a whole lot of, um, you know, interactions with others and doing all of that to see how

164
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:23.850
Chris Padrutt: I don't mind interactions with people.

165
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.650
Chris Padrutt: Genuine interactions. You know, I don't

166
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.700
Chris Padrutt: Like people's

167
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.360
Chris Padrutt: Pretending that you're not and

168
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.440
Chris Padrutt: You know,

169
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.100
Richelle Direny: We're always going to find that you're always going to find those people who weren't your phone.

170
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.700
Chris Padrutt: And I just

171
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.650
Chris Padrutt: I just keep them at arm's

172
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.020
Richelle Direny: Distance. Mr. Yeah, yeah.

173
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.110
Richelle Direny: You find that a lot new always you continue to find that

174
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.520
Richelle Direny: But it's still, it's still comes down to

175
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.990
Richelle Direny: You know, either way. Either way, I'm just saying, generally speaking.

176
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:08.310
Richelle Direny: In this time that we've been together, you still, even with some bout of depression, somehow, a lot of it having anxiety.

177
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:28.980
Richelle Direny: Or what have you, seeing how persistent. You were in going out there to find something to do, to have a little bit of stimulation mental and physical stimulation outside of just being home and being just kind of sitting there and thinking about the what ifs and the past and

178
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.440
Richelle Direny: The not having your children.

179
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:40.590
Richelle Direny: In the same proximity as you and not being able to speak to them but you found a way. So, like, to me, especially with everyone that I meet

180
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.280
Richelle Direny: In this this setting.

181
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:45.810
Richelle Direny: Hey,

182
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:58.410
Richelle Direny: CHRIS, DID IT OR everyone else to do it because it took a lot. And I'm sure it took a lot for you to go out there and do what you're doing.

183
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.580
Richelle Direny: It. Listen, Chris. Our first interaction. You had to have gone like through a pack of cigarettes with our interaction.

184
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.110
Richelle Direny: Now, I was surprised that even see you smoking one

185
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.790
Richelle Direny: So, you know, I want you to speak to that, like that anxiety, like what has decreased that anxiety.

186
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:28.740
Richelle Direny: Because I know you didn't really like this whole setting for it in the beginning, but um what decrease that

187
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:33.030
Chris Padrutt: Know,

188
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:47.070
Chris Padrutt: Sleep and get to know you, you know, you're generally try to help you know genuinely trying to help people not just I've talked to a lot of

189
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.820
Chris Padrutt: counselors and psychiatrists, the

190
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.260
Chris Padrutt: Dots somebody for five minutes and tell if they're

191
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.600
Chris Padrutt: Just there for the paycheck and

192
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.170
Chris Padrutt: So I think that helped and

193
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:11.070
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm saying, Boy, Chris there a cup cut back on that spoke in

194
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:20.370
Richelle Direny: So, but that's good, that's good. Like, I really look forward to meeting you with this smile on your face each and every time.

195
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:37.830
Richelle Direny: And that now I'm actually seeing you all the time and you try to make an effort for us to see you all the time. And now you're participating in the group. So, I mean, it definitely speaks volumes to how far you've come. Hold on, let me see what else I need to check in here.

196
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:59.220
Richelle Direny: And the other thing that we we had mentioned in terms of what you were working towards is a more positive mindset as you continue to process the anger and resentment towards the past and that's another thing.

197
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.770
Richelle Direny: I think, as you said, it speaks to you, I'm sure, without even realizing it, that

198
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:20.370
Richelle Direny: By thinking a little bit more positive. I mean, again, outside of the fact that you're saying that you have gotten that you're getting the rest because you're taking what is it the circle right it's the circle that helps

199
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:20.910
Chris Padrutt: You sleep.

200
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.950
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, so, and how many hours are you sleeping at night.

201
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.100
Chris Padrutt: I'm still a slave and about three or four but

202
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.780
Richelle Direny: It's better than

203
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.220
Chris Padrutt: Again, three or four maybe once a month if that

204
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:44.310
Richelle Direny: Um, so with um now with the three or four hours of sleep per night.

205
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.130
Richelle Direny: Did Dr. Jamison increase

206
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.010
Chris Padrutt: Yeah we uh she pretty much let me

207
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.030
Chris Padrutt: pick whatever was working on that and

208
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.510
Chris Padrutt: I could probably take more sleep longer, but it's a real groggy feeling

209
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:10.080
Chris Padrutt: The next day, so it kind of messes with my brain a little bit

210
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.320
Chris Padrutt: Falling asleep just feels like it's hard to breathe. If you take more than

211
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.760
Richelle Direny: Actually, gosh.

212
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.430
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, I tried it. I played around with it then.

213
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.550
Chris Padrutt: It must go, stick with what where it's at now.

214
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.700
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. OK, and

215
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.260
Chris Padrutt: From a medical is my shoulders. It's waking me up on me. Oh, OK.

216
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.790
Chris Padrutt: I will turn just because something could knock me out for longer doesn't mean, I'd be, you know,

217
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.540
Chris Padrutt: They're just not doing nothing with that as far as

218
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:55.650
Chris Padrutt: You know it's Medicaid. So they're go through six months of physical therapy before eating. I'll give you an MRI.

219
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.880
Richelle Direny: Did you you you fell in her attritional you

220
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.420
Chris Padrutt: Know, it was just from working in the warehouse for

221
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:05.430
Chris Padrutt: full year.

222
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.110
Chris Padrutt: You know,

223
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.270
Richelle Direny: So it's more of a strain.

224
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.380
Chris Padrutt: On the X ray

225
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.650
Chris Padrutt: On my worst fail and shoulder

226
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.070
Chris Padrutt: It's curved the way down.

227
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.320
Is not

228
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.450
Chris Padrutt: As much as it was shoulder. It's kind of like that so

229
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.430
Chris Padrutt: So that might be causing a lot of it, but

230
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:39.270
Richelle Direny: So what did they say what what can be done to rectify where it doesn't find is painful.

231
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.480
Chris Padrutt: Know if I'm they they've given me.

232
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:57.390
Chris Padrutt: creams and and inflammatories and stuff like that. When till I finish going through all this crap and actually get an MRI. Once I get an MRI on they're going to see this told her up, you know,

233
00:23:59.670 --> 00:23:59.940
Chris Padrutt: And

234
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:01.800
Chris Padrutt: Like I've had

235
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.160
Chris Padrutt: surgery on my elbow and

236
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.470
Chris Padrutt: I don't know if

237
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:24.000
Chris Padrutt: My bounds are awake or what, but I don't have problems breaking any fine but pieces of my elbow. You got the ball and you got to cut part pieces of the ball big hunks of it were broke off of it just floating around in my elbow.

238
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:29.460
Chris Padrutt: Um, they had to go in there and clean it all out and chef, but

239
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.550
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, I'm just waiting to

240
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.550
Chris Padrutt: You know, jump through all the hoops to

241
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.120
Chris Padrutt: See like decent saw my shoulders.

242
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:55.950
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, I was gonna think you know you can't you can't do a contract, you just have to go with getting an MRI and see what best to do to help because when you lay down. I'm sure it hurts more when you're laying down

243
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:03.540
Chris Padrutt: Yeah, like during the day. There's always I'm not doing things over my head and

244
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.280
Chris Padrutt: Are straight out in front of me like laying it over working on a car.

245
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.190
Chris Padrutt: Really doesn't bother me a whole lot through the day.

246
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:22.410
Chris Padrutt: But it seems like at night. That's when it gets in, it gets flying it'll actually my arms will go to sleep.

247
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.390
Chris Padrutt: And unless I stand up.

248
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:42.690
Chris Padrutt: You know the pain doesn't go away and it always subside to I laid back down and does off and to kick back in. Sometimes it's the worst pain like I've never cried because the pain, but this

249
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.340
Chris Padrutt: Has been so bad it's brought a tear to my

250
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.040
Richelle Direny: Family like

251
00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:56.070
Richelle Direny: You're really if it's really bad. That means that there's something pressing against something that needs to be addressed.

252
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:02.730
Richelle Direny: You know, like you said, the sad truth is when you don't have the right insurance. It doesn't make things go much quicker.

253
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.830
Richelle Direny: So, and there's not a whole lot of

254
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.220
Richelle Direny: You doesn't mess.

255
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.270
Chris Padrutt: Around with us.

256
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.480
Chris Padrutt: Insurance, but decent insurance is hard to find.

257
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.440
Richelle Direny: Well, nowadays, it is and that's kind of neurologists, right. That's what you call the nerve doctor right and neurologists

258
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:30.720
Richelle Direny: With the ones that deal with the nerve because it may be. It could also be like the nerves and different things that might be

259
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.190
Chris Padrutt: Well, I can't even

260
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.230
Chris Padrutt: You got to get referrals from

261
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah, with Medicaid, you have to get referrals from your primary doctor

262
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.050
Richelle Direny: Go to the specialist

263
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:54.360
Richelle Direny: Yes. And then there's jumping hoops in that and and I remember in the past. That was some of your frustration is when recommendations are make made, but then you have to jump through all these hoops, just to get to where you're going. And that's just really frustrating within itself.

264
00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:02.550
Richelle Direny: So I, I do agree with that. But, you know, yeah, if it's really bad. You don't want to

265
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:11.520
Chris Padrutt: That's another thing that was on the getting sleep part of it. I was dealing with that a bunch of psychiatry is that

266
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.950
Chris Padrutt: Are giving me the same shit over again. And I'm telling them it's not work and

267
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.500
Chris Padrutt: I'm glad that she actually took the time to listen and try something different.

268
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:24.420
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

269
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.800
Chris Padrutt: At least they will get some sleep. So I felt like I'm a little bit of progress.

270
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:43.590
Richelle Direny: I think there was one session where I was like okay, he's a little bit more intense than usual. So maybe we can read out three shots of the doctor and see if you know the lack of sleep, and I so the nice segue.

271
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.240
Richelle Direny: About

272
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.350
Richelle Direny: Working in a psychiatric facility.

273
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.140
Richelle Direny: Was a lot of people. And for me, seeing firsthand what lack of sleep does

274
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.220
Richelle Direny: Lack of sleep makes a person psychotic

275
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:11.160
Richelle Direny: And some for some people. I seen them display some superhuman strength because of its Chris you LAUGH But listen, I have seen some friends.

276
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.600
Richelle Direny: And and it was all because of lack of sleep.

277
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:28.590
Richelle Direny: When a person hasn't slept in days, it just throws everything off, you start seeing things. I mean it is I have seen people do some strange things

278
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:36.900
Richelle Direny: When you know what's funny when you finally give them that medication to somewhat shut their system down for it.

279
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:47.040
Richelle Direny: Somewhat kind of forces them to go to sleep. It calms them down to the point where you go to sleep, and they go to sleep for like a whole day or two, and they don't wake up.

280
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:58.710
Richelle Direny: When they wake up and you tell them what they were doing. They're like, No, there's no way i don't like if I could have recorded, you would have seen what you were doing.

281
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.820
Richelle Direny: And they're like, there's no way I would never

282
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:19.620
Richelle Direny: I've seen a person. It was a guy. He had superhuman shirt like five people on top of him trying to pin him down to like give him this medication. He gets up, he throws them off. It was ridiculous. And the next day, it was, it wasn't the next day or sometime after that.

283
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:30.150
Richelle Direny: He own. Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am, Mr a quota is this the same person talking to me because that's not how you were talking yesterday.

284
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:48.540
Richelle Direny: So it's in lack of sleep does a whole does I'm saying one thing can just throw the body completely off. And so the other thing that I'm thinking to maybe the intensity in terms of you know your your shoulders hurting

285
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:53.340
Richelle Direny: How is your mattress that you're sleeping on because I'm telling you they saw the worst mattresses in town.

286
00:29:54.150 --> 00:30:01.290
Chris Padrutt: Oh, it's this has been going on for three years now. So it's been several different mattresses and

287
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.980
Chris Padrutt: Swiss sitting up is about the best sleep. I get it.

288
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.530
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it out there.

289
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.320
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna throw it out there and I'm Chris. I've been through a few mattress Emma bad. Listen, my backfill her

290
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:29.910
Richelle Direny: Pastor, and I've been through some mattresses and you spend money on mattresses and it's just like, I need to get well you know kind of metrics. I really needing it is the ones that will open to sleep on the little ones that you cannot have hydraulics in it.

291
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:31.890
Chris Padrutt: Oh, yeah.

292
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:42.570
Richelle Direny: I'm telling you a mattress could because a lot of these masters, they sell a whole lot these days you spend a lot of money on it and it's not ideal. I think the best we've ever

293
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:49.350
Richelle Direny: The best painlessly if I'm ever had, surprisingly, was in a hospital bed.

294
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:51.270
Oh, yeah.

295
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.420
Richelle Direny: Why you think it's a hospital bed.

296
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.450
Chris Padrutt: Oh,

297
00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.130
Richelle Direny: Because remember, you can adjust it.

298
00:30:59.370 --> 00:30:59.700
Chris Padrutt: Well,

299
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:11.670
Richelle Direny: You can adjust it so your adjusted so your body gets its cooking dinner. Some of the hospitals, the mattress and it's a little thicker so you adjusted to conform to your body. And it's, it makes it

300
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:23.400
Richelle Direny: So your mattress could not to say there's nothing wrong with your shoulder. But what can aid in the pain at night. It's the mattress. If the mattress is not right then.

301
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.670
Chris Padrutt: That can definitely set up, but definitely Oh, because that's

302
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.770
Chris Padrutt: I got one of the, it's a

303
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.260
Chris Padrutt: Little kind of wraps around you, a little bit. It's meant to

304
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:41.700
Chris Padrutt: Set up the back against it. I got that pill up against that and so

305
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.240
Richelle Direny: Just kind of prop you yeah to kind of prop you up.

306
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:51.390
Richelle Direny: To be in a comfortable position, but I you know that that is another thing because

307
00:31:52.170 --> 00:32:01.200
Richelle Direny: You can think about everything in the world. But until you've experienced certain pain, you try to start ruling out and sometimes the things that are proper the problems to

308
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:16.590
Richelle Direny: The answers to some of our problems is ruling out the simplest little things, who would who would know that one of the issues you are having was the lack of sleep and not going because you weren't getting enough sleep, it was keeping you kind of in the super

309
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.760
Richelle Direny: You've been through three years, but three three.

310
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:28.830
Chris Padrutt: Was when I was working and had days and insurance. I've always my whole life. I've had problems sleeping.

311
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:30.810
Chris Padrutt: But I was working

312
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.540
Chris Padrutt: Third shift and

313
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.980
Chris Padrutt: They got a medication for

314
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:43.620
Chris Padrutt: Supposed to help people sleep when they're on a third shift schedule.

315
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.550
Chris Padrutt: A dog. I thought it was a good idea and everything, but

316
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.430
Chris Padrutt: Phuket insurance wouldn't pay for

317
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:58.560
Chris Padrutt: Everything else at night just write stuff to try to help me slightly, but none of it worked or didn't

318
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.500
Chris Padrutt: I don't know.

319
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.870
Richelle Direny: I think when you work when a baby comes into the world, what do you teach him to sleep when

320
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.540
Richelle Direny: When are they supposed to really sleep.

321
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.730
Chris Padrutt: Nothing really.

322
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.360
Richelle Direny: Know when you when you think about when you're coming to this world.

323
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:20.520
Richelle Direny: We're trained you sleep at night because that's what night is made for and you're up.

324
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.460
Richelle Direny: You're up during the day.

325
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.610
Richelle Direny: The one thing I can attest, I can attest to

326
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.460
Richelle Direny: But when you work third shift you never truly your body never really gets adjusted

327
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:39.630
Richelle Direny: To, you know, the opposite. It never gets adjusted to it because we're the ones that's forcing it to do.

328
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:47.310
Richelle Direny: Opposite than what it's designed to do you rest at night. That's why you have a night where the world shuts down your body shuts down

329
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:58.830
Richelle Direny: The day where the world is awake and that's the reason why if you try to sleep during the day, you kind of have to close your blinds and close everything and make it dark. So your mind thinks is time to go to sleep.

330
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:11.100
Richelle Direny: So when you try to change that. I remember in school when I was younger and I worked at night and I had to. I left work at like seven in the morning I went to

331
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:22.890
Richelle Direny: Class, and when I say Chris the sleep was kicking into overdrive. And I'm like sitting right in front of the teacher and my eyes were shutting down like it was it was kicking into true overdrive.

332
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:32.070
Richelle Direny: And she was like, I think she was like also somebody serotonin was going into overdrive because I guess that's what they call the different chemicals in your body.

333
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.450
Richelle Direny: In shape. And then I said, man.

334
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:40.140
Richelle Direny: And she was like, and she. That's how I learned this concept. She says, your body is not naturally designed

335
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:51.510
Richelle Direny: To stay awake all night. And when you force it, it becomes it's overload. Because now, your body is fighting it needs sending off these it's releasing these hormones.

336
00:34:51.840 --> 00:35:02.400
Richelle Direny: To saying you need to sleep you need to sleep you need to sleep. And that's why these you get fatigued, or you get like grouchy and all of this stuff because your body is saying you need to sleep you need to sleep.

337
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:10.020
Richelle Direny: So when you finally try to go to sleep. It's hard to fall asleep, because you have all these hormones that were released in your body.

338
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:17.490
Richelle Direny: And now you're fighting it to start a kind of calm down to allow you to sleep or to allow your mind to shut down. So naturally

339
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:28.170
Richelle Direny: I think over the years. We don't do what our, our bodies are naturally designed to do we teach it to do the very opposite. And when our body starts to fight against us.

340
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:44.130
Richelle Direny: We fight back, and the body is saying, No, you're fighting me to do something. I'm not designed to do. This is what I'm designed to do. And so giving someone medication to do the contrary of it, then what happens, what are some of the side effects to on that.

341
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:55.650
Richelle Direny: So it's like you really think you know hey I listened, by no means am I ever saying never to take your medication that you're describing, but sometimes you have to stop to think about it.

342
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.600
Chris Padrutt: Was one of my side. I never

343
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.830
Chris Padrutt: Never. You should go to the doctor ever

344
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.940
Chris Padrutt: Like my elbow or

345
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.670
Chris Padrutt: Stitches or something like that, but

346
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:19.950
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, so then you're fighting your body you're taking the doctor says all take this pill. You can help you to stay awake at night and then you take it and then you're

347
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:26.280
Richelle Direny: Then you're. What is the side effect to that. And then how does it affect you in the long run, and then

348
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:41.400
Richelle Direny: You know, all these different ailments that comes along the way. Because of the fact that you were fighting your body to do something and then you're wondering, oh, why did I get this. Why did I get that. Well, remember when you were doing this. So it's, it's, you have to

349
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:58.320
Richelle Direny: Listen to what your body is telling you and kind of go with that and just understand. Is it because I'm working more hours than I really need to. And I'm over exerting myself I'm is it that

350
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:08.010
Richelle Direny: I'm whatever it is that you're doing to your body and your body is saying, No, I know you can't do this. You can do this and you're fighting against it.

351
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.940
Richelle Direny: So, and all of this affects your psyche. You don't think it's affecting your psyche. But all of this affects your psyche

352
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:21.510
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, those are things to look at. And so now that you're retraining yourself.

353
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:37.050
Richelle Direny: To get sleep care for yourself, even in a more holistic natural way because the reality of it now. We're all quarantine. We really can't go out there and do as we please Like before, so in even think about it, Chris.

354
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:48.870
Richelle Direny: You take medication, whatever it is that you're doing and you're eating a lot of these hormone filled and chemical souls are generated foods that we're eating that's having an impact on you.

355
00:37:49.770 --> 00:38:03.810
Richelle Direny: So now you're retraining and you're saying, Hey, let's grow our own vegetable garden and you eat from the fact of your land that you've and so now you're feeling a whole lot better. So those are the things and you wonder, you know, what's really going on stopping and thinking

356
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:12.780
Richelle Direny: What's, what's making me feel better and it helps you now to kind of re shift into refocus where you are right now.

357
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:14.790
Richelle Direny: So,

358
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.590
Richelle Direny: I don't know.

359
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.600
Richelle Direny: What do you think

360
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:46.620
Chris Padrutt: I hope we all learn some from all you know I don't think we need to be packed on top of each other all the day on time and but I don't think we will. I've noticed that already. And people they like the niceness and so subsided, and now people's ass holding this is coming back out and

361
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:57.210
Chris Padrutt: I'll tell you some of the worst ones are old people, you know, I'm at the stores all day. Normally, old people just do their own thing and

362
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:02.910
Chris Padrutt: People are offering the hell and you know babe knowledge to

363
00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:13.650
Chris Padrutt: For some reason here last couple weeks, though, cut right in front of you to get in line, you know, cut you off.

364
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:21.660
Richelle Direny: Yeah, well, what, why do you think that is why do you think that is and I think about these the poor old people. Why do you think that is

365
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.760
Chris Padrutt: I don't know. People are just assholes anyone

366
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.280
Chris Padrutt: I don't know why the old people are

367
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:34.440
Richelle Direny: set in their ways. That's just number one.

368
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.890
Chris Padrutt: I'll probably be a lot more bad Rob hold

369
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:45.900
Richelle Direny: And then the number to remember what was the first thing that you heard about the coven 19 who is the number one.

370
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:55.500
Richelle Direny: The, the old people. So now. Hey, listen, I tried it. I mean granted, even though I'm 95 I'm not trying to go out like this.

371
00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:01.470
Richelle Direny: So they're saying, I don't want to catch this, so if they're opening the source, allow me to get in.

372
00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:11.940
Richelle Direny: You know, it's, it's, um, I saw this meme where the same thing with old people, I think it was like BJ. The, the wholesale store where all these people

373
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:21.510
Richelle Direny: Were all these old people were standing in front of the store and this guy was pushing his younger guy was pushing his way past to get to the front.

374
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:29.460
Richelle Direny: And when he got there some old person hit him and told him. Get back. Get back. So then he goes back to each. He makes his way back to the front.

375
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:44.820
Richelle Direny: Another old person beats him up and tells him to go to the back. He makes his way back again to the front, and he was somebody said something he was like if y'all stop. He's. What did he say if you don't start finding me let me open the door so y'all could get in because

376
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.100
Richelle Direny: The guy was trying to open the store to let them in.

377
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.060
But they refuse

378
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.860
Richelle Direny: To go in

379
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:54.750
Chris Padrutt: Oh, that's funny.

380
00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:07.320
Richelle Direny: But a lot of them. They're just scared they're just scared. So now here it is that they give them the opportunity, go in and get what you need to get and then leave and then the rest of the general population. But then the thing is

381
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:13.680
Richelle Direny: If you got like 20 oh people going in there. Remember, they all have phone got something they stick with something

382
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:26.460
Richelle Direny: So they just sharing it with each other. They're not thinking that they're just thinking, let me hurry up and get in there and let me get out. So that's probably why a lot of them are grouchy because a lot of them are very, very they're terrified.

383
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.940
Richelle Direny: They're terrified of contracting. It's simply because

384
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:39.930
Richelle Direny: In the initially they said that the population that was being affected by the greatest was the elderly population.

385
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:52.230
Richelle Direny: So, you know, no. You don't want to give them an excuse to being nasty because a lot of them are already nasty, but some like at this point in time. It's trying to understand they're playing. Yeah.

386
00:41:52.950 --> 00:42:00.270
Chris Padrutt: So how is pulling up to the place called Holly's. It's like an odd laws is a discount store.

387
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:05.700
Chris Padrutt: We're pulling up, get out of the car walking in and there's this

388
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:12.060
Chris Padrutt: She's probably 4050 years old got little wheel behind car, you know, and

389
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.100
Chris Padrutt: She looks like.

390
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.780
Chris Padrutt: Anybody else you know random person and all sudden here comes a guy come running out of the store.

391

Chris Padrutt: stole a bunch of shit anyway rip it all out of her bed. Well, I grabbed a bunch of it, but he said she made off of a bunch of other stuff, but it was funny as hell, she said.

394
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.440
Richelle Direny: She stole a bunch of stuff.

395
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Oh my god. We see people you see how many people are so ridiculous.

396
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:56.400
Richelle Direny: People are so ridiculous, but, you know, hey, what can you do about that can't do anything about that and people are people. You just have to

397
00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:11.520
Richelle Direny: Let me just think about me, let me think about my own sanity. Let me find my own joy, where I'm not getting angry and I'm not, you know, getting all bent out of shape for things that you don't have no control over and let me just stay in the presence so

398
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:20.010
Richelle Direny: Okay, Chris. So it's always a pleasure meeting with you. Let me try to schedule, you're going to schedule you for sometime in

Richelle Direny: Hopefully by June.
