190
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:38.850

191
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.990

iPhone: Well, I went, because they're not testing us.

194
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.780
iPhone: Mm hmm. And

195
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.600
iPhone: I have a lot of free time on my hands.

196
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.240

Mm hmm.

199
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.240
iPhone: So,

200
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.690

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.480

Serenna Beers: You can do it online through zoom now.

208
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.690
iPhone: What was that

209
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:58.830
Serenna Beers: You can go to online meetings.com I think it is or if you just do a search, find an online NA meeting, it'll pull up a website and they actually do zoom, just like this.

210
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.260
iPhone: Okay, yeah.

211
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.390
Serenna Beers: Just, just a little extra help there. You know, for those nights when you're struggling

212
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.190
iPhone: Sure.

213
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:17.790
iPhone: But I haven't really thought of any goals. This is a new process to me and it's been very frustrating so far.

214
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:26.850
iPhone: Yeah, and I've been in the waiting room for over 15 minutes before we arrived lights and my group.

215
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:34.080
iPhone: Was was told that I had to do surveys and

216
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:41.820
iPhone: This meeting. I wasn't told about. I mean, there's a lot

217
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.340
iPhone: more to this than

218
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.310
iPhone: That it's it's frustrating if you know if you're not familiar with being online.

219
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.150
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

220
00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:01.680
iPhone: And if it worries me about people who don't have an iPhone, like I do, and you know

221
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:10.560
iPhone: So I don't know. I don't really have any goals when it comes to re art just get into my groups.

222
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.800
Serenna Beers: Okay, what about I don't necessarily mean

223
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:34.980
Serenna Beers: Goals for bright how bright heart. I came to say it goals for bright heart, per se. I mean goals for yourself that we can assist you with. Does that make sense so like, what, what do you hope to work on. I mean, what is your overall goal with attending groups.

224
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.090
iPhone: Just said listen to try to

225
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.640
iPhone: Look, learn what other people are doing.

226
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.140
iPhone: Mm hmm. And

227
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.810
iPhone: Stay connected and hopefully being encouraging.

228
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.810
iPhone: Others.

229
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.130
Serenna Beers: That's good. That's a start, you know,

230
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:11.130
Serenna Beers: Yeah, um, do you have someone that you call when you're feeling really triggered, like when you want to use really bad. Is there, is there a. Is there a point person that you try to call or is

231
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:21.540
Serenna Beers: What do you, what do you do, especially because you just shared with me that your cravings, or your desire to use has been pretty strong. What do you do

232
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.360
iPhone: Anybody right now.

233
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.410
Okay.

234
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.230
Serenna Beers: That's what my concern was

235
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.750
Serenna Beers: So,

236
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.390
iPhone: I'm in how people are doing it. Okay.

237
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.580
Serenna Beers: I'm going to give you a little tool, if you don't mind.

238
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:17.190
Serenna Beers: Because it's not. I mean, it's tough. Any, any way. But then you throw on all this stuff where we have to stay home and

239
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:35.070
Serenna Beers: You know, we can't go anywhere. We can't do the things that we used to do for self care. It makes it really hard and it makes it. I mean, it's hard. Anyway, but you throw addiction on it. I mean, you're already struggling just to get through the day. And now all of a sudden we have all this

240
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:35.940
iPhone: Right, I

241
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.380
Serenna Beers: Mean, that's like compound and that's like pouring salt on in open moon right

242
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.150
Serenna Beers: Right, right.

243
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:50.250
Serenna Beers: So I'm going to share my screen for a second. Let me see if I can do a whiteboard here.

244
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.790
Serenna Beers: Can you see me so

245
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.520
iPhone: Yes.

246
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:04.260
Serenna Beers: Okay, so this is what I like to call it, there's a short term and it's called stupa you've probably never heard of it. And I would imagine, because

247
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:11.640
Serenna Beers: I made up the word. It's a thing that that's been going or that's been around forever. I just made up a short term.

248
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:22.140
Serenna Beers: For it because I could never remember it. And this doesn't only have to be for like when you want to use this can be with anything when you can't can troll. Your, your

249
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:35.280
Serenna Beers: Anger rage when you're really sad and and you're tired of being sad and you want to feel happy again this can be used for anything. This isn't just substance but in your particular

250
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.320
Serenna Beers: Case I would like you to

251
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:45.480
Serenna Beers: Try to do it when you feel like you want to use. And you're like, at your wit's end and you're ready to call the the dope man or dope.

252
00:22:46.260 --> 00:23:00.390
Serenna Beers: Lady or who your person. Right, right. So, it's called a stupa and what a stupa is in in every relapse. All right, we start with situation thought, let me write this out.

253
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.250
Serenna Beers: Situation thought, feeling urge action. Right. So our situation it's I want to use

254
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:15.960
Serenna Beers: Just, I want to use. That's my situation. I want to use. And I'm going to use. If I don't figure this crap out right

255
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.850
Serenna Beers: Right, what comes along with those type of thoughts. I want to use thought

256
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:22.500
Serenna Beers: Well,

257
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.470
Serenna Beers: They aren't testing me right now.

258
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.090
Serenna Beers: Right.

259
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.060
Serenna Beers: Right testing. Let me go like

260
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.730
Serenna Beers: Wow.

261
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.650
Serenna Beers: Okay. They are testing.

262
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.750
Serenna Beers: Yeah, this thing wants to give me grief right now.

263
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.530
Serenna Beers: Let me go, hang on.

264
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.180
Serenna Beers: Do

265
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:56.580
Serenna Beers: Of course, that did that. Okay. They aren't testing me right now you're just gonna have to deal with the space. So sorry right now.

266
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.900
Serenna Beers: Right now, so that that would be a yucky thought right

267
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:01.950
iPhone: Right.

268
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.140
Serenna Beers: My feeling my be

269
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:22.530
Serenna Beers: Anxious right I might feel worried. Heck, I might even have a little bit of excitement because with that comes, kind of like adrenaline right that pre digital like you're getting ready to, you know, like when you're waiting on it and you, you feel that anxiety. Right.

270
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:36.390
Serenna Beers: Is worried. And I know you know exactly what I'm saying. Worried anxious fear because what if all of a sudden, tomorrow we bust out testing again. Right. So there's that fear.

271
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:45.180
Serenna Beers: Maybe there's some depression because it's like, why can I figure this out. I don't know how people do it, why, why. So you might have some of that.

272
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.390
Serenna Beers: Which

273
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.310
Serenna Beers: I don't know why this thing is not doing this. Okay, so

274
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:10.140
Serenna Beers: Let's go urge so my urge is going to be to us. Right. How could it not be if I have a thought of, well, they aren't testing me right right now. I'm feeling anxious, depressed worried

275
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:19.890
Serenna Beers: And I've got some fear. Why would not use that would be my urge well if my urge is to use. What do you think I'm likely to do

276
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:23.940
iPhone: You

277
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.250
Serenna Beers: Let me capitalize that right

278
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:41.010
Serenna Beers: Right. Well, that is no boy. No, we don't want that. We don't like that. That's not where your goal is right. Your goal is I'm trying to get through this out using. Okay, so here is where the magic. Are you ready to hear some really good news.

279
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.750
iPhone: Here. Okay.

280
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.320
Serenna Beers: We're going to start all over. We're going to clear it.

281
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:55.140
Serenna Beers: Clear All drawings. Okay, we're gonna start over with the same thing. We're gonna go situation.

282
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.640
Serenna Beers: I can spell.

283
00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.410
Serenna Beers: Situation dot O

284
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:03.510
Serenna Beers: Feeling

285
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.330
Serenna Beers: Urge

286
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:18.240
Serenna Beers: Action now situation is still the same. I want to use right my situation is I want to use and you're trying to figure out how you are going to use

287
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:29.280
Serenna Beers: Here's where the key is, it's where we change our thought because our thought we changed the thought we changed the behavior if our thoughts are all negative, more than likely

288
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:42.720
Serenna Beers: The feeling in the urge proceeding that are also going to be along those same lines. So what if the thought was, what would be a thought that's a positive thought that's in a recovery mindset or just as more positive. What would be a thought.

289
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.890
iPhone: Well for me, us, it would be temporary. It's not worth it.

290
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:05.160
Serenna Beers: It's a temporary solution. How about this one to a permanent problem.

291
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.300
Yeah.

292
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:20.670
Serenna Beers: Okay, now and there's more thoughts. Right. But just for like time sake. And just because I, I want you to understand how this works, because you can literally like when you have this feeling of wanting

293
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:36.780
Serenna Beers: To use. You can sit, sit down with a piece of paper and write out your, your strength. Okay. You think to yourself, I need to write this out because I don't want to use. So I need to figure out how to change my thought to change my

294
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:46.740
Serenna Beers: My action to my thought. It's a temporary solution to a permanent problem. So, what is my feeling. If I feel that way. What do you think that I'm going to feel

295
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.110
Serenna Beers: Think, maybe, maybe a little bit of hope.

296
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:03.450
iPhone: Yeah, just saying it mean right like just feel lighter

297
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.020
Serenna Beers: Whole. So how about calmer, or I feel calm.

298
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:17.880
Serenna Beers: Is there any joy. I mean, just saying that like you know you know beyond a shadow of a doubt you know better than anybody.

299
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:28.020
Serenna Beers: You know better than anybody that you pick up one time and it is not going to solve your problem. You know that, right, intuitively you know that

300
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:35.880
Serenna Beers: But sometimes saying it in your head is not enough. You got to get it out and you literally have to go through the steps of it.

301
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:52.380
Serenna Beers: My situation which turns into a thought, which creates a feeling, which produces an urge, which causes me to respond. That's my action. Right. So if I feel calm. Let's just even just say calm. If I feel calm. What do you think that my urge is going to be

302
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.590
iPhone: To say straight to

303
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.160
Serenna Beers: Us.

304
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.980
Serenna Beers: To not use right

305
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:13.380
Serenna Beers: Right. So if I have the urge to not use. What do you think I'm likely going to do

306
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:27.690
iPhone: It is. And when I find something else to fill that void.

307
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.890
Serenna Beers: And find something else better for me. How's that

308
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:32.820
Okay.

309
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.690
Serenna Beers: Okay, you have a phone.

310
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.940
