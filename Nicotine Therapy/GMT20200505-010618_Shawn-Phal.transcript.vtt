00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.570
Isaak: Hi.

2
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.980
Isaak: Yeah thank

3
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.940
Isaak: You. How's it going, um, things are. OK, I guess, well it worked. Okay. At first, like the past month like

4
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.830
Isaak: I don't know, I just because it's locked down. I mean the guy extended to get stuff like I've just been noticing like

5
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.950
Isaak: I don't know if it's been cooped up at home or what but like I was sort of some like more cravings and stuff, you know. So I talked to my

6
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:15.690
Isaak: My doctor or whatever. And I'm going back up to what I was on originally and i mean i don't know i'm kind of bummed about that, but it's like, I don't want to like mess up, you know,

7
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.640
Isaak: So,

8
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.330
Shawn Phalen: My you been coming why you'd be bummed about having to go up.

9
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.790
Isaak: Well, I mean, I don't know, like, because I had like this whole game plan, you know, like I wanted to

10
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:42.900
Isaak: Taper and like you know like eventually Ryan got, like, you know, almost off this I learned to like maybe go to school or get, like, you know, more full time, you know, job and stuff. And I just have like a game plan. And then this coronavirus stuff just like messed everything up.

11
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.590
Isaak: But, um, I mean, I've got a new game plan, though. Now, so, like, so that's good. I guess like you know in the past few days like I figured out like

12
00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:02.910
Isaak: I'm just going to go back up on my medicine and then I'm probably going to try to get a car because I've got a few months, like, I don't know. I've got like a few grand

13
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.150
Isaak: From, like, the stimulus checks and stuff and just have a money left over. So I'm going to get a car, and then I might do grub hub.

14
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:29.970
Isaak: Yeah, right. Because I mean, right now I think that's the best option because like I live with people that are at risk. But, I mean, I won't really be around, you know, people when shit so seems like, I don't know, I just kind of need a purpose right now because I'm just all I

15
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.490
Isaak: Just all fucked up right now.

16
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.050
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, it's a little frustrating, isn't it.

17
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.510
Isaak: Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I just had like a shit ton of anxiety honestly like

18
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.720
What do you think things is from

19
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.740
Isaak: I mean just feeling stuck like i mean i don't know like I started getting clean and stuff. And like now slop down like I feel like

20
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:07.680
Isaak: Now, the world's on pause. You know what I mean like I felt like my life was on pause because of my choices. So now. Now, I don't know. It's like the world is on drugs. Yeah. You know what I mean.

21
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.430
Shawn Phalen: Did you have any relapses when you were having those cravings.

22
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.410
Isaak: No, no.

23
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:32.580
Isaak: That's good. What did you do when you have the cravings, um, honestly. I mean, it was pretty tough. I mean, I was like kind of a nightmare. I'm sure I mean I'm. It doesn't help you, that you know we're all being like cooped in the house and shit so right. I don't know.

24
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:43.980
Isaak: That's like another reason kind of why I want to get a job just so like, I'm not here, like all the time, you know, because we're all just cooped up all the time and yeah

25
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.400
Shawn Phalen: So tell me what you did when you enter cravings. We just white knuckling it

26
00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:08.010
Isaak: Well, I mean, I don't know, I just got depressed and you like an isolate like there was a week where like I really just didn't do like anything. You know what I mean, like, I only took like maybe a few showers. You know, like it was bad, like I just didn't. I was just fucked up.

27
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.700
Shawn Phalen: Was that anxiety or from cravings.

28
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:34.560
Isaak: I mean like cravings and anxiety. Like, I mean I feel like the cravings, like triggered anxiety and like depression you know cuz i mean i'm i don't know i used to bring to you know, and so I was trying not to do that as well. So because like that's like go to and I don't know.

29
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.960
Yeah.

30
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.910
Shawn Phalen: I mean, you can still go for walks right you can still

31
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.210
Isaak: Yeah. Oh, I could still do that. I've been. I've been working out. But like I said, I don't know, it's just like a few weeks ago, like it was really bad. You know, I'm kind of like

32
00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:07.200
Isaak: put things together. Now, you know, like, I mean, I stopped working out for a little bit. I just started like kind of eating unhealthy again and but I just past week or so I kind of put everything you know back together so

33
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.270
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so I mean this is this quarantines not gonna, it's not gonna last forever.

34
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.040
Isaak: Yeah, I know.

35
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.500
I know. I mean, it was extended yeah and that sucks, but it's gonna be for only, you know, another month

36
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.120
Isaak: Yeah, hopefully. Yeah, and

37
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:40.200
Shawn Phalen: And so I think that it's also about finding things like even though it's really difficult to have a routine right now. It's really important to have operating

38
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.910
Isaak: Know, I know.

39
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:59.790
Isaak: So if that means like going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time, if that means like you take a walk in the morning and then you take a walk at night, you know you're doing thing staying engaged to get out of that out. It's us

40
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.870
Isaak: Oh, I mean, I've been I'm pretty routine for the most part, like even I mean

41
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.180
Isaak: But like I said, like, I don't know. I've just had like a few tough weeks, you know, I'm just glad that I sat back to the most part, you know,

42
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.980
Isaak: And I'm glad that I i said something to you know my doctor, whatever.

43
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.110
Isaak: Honestly, like I i don't know if I would have made it much longer. So I'm so glad you said something

44
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.730
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so, has she increased her medication. Have you started taking it.

45
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.640
Isaak: Yeah, I mean, so basically

46
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:45.930
Isaak: I wasn't going to get like a new prescription for like another week or two, but he made it to her like I'll get my next prescription or whatever, like next week.

47
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:56.040
Isaak: Or like this week actually Friday or whatever. And like I have just enough to where like, I started taking, you know, to, again, to make it though.

48
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.870
Isaak: Okay, did you take to today. Yeah.

49
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.720
You notice the difference here.

50
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:14.130
Isaak: Um, I kinda yeah I mean like, like, I don't know. It's only been like a few days. But I mean, like the cravings been like a little bit

51
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.110
Isaak: But yeah

52
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.560
So,

53
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:32.460
Isaak: I mean, yeah, so during that like my game plan is just like grub hub cuz I mean like, you know,

54
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.360
Isaak: I think like most people that want food delivered right now or whatever. Probably going to like just wanting to even on the porch.

55
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:48.870
Isaak: Is like, usually there's the option where like, you know, you could have them bring them to the door, whatever. So it'll just be good. So I don't x, you know, excellent. We get the virus or something and bring a year.

56
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.550
Isaak: So,

57
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.790
Shawn Phalen: I agree. I think most

58
00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:04.560
Isaak: People are fine with you just leaving end up the door or wherever on the yeah you can wear a mask that would help you feel safer, you can work with that would help us today for

59
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:14.340
Isaak: You can certainly spend your day doing grub hub. You know, like can, yeah.

60
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.070
Shawn Phalen: Movie out as long as you want to be out right

61
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.240
Shawn Phalen: Have you ever done it before.

62
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:40.110
Isaak: I'm not that kind of job. No, I mean, yeah, no, I haven't really done delivery stuff but I mean I have done it and stuff. And I mean it's a it's pretty easy and you know it's it's decent I figured it would be like probably better like wages right now because you

63
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.870
Isaak: More takeouts going on.

64
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.470
Isaak: People make good money doing that. Yeah, you know,

65
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.930
Isaak: I mean it's supplemental think because you're, you're still, you're not getting unemployment anymore, you know. Yeah.

66
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.130
Shawn Phalen: So at least had some money coming in and like

67
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.000
Isaak: Good as often as you want to do it. And I feel like

68
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.490
I feel like

69
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.120
Shawn Phalen: I understand that you wanted to taper get it.

70
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.380
Yeah.

71
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.100
Shawn Phalen: I thought, I thought it was a little too soon.

72
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.950
Isaak: Yeah, that's okay.

73
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.470
And you found out that it was probably a little bit too soon.

74
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.770
Shawn Phalen: And it's an easy fix. Which is a really good news, right. Good thing.

75
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:54.750
Shawn Phalen: That's easy to fix. And now it's gives you time and space to think about what's next plane is like so. Now what like once once this quarantines over what do you wanting to do you think you want to, what's your next goal in terms of what you want to accomplish.

76
00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:05.700
Isaak: Um, well, the quarantines over. I mean, I'm not really sure. Like, I mean depends, like if I start the grub hub. You know, I might stick around that, you know,

77
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:18.300
Isaak: On how it goes and stuff and I'm still going to be up. I mean, I might try to taper like a few months after the quarantine like it just all depends. Like when it ends, you know,

78
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:33.900
Isaak: But tell me why you want to taper. I say why I just feel like okay well I just feel like, I don't know, I, I just don't want to be on like this too long. Like, I don't know, I just feel like, to me, like, I don't know.

79
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.540
Isaak: I just wish like I could just start for us to done. You know what I mean.

80
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.290
Shawn Phalen: But what you don't understand is that by being on this Suboxone years

81
00:10:46.470 --> 00:11:03.810
Isaak: You're starting you're starting fresh, you have a fresh start now. Yeah, no, I just think of it that way more. I mean, I do, though, and you know, like, for me, it's been like a miracle. For me, it really is because like i mean i was i was pretty fucked up without it, you know. Yeah.

82
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:16.590
Shawn Phalen: So here's here's maybe a way of thinking about this is, like, you're not gonna have to be on the Suboxone forever. Okay. And it's not a defeat. It's okay. Look, listen.

83
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:29.520
Shawn Phalen: Look at you, you, you have a lot of courage okay and and you really wanted to taper and I get it. And it's not a failure. It's not a defeat. It's just that it's not time right now.

84
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:40.980
Shawn Phalen: That's all. And it doesn't mean look, if you're not gonna. You don't have to be on this for the rest of your life. But you have to be really smart about it. Great.

85
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:54.300
Shawn Phalen: You know, you're still an early sobriety and then really, really well and really stupid done so well you have come so far. I mean, I've started, I started working with you when you first got in this program.

86
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.340
Isaak: I know I saw

87
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.510
Shawn Phalen: You know, like, I mean, from where you were and where you are now was amazing.

88
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.280
Shawn Phalen: So the next step is to

89
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:21.120
Isaak: Find a job now so finding a practice not mean you have to be off Suboxone at all. Yeah, you're, you're right. Okay, that's like I feel like this whole situation, it's kind of helped me realize that a little bit, you know,

90
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:39.570
Isaak: Like, I don't know if like the lockdown. And then trying to taper and then going back up. Like, I realize that, because like you know my original plan was like that I felt like I just needed to taper off this, you know, and I mean you're right it is pretty early to I mean

91
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.400
Isaak: It hasn't really been a year yet. You know what I mean, right.

92
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:57.870
Shawn Phalen: Like, I think, I think we talked about this, this might have been a while ago. But I think what I had said to say, okay, you have to Elise, give it a year, maybe a year and a half with being on Suboxone for you consider tapering

93
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.380
Isaak: Yeah, so the next thing is like there's

94
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:10.650
Isaak: In terms of like personal growth and emotional growth. The next step is to find a job like your night five or how

95
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.560
Shawn Phalen: Whenever a 40 hour week a job right.

96
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.000
Isaak: So then you get that experience under your belt and then you start to

97
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:28.350
Shawn Phalen: You start earning your money. Right. And then the next step might be to find your own place when you feel like you're ready to do that, like, so you're taking steps to

98
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.520
Just be completely self supporting and self sufficient.

99
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.920
Isaak: Yeah, no, I know that's that's what I wanted. Yeah, so

100
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.770
Shawn Phalen: You know that's that's also you know what sobriety is, you know, to

101
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:54.930
Isaak: hold a job that I know you can hold a job. Yeah, I had like, you know, I felt that's that's why, like a, you know, that was for like my plan right now.

102
00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:05.100
Isaak: I guess when I had a job in the past like, you know, I felt love like better. You know what I mean, even though I was like messed up. Like, it's still gave me more purpose that I have right now. You know what I mean.

103
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.460
You're young yeah you know like you're young and, you know,

104
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:22.860
Isaak: The world's your oyster. Yeah. And you're right, you should be out there working and you should be earning your own money and you should be meeting people for work, you know, that's all part of

105
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:32.640
Isaak: Know I know that's all part of what you should be doing. And once this cortinas over yeah now start working towards that. It just take this

106
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.160
Shawn Phalen: It's not a race. Okay.

107
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:41.100
Isaak: It's fine, not a race. So I know it's disappointing.

108
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.680
Isaak: Yeah, but

109
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.470
Shawn Phalen: You know, even you said, you know, that was your game plan. And now, and now you have another game plan, you know,

110
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.040
Yeah.

111
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.100
Shawn Phalen: Right. And here's

112
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.780
Isaak: Her you know

113
00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:04.050
Shawn Phalen: That's what it is. It's trial and error and and you know even you were just saying, like you're really messed up when you first came to this program.

114
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:12.090
Yeah. And so you have to look at how far you've come and how far you you know where you want to call not what you don't want to go backwards.

115
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.860
Isaak: Yeah.

116
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.980
So, you know, just keep putting your foot one foot or the other and

117
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.090
Shawn Phalen: Are you feeling

118
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:39.360
Isaak: Kinda Democrats. Um, well, I mean I have like, yeah, I mean, often on you know like today was a lot better though because like I started to like kind of come up with an idea of what I'm going to do, you know, but like, often on

119
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:55.110
Isaak: Hasn't been really overwhelming, or do you think, do you think it's from less because you're not, you weren't taking as much oxygen. Um, I mean, I'm sure it's like a combination of things, you know,

120
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.260
Isaak: Feeling better for the most part, you know,

121
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.670
Isaak: Don't be so hard on yourself. I know.

122
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.580
Shawn Phalen: Seriously come so far. Look at your accomplished.

123
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.250
Isaak: All right, good. Fear depression starts
