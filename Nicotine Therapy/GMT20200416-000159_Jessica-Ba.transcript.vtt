Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And are they doing right here for that to

21
00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:00.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I haven't been out doing much grocery shopping, but I know the trader joes in my area that was the first time I experienced that all like, I believe, like 10 at a time going in.

22
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, I think I'm going to Publix, too, but it was early in the morning they hadn't done that the sets, maybe later in the day they do that, but

23
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whatever it takes to make you feel safe, as well as the employees feel safe.

24
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.120
Brian Kern: Yeah, this is crazy, like she doesn't feel safe at all.

25
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Gloves. Yeah. There they have masks for them.

26
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.560
Brian Kern: And stuff so

27
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.080
Brian Kern: Keeping her home masks. So

28
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.960
Brian Kern: The times that we like left to go like, we want to target today, get some stuff and

29
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.470
Reward

30
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.230
Brian Kern: I feel like she's going to be exposed like she's going to get exposed to, you know, I mean, just like

31
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.150
Brian Kern: Two containers.

32
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.960
Brian Kern: Young man.

33
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

34
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.000
Brian Kern: Very scary crazy time

35
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know and

36
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And with your anxiety checking in. How is how is this for you.

37
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.460
Brian Kern: Oh,

38
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.610
Brian Kern: Some days I get pretty anxious, but

39
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.860
Brian Kern: Yeah, is is manageable. You know, I mean,

40
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:26.100
Brian Kern: I've been trying to like work, work out. And I've been gone to like digital a meetings on zoom

41
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.530
Brian Kern: Yeah.

42
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.450
Brian Kern: That's good. I felt like I needed I

43
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.100
Brian Kern: Needed to do that.

44
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.460
Brian Kern: No, I

45
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.010
Brian Kern: Like before that I haven't been to a meeting, basically the whole time. I live in Mexico, you know, because they're all so far with

46
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.790
Brian Kern: My house.

47
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.800
Brian Kern: Yeah, me is I mean just like stay home all that, you know,

48
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your hobbies or anything that you learned about yourself in this process.

49
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.620
Brian Kern: Oh, no. I mean, I've just been playing a lot of video games.

50
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.260
Brian Kern: Right.

51
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.410
Brian Kern: This like I play video games. I like clean house and Coke, you know,

52
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.640
Brian Kern: Workout morning

53
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I ever played the drama triangle video

54
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For you.

55
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.480
Brian Kern: Know,

56
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think prior to this, we just have one session. Right.

57
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.100
Brian Kern: Yeah.

58
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. All right. I want to

59
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:58.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make this video because it helps me to get a little more insight about the patients, I'm working with a different responses.

60
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.640
Brian Kern: Oh,

61
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.650
Brian Kern: You know what, let me let me connect

62
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.740
Brian Kern: My connection. So I started out

63
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.100
Brian Kern: In caves. Let's see if this makes it better.

64
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

65
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:38.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: conflict arises between people, often in dramatic or intense relationships or interactions and it will hear it. Okay.

66
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.230
Brian Kern: Oh yes, I'm here.

67
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:56.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To help us understand how conflict arises between people, often in dramatic or intense relationships or interactions and it was conceived by a guy called Stephen common in 1968

68
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it involves three different roles one that's kind of cold one down role and two that are called one up for all

69
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Three roles. The victim, the rescuer

70
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.760
persecutor

71
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:22.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I think understanding how these roles work can really help us to identify how we could be resolving potentially destructive interactions that are quite

72
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Draining on our energy. So let's start with the victim role. And I think the victim role is quite self explanatory.

73
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:42.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's the person who feels helpless and powerless, like they can never cut a break or they can never get ahead in life. They often think things like, you know, this always happens to me.

74
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:55.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another role in this drama triangle is the rescuer and this person is someone who takes responsibility for other people's problems and they kind of make it their own problem.

75
00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:06.090
Brian Kern: But at the same time, I don't really look at their own in fact be a complaint minutes and they'll say people who might be going through a difficult time and think, oh look at that person.

76
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:17.400
Brian Kern: You know they need help. I'm nice so I'll help them or maybe something a bit more parental like if that person did what I said they'd be happy.

77
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:19.860
And I think

78
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.570
Brian Kern: That we often say pay out between the victim.

79
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:40.260
Brian Kern: And the rescuer is something that we see in movies and, you know, romantic comedies all the time. It's something that we almost think is normal, but it really is an unhealthy interaction. So the third one is triangle.

80
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is a persecutor. This is a person who is frustrated. They kind of self righteous and a bit of a bullied.

81
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, and they might think things like you know they're wrong and I might may need to do what I say.

82
00:08:53.010 --> 00:09:01.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or that person will get what's coming to them. Another thing that's really important to recognize it at this triangle is that each of these roles move between each other.

83
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:17.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, you know, the rescuer can become a prostitute or or the persecutor can become the victim, the victim can become prosecutor. So they all kind of move around another concept that's really important to understand when talking about the drama triangle.

84
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.840
Brian Kern: Is this idea of that.

85
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:31.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We tend to have this one role that we most naturally sort of enter into. So for instance, you know one person might often go straight to the victim role where someone else might jump into the rescue.

86
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:43.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The other thing that's really interesting about this is that starting get role, sort of, is part of what we see as or an identity and like I said before, we shift from one role to the other.

87
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:56.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Inevitably, we all end up in the victim role feeling powerless and helpless and then I able to do anything. And that's why it's really important to work out strategies for how to get out of this triangle.

88
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I guess that brings me to the next question. How do we get out of this drama triangle.

89
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:12.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's take it by looking at each role again. So in the one down victim role, we need to become a survivor. In order to do this.

90
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:25.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We need to think like a problem solver and ask ourselves questions like what do I want and what steps can I take to get what I want another useful thing to do is to reflect on the good things that are going away.

91
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.760
So we can make a note of it in a calendar or diary.

92
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, ask ourselves questions like What are three things that I'm grateful for today.

93
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or at the end of each week we could ask ourselves, what did I change this week.

94
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:52.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's move on to the rescuer role. Again, if this is where you tend to find yourself sitting, you need to think of yourself as a teacher or a coach.

95
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Rather than as a rescuer you need to remember the golden rule that teaching a man to fish.

96
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:04.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you need to support and encourage the person in ways to identify and solve their problems rather than rushing into solve it for them.

97
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:12.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can ask them things like, what is it that you want to see happen in a situation or what do you think you can do to changes.

98
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Also, you need to make sure that you set boundaries setting boundaries around the time that you're able to listen to the person I'm letting them know that is really important.

99
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:29.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In some ways it's a similar situation with the starting gate persecutor who left the rescue up for themselves in these sort of one off how powerful position.

100
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The difference is with this role is that you need to become a challenge, need to be firm but fair in your approach to people.

101
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:50.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And to help the person recognize how you're feeling, you need to sort of address the consequences of their actions and set boundaries. So for instance, you could say something like, if you if you keep your side of the agreement, I can keep one

102
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:58.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As well the rescuer. It's important to remember to set these boundaries and recognize that this isn't your problem to solve.

103
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:13.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: By freeing ourselves from this drama triangle, we are able to have happier, healthier relationships with people. We won't feel so drained and powerless and we'll also be able to identify toxic relationships that we may in fact be better off without

104
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.490
Brian Kern: Very insightful.

105
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.180
Brian Kern: Yeah.

106
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me more about that. What, what did you relate to

107
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.610
Brian Kern: Probably like

108
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.030
Brian Kern: Maybe definitely not persecutor

109
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.910
Brian Kern: Not really rescuer either. Yeah.

110
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:12.420
Brian Kern: I don't try it. I mean, I guess sometimes like when my wife is feeling depressed, finally help her.

111
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.400
Brian Kern: I mean,

112
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.340
Brian Kern: Like she's not feeling like the presley Lisa China.

113
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.900
Brian Kern: China like help her in that sense.

114
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.950
Brian Kern: You know I wouldn't

115
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:35.340
Brian Kern: I wouldn't really say I'm like a rescue though you know i got i try I do try to like figures figure stuff out for, you know, like right now she's on

116
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.780
Brian Kern: She's having trouble getting the medication that she usually takes

117
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.490
Brian Kern: Because it's like she never had a psychiatrist here.

118
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:54.060
Brian Kern: Yeah. Well, actually, she does, she saw a psychiatrist like on like a digital format, kind of like how we're doing, you know, but

119
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.650
Brian Kern: He actually tried today to do that again. And they said Ofer

120
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.230
Brian Kern: Seven trying to figure it out for

121
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like this is the higher level care.

122
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.570
Brian Kern: Know they said they weren't because the medication. She takes. It's like, I guess.

123
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:19.590
Brian Kern: I don't know. They just said they couldn't they couldn't give her that medication for some reason, even though he did last time.

124
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.330
Brian Kern: So,

125
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:29.190
Brian Kern: It's kind of, kind of, I mean she saw a summer vacation weapon like she's not alone out

126
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:29.910
So,

127
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I don't know.

128
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.090
But

129
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:38.340
Brian Kern: Yes, I guess, either the victim or the rescuer really, you know,

130
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:50.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You actually you actually align with the victim role in opportunities where your wife needs you. You're able to take on the rescue.

131
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.410
Brian Kern: Yeah.

132
00:14:53.370 --> 00:15:02.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah what what resonated with you in the video what times or situation was shared that made you say oh yeah that's that's my role right there.

133
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.740
Brian Kern: Oh,

134
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.620
Brian Kern: I guess.

135
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:17.250
Brian Kern: I don't know, like I was falling victim. Just because everything that's happened to me in the past, like with getting attacked by other shitty

136
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:24.450
Brian Kern: You know, like it's literally like this guy was on trial. And I was like the victim ups case, you know, I mean,

137
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.880
Brian Kern: So,

138
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was the outcome of that.

139
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.320
Brian Kern: He got life in prison.

140
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.860
Brian Kern: Yeah, like, basically. Oh.

141
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.250
Brian Kern: Yeah trial where I had to testify

142
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:46.110
Brian Kern: And so I really didn't want to but you know we got had to go on the stand and like

143
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.100
Brian Kern: You know, they're asking questions and

144
00:15:51.960 --> 00:16:03.450
Brian Kern: Yeah, and then they were like showing the pictures of me like on the stretcher basically like with my face mutilated and stuff is pretty darn so yeah

145
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.060
Brian Kern: And then they they were talking about like how my brother died right afterwards and

146
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.470
Brian Kern: So like I still think about it a lot.

147
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of trauma, I can imagine that those you would replay those soon.

148
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because

149
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

150
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.650
Brian Kern: I still have nightmares.

151
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.510
Brian Kern: Sometimes about, you know, like a whole like be dreaming that back.

152
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.170
Brian Kern: Watering Austria by handing it off, you know,

153
00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.180
Brian Kern: You don't really talk about they want

154
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.340
Brian Kern: To PTSD. The point where I'm like, like punching walls should

155
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.650
Brian Kern: I still like

156
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.470
Brian Kern: Think about it a lot, you know,

157
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.170
Brian Kern: It's like, you know, I'm like, I get reminded of it when

158
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.300
Brian Kern: Like all they

159
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.270
Brian Kern: Know, not even like I'll knock into things cuz I'm blind in my left guy, you know, I mean,

160
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.560
Brian Kern: We're like, you know, my right hand is messed up. So like

161
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.010
Brian Kern: Ali, maybe like drop something with my hand, you know, I mean I'll kind of like

162
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.310
Brian Kern: Freak out sometimes

163
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:27.690
You know,

164
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:35.820
Brian Kern: And like I have a lot of like I say, like, this is why I'm like so hyper vigilant when I gone public

165
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.280
Brian Kern: You know, it just affects the way I think about. So, you know,

166
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:56.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have a live experience you have daily reminders physiology physiology through your, your vision and motor skills as a result of this

167
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.020
Brian Kern: Yeah.

168
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:06.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you have those flashbacks and you have those reminders what my tab is your back over to present moment.

169
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.200
Brian Kern: Oh,

170
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.770
Brian Kern: I don't know. I mean, I'm just like, call now.

171
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.760
Brian Kern: You know,

172
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.910
Brian Kern: I guess it's more like I like really like I'm just

173
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:23.850
Brian Kern: It's gotten better over the years because like it was like a long time ago now. I was like six years ago.

174
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.940
Brian Kern: Is still

175
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.460
Brian Kern: I still get angry about

176
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:49.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in in the role in the victim role right there was certain terminology that was used. Like, why does this type of stuff happened to me.

177
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The victim role.

178
00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What contributes to the victim role is haha they align themselves with people that are rescuers for, you know,

179
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.510
Persecuted

180
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.370
Brian Kern: Yeah.

181
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:18.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What continues to manifest the victim role is when they hang out with other individuals that are in the victim role, but based on what you discussed with me.

182
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:34.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And just how you said that there's moments where you can share to the restroom role. Um, I would assume I correct me if I'm wrong. My assumption that you your community or your supports.

183
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're not also aligned in the victim role. Is that accurate.

184
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.230
Brian Kern: Yeah, when

185
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.050
Brian Kern: You think so yeah

186
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.560
Brian Kern: Oh really, I mean I know thing is only have any friends, you know, I mean,

187
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.070
Brian Kern: So, I mean, I'm like, you know, I don't have any friends here.

188
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.510
Brian Kern: Oh,

189
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.340
Brian Kern: Mean

190
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.810
Brian Kern: I wouldn't say my wife is like a victim role will

191
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Be

192
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.560
Brian Kern: Probably the persecutors

193
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.240
Brian Kern: Yeah yeah

194
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.420
Brian Kern: You. Yes, Maggie.

195
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.130
Brian Kern: For stuff. Yeah.

196
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.530
Brian Kern: Yeah, just say first

197
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.070
Brian Kern: Maybe like at some point maybe she's a rescuer yeah

198
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, they say, if it's a it's absolute loans or maybe

199
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.710
Brian Kern: The sort of

200
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: certain situations that puts us in a bit tomorrow.

201
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:57.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then other situations will will go to different roles, because of the situation, but

202
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:04.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's that starting gate, and this is who you naturally. Are you know onset. This is the person that you want.

203
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:09.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then if given us opportunity or meeting to

204
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:17.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your take on another role. And so from what you share with your wife, you know, you're starting gate is the victim role, but

205
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:32.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you know, almost heard of, kind of a little, like, Okay, well, we thought about him, he thought, we'll know when it comes to my wife, it's like you they like you physically like worked up the courage to say I am the rescuer I can be the rescue when it comes to

206
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:40.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you find yourself in conflict in your marriage in the roles between being a victim and being the rescuer

207
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.250
Brian Kern: No, I don't think so.

208
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.120
Brian Kern: You know,

209
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:57.270
Brian Kern: I mean, we don't. We never like fight about anything. We literally like, you know, like I tell people like you kind of have like the perfect marriage, almost like we don't ever like argue about a thing.

210
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.540
Brian Kern: You know, a unit. She is mad at me like,

211
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.010
Brian Kern: It's not like anything serious, you know, I mean,

212
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:11.370
Brian Kern: Like she might get mad at me because like I didn't clean the kitchen well enough, or something like that, you know, I mean,

213
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.810
Brian Kern: And I just

214
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.630
Brian Kern: I just clean, clean it, you know.

215
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

216
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:22.200
Brian Kern: I think I'm rolling. Now, like with every day. I'm not working out. Time to enroll the House has been hagen's just

217
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:28.290
Brian Kern: Trying to make sure that it's clean. Well, I mean, she doesn't really, you know, we don't ever argue about anything.

218
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.770
Brian Kern: I mean, because we really best friends before we got married, you know, I mean,

219
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:49.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I want to go back to how you said you have the flashbacks and you're able to get yourself out of it. You don't necessarily know how, but you're able to

220
00:22:51.030 --> 00:23:12.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. So one of the things I like to to have patients do is use the imagination and think of a distancing metaphor to that means these type of traumatic experiences or memories that late when they come to you. You literally like separate yourself from it. It's distancing

221
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:27.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So some imagery is that I've used is, you know, this a hot air balloon and it's about to take up and you literally see the hot air balloon on the vehicle, you know, driving and then you're able to see and

222
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:39.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's several different things and feel free to come up with your own example that that resonates best with you, but the distance the metaphor would be another tool that you can use.

223
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:50.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because often patients that have been endorsed so much trauma, they find a way to not think about it or to deal with it, but not necessarily cope with it.

224
00:23:51.420 --> 00:24:01.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To deal in a coping is so different, because dealing is I gotta live license going to keep going. It's along the lines of surviving and thriving.

225
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:15.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The coping gives you that state of thriving so that with the coping it's focused skills so that over time. You don't have to deal with the distress as

226
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.220
Brian Kern: Yeah.

227
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:25.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what distancing imagery which you want to use in regards to this experiment.

228
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.560
Brian Kern: I think probably the one you sent out of the car.

229
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

230
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:34.290
Brian Kern: We got an earlier. Yeah. Especially because I tried to

231
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.300
Brian Kern: You know, I've tried to put it by me a lot.

232
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.160
Brian Kern: You know hasn't necessarily

233
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.090
Parts.

234
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:44.430
Brian Kern: I tried to

235
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.970
Brian Kern: I tried. I've tried in the past it.

236
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, yeah.

237
00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.960
Brian Kern: I guess is still like like the worst part about it is like my twin brother overdose right after

238
00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.430
Brian Kern: You know, I mean,

239
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.960
Brian Kern: Like I can. I almost like deal with the violence of it you know i mean i

240
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.450
Brian Kern: Just, you know, just like

241
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.220
Brian Kern: This is like the worst part of that whole situation early

242
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:34.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So with that, with having all these different triggers the memories to live experiences with your hyper vigilance, the body.

243
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reminders

244
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The dispensing and be able to

245
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:49.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you recall the experiences to have that reminder that this present day.

246
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:59.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And, you know, coming up with imagery resources that when you have that thought. You can immediately replace it with something that's more comforting for you.

247
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:06.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that distancing metaphor is good because now you have that memory and then you just imagine yourself.

248
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:19.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In a vehicle, you know, you can create this vehicle, you know, could be the current vehicle, you're in. It could be your dream vehicle. I love a Cadillac Escalade escalate. I love those big trucks at the business like

249
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh yeah, I love it.

250
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:42.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I would envision myself in a Cadillac Escalades all black and just soaking up driving and the sun setting like I would create it. So when I say imagery like really go to that space. And because you've created it, you can access that thought every time that memory comes up. Yeah.

251
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There'd be a could be really be going

252
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.200
Brian Kern: Just

253
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.350
Brian Kern: Like where are we going

254
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.160
Brian Kern: I don't know. Probably just

255
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.670
Brian Kern: As far away from what happened as possible.

256
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.230
Brian Kern: You know, I mean,

257
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.270
You know,

258
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:12.600
Brian Kern: Like, I'm glad that I'm fine, you know, make it happen in Virginia. I mean, New Mexico. Now,

259
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.120
Brian Kern: It's trying to like start over.

260
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.820
Brian Kern: You know, so probably it would be driving likes

261
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.390
West

262
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.810
Brian Kern: What car would be

263
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:27.330
Brian Kern: I don't know about that. Never been a big like car person, you know,

264
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:33.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My it's just whenever I see a Cadillac Escalades like I think that was meant for my life.

265
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.220
Brian Kern: I'm surprised the chapel Cadillac.

266
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.220
Brian Kern: I like those cars a lot to actually

267
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

268
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:50.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So think about the color and you know you want it to be a truck small vehicle. Do you want somebody in the car with you or no one. It's just you driving by yourself.

269
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.140
Brian Kern: My wife was in the car.

270
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.300
Brian Kern: And probably

271
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.600
Brian Kern: Why does be she isn't Jeep dislike really sweet, you know,

272
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.310
Brian Kern: It shows a jeep.

273
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.920
Brian Kern: Cherokee maybe

274
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:10.080
Brian Kern: It is like a race is very sweet. Honestly, it's like it's green.

275
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.990
Brian Kern: And I like her a lot

276
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.000
Brian Kern: Now,

277
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know, be good too, because your wife represents so much peace and happiness for you.

278
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:30.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that really brings you back to the present moment because your wife is here now your interview and driving where you're headed west.

279
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the next time you have that reminder

280
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tap into that image.

281
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:42.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another

282
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another resource would be also

283
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:56.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think of something or someone real or imaginary that represents piece for you, safety and nurturing

284
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would that be

285
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.910
Brian Kern: To be my mom, honestly.

286
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.400
Brian Kern: Let me see. But, you know, she was like

287
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.420
Brian Kern: Yeah, very peaceful and just

288
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.470
Brian Kern: Yeah, she always had my back. No.

289
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:37.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's, that's a safe nurturing figure for you. Are there any makes mixed roles with that. Were there any experiences with her that will probably complicate that imagery

290
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:55.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, um, the reason why X is like parental figures, there's some size that represent nurturing and say if a parent has an addiction or there was abuse. So there was like a bad argument you had with

291
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That comes along, when you have that imagery

292
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.680
Brian Kern: Know there was anything like that.

293
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:13.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, good. Yeah. So another one. If this is seen as a working, you can also tap into. Okay, my resource figure, my mom.

294
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:28.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, imagine what it's like if you will be in humped by your mind, you know, and really get into that moment, you know, how did she needed she heard it tightly, you know. Can I smell her perfume.

295
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:40.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I don't know how long your hair, your mom's hair was but just really get into that imagery and allow yourself to feel the comfort of being a your mom's arms.

296
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:55.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is what I call your resource team that when these traumatic experiences happen. You have your business. The metaphor, which is the brain Jeep Cherokee

297
00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:14.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right and out of the West, you have your resource figure which is your mom who represents nurturing and safety and you're just helping your mom. Then there's also this container this container holds all of the lingering emotions.

298
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:26.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this container to hold the anger that you have towards the guy that did this, um, you know, when, if you replay how you how it was when when the jury.

299
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:40.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm sorry testifying any motions that you just want to get rid of will be in a container and only you have the key to this container what Taylor look like describe it.

300
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.180
Brian Kern: Like an urn or something.

301
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.590
Brian Kern: Some, like that.

302
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What kind of way to be a big weight be

303
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.560
Brian Kern: Blue sky like

304
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.370
Brian Kern: Probably a pretty big honestly just a lot of emotional side to it.

305
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:07.170
Yeah.

306
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So play a big blue earn

307
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you have the key to

308
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:28.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It. So every now and then, you may want to recall positive moments that you have with your brother. And then when you go down memory street that situation might come on

309
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.210
Brian Kern: Yeah.

310
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:40.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it comes up and then you allow Brian to feel the comfort that he had with his brother, but you put all of those other emotions in that below.

311
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you lock it up.

312
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:44.940
Brian Kern: Yeah.

313
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.000
Brian Kern: I'm gonna think about my brother a lot lately, actually.

314
00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you think it's bringing up these emotions.

315
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.490
Brian Kern: I don't know, honestly, you know, I was actually like listening because like

316
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:08.070
Brian Kern: He would show me a lot of like metal you know we listen to a lot of metal together. And like we got a metal concerts and like huge Sony bands a lot and like

317
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.170
Brian Kern: You showed me this one big

318
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:20.760
Brian Kern: lossless saints home today. Yeah, it was like last last man. He showed me last time I saw us like check this band out you know we listen to it.

319
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:32.940
Brian Kern: Yeah, I don't really know is just lovely love music I listen to remind me of something like that. You know what I mean. Yeah.

320
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:48.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's tragic that this had to happen to you and your brother. Well, when you have those emotions or yourself to film, you know, in that

321
00:33:49.590 --> 00:34:05.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Field them identify what the feelings are and, you know, are there any thoughts attached to these feelings, and behaviors. It's been encouraging my patients to look for the patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, because they're all the alignment working together.

322
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:14.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And for the most part, there's so much tragic memories that are repressed for a reason.

323
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No one wants to relive those experiences of feel bad pain.

324
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:38.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some people have dealt with it through addiction what your anger. And so these resources gives you that opportunity in a safe space to if the if the memories revisit I have a way to reset.

325
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And create a new imagery from ourselves.

326
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:58.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the more times that I activate my brain to reset from trauma to nurturing security, peace, tranquility and control because that's what that container represents

327
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:04.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That blue earn that she had the key to represents the power that you have

328
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In a situation where you are powerless, you were sleeping and this guy victimized you and your brother.

329
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:18.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now you have the power to put those spots away and you are the only one that has the key.

330
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.240
Brian Kern: To that all stable.

331
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.970
Brian Kern: Because when

332
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.060
Brian Kern: We know when, like I feel this kind of stuff. I'll just

333
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.080
Brian Kern: I usually like find myself sitting it you know i mean

334
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:34.560
Just

335
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:54.150
Brian Kern: Yeah, I still haven't like I haven't really been like, you know, dealt with, like, you know, I haven't really dealt with a lot, you know, like I watched my mom died. I never dealt with that. So I just started I was getting high.

336
00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:04.650
Brian Kern: And then with my brother is the same thing. I just, you know, found myself just getting high just trying to think about it. You know, I mean, but now that I'm not

337
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:11.850
Brian Kern: No, I'm not getting high anymore. You know, like I just, I start thinking about all stuff, you know, I mean,

338
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.660
Yeah.

339
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:19.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, it's a girl and I chatted brain played and so

340
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:36.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When, when those memories come up, but that activates activating these resource figures and safe ways to remember live your attic brain will take over and convince you that it's okay that it's justified that you need it.

341
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:49.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you deserve to live a better life. We don't have to deal with it. But the silver brain can be activated through the container that distancing and the nurturing resource.

342
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:50.970
Yeah.

343
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.310
Brian Kern: And

344
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.830
Brian Kern: I'd rather you know

345
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:02.370
Brian Kern: Now, you know, I tried to, like, you know, I'm really trying to stay clean so it's

346
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:09.780
Brian Kern: Yeah, I feel like it's important. It's important for me to deal with the same shit, you know, I mean,

347
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He didn't have any cravings.

348
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.540
Brian Kern: No Suboxone really helps with that.

349
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:23.970
Brian Kern: Like I don't, I don't really get cravings at all. Yeah, well,

350
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.000
Brian Kern: I mean, I did you know like when I relapsed a couple months ago.

351
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.910
Brian Kern: Yeah, it was kind of like

352
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:40.290
Brian Kern: I don't really like I was so anxious all the time that I didn't care that I was gonna pop up, you know, I mean,

353
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.780
Brian Kern: But now it's like

354
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.980
Brian Kern: I have so much to lose. Now, whereas

355
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:47.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Before

356
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.940
Brian Kern: You know, like a couple years ago and

357
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.290
Brian Kern: Everything I didn't have so much to lose said, you know, I mean,

358
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.790
Brian Kern: But now it's like, oh, you know, I'm married now and

359
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.810
Brian Kern: Yeah, I'm just trying to do the right thing, you know.

360
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.890
Yeah.

361
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:21.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It just drag my number one you said when you had the relapse. A few months ago. You did a really care. That was the added brain, you know, telling you where any thoughts like that's identified here that came across your mind and had that relax.

362
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.130
Brian Kern: Oh,

363
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.440
Brian Kern: Yeah definitely like nobody has to do

364
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.450
Brian Kern: You know, I mean,

365
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:39.180
Brian Kern: I have to, you know, like I felt also a sister. I just like I needed it. You know, I mean,

366
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.650
Brian Kern: Maybe like I'm having a bad day to

367
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:54.930
Brian Kern: Definitely not. I'm only gonna have one. Yeah.

368
00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.180
Brian Kern: Definitely not that

369
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.690
Brian Kern: I didn't think I can control it.

370
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:12.990
Brian Kern: You know, I mean like I literally like I just thought in my head. Like, I'm just going to use. So not so anxious anymore, but I'm not gonna like it all strolling out like that's what I was thinking in my head.

371
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:18.900
Brian Kern: Yeah, yeah, which is like don't because every time I use, I get strung out and

372
00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.630
Brian Kern: going HAM with it, you know.

373
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:23.970
Brian Kern: I can't not

374
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Addictive brains, not done this be addicted brain that just takes over.

375
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

376
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.690
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean,

377
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.970
Brian Kern: I just was justifying it my head. You know, I mean,

378
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:51.720
Brian Kern: Like I was like I couldn't get my, you know, the medication that healthy not be so anxious

379
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.880
Brian Kern: And I wasn't sleeping at all, you know,

380
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:03.690
Brian Kern: So I just yeah I might have to say I needed to not feel like complete shit all the

381
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:04.380
You know,

382
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:22.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The opportunity is, you know, the fact that you have. I can control it, like you said, that was your solo brain that now is saying, well, you know, you can control it, because you try it once, Brian. And then you just get strung out that's

383
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You want to be able to differentiate between the two.

384
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:28.650
Brian Kern: Yeah.

385
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:41.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm having a bad day. I might as well use instead of that I'm having a bad day. I deserve to make myself happy. What can I do what what happiness look like for me right now.

386
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:53.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm you know changing, changing the statement after that, comma, um, nobody has to know except that eventually people find out

387
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.540
You know,

388
00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ways always contradicting because

389
00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:13.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's like the the movies where they had the bad guy and the good guy on one in or the devil and the angel one. This is how the addictive brain and the social brain happens and if you don't have another voice to challenge that thought.

390
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:26.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or you don't put that out on trial. It'll just continue to work, continue to talk until that's the only voice you hear and before you know it you're like, wow, I just realized

391
00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:28.530
Brian Kern: Yeah.

392
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:48.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And unless shame and guilt produces itself and the vicious cycle starts all over again because the shame convinces you will and Tom fell off. I might as well just keep up or makes you feel like you're so low that it's hard to see hope or to see a way out of this.

393
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:49.350
But there is a

394
00:41:53.940 --> 00:42:05.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's research medication and several programs that proves that there is a way and you come into therapy to allow your sober boys, you're sober mind to have a voice.

395
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:22.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To get activated and now you taking all this information in, you know, kids, you're sober mind what opportunity to rise up because now has knowledge, you're, you're empowering the sober brain now.

396
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:38.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I like to use this model for addiction. Any other distressing thought that you may deal with. I mean, this is good for anger. If you're a controlling person.

397
00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:41.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Depression, you know,

398
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This can be adequate for anything.

399
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have any questions about this or anything that we've discussed

400
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.540
Brian Kern: No, not I can think of.

401
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:13.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I know you said that it helps to keep a set schedule that helps me too. So let's see. Today's Wednesday.
