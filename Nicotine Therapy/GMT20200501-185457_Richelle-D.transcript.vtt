Melonie Powers: Oh no, they actually

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.520
Melonie Powers: They put this pulled it out. I had to go to the oral surgeon, he

10
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.770
Melonie Powers: He sliced it and I had stitches. There I go back on the fist and

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.110
Melonie Powers: It feels a lot better now at it just that initial

12
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.760
Melonie Powers: Got it just hurt. I was out of it.

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.890
Melonie Powers: Now, getting ready to go on.

14
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:08.550
Melonie Powers: I picked up two little taste or jobs or I can go make a big, whopping grand total of $14 of

15
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.720
Melonie Powers: Merchandise two products will one particular story.

16
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.340
Melonie Powers: Every little bit helps my session.

17
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.250
Richelle Direny: Also also you're going to, you're going to your job right now.

18
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.010
Melonie Powers: No. And then when I'm done with you.

19
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.140
Richelle Direny: Okay.

20
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.750
Melonie Powers: Around you know i mean that I just need to be ready so that when I which I must I pretty much know

21
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.220
Melonie Powers: That when I get off with you that I can just go run to these two stores.

22
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.940
Richelle Direny: So the two stores in for 14 hours.

23
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.300
Melonie Powers: Yeah, it's like you go in, like, I'm going to be going to the two. There's two loads in Kingsport, so I'll drive to those stores.

24
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:09.180
Melonie Powers: Look for the specific items, the specific brand hates called harmony on this one. I can't remember. And I'll go in there and I work through an app on the phone.

25
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.310
Melonie Powers: And these jobs. Once you grab them you've got six hours to complete them. So if it were like a normal did you do

26
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:35.550
Melonie Powers: I probably would have grabbed like five of them to try to make you know like $45 or so, but because everything closes at seven I just decided to be safe and only grab two because that's all that's out there, it's close enough that I know I can get into.

27
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.930
Richelle Direny: Let me

28
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:55.800
Richelle Direny: Know that I've heard. And I don't know if it's the same for Tennessee, but it just seems like everywhere, um, you know, Amazon is hiring. And then I saw something. I don't know what the email or where I saw where they're even like people working from home. Have you thought about like that.

29
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.930
Richelle Direny: Where it's like

30
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.890
Richelle Direny: Study

31
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.380
Melonie Powers: I don't have

32
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:11.100
Melonie Powers: What I would need to work at home, although I could get it if I needed it. They don't have internet here. Um, we have our cable hooked up.

33
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:22.170
Melonie Powers: But we don't have the internet hooked up. They wanted service eight arms and three legs because we're at out and kind of, you know, in my area.

34
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:34.740
Melonie Powers: And know we decided, You know, I could do it though i mean i i can i can go grab a laptop and go out to tmobile that has like $50 a month because I

35
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.620
Melonie Powers: Yeah T Mobile because we have them anyway. And they do cover area.

36
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.400
Melonie Powers: But I don't want to go do that without the job.

37
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:59.430
Melonie Powers: And then when you go out online and want to apply for those jobs which I have to anyway because I'm claiming unemployment, like the pandemic unemployment, because I was working

38
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.660
Melonie Powers: All those reset jobs and everything. Those were four days a week you know about 100 $120 a day depending on

39
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:26.010
Melonie Powers: Location, you were at. And when the virus came through all not only those jobs off, but even for the last few weeks, like the two that I'm going to today, and a few others that I could have picked up.

40
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:35.190
Melonie Powers: Haven't been nothing out there because of everything happening. So I applied for this pandemic unemployment and

41
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.320
Melonie Powers: I've got. I got three letters on the 29th of monetary redetermination

42
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:57.720
Melonie Powers: One says not eligible next one says now eligible. The third one says, you could get this. They have amounts of money there. But then when it goes down into the sections to say what you earned in each quarter is all zeros.

43
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.540
Melonie Powers: Will that none of that's correct. And I have already sent two emails and downloaded.

44
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.500
Melonie Powers: All of my paycheck stubs.

45
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:21.780
Melonie Powers: You know my bank deposits. That's for the recent working for myself to show that I was working full time and then stops to the virus that even the quarters. Before that, where I work for the call center and

46
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:39.210
Melonie Powers: What other place I can plant partners were doing that stuff before I fell down the stairs and hurt my back. But I have money in those quarters and I sent those I send all that information in the 1099, you know, and my dates and all that stuff to them.

47
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.620
Melonie Powers: And I put it on the original application to

48
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:52.740
Melonie Powers: So I just don't understand what's going on with it and and I try to figure it out. I was trying to figure it out earlier, and then I was just like, well,

49
00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.500
Melonie Powers: I can sit here and do this right now. Or I could jump in the shower, get on with you go to a couple jobs, then come home.

50
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.780
Melonie Powers: And try and figure it out later. You know what I mean, at least make a couple bucks.

51
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.830
Mm hmm.

52
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:19.950
Richelle Direny: I mean, there's, there's the other option. I don't know, like so. Sometimes, you could use your phone as a hotspot. I mean granted. I don't know if you want to do that every day all day to use your

53
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:36.030
Melonie Powers: Mind is but like I said it wouldn't take anything for me to do that. And here's the thing, like I have to apply for three jobs, a week out on their program anyway and Tennessee's workforce.

54
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.370
Melonie Powers: Because I already

55
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:49.530
Melonie Powers: What in May last May, when I had lost my job. I went into the Workforce Center to have her help me with my resume, you know, updated, things like that, you know, just to

56
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:58.170
Melonie Powers: Have second eyes on it you know and have somebody review it and make sure it looks right type of typos. But you know what I mean.

57
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.030
Melonie Powers: Is the second is on it.

58
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.970
Melonie Powers: And so I'm already in their system.

59
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.970
Melonie Powers: And now, the good thing about kind of see is, even though they're technically not paying me what I have to do is like a

60
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.100
Melonie Powers: A wage.

61
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.180
Melonie Powers: Dispute or something. I don't remember what they call it. But anyway, when you're out on their site.

62
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.250
Melonie Powers: And you because I already went in and updated my resume.

63
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:42.510
Melonie Powers: To reflect what I've been doing for the last few months and then any job I apply for their system keep track of it. So, I still have to claim and that way when I do my wage dispute, because it is

64
00:07:43.590 --> 00:08:06.180
Melonie Powers: It's not for regular unemployment is for it even I don't understand all the rules. I don't think they do either. I wouldn't have had three letters in one day, but I'm so I'm still going to be applying for jobs. So, and there's jobs out there lots of cashier jobs, things like that.

65
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:20.790
Melonie Powers: You know, to get away from this little piecemeal crap that I've been doing either, you know, so I have to apply for. If I want to be paid. I guess I should say that page.

66
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.980
Richelle Direny: Curling iron

67
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.050
Melonie Powers: And I know turned it off.

68
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.160
Melonie Powers: I have little things for me. So I've been there but you know what that is.

69
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.740
Melonie Powers: I redid my bathroom right

70
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.260
Melonie Powers: Which is a disaster right now but

71
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:53.490
Melonie Powers: We painted all these shells and put this thing on the mirror new lights and handles and you know everything. And I found that little thing at your store and it was

72
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.680
Melonie Powers: For wine.

73
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:07.620
Richelle Direny: To drop the line in. Oh, you know, I've seen someone with that on their wall. It's really cute like it's this whole thing and you drop all the different models of wines in it.

74
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:24.810
Melonie Powers: Right, well my thing was I was out looking for somewhere to hold my hot, hot curly hair and stuff. And this was the only one that wasn't branded as wine. Now I got for like six bucks and to get them out on Amazon. They're like 2122 23 bucks.

75
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.080
Melonie Powers: I was like, that is going to work perfect because

76
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.030
Melonie Powers: You know, it's like that feel like

77
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:32.820
Melonie Powers: Whatnot so

78
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:40.920
Richelle Direny: And then I got nervous because I know like you're talking and because you're going to go out, you might forget that. Oh, crap. I didn't

79
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:50.400
Melonie Powers: Know, leaving my bathroom disaster which I don't generally can't stand it helps me but

80
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.020
Melonie Powers: Oh,

81
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.630
Melonie Powers: Are you going to do right

82
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.290
Richelle Direny: So how are you, how is everything going, um,

83
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.530
Richelle Direny: I know like it like in our last few groups like you were

84
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.090
Richelle Direny: Only thing on sharing. I know you don't necessarily always want to share in a bigger group setting.

85
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:12.750
Melonie Powers: Well, you know, my deal with the curse is in again. You know, I know that you think

86
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:21.900
Melonie Powers: I don't know, it's just like they're so far away from where where I am in some in a lot of ways, but it's like you know like

87
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:36.390
Melonie Powers: My relationship with my kids and stuff like that girl that was talking about her kids, things like that. Well, I get it. But you know my issues with from divorce you know my ex husband, he'll be

88
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.410
Melonie Powers: If you do that, it was for 50 for here.

89
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:50.310
Melonie Powers: You know, basically, my kids came with me and stuff, but she went back to Colorado, because that's where all of the school friends, family, everything she had

90
00:10:51.060 --> 00:11:06.360
Melonie Powers: I had been with her, you know, she's got a year with me in Florida, things like that. But she wanted to go back to her friends know her dad basically home over my head. The whole child support things you've already mean now he had her own Colorado.

91
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.800
Richelle Direny: So why don't

92
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.890
Richelle Direny: You try support when she's with him.

93
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.390
Melonie Powers: I would pay and I played it before I did it for my son.

94
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.560
Melonie Powers: But, you know,

95
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.110
Melonie Powers: When I pay child support for my son.

96
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:29.100
Melonie Powers: I never had a problem with that. I work that I work with them to make money and have a problem because I understand what it takes. Right.

97
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:42.450
Melonie Powers: But he knew that I was financially strapped down in Florida, and he knew that he could really screw me. So basically he got the pull the strings of whenever I see her talk to her.

98
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:51.870
Melonie Powers: I don't believe that any of my Christmas present that to her. I don't believe that a card, anything goes. I never got any call drinking and then like

99
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.720
Melonie Powers: You know, almost a year goes by and it's summer coming because he wants her to learn how to die.

100
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:06.840
Melonie Powers: And I worked for a dive company. You know, when I was arrested. You know I made myself a rescue diver and he knew I could get her diving certificate done for free.

101
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:20.160
Melonie Powers: With one of our instructors, which is not free. You know, I give them a little tip is how it works. You know, but they do it. Sorry chorus and, you know, so then he sent her out for like a week.

102
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:27.570
Melonie Powers: And she hates diving right she doesn't, she's not. Some people are not good underwater. She does.

103
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:38.250
Melonie Powers: It wasn't for her and something that's so dangerous. You don't push your child to do so she she got her

104
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.190
Melonie Powers: Her halfway through down, you know, which means she could go finish that with a later date or whatnot, if she wanted to

105
00:12:44.790 --> 00:13:01.920
Melonie Powers: She, she closed her dad earrings or a new ass because you know she is not strong enough. Although this kid is all states swimmer that a full scholarship to school, but it's different. And anyway, and then it was just like, and I didn't see her after that and

106
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:14.130
Melonie Powers: She's so brainwashed from him now. And I guess the point here is not. Yeah, I understand. Problems with, you know, my problem with my children.

107
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.680
Melonie Powers: Stems from other thing, it's not

108
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.480
Melonie Powers: You know,

109
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:36.960
Melonie Powers: It's not because I was out doing all these drugs God because I was out partying, like a rock star. It was because it was, I was so expensive to live down there is a brand new buyer mean I mean there's just no way I could do something that

110
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:48.810
Melonie Powers: The person that he is and having her and being able to hang out my thing over my head and destroyed that relationship. So, I mean, I get those kinds of things that

111
00:13:49.500 --> 00:14:07.950
Melonie Powers: I legitimately got hurt at Horace Mann, you know I legitimately was put on all those medications. I told them as your kid and you do get addicted to it, you can't not get addicted to that I'm the person you know that when I found the alternative

112
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.230
Melonie Powers: And and went, Wow, this. Give me my life back to change.

113
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:15.930
Melonie Powers: Because they

114
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:16.980
Richelle Direny: Are you

115
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.040
Richelle Direny: Pressing me you resonated with her because

116
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.530
Richelle Direny: Here is yes your addiction story.

117
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:34.410
Richelle Direny: But then, here's the backstory and no one cares thing here, or even understand the backstory to the addiction. So they just look at the addiction and now you lose everything because of the addiction and then

118
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.830
Richelle Direny: When you're nice to people right Walker.

119
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:56.340
Melonie Powers: Yep. You want to walk around a call me a drug addict. Well, listen, I can go into a bar, sit down and have a beer. I don't need three I need. I don't need I don't go I don't spend money on something drugs actually not that girl. I never had them as always I'm legitimate.

120
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:10.170
Melonie Powers: And that's what, that's where I do not identify. I mean, I do identify. I mean, I know it's hard coming out of that crap. I did it. I had to do it for myself, I had to go without it for a long time to make sure

121
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:18.690
Melonie Powers: That I truly have still in pain to let it get out of my system and all that kind of stuff for a while. You can't just go like a couple days.

122
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:25.590
Melonie Powers: You know, because they still have in your body hurts your, your feel horrible. You're awful, you know, for a while.

123
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:34.320
Melonie Powers: You know, I've been through all of that but not because somebody put me there. They're not because I got in trouble. Not because that you know what I mean.

124
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:46.440
Melonie Powers: I did it for myself and get it because I thought that there was a better way. And there was. And that's why I've been on the program or well over. I just got to be well over eight years now. I've lost track.

125
00:15:48.360 --> 00:16:06.330
Melonie Powers: And that's why you know like it. My thought it was hard coming to kind of see that my doctors and Florida always understood that. That's why they didn't have a problem like my health problem and you know my address because they knew my entire story. They knew every time.

126
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.580

264
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:51.630

288
00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:06.630
Melonie Powers: Things have calmed down because I'm not angry all the time. And that's just me because that's how I do ship, you know, very

289
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.470
Melonie Powers: And this stuff happened.

290
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.170
Melonie Powers: It's taken a lot of

291
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:14.850

Richelle Direny: So this is one of the things that we talked about, because I know we were talking about it in our last one on one session I'm

295
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.910
Richelle Direny: Speaking to what exactly you just said it's taking a lot of effort for you to bury it.

296
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:45.360
Richelle Direny: And we talked about, okay, well just taking those those little baby steps like what are some things that you're doing to try to

297
00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:59.310
Richelle Direny: Work through it. It's not just taking it and like it didn't happen and not wanting to process it and trying to suppress it because just like with anything. Um, if you have a soda bottle you shake it up.

298
00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:06.840
Richelle Direny: To release the pressure, you have to slowly slowly opening so it doesn't explode. So

299
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.400
Melonie Powers: Right.

300
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.850

355
00:38:55.410 --> 00:39:07.590

405
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.470
Melonie Powers: And then

406
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:44.520
Melonie Powers: Somewhere or whatever my make, you know, fill up the gas chamber, you know, get some groceries or, you know,

407
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.180
Melonie Powers: Me dog food. You know, things like that.

408
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.980
Melonie Powers: But I'm just not the same. And I need a real job.

409
00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.090
Melonie Powers: In it want to work part time because I have so much going on all the

410
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.410
Richelle Direny: You know anything

411
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:06.720
Richelle Direny: We talked about it before I'm are you want to work part time but it's like finding that

412
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:13.830
Richelle Direny: That consistent part time where you're not having to like you have like that one consistent part time job.

413
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:20.070
Richelle Direny: That you're doing and and it's I know especially now, it's going to be a little bit harder because they're slowly opening up

414
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:29.040
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, places of businesses and all this different stuff. But then you also have like these big giant stores like Jason J. Crew.

415
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:44.160
Richelle Direny: I think it's called J. Crew and just all these other so blooming, or is it Bloomingdale's and we're Nordstrom Nordstrom, I think, like they're fighting for. Great. What's it like so there are all these things that are happening because of the pandemic, but um

416
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.290
Melonie Powers: It's just a lot of growth. So

417
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:55.350
Melonie Powers: That's really what I'm looking for something small grocery store Dollar Store. We have our general here. I swear to God, one file.

418
00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:08.910
Melonie Powers: Or, you know, our food. My or whatever because we, I really only bring in $1,000 let us live really comfortably. Does that make sense.

419
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:10.530
Melonie Powers: Um,

420
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:12.060
Melonie Powers: And

421
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:31.140
Melonie Powers: And that even gives me my own way. And then, you know, because I getting my teeth I yeah I have dental insurance and I have great great insurance. The dental there's still stuff that I need done. It doesn't cover it, you know. So I have faith that I find a way

422
00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.650
Melonie Powers: So, you know,

423
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:52.530
Melonie Powers: Working to let us be okay you know it'll that extra thousand dollars a month allows us to buy the chemicals, the cool things like that, you know, it allows me to buy all the things I need my garden right going. It allows me to

424
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.300
Melonie Powers: You know, my little crab. You know, I've always got some new

425
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.730
Melonie Powers: Windows, whatever. You know how I young

426
00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.010
Melonie Powers: But

427
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.620
Melonie Powers: It allows you

428
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.640
Richelle Direny: So you're able to. So for the most part, you're a bit

429
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:26.100
Richelle Direny: You're able to stay afloat, you're able to do the things that needs to be done and take care of all that needs that you need. You just need some consistency with working everything else. You just consistent

430
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:38.850
Melonie Powers: Right and well. And the good thing is now even though, and because the job socking away. But now I understand planner. I understand restocking I understand how to build

431
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:49.410
Melonie Powers: You know, the things in the stores, you know, that are all the displays and things like that and how how to go in price have to the pricing on offer.

432
00:48:50.280 --> 00:49:04.140
Melonie Powers: But since I have all of those fields know I can apply to Z, you know, grocery stores and most likely to hire me. I believe now because I have those skills. I didn't have them before.

433
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:19.980

436
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:35.910
Melonie Powers: You know the pricing on putting in for this will go, you know, I get it, you know, that will help me get into a

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:44.190
Melonie Powers: Part time probably grocery store, you know, working in some departments. I don't want to be a capture certain crazy

438
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.230

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:57.240
Richelle Direny: Know, because you're doing because I mean you clearly can't put anything on your head, like you're doing it this way. I'll have, I'll have them. If you're interested, what I'll do is I'll have Serena.

537
00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:07.020
Richelle Direny: Give so she can explain it to you. I'll refer you for it. And if it's something that you're interested they could go over it more and see if that was something that you feel you could benefit from

538
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:08.910
Melonie Powers: Okay.

541
01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.630
Richelle Direny: All right, you have a great day.

542
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:24.990
Okay.

543
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:39.180
Richelle Direny: Well, I'm looking at you like this.

544
01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.590
Christina Meyers: My phone my screen didn't rotate. There we go.

545
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:45.300
Christina Meyers: VERY HAIRY

546
01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.720
Richelle Direny: How are you doing,

547
01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:53.160
Christina Meyers: I'm good. I am so sorry. Why I

548
01:00:55.050 --> 01:01:04.740
Christina Meyers: spaced out and missed our I wish I could tell you, I had an amazing excuse but I don't. I forgot. And I am so sorry. I feel terrible. I'm so sorry.

549
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.680
Richelle Direny: No, you are fine. You are fine. I wish I could tell you I have an amazing excuse

550
01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:20.580
Christina Meyers: Yeah, I wish I could have a crazy store, but I don't. I just, I got to thinking that like a quarter till five, I was like, wait a minute, is my appointment at five and yeah I space.

551
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.540
Richelle Direny: And you, it's fine. And so this is the thing because

552
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:32.160
Richelle Direny: You're the only one like you sent me a message because I think your point, it was that for right

553
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:45.930
Richelle Direny: Corrupt and so and this is the thing because I technically could have met with you because my five o'clock, did the exact same thing my five o'clock sends me a message at the very end and be like, was my family's my appointment. I'm like, it was

554
01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.940
Richelle Direny: So my father did the exact same thing.

555
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:54.900
No.

556
01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.930
Richelle Direny: It's fine. It's okay. You're good.

557
01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:01.920
Richelle Direny: So how is everything with you, you're still working.

558
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:14.760
Christina Meyers: Now in school right now I'm at home no work because I work for a school district. And obviously we're not in school. So right now there's 362 children.

559
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:20.580
Christina Meyers: So yeah, that's fine. It's for but it feels like a lot

560
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:27.330
Richelle Direny: Oh, what did you, what do you say 362 like almost every other days of the year like

561
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:38.820
Christina Meyers: Right. Right. Yeah, I got enough of those. But yeah, we're all cooped up and they just extended us another month for the stay at home stuff. So yeah, we're on

562
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:45.420
Christina Meyers: A Ohio. I'm in Ohio. So we just got extended another month to stay at home.

563
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.760
Richelle Direny: Oh, the whole state.

564
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:51.300
Richelle Direny: Yep. Oh, why are they were opening in

565
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.220
Christina Meyers: See this is the thing like they're starting to open up like

566
01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:14.820
Christina Meyers: construction work manufacturing, distribution and then I heard on like the 15th. Some retail stores are opening up and then like last night at midnight Dr Acton sent out this thing where they're extending the stay at home. Another month so it made no sense to me.

567
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.330
Richelle Direny: Wow, very interesting.

568
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:20.550
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, you're gonna have

569
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.850
Richelle Direny: Some more probably time at home and then when the school and for you guys for your kids.

570
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:41.340
Christina Meyers: So my cancer is last day. My oldest her last day is around the 20th. And then my other kids go to like technically Labor Day or Memorial Day, but they don't go on Memorial Day.

571
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:49.080
Christina Meyers: I have a senior, she doesn't go that last week and then my other one, we're

572
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.270
Richelle Direny: Gonna do it for

573
01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.060
Richelle Direny: For her with the

574
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.650
Graduation

575
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.520
Christina Meyers: Some are talking about using like a drive in movie theater.

576
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:20.910
Christina Meyers: And just having everyone sit in their cars and then one at a time. The student goes up and gets their diploma. I've heard others doing it virtually, some people are having a parade through the streets. Our school hasn't said anything yet so

577
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.010
Christina Meyers: I don't know.

578
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:33.540
Richelle Direny: I don't know. I mean, it might be a great I mean like here, I'm in Florida. I seeing

579
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.400
Richelle Direny: Like a you see people like posting signs up on the doors and, you know,

580
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:47.190
Richelle Direny: So I guess that's like the most pivotal time of your whole high school just your whole school career.

581
01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:51.780
Richelle Direny: Is able to walk across like to know that you've accomplished.

582
01:04:52.020 --> 01:05:02.460
Richelle Direny: At least this like that's what I've been looking for all year. So like I get it. Um, I really truly get it like it's not like leaving elementary or middle but like you're legally

583
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:08.370
Richelle Direny: Because you don't, you may not necessarily go to college. And then, you know, everybody doesn't go to college right away. So like miss that.

584
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:19.530
Richelle Direny: Um, I don't know how it's there in Florida and Ohio, but like here. You like there's all these different field trips and all these different things that they go to

585
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:37.920
Richelle Direny: Right before graduation. And so they lost out on all of them. So it really does suck. It really does. So it would be nice if they find a way to come up with, allowing them somewhere, even if you practice all of your social to help put on a whole situation.

586
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:46.950
Richelle Direny: And then, you know, allow them just that opportunity. But just to not do it.

587
01:05:49.110 --> 01:05:51.000
Richelle Direny: Just really sucks. It really does.

588
01:05:52.170 --> 01:06:13.830
Christina Meyers: Too much. Yeah, I know. And I want her to have that moment that's what she's been Oh good lord, looking for no sorry I clicked on my email accidentally. Yeah, just for her to have that moment of recognition. I mean, she is going to college, but I don't want her to wait for years for a graduation.

589
01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:15.270
Richelle Direny: It's not

590
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:23.340
Richelle Direny: Not, not all kids decided to go to college right away. But even if you decide to and your that focus then you stay for the whole four years.

591
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:35.730
Richelle Direny: It's not the same as when you're because, like, if you think about like those friends that you made, and you still have them, and those are the ones from high school. It's very different from the ones that you meet in college.

592
01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:46.110
Richelle Direny: Yeah, we like you my day one, like we know each other from high school, you knew me when I ordered a pimple and you know this little boy like

593
01:06:47.910 --> 01:07:02.190
Richelle Direny: And I had all of this, you knew what I was going through my hormonal changes. So like different bond and to, you know, so it's, it is. I definitely get it. I definitely get into that stage with your friends like we've made it

594
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:07.650
Richelle Direny: Up and you're telling those teachers that like on your last nerve like

595
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.360
Christina Meyers: Done with the

596
01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:11.700
Christina Meyers: Out.

597
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.110
Richelle Direny: Very different. It's very different.

598
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.480
Richelle Direny: Hopefully, um,

599
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:22.740
Richelle Direny: You know, they find something to do with those poor little kids so they

600
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.230
Christina Meyers: Were waiting

601
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.350
Richelle Direny: So there was no problem for her either

602
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:37.590
Christina Meyers: Know in I'm thinking about maybe doing something here at the house for her because I have an eighth grader, who's also transitioning

603
01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:50.100
Christina Meyers: To high school and she missed her farewell dance, but it's like you said, it's two very different. She'll have high school. You know my other ones. Done. But when you buy the dress and everything and didn't get to where

604
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:52.680
Richelle Direny: Somebody can see

605
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:54.510
Christina Meyers: Right.

606
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:55.950
Are you aware

607
01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.490
Richelle Direny: Of this bad boy you go somewhere.

608
01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.740
Christina Meyers: I said,

609
01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.230
Christina Meyers: No. But yeah, no problem.

610
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.120
Christina Meyers: So rough one,

611
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:08.490
Richelle Direny: Thought about something maybe really creative.

612
01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:21.690
Richelle Direny: Maybe turning in like your living room and maybe just having like one or two kids like just come over, like turn the whole thing. Turn on music and let her dance and just make it as creative as possible for both of them actually

613
01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:32.550
Christina Meyers: Yeah, we're thinking about doing it so supposed to be 70 here tomorrow to be perfect for us. We get some pictures. And I know a couple families that are taking the quarantine very seriously, like we are.

614
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.680
Christina Meyers: Where I could trust them. And there's minimal risk for exposure, you know, but we're thinking about, just to give them something something normal

615
01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.150
Christina Meyers: Yeah yeah

616
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:57.090
Richelle Direny: That was and I think hopefully. Hopefully that later on in life. They won't not just get they're going to remember that. Yeah, when we graduated, I didn't have it. But then my family found a way to make it

617
01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.530
Christina Meyers: You know, memorize

618
01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:59.700
Richelle Direny: And hopefully by

619
01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:10.020
Richelle Direny: Now, so I definitely get it. We have to be saved, but at the same time, you still want to give them the simple joys of life that

620
01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:17.430
Richelle Direny: You have. So, um, I remember looking back at my high school prom pictures. I was a strange thing. Yes, I was.

621
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.860
Christina Meyers: We all were

622
01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:20.790
Christina Meyers: We all were

623
01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:27.990
Richelle Direny: The days of one back to be

624
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:29.310
Richelle Direny: Looking like that. I don't know.

625
01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.030
Christina Meyers: I don't think I'll ever get back to that ever

626
01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:38.490
Richelle Direny: So, um, let me pull this up for a second.

627
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:44.940
Richelle Direny: So today we're doing

628
01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:11.760
Richelle Direny: So what Mayra says you're on. Because when I saw you probably my screen. I said mindfreak. I mean, we go with different names.

629
01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:19.800
Christina Meyers: I don't know why it does that, like, I don't. That's a maiden name I can't, I don't know why does that

630
01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:23.610
Richelle Direny: Maybe your phone is your phone bill in that name.

631
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:25.140
No.

632
01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:33.750
Richelle Direny: I mean, that's good. I was just like, I know it's a different Christina. I'm saying

633
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:42.090
Christina Meyers: That's so weird, but other doctor. The doctor had that issue, too. And I said, No, no, don't be corny know prescriptions.

634
01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.110
Richelle Direny: For buyers.

635
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.520
Christina Meyers: I'll never get

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:46.860
Christina Meyers: Oh,

637
01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:55.740
Richelle Direny: Alright guys in group I had someone that popped up on the screen. It was a male, but it was a female's name that was underneath that. And I said, Okay, I'm step out on a limb here.

638
01:10:56.190 --> 01:11:07.050
Richelle Direny: I'm not trying to be disrespectful or nothing but I just need clarity. I'm seeing a guy, and it's a feels me. You know, it's okay, my girlfriend's okay

639
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:09.990
Christina Meyers: Well, it's funny.

640
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:12.990
Christina Meyers: Because my husband's name is Carly

641
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.090

Christina Meyers: We did.

645
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:35.280
Richelle Direny: And I'm like, you know, I'm not really trying to be disrespectful. And please, please, respectful. But you know what I see in the name don't really match.

646
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:45.510
Richelle Direny: Like, and then and then like I have a couple that's in a group. So, you know, like you see how when you did something with your phone.

Richelle Direny: You know, I know that picture.

649

Richelle Direny: So you just had you had a rough time because of the immediate transition

671
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:43.590
Christina Meyers: Well, right. I it's not just that, like, yes, I was kind of like, you know, I, when I first met Jill.

672
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:48.960
Christina Meyers: Me and her talked about things because I was unsure about bright heart being a good fit for me.

673
01:13:49.350 --> 01:14:04.290
Christina Meyers: You know, and her and her her and I saw eye to eye on one of the things that I wanted in a program and that I wanted in a doctor. So I don't know if Dr sell shares those same values that I have

674
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.570
Christina Meyers: And like she's already

675
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:08.250
He was facial sorry

676
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.140
Christina Meyers: I didn't not

677
01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:19.710
Christina Meyers: Not in group with everybody, but like she already switched things up so much that was like really discouraging. I'm like, like for example, I'm

678
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:33.390
Christina Meyers: I'm used to getting my prescription once a month in a time like this. I really value that because it's less risk I have going out, etc. She changed it to once a week now.

679
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.550
Richelle Direny: She did not her.

680
01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.950
Christina Meyers: It's not her. It's okay.

681
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.180
Richelle Direny: Her so

682
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.130
Richelle Direny: She could continue, continue and I'm going to tell you if it's it's not has nothing to do with her.

683
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:51.090
Christina Meyers: So in treatment programs. To me, that's a penalty. That's a default

684
01:14:51.630 --> 01:15:04.110
Christina Meyers: Usually when you started treatment program your once a week then twice a week, then your monthly because they trust you, you're working your program you're showing progress to go back to once a week was kind of like, you know, like a setback.

685
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.010
Mm hmm.

686
01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.790
Richelle Direny: So this so

687
01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:19.200
Richelle Direny: I don't know what you know what information was provided, especially from providers and the medical provider or what have you.

688
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:26.730
Richelle Direny: Because I have another practitioner that I worked with that was kind of doing it that way. So the program rules.

689
01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:36.510
Richelle Direny: Are exactly what the second part of what you just explained. When you first start. And so that, and especially now they're cracking down on it as well.

690
01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:44.910
Richelle Direny: Is that the program are you come to the you come to group every single week you'll get your prescription every single week.

691
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:53.220
Richelle Direny: And with consistency with the group and within the visual and I look at individual from the standpoint if you're meeting with me.

692
01:15:53.940 --> 01:16:00.060
Richelle Direny: And if you're already seeing someone on the outside. First of all, your insurance is not going to pay for the same type of therapy.

693
01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.940
Richelle Direny: That's just like that and they're not going to do that.

694
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:14.310
Richelle Direny: But if you're already seeing someone actively in the community who continue to do that, we'll just check in. So we'll do the bio like we did then we'll do the second which will do our like our treatment planning and what have you.

695
01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:22.260
Richelle Direny: And then, you know, if it is that you're, you're really in a good place. And we'll say okay well let's just check in once a month, because that's just in the visual

696
01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:35.430
Richelle Direny: Um, once we're seeing that consistency your commitment to the program. Then it goes down to. Okay. We'll fill it every other week and then you kind of gradually move to once a month.

697
01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:54.570
Richelle Direny: Okay, so what what Dr cell is saying to you is exactly how the program is structured. And so what. So what they're cracking down on their kind of tightening up on is what some way. And so it's kind of like that saying where

698
01:16:55.650 --> 01:17:07.740
Richelle Direny: The good Apple always, I mean the bad apple spoils it for the bunch. It's because like you will get your medication once a month when I need to show up because I don't got my meds for the month.

699
01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:16.290
Richelle Direny: And that's what was happening. So now to kind of maintain that accountability is that we ask that you show up.

700
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:26.490
Richelle Direny: Not just for your medication one someone but you're showing up for group. So like, even with group will also change it to say, hey, you don't have to come to group because of the consistency.

701
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:40.710
Richelle Direny: You've come to group once a month. Also, there's a whole lot of other things that goes into that. I mean, let's be real, I know you want to maintain your journey. And I know you want to do all of this, but the same time I got no money to pay for it. Like, I mean, I can understand. So then

702
01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:41.280
Christina Meyers: Right back

703
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:49.110
Richelle Direny: Like a conversation, you have to have from a financial and to say, hey. Well, listen, I really want to come in a group and I really want to be a partner and show my commitment.

704
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:54.660
Richelle Direny: But at the same time, I can't afford to come once a week because I have to pay extra out of pocket.

705
01:17:55.140 --> 01:18:02.910
Richelle Direny: So, but that's a conversation. So then, but again the commitment and everything else. It's kind of based on that assessment we make those determination.

706
01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:15.030
Richelle Direny: So that's where all of that is coming in. Well, we really encouraged the attendance in group. If not, I'm in the beginning, weekly, and you get your men, now

707
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:20.130
Richelle Direny: With the no shows, so like when you arm.

708
01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:27.330
Richelle Direny: Technically, when you, when we didn't meet on Monday that would have been considered a no show

709
01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:37.350
Richelle Direny: So you reached out to me. So I took it off of the no show list and I put it in as a reschedule because now we're we have that conversation.

710
01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:47.430
Richelle Direny: So I'm not going to Daniel for, like, Okay, well, you know, you just out you just asking like, you know, like I've had people who do that. They're like, Hey, Michelle, can I do this and I'm be here tonight.

711
01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:57.630
Richelle Direny: And then you Mia. So, you know, I will adjust it in the system because now I don't want it to go against you because we did have that conversation.

712
01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:08.490
Richelle Direny: That we know let's reschedule what and that's why I always. I mean, you don't attend my groups, you go to Serena's groups, but typically like I would always give out all

713
01:19:08.970 --> 01:19:17.520
Richelle Direny: My patients I send the messages. And I always say, Hey, I have an open line of communication. If you're not going to be able to make it, life happens, it's always happening.

714
01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:23.100
Richelle Direny: Just shoot me a text and be like, Listen, I won't be able to make it today. Um, can we reschedule for another day.

715
01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:35.040
Richelle Direny: And I think that's just kind of really were. So it's again it's kind of like that one bad apple that's folded for the rest. So then you feel like out of the outage or somebody and then like I would have to do it on like a one to one be like

716
01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:41.220
Richelle Direny: An issue too horrible everything so it has nothing she didn't change anything.

717
01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.110
Richelle Direny: Because

718
01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:59.430
Richelle Direny: I had a group where I had to tell everybody know it's not like that. You're not supposed to be getting your medication once a month it's supposed to be. And then eventually you'll move to the, um, you eventually. Listen, I know you're studying to be a counselor. Right.

719
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:02.130
Richelle Direny: Yeah, yeah, when you cross to the upside.

720
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.080
Christina Meyers: That's right. I'm not on that side yet.

721
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:20.490
Richelle Direny: When you decide, and you start wearing you you'll realize that sometimes you just have to find different ways to just communicate. But, but, yes, it has nothing to do with her.

722
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:27.570
Richelle Direny: Or it's just kind of how they have structured the program and they just really truly want that consistency.

723
01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:41.430
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, I know, for some people meeting in this way in terms of therapy. It's better for them because some people have been some people on the outside and they switched to doing it this way because it's everything is in one place for them.

724
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:46.590
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, um, but, I mean, when you speak to

725
01:20:48.120 --> 01:21:03.270
Richelle Direny: Dr. Sell. I don't know. She does individuals. But if she does. You could just, you know, to her to see um you know if she does, um, you know, align with what you're looking for in a program

726
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:04.350
What you're right.

727
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:17.040
Christina Meyers: Yeah, I would love to have that conversation with her and and i will most definitely bring it up. Next time we spoke that was her first group with us. She had a lot of questions to ask everybody

728
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:27.390
Christina Meyers: You know, so I wasn't going to hold up her groups time with that but I definitely will bring it up with her, just to make sure we're on the same page because not every doctor Greece, you know,

729
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.070
Christina Meyers: Which which is

730
01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:34.710
Christina Meyers: Why I switched doctors and came here to begin with. So, I mean, I sort of make sure we are on the same page.

731
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:40.620
Richelle Direny: On the same page. Yeah, I mean I think with everything that's going to be a little bit of bumps in the road and you just kind of have to take your

732
01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:45.930
Richelle Direny: Your, you know, just kind of assess like is it really truly for me, or is it not like you know the program.

733
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:53.970
Richelle Direny: Um, I know. Like some people have some issues like even with the check in process. So it just, it's just, you know,

734
01:21:54.870 --> 01:22:12.180
Richelle Direny: Voicing like, hey, this is the issue I have. And then, you know, it's for it to be explained, of how things should be. But you're right, Miss Jill was new. And so I don't know. You know how the information was conveyed to her in terms of how but we just got a few emails. I'm just reading

735
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:26.070
Richelle Direny: Reinforcing especially for the providers, the nurse practice the PA is and all of them, how to give the medications, because they really want to be able to monitor

736
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:42.210
Richelle Direny: Everyone that they are you know really truly following the program because it's this is different from when you're in an inpatient facility where they really, you know, kind of hold everything down. So, um, hold on, let me pull up

737
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:43.560
Richelle Direny: Here.

738
01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:53.760
Christina Meyers: I made it makes sense when you say it like that. You know what I mean, as long as we can get to a place where I can get back on track to where was

739
01:22:54.180 --> 01:23:06.000
Christina Meyers: You know it's it's a bit of a change when you go from like five, six years to going once a month, then it's every weekend, especially during Kobe that, you know, for me, I want to go out any more than what I have to

740
01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:07.950
Richelle Direny: Well, it doesn't

741
01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.380
Richelle Direny: They don't deliver it. You have to physically go

742
01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:16.590
Christina Meyers: There. Correct. I don't have a pharmacy within a 30 mile radius of me. I'm not Boondocks.

743
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.930
Christina Meyers: Oh, wow. Yeah.

744
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:24.450
Richelle Direny: And you have like the people exposed where you are. Is it a lot.

745
01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:37.170
Christina Meyers: I'm not in my county. I think we're under 100 right now in my county, but in other counties where my pharmacy. Is there a larger cases.

746
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.440
Richelle Direny: Okay.

747
01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:52.560
Richelle Direny: Just, just have that conversation because I don't know how they do it for people who

748
01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.320
Richelle Direny: Have been in the program.

749
01:23:56.910 --> 01:24:00.960
Christina Meyers: That's why I assumed Dr beavers did it. I just assumed because she knew my history.

750
01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:03.120
Christina Meyers: And that's why she

751
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:04.320
Christina Meyers: You know when I meet

752
01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:10.950
Christina Meyers: Someone yeah from from day one, like I've never been on a weekly

753
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:17.160
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I know that. Yeah.

754
01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:23.820
Richelle Direny: Because I'm another like what I grew up practice practitioner that I worked with

755
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:25.950
Richelle Direny: What fell asleep.

756
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:32.880
Richelle Direny: You look when your foot falls asleep.

757
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:35.790
Christina Meyers: Hearts.

758
01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:39.600
Richelle Direny: Your whole team tingling things in the bottom of my foot.

759
01:24:51.330 --> 01:24:52.170
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

760
01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:13.470
Richelle Direny: Okay. So this week we're really just covering actor because we met. We got like a lot of the background information or what have you. Now, you said that, um, you know, you've kind of been on this journey of sobriety and kind of holding it down, like you said for the last five, six years. Yeah.

761
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.870
Richelle Direny: Okay, so when you look at, like, what

762
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:28.200
Richelle Direny: You so coming to be a part of bright heart and maintaining, you know, being on the on Suboxone treatment.

763
01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:50.190
Richelle Direny: What is it that you'll feel like you want to continue to work on as you continue on this journey to sobriety like is what are your goals is that maybe in a few years later on to eventually taper off. Is it that you want to maintain it. Like what are you, what are your goals.

764
01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:55.560
Christina Meyers: Right now it's maintaining

765
01:25:56.850 --> 01:26:07.470
Christina Meyers: I think right now. I have more short term than long term, you know, right now I just want to get through the stresses of coven get past that and then

766
01:26:08.850 --> 01:26:19.980
Christina Meyers: Get that normalcy instability back and you know in a few years, consider tapering. Absolutely. It's, it's always a consideration of mine.

767
01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:28.860
Christina Meyers: You know there are times where I feel like it's a possibility. And then there's times where I'm like, I'm just going to be on this forever type deal

768
01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:38.700
Richelle Direny: So what are the what's, what's the variation between the two, like you said that there are times where there's a possibility and it's like you're going to be on it forever. What determines the two

769
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:50.910
Christina Meyers: So, for example, right now the the the chaos, you know, I'm used to a little bit of stress. We all have it. It's our daily life, whatever, but

770
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:57.840
Christina Meyers: I think it's the severity of the situation like right now with everyone content. There's no

771
01:26:58.590 --> 01:27:06.930
Christina Meyers: Personal space for me. There's no way for me to decompress and be like, Okay, I have to get my head together, you know, because we're all cooped up right now.

772
01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:16.980
Christina Meyers: So at times like right now. I feel like I probably would have totally had a relapse and, you know, went back to where I was before.

773
01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:21.870
Christina Meyers: And then there's times where, you know, like before with the other doctors

774
01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:36.450
Christina Meyers: I had gotten you know to where I was experimenting only taking, you know, one and a half a day instead of two and seeing how I felt and stuff like that because I'm in a good place where there's just my just my normal stresses. There's no more added to it.

775
01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:38.610
Richelle Direny: Now,

776
01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:40.440
Richelle Direny: So,

777
01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:52.680
Richelle Direny: In looking at and for me and understanding it. So to kind of gauge it into kind of guided because the reality of what determines also whether you

778
01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:58.770
Richelle Direny: Have it as a goal to taper off depends on

779
01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:10.650
Richelle Direny: The, the foundation of why you're on it in the first place. Um, so like for some, a lot of it is like a part of their pain management routine.

780
01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:22.140
Richelle Direny: And maybe for them. It's like, What do you mean you're going to pay for your kid taper off because it's a part of a pain management because of a medical issue as part of why you can only learn how to

781
01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:38.970
Richelle Direny: Not become addicted and reliant, but it's not. You can't really come off of it. That's not really what you can do. Um, so for you. I know you said that what started was after you had the reduction. Right.

782
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:49.590
Richelle Direny: Yes, yeah. So now, and then from that. Then there was the the dependency and then the introduction to other things.

783
01:28:49.860 --> 01:29:07.530
Richelle Direny: But a lot of it was because of becoming dependent and you found that, hey, this doesn't just work for pain and helps me when I'm stressed. It helps me with all these other things. So you found other uses for which all meds, it helps with so many other things than the one identified reason

784
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:31.920
Richelle Direny: What are some effective ways of just coping with stress that you've learned along the way. Because one of the stressors that I hear you talk about is your inability to feel somewhat claustrophobic now that you're like home with your children all the time. It's just like I need to read

785
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.210
Christina Meyers: That's accurate. Yeah, I'm

786
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:43.800
Christina Meyers: Before I used to be able to go get my nails done, and take that meantime

787
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:48.840
Christina Meyers: And I think that's where I'm lacking.

788
01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:51.960
Christina Meyers: I feel guilty if I do it now.

789
01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:55.170
Christina Meyers: But

790
01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:07.110
Christina Meyers: You know, it's not fair for me to go out without taking someone with me because there's too. So I felt guilty.

791
01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:10.350
Christina Meyers: Tending to myself right now.

792
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:15.270
Christina Meyers: Because I was suffering, just as much as I am, if not more.

793
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.510
Richelle Direny: Now,

794
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:26.670
Richelle Direny: Okay, so let's just say, partly for phobia, because the reality of it is

795
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.580
Richelle Direny: Everybody needs their meantime

796
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:31.320
Christina Meyers: Everybody you are here.

797
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:39.330
Richelle Direny: You might be me that he needs a daughter needs everybody needs it individually. Everyone needs it. And so it's

798
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:59.370
Richelle Direny: Coming to that place as to how there is seven days in a week. Everybody has to have a day without having any guilt attached with everyone has to have a date. How can I decompress, how can I have some me time without feeling guilty.

799
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:15.480
Richelle Direny: And I think maybe being aware that as a mom. We're always going to feel guilty if we're doing something and having fun with our children, especially if you're one of those involved. Once your it is you're always going to feel guilty.

800
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:20.010
Richelle Direny: It's like this morning. I got up and I decided, you know, we put on some airing

801
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.980
Richelle Direny: And I woke up my kids for school.

802
01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:24.240
Richelle Direny: Mommy, where you're going.

803
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:30.990
Christina Meyers: Right.

804
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:34.860
Richelle Direny: I'm going away, you got on lipstick. Don't worry about it.

805
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:43.710
Richelle Direny: I'll be all you're doing is going outside. Well, money can I know. Can I just have five minutes to look at the tree.

806
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:45.360
Christina Meyers: Right.

807
01:31:46.050 --> 01:32:01.470
Richelle Direny: I want to do, but it's been OK and coming to that place that for your own self care is that you need some time and being okay with understanding that as a mom as a wife that you do, it's, it's

808
01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:03.360
Richelle Direny: It's detrimental.

809
01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:09.900
Christina Meyers: In our yard okay with it. Yeah, I'm not okay with it because it makes me feel bad.

810
01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:23.850
Richelle Direny: But it's but it's it's retraining your the way you think to say it. I have to be okay with having some time to myself.

811
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:34.710
Richelle Direny: And not having to think about what is that going to eat. What does children eat, what are they going to wear, what is this what is that what is this what is that because this is a question, Christina, who stops it does that for you.

812
01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:36.420
Nobody

813
01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.850
Christina Meyers: That's true. Nobody

814
01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:45.210
Christina Meyers: I still I I felt obligated to get

815
01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:47.310
Christina Meyers: That was such a

816
01:32:48.690 --> 01:32:52.590
Christina Meyers: Big part of the addiction to is being the supermom

817
01:32:53.790 --> 01:33:09.720
Christina Meyers: Well, and just doing everything and you know that that was my thing. So I feel like I have to maintain that title maintain that duty. And if I don't, it's, it's this, it's a hot mess like I have to, I don't feel like there's another option.

818
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:18.630
Richelle Direny: About what you just said. Part of what maintain your addiction or fed your addiction. Remember, what did you say

819
01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:22.290
Christina Meyers: That

820
01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:33.030
Richelle Direny: serve everybody. Yeah, but in you feeling the need is overwhelming guilt to serve everybody. What were you doing to yourself.

821
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:36.390
Christina Meyers: Not taking care of myself, that's for sure.

822
01:33:38.610 --> 01:33:58.170
Richelle Direny: So the more you told yourself. It's not okay for me to feel like taking care of my and just being by myself for an hour or two, you somehow told yourself. It's not okay. It's, it's no I need to feel guilty. So then you continue your addiction.

823
01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:01.890
Richelle Direny: You continue tearing yourself down.

824
01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:16.080
Richelle Direny: How you know that there was something wrong, because we're keeping it a secret from everyone else, you were hiding refining some way to feed because you need to maintain this big S on your chest.

825
01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:18.900
Christina Meyers: Sure, sure.

826
01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:34.860
Richelle Direny: So now, how now, how can we, together, start turning that around. Where are you remove this is off your chest, you're still mom. Nobody's ever going to take that away from you. Nobody ever can take that away from you, but

827
01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:39.390
Richelle Direny: Have you ever flown on a plane.

828
01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:40.830
Yes.

829
01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:47.670
Richelle Direny: When you're on the plane right before the plane takes off. What does the stewardess talk about

830
01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:53.490
Christina Meyers: The safety stuff. And if the plane crashes and

831
01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:57.600
Richelle Direny: Forget about the pain here. What, what specifically about the safety. What did they tell you to do if

832
01:34:57.810 --> 01:35:00.720
Richelle Direny: You're traveling with a child a disabled person or child.

833
01:35:01.050 --> 01:35:02.100
What are you supposed to

834
01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:05.490
Christina Meyers: Put your mask on and then

835
01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.940
Richelle Direny: Help others. Why do they tell you to do it first.

836
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:13.590
Christina Meyers: Well, because if I'm dead, I can't help anybody else.

837
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:15.480
Richelle Direny: If you ain't taking care of yourself.

838
01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.370
Richelle Direny: Your family.

839
01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:19.410
Richelle Direny: Your

840
01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:29.010
Richelle Direny: If Christina is not practicing her own. So here, how can you maintain this title of Superman.

841
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:33.480
Christina Meyers: Not very well.

842
01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:34.890
Richelle Direny: Not at all.

843
01:35:35.610 --> 01:35:36.120
Christina Meyers: You know,

844
01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:42.480
Richelle Direny: Just think about that. Just think about that energy from the plane when they go through it.

845
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:44.910
Richelle Direny: But then somehow

846
01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:58.260
Richelle Direny: This idea of maybe how you grew up or whatever your earlier experiences in life as a child and waited what it should look like.

847
01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:05.760
Richelle Direny: To be always be there for your children and never stopping to take care of yourself you're drowning.

848
01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:08.520
Richelle Direny: We're dying.

849
01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:21.750
Richelle Direny: And everybody else's. Okay. And because everybody else's. Okay, nobody is really stopping to say, hey, Mom. Throw your ass. Hey, how about I help you do this.

850
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:25.440
Richelle Direny: And so

851
01:36:26.850 --> 01:36:27.750
Richelle Direny: Somehow

852
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:38.700
Richelle Direny: you convince yourself that it's okay to consume substances to make you keep on this high, to be able to take care of everybody else.

853
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:42.660
Richelle Direny: Never stopping to take your and making

854
01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:51.900
Richelle Direny: A little bit of that said, I want you to take me down the road.

855
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:56.130
Richelle Direny: To see if we can find awareness in all of that.

856
01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:01.020
Richelle Direny: You grew up with mom and dad that mom just mom.

857
01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:05.370
Christina Meyers: Mom, my parents got divorced when I was nine.

858
01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:07.290
Christina Meyers: And

859
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:09.750
Richelle Direny: In how many, how many siblings do you have

860
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:11.430
Christina Meyers: One.

861
01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:15.450
Richelle Direny: Okay. And how was that like, how was

862
01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.230
How did you do

863
01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:24.840
Christina Meyers: Um, I, my mom was never home she was

864
01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:34.230
Christina Meyers: He there working around the bars or finding a new boyfriend or I was always love to take care of my brother.

865
01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:35.850
Richelle Direny: Because you're the only one.

866
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:37.170
Correct.

867
01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.120
Richelle Direny: And

868
01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:42.420
Richelle Direny: You were nine years old, taking care of how old are

869
01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.480
Christina Meyers: My brothers three years owner

870
01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.730
Richelle Direny: Okay, so at nine years old, you learn how to be mom.

871
01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:52.980
Christina Meyers: Pretty much.

872
01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.170
Richelle Direny: And

873
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:59.490
Richelle Direny: All throughout your years of growing up.

874
01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:02.550
Richelle Direny: You were among

875
01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.470
Richelle Direny: Sure, not just to your brother, but for the mom to

876
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:09.720
Christina Meyers: Probably my mother.

877
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.540
Richelle Direny: So at what point in time in that dynamic

878
01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:20.430
Richelle Direny: Did you mentally tell yourself. I will never do this to my children.

879
01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:32.400
Christina Meyers: I'm sure a bunch of times. Probably. Probably all throughout my teenage years. Nothing. You heard me say I will not be like my mom, I will not be like my mom, I will not

880
01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:35.310
Be yourself.

881
01:38:36.570 --> 01:38:37.200
Christina Meyers: What's that

882
01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.270
Richelle Direny: What do you think you are you, what do you think you mentally did to yourself by saying back

883
01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:53.370
Christina Meyers: I think that I'm mentally put myself in a state to be supermom probably at a young age, because I told myself I will not going to be like her.

884
01:38:55.890 --> 01:39:01.860
Richelle Direny: And do you think you overcompensate as a mom to your children because of

885
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:04.620
Richelle Direny: What your mom did not do for you.

886
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:07.230
Christina Meyers: Absolutely, absolutely.

887
01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.220
Richelle Direny: You see where a lot of your guilt is coming from right now.

888
01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:12.600
Sure.

889
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:18.750
Christina Meyers: Because what I knew, I knew it would. I mean,

890
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:20.310
Christina Meyers: I

891
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.940
Christina Meyers: I know that sometimes a lot of

892
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.500
Christina Meyers: How I act now is

893
01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:32.820
Christina Meyers: An effect of how I was when I was younger.

894
01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:44.760
Christina Meyers: Or I'm dealing with things now that I didn't deal with when I was younger, you know, maybe it wouldn't have been like that with my mom had I had said something to somebody else. You know what I mean. So I

895
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.150
Christina Meyers: Carry that now to where I'm older.

896
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.700
Christina Meyers: Absolutely.

897
01:39:51.210 --> 01:39:53.130
Richelle Direny: There's always a force that drives

898
01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:02.070
Richelle Direny: Think how we act, how we operate. We don't understand what this forces. I just know I just need to be this way.

899
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.000
Richelle Direny: But what you are doing.

900
01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:12.180
Richelle Direny: Is that every time you see your children you see yourself in your mother.

901
01:40:13.110 --> 01:40:20.610
Richelle Direny: And how you operate is how you would have wanted someone to treat you and to take care of you insecure for you.

902
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.870
Richelle Direny: So to stop and to practice your own self care.

903
01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:33.750
Richelle Direny: Means that you're going against everything over yourself. Growing up

904
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:38.460
Richelle Direny: I am going to completely devote my life to my

905
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:45.120
Richelle Direny: To my family and I'm no matter what. Even if means that

906
01:40:45.150 --> 01:40:53.160
Richelle Direny: I'm telling myself and I'm dying inside. I will never ever stop doing this because this is what I wanted.

907
01:40:53.970 --> 01:40:54.300
Richelle Direny: For me,

908
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:08.640
Christina Meyers: Yeah, that sounds about right.

909
01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:16.110
Richelle Direny: Is your mom still alive.

910
01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:17.460
Yep.

911
01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.310
Richelle Direny: How much is she involved now.

912
01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.380
Christina Meyers: Not at all. I don't

913
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:24.900
Christina Meyers: Talk, you're here.

914
01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:30.150
Richelle Direny: Is there a part of you that wants her to come

915
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.360
Richelle Direny: apologize for not being there.

916
01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:34.830
So we

917
01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:39.390
Christina Meyers: Guys, for a lot of scope.

918
01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:48.840
Christina Meyers: But it will never happen. So that's why I toss in the towel years ago.

919
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.560
Richelle Direny: you toss in the towel. So you're right. Your mommy.

920
01:41:59.010 --> 01:42:11.460
Richelle Direny: What you want her. So there's this whole that's inside of you that you build and even though you toss it in. It's still there and you're finding every which way.

921
01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:16.410
Richelle Direny: To either. So it's like you're filling something that will never be

922
01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:18.780
Christina Meyers: diction.

923
01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:22.440
Christina Meyers: Yeah.

924
01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:38.610
Richelle Direny: Cool. Now when you kind of like want to just say, I want some time. Tell me about the even the relationship with your husband you and your husband raising these children and being there.

925
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:41.580
Christina Meyers: And

926
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:53.520
Christina Meyers: He works and I'm at home, mostly when I do work. It's for the school. So I'm with my kids. Anyways, and then I come home and I usually

927
01:42:54.180 --> 01:43:07.350
Christina Meyers: You know, take care of the kids. And when I needed a moment to myself, you know, I just usually I would take that time while the kids were at school because now they're all in school and I would take that time to do things for myself.

928
01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:12.480
Christina Meyers: But now that everyone's home. I just don't. I mean,

929
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:27.450
Richelle Direny: Outside of right now, because what right now is doing. It's somewhat to come to terms with everything that you've always dealt with growing up as being a mom. It's kind of taking you and if you're you're being stifled.

930
01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:31.710
Richelle Direny: Because I don't have any time and all of that.

931
01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:39.540
Richelle Direny: Prior to this, what was your self care routine or did your husband helped foster to help you with it.

932
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:48.210
Richelle Direny: To say, hey, Christina, I got the kids, don't worry about it, you'll go out you go spend all day pampering yourself.

933
01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:59.760
Christina Meyers: I mean, he, he will not do that. But, you know, if I were to say to him, you know, I need to go out somewhere. It's not a. It's not a problem. You know, like, Okay, well, you know,

934
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:05.820
Christina Meyers: Go out and I wouldn't say that he forces me out to go do

935
01:44:05.850 --> 01:44:06.870
Christina Meyers: Things you know

936
01:44:07.410 --> 01:44:08.550
Richelle Direny: Just allow you

937
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:25.380
Richelle Direny: If you need and just spend a half a day just unwinding just looking in the mirror and saying, girl. Look, let's let's go guys, you're done. Let's get our nails done. Let's go shopping and take be slow about turn on these clothes.

938
01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:30.210
Richelle Direny: He allows that he fosters that to happen.

939
01:44:30.630 --> 01:44:32.550
Christina Meyers: Sure, absolutely. Okay.

940
01:44:33.090 --> 01:44:34.470
Richelle Direny: It's just right now.

941
01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:39.060
Richelle Direny: You just feel that you're overwhelmed.

942
01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:39.960
Sure.

943
01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:42.600
Richelle Direny: What is something

944
01:44:46.770 --> 01:44:49.230
Richelle Direny: But everything that we just pointed out.

945
01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:56.040
Richelle Direny: Do you think your, your mom.

946
01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:57.900
Christina Meyers: No.

947
01:44:58.500 --> 01:44:58.950
Richelle Direny: You're not

948
01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.310
Richelle Direny: So check your not your mom. Do you think you will ever turn out like your mom.

949
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.390
No.

950
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:13.320
Richelle Direny: Does your children treat you like hot or look at you. The way you looked at your mom growing up.

951
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.550
Christina Meyers: No.

952
01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:17.760
Richelle Direny: Well, it's a whole bunch of things you're doing very well.

953
01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:29.610
Richelle Direny: Um, do you think that your children would feel some type of way, if you were supposed to just go out for an hour to just be alone and do what

954
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:33.120
Richelle Direny: They know you're coming back to take care of them.

955
01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:46.920
Christina Meyers: No, I, they would be okay with it. You know, it's just the fact that i like i said i felt guilty. They're stuck here too. They don't want to be in the house, either. So, you know, that's why I feel guilty about it.

956
01:45:47.490 --> 01:45:59.640
Christina Meyers: I think what I RIGHT NOW I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO JUST THE WEATHER warming up, and then I can be out side by myself. I can walk. I can

957
01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:19.620
Christina Meyers: I can breathe because right I feel very smothered sometimes and very like I have to be JoJo the clown like I have to be the entertainer and I'm bored. What can I do. Okay. Well, let me think of this, let me. You know, I like i'm i'm just drained I'm mentally exhausted.

958
01:46:22.770 --> 01:46:34.500
Richelle Direny: Where you live right now. Are you able to take a walk like even in the morning, if you took, because remember, there's seven days in a week. I mean, hey, I'm staying for six. Can I insane myself for one

959
01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.170
Christina Meyers: Yeah.

960
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:46.740
Richelle Direny: It's being verbal about that. And I think that's maybe what you have a hard time saying because it sounds to me that if you save that.

961
01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:53.610
Richelle Direny: You put yourself in the same world as how your mom was growing up.

962
01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:58.800
Richelle Direny: What, listen, you're there. And I think it's giving yourself that credit

963
01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:06.450
Richelle Direny: You're there and you've always been there, you're never going to ever be your mom because you're there.

964
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:19.770
Richelle Direny: Go out you know you're coming back because you know where you're going, you're not going to the bar, you're not doing all of it. And even if you decided to go wherever you go. You are coming home.

965
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:28.200
Richelle Direny: Because I'm sure when you got girlfriends. I'm sure 60 to 70% of the conversation is not nice cute.

966
01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:30.510
Christina Meyers: Yeah.

967
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:33.660
Christina Meyers: Yes.

968
01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:35.370
Richelle Direny: Children say it's not

969
01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.660
Christina Meyers: As good as they are.

970
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:42.450
Richelle Direny: So, you know, you will never, and I think it's, you have to

971
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:45.780
Richelle Direny: And I hate to use the word have to

972
01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:50.820
Richelle Direny: Maybe when you have your alone time in the bathroom because sometimes

973
01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:54.210
Richelle Direny: That is always robbed of them.

974
01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:55.650
Yeah.

975
01:47:57.690 --> 01:48:02.550
Richelle Direny: The bathroom is always robbed, like, Dude, can I can I can I be in here by myself.

976
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:03.870
Christina Meyers: Like

977
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:05.940
Richelle Direny: The door was closed for a reason why are we

978
01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:09.810
Richelle Direny: Why are we even still having a conversation. Yeah.

979
01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:16.500
Richelle Direny: So when you're it's having that moment, whatever time and say, Christina.

980
01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:20.790
Richelle Direny: You are not your mother.

981
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.430
Richelle Direny: Who have come a long way and you are who you have to speak.

982
01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.810
That into yourself.

983
01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:33.900
Richelle Direny: You just have to speak that into here.

984
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:37.680
Richelle Direny: And I

985
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:38.550
Christina Meyers: Think that

986
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.380
Christina Meyers: Go ahead. I think you're right, also about

987
01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:46.470
Christina Meyers: Not verbalizing

988
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:51.900
Christina Meyers: When you said not saying something. I don't, you're right.

989
01:48:53.010 --> 01:49:08.490
Richelle Direny: You sit there like we all do, as women we swallow it on. I'm not one more situation, no more. Listen, just give me two seconds. Let me just say I remember years ago I remember this lady I was listening to this thing and she

990
01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:16.560
Richelle Direny: She has to sit in the bathroom and even m&m in P as in the kid will come in was in your mouth.

991
01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:23.790
Richelle Direny: Open it up. Let me see. And you find a way to stick it under your tongue and hide it.

992
01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:28.860
Richelle Direny: Creatively so they don't see what's there because I

993
01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:32.130
Richelle Direny: Want to share what I really don't.

994
01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:33.570
Know,

995
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:40.500
Richelle Direny: You so it's but it's, it's, we have to verbalize it. But in even everything. I mean,

996
01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:49.290
Richelle Direny: That's not what you shared with your mom and you are so much more than that. But you have to speak that to yourself like you are

997
01:49:49.890 --> 01:50:00.630
Richelle Direny: You're ultimately punishing yourself because you're working so hard not to be like her that have not. It doesn't sound like you have come to that reality that you're not her.

998
01:50:01.650 --> 01:50:02.220
Christina Meyers: Correct.

999
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:14.490
Richelle Direny: Everything she did. I'm sure she has a pass, and there was a force that drove her to do what she did. Maybe it was the, the loss of the

1000
01:50:14.490 --> 01:50:21.750
Richelle Direny: Relationship or whatever her reasoning was as to why she tells spitting into whatever her story is her story.

1001
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:28.410
Richelle Direny: your story, your story and your story is my childhood was wrong.

1002
01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:35.400
Richelle Direny: Because I was busy taking care of myself, starting at nine years old and I didn't know what the heck I was doing

1003
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:45.150
Richelle Direny: I was busy taking care of my brother and maybe our brother sister relationship wasn't really what it needed to be because I was so busy being Mommy to him.

1004
01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:54.510
Richelle Direny: And I was so busy being Mommy to my mommy was supposed to be that. So there's that anger. There's that bitterness. There's that resentment.

1005
01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:58.380
Richelle Direny: And because you hold on to everything you have towards mom.

1006
01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:12.660
Richelle Direny: You try. You're endeavoring best never allow your children to see that. So, by not verbalizing to them how you feel in saying, Hey, I just need it and then just give me a minute on wine, and then I'll come back.

1007
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:22.920
Richelle Direny: You'll take that same anger and bitterness that you have to your mouth from with your mom, you take all of that and you put it on your children and you think your children is going to look at you that way.

1008
01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:24.300
And you're

1009
01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:30.090
Richelle Direny: It's like you're formulating their thoughts for them and they are just looking at you like,

1010
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.770
Richelle Direny: I'm

1011
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:33.810
Christina Meyers: Crazy. I'm not thinking that crazy

1012
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:36.930
Richelle Direny: You know you

1013
01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:38.310
Christina Meyers: Make sense

1014
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:44.610
Richelle Direny: You're putting so much on them and they look like. I mean, I really don't.

1015
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.950
Christina Meyers: Know it's true.

1016
01:51:50.340 --> 01:52:02.040
Richelle Direny: They come home every day, they come home to you, they come home cooked meal. And I remember in your thing, you said that aren't you like a cheerleading mom or something like that. You're on.

1017
01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.280
Richelle Direny: Your own luck and they

1018
01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:10.590
Richelle Direny: They probably like, Mom, seriously, could you give me two seconds. Let me just show

1019
01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:14.700
Christina Meyers: A baby the meantime.

1020
01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:28.800
Richelle Direny: You see, but you can hear that they need to meet time because you're so busy worried about how they're going to look at you. The same way you look at your Mom You're so great I i with that.

1021
01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:36.300
Richelle Direny: You're not realizing that while they want their meantime. This is classic for me to have my meantime

1022
01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.170
Sure.

1023
01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:46.650
Richelle Direny: It's all about reframing and restructuring, how you think and being okay and same Christina.

1024
01:52:49.050 --> 01:52:51.210
Richelle Direny: It is ok for me.

1025
01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:55.680
Richelle Direny: To take an hour or two, because that's really

1026
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:59.400
Richelle Direny: Mom's Mom, it's really truly only me

1027
01:53:00.330 --> 01:53:09.240
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because you know when you go out with friends and they doing something, especially the ones that don't got no kids, and you're like, why am I even here I need to go home to these kids.

1028
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:17.430
Christina Meyers: That's exactly right. Or I don't stop talking about one or the other.

1029
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:23.490
Richelle Direny: Exactly. Or, you know, I don't know if your children by mine your phone ringing. What do you want

1030
01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.560
Christina Meyers: All the time something stupid.

1031
01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:42.840
Richelle Direny: Something real stupid. So, you know, a reality of what us as women and as bombs, we need. I just need an hour to that's it that's really all I need is an hour to

1032
01:53:43.890 --> 01:53:50.790
Richelle Direny: You not trying to even stay out late because you wondering, did they did he make them go to bed early. Did he even make them eat.

1033
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:54.930
Christina Meyers: What did he make him. Did he can cereal. Yes, all

1034
01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:08.730
Richelle Direny: eat for dinner cereal. Seriously. Seriously article writer and. Oh, you thought up because, you know, what's that word that I didn't want to do so. Cereal is the easiest thing.

1035
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:11.700
Christina Meyers: Exactly, exactly.

1036
01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:25.560
Richelle Direny: The reality of it is, it is. Okay. All I need is, I won't have to, and you don't even have to do it every single day because the reality you really needed every single day, seven days out of the week.

1037
01:54:25.890 --> 01:54:36.300
Richelle Direny: After the Six Day. That's when you feel like you're about to drown. And so taking one day out of the week and saying this is mommy time

1038
01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:39.540
Richelle Direny: You guys get

1039
01:54:40.710 --> 01:54:41.760
Richelle Direny: Six days.

1040
01:54:42.930 --> 01:54:45.690
Richelle Direny: Damn near if I'm not sleeping 24 hours a day.

1041
01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:46.560
Christina Meyers: Because sounds good.

1042
01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:49.470
Richelle Direny: Sleep and you're coming in the face to ask me something.

1043
01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.880
Richelle Direny: Right when I got to that real good part of the dream.

1044
01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:54.330
All

1045
01:54:56.250 --> 01:54:56.580
Christina Meyers: So,

1046
01:54:57.690 --> 01:55:11.130
Richelle Direny: I just need this day, this time isn't my time. I want to watch this movie. And I just want to get lost in the movie. And I want to just act like for a minute. I'll handle husband, I'll handle kids. It's just me alone in the world.

1047
01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:12.300
Yeah.

1048
01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.720
Richelle Direny: But you have to verbalize that

1049
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:20.970
Richelle Direny: But while you're verbalizing that there's that voice in the back of your mind that saying

1050
01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:27.240
Richelle Direny: It is okay. There's nothing wrong with it, you needed it is okay.

1051
01:55:29.670 --> 01:55:41.850
Richelle Direny: And it's just that that's that's kind of like, that's where that positive self talk, you're talking yourself down. And in doing that, you'll start realizing that your anxiety will slowly start going down.

1052
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:55.890
Richelle Direny: Because right now, that's where you are. You just kind of need to find a way to address where is this anxiety coming from identifying where is this anxiety coming from for you today.

1053
01:55:56.970 --> 01:56:01.320
Richelle Direny: Your anxiety is backed with feeling claustrophobic.

1054
01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:13.470
Richelle Direny: That's where your anxiety I feel holy and I need to stop being claustrophobic because you know what, the more you feel claustrophobic. The more the anxiety.

1055
01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:15.420
Richelle Direny: You. Oh snap.

1056
01:56:16.290 --> 01:56:16.770
Christina Meyers: Sure.

1057
01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:21.720
Richelle Direny: And when you snap them kids go look at your kids, your husband got me looking at you that mommy crazy

1058
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:27.660
Christina Meyers: It's true. Some mommy dearest

1059
01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:29.430
Christina Meyers: You see,

1060
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:36.510
Richelle Direny: You're not thinking that you just got on my last godforsaken nurse, they just looking at me crazy.

1061
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:38.700
Christina Meyers: Happened.

1062
01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.670
Richelle Direny: Don't have that's what's happening.

1063
01:56:42.150 --> 01:56:42.630
Yes.

1064
01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:53.340
Richelle Direny: The only are going on. And they're looking at you all this way, simply because of this battle.

1065
01:56:55.050 --> 01:56:59.490
Richelle Direny: That's raging on the inside of you that started at nine years old.

1066
01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:00.480
Yo,

1067
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.240
Richelle Direny: And kind of went on through life.

1068
01:57:06.210 --> 01:57:06.690
Richelle Direny: So,

1069
01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:08.310
Richelle Direny: Honestly,

1070
01:57:10.770 --> 01:57:17.310
Richelle Direny: Today what they do you think, even in this time because listen, the reality is, you know, we're gonna be doing this for a month. Me and

1071
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:19.020
Looking at yet.

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:24.360
Christina Meyers: Yep.

1074
01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:30.570
Richelle Direny: So what is it what they can you pick that you can dedicate to yourself.

1075
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:38.070
Christina Meyers: Um, I'm going to say Monday. Monday seems to be the least craziest day

1076
01:57:38.610 --> 01:57:39.930
Richelle Direny: Monday at what time

1077
01:57:42.810 --> 01:57:45.150
Christina Meyers: I'm going to say from 10 to 12

1078
01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:47.790
Christina Meyers: In the morning, yeah.

1079
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:51.150
Richelle Direny: What's what why specifically 10 to 12 in the morning.

1080
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:57.150
Christina Meyers: Half the house is still sleeping. It will be very easy for me.

1081
01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:00.060
Richelle Direny: There you go.

1082
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:08.640
Richelle Direny: But you have to be intentional. You have to really say this is my time. The house is quiet.

1083
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.120
Richelle Direny: From 10 to 12 which is a whole two hours. What do you think you can do in those two hours.

1084
01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:33.540
Christina Meyers: I think I'm going to utilize it to be outside because i don't i don't want to make the mistake of staying inside because then what will happen is, I'll start picking up and cleaning and I'll have used that time not to decompress to do other things. So I'll be outside

1085
01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:37.500
Christina Meyers: Six.

1086
01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:53.700
Richelle Direny: Okay, so from from one mom to the next, even though I'm doing therapy bill from one month to the next have a young child from 10 to six was quite as possible because you don't need to get up.

1087
01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:55.320
Christina Meyers: Yeah.

1088
01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:58.260
Richelle Direny: We won't do nothing that's gonna make a whole lot of noise.

1089
01:59:00.150 --> 01:59:01.800
Richelle Direny: So if you got dogs you go and tell them

1090
01:59:03.330 --> 01:59:12.390
Richelle Direny: You're gonna sneak out and do what you do, because that's what we had to do if we need to make a clean break. Be real quiet, what you do.

Richelle Direny: You come back. Now you could take. Now we can put that s back on our chest for the day.

1106
02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:41.100
Richelle Direny: And you've always been a good mom, you need to hear that.

1107
02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.380
Richelle Direny: Your screen went away.

1108
02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:47.250

1112
02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:12.330
Richelle Direny: That we're going to go through that every single day and I'm assuming for a month for you to constantly tell yourself that you are a good mom.

1113
02:01:13.170 --> 02:01:19.650
Richelle Direny: Or not your mom you, Christina Meyers out how you have your life.

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:29.490
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1116
02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:31.290
Christina Meyers: Okay.

1117
02:01:31.710 --> 02:01:33.480
Richelle Direny: Because I eat. It's for you to believe

1118
02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:34.290
Right now.

1119
02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:42.090
Richelle Direny: No matter even if your children tell you you're very good at, which I'm sure they told you that you're a good mom, I'm sure.

1120
02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:52.950
Richelle Direny: Everyone in your life has told you that you're a very good mom, whether it's the living right. Yep. And I'm sure if you do you have a good relationship with your brother.

1121
02:01:53.520 --> 02:02:01.770
Richelle Direny: Yes, I'm sure you he's even told you at some point in time that you are a good mom and you're not your mom, but you don't believe that.

1122
02:02:02.850 --> 02:02:05.550
Richelle Direny: You don't believe that because

1123
02:02:07.410 --> 02:02:13.770
Richelle Direny: Christina needed that female figure in her life to teach her how to

1124
02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:22.410
Richelle Direny: How to be a mom how to be even you even want love to your, your mom to be a grandmother to these children who she's unable to so

1125
02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:31.410
Richelle Direny: We'll never got any of that your soul overcompensating in that that anything that anyone tells you, you cannot process it. You've put

1126
02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:33.420
Richelle Direny: Your like

1127
02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:43.320
Richelle Direny: That's what you do every time they tell you that's not true. That's not true. That's not true, because every time. Christina looks in the mirror, she sees her mom.

1128
02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:46.050
Richelle Direny: She looks at herself.

1129
02:02:49.080 --> 02:03:04.290
Richelle Direny: So every day, whatever time of the day, even if you need to tell yourself that all day, even if your children is flipping out and they talking about. That's what kids do they have to learn and you want to snatch the team out of the mouth, and I know I'm on record saying this, but

1130
02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:07.260
Christina Meyers: It's

1131
02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:11.700
Christina Meyers: True. Yeah.

1132
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:25.770
Richelle Direny: Snatch everything about there, so they could stop speaking, you know, you remember the cartoon. What is it area when they took the voice thing out of her mouth, she couldn't talk. So, you know, in that moment, you need them to do you need to kind of put a guard. I call it out.

1133
02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:28.860
Christina Meyers: To be Ursula. I've been here.

1134
02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:29.790

1135
02:03:30.150 --> 02:03:30.510
Me.

1136
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:35.370
Richelle Direny: So yeah, you

1137
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:46.650
Richelle Direny: Do that everybody deals with that but for you. You say nothing because saying something is what your mom would have done.

1138
02:03:47.730 --> 02:03:57.480
Richelle Direny: All the things that you have towards her. So every time your children do what children do which is talk back have attitude and do everything.

1139
02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:05.520
Richelle Direny: That they do that makes you picture yourself in that orange jumpsuit telling you the truth, it's okay because their kids.

1140
02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:12.330
Richelle Direny: But it doesn't change that you're a good loving, caring mom that will do anything for them.

1141
02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:36.120
Richelle Direny: It doesn't change that and that's what I want you to tell. I am a good loving mom that will do anything for my children every time you have a thought that you're not. I want you to tell yourself that I am a good loving mom that will do anything for my children and I am not my mother.

1142
02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.200
Richelle Direny: Those are the two things that we're gonna

1143
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:08.250
