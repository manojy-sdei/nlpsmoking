25
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I was thinking, but I always want it to be client driven. I was thinking today. We could do some target mapping

26
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning sort of finding some history around this emotion of shame that continues for my assessment to infect

27
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How everything, everything. Yeah, okay, glad you said it.

28

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Become aware of all the temperature and sounds that are

40
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Available to you there.

41
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what you're doing there and maybe even seeing your own hands in motion.

42
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: As they do or don't do anything at all.

43
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how your body feels there.

44
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What your mind.

45
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: wanders off to or or maybe is at rest.

46
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a sense of the shift of being there. Yes.

47
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So while you're there.

48
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to

49
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Rely on that space to think about some negative possible history here and

50
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And do some em, Dr.

51
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so first

52
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about

53
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a recent trigger of shame like may have happened five minutes ago or yesterday.

54
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a recent trigger that might have been what was steering my decision making and my behavior. And once you get it.

55
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.830
Let me know.

56
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it on your mind. Yeah.

57
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

58
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, hold that in your mind and then go to the earliest time that you can remember having that feeling.

59
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the earliest time and the most intense

60
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can get to that most intense

61
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Shame experience.

62
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If you get a sense of how old you were

63
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.180
I'd like to know.

64
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.920
Cynthia We: Hmm, I'm having trouble with that.

65
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

66
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me about the one that is a recent trigger

67
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.140
Cynthia We: Was got was just me about, um,

68
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.870
Cynthia We: We were talking about

69
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.020
Cynthia We: My nephew coming

70
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.810
Cynthia We: And I had talked to my sister.

71
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:27.600
Cynthia We: via text because it was like 1130 at night and she had robo router at her house and

72
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:35.280
Cynthia We: She said that she thought that her son would come to Santa Fe first and then go to

73
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:47.970
Cynthia We: Michigan because she wanted to do a wellness check on him and I responded that I thought, does that have to do with drugs like, to me, it's obvious that something's going on with them.

74
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.760
Cynthia We: And Scott's response to that was, why are you texting.

75
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.040
Cynthia We: Me, My response, I think, was automatically

76
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.650
Again,

77
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.170
Cynthia We: Um,

78
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:22.710
Cynthia We: But I kind of, you know, lashed out at him, and it. Well, first, first I tried to explain because it was late at night we were texting and and I thought I had done a really good job of not making not triggering her not i'm not saying anything mean

79
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So go back to I you know I fucked up again.

80
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:31.230
Okay.

81
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hold hold that in your awareness.

82
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And see where it lands in the body. See if we can we, we may need to go somewhere else to get some some history here, so

83
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That distinction between I didn't have the thought that I had fucked up. And now I fucked up again.

84
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.200
Cynthia We: I think it's in my chest. Okay.

85
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.360
Like pretty strongly

86
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So go there and feel it when I get a sense of its size and shape and color.

87
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And whether it's moving anywhere expanding or contracting

88
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Just attend to it.

89
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can find a way to ask that chest when its earliest experience of that.

90
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Tension

91
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Skin, a sense of whether

92
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The body remembers how

93
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want me to ask out loud. Okay, asking my head, you can do in your head.

94
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.670
Cynthia We: Very small.

95
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Very small yeah like

96
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.210
Cynthia We: Like I'm

97
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.230
Cynthia We: In our old house. So it was before I was 10

98
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Will check and see if the tension here nine

99
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The check and see if that chest was there at nine.

100
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.200
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

101
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:50.820
Cynthia We: Yeah.

102
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And then move back to eight mm hmm like third grade, maybe

103
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.780
Cynthia We: Was there. Remember, give you like second grade.

104
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.330
Okay.

105
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.580
Seven.

106
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you just get a little picture.

107
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

108
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.590
Cynthia We: My

109
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.290
Cynthia We: Do you want me to tell you about it.

110
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.510
Cynthia We: Dad was outside playing with me and I was so excited to do is playing

111
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.580
Cynthia We: And, um,

112
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:54.480
Cynthia We: I, I had to go to the bathroom, but I didn't actually go inside because I was so excited that he was playing and I put my pants and I'm by then, he had gone into to take a nap. And I had to wake him up to help me get out of my pants and he was pissed.

113
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:04.890
Cynthia We: I don't feel like my dad always is the one that triggered my shame. I think my mom did more, but I really am having a hard time picturing

114
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you don't have to do all the heavy lifting. Here you can let me be your therapist, just let me guide you. You don't have to work so hard.

115
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: No way to do this wrong.

116
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.920
You know,

117
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No way to do it wrong.

118
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, tell me what emotion. You're having right now.

119
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.770
Cynthia We: I'm confused because I I am

120
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.220
Cynthia We: Because I can't really remember.

121
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:51.780
Cynthia We: That remember that incident very clearly. And I remember how awful. I felt and like, like what a loser. I felt like

122
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.770
Cynthia We: But I cannot remember

123
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.680
Cynthia We: Feeling

124
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:08.940
Cynthia We: I can't remember a lot of my childhood, like I do, but I don't you know like I don't remember the feelings. I had

125
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.190
Cynthia We: A lot of times

126
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's just stay there.

127
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've labeled it confusing.

128
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: When you summon it up.

129
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't come to you the way. Maybe you'd like in the moment.

130
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.660
Cynthia We: Yeah, it doesn't at all.

131
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.580
Cynthia We: And I'm

132
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So how distressed. Are you from zero to 100 hundred is just

133
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:40.110
Cynthia We: Oh, I'm not super just just, I'm just like, maybe 20 I'm probably average around the 40

134
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically at a 40 so right now.

135
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So, go back, go back to that.

136
00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That moment and check and see if this, I want to word to describe what was going on with the chest, so I don't keep just calling it chest. What's the actual feeling of the chest.

137
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.480
Um,

138
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.710
Cynthia We: Like a constriction tightening

139
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To check in, again, see if that was happening with this excitement on not wanting to waste a minute wanted to keep playing. Write it down.

140
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.130
Yeah.

141
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.940
Cynthia We: To see if my chest was happening.

142
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:46.350
Cynthia We: I had to go in and announce that I put my pants and I needed help cleaning it up. Yeah, yeah.

143
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:54.030
Cynthia We: Yeah, man. He was very mad because he had gone to sleep. He was taking a nap.

144
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.010
Cynthia We: narcolepsy was a very big excuse for him to sleep a lot. My childhood.

145
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you saw him being very mad.

146
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. I didn't you

147
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:15.630
Cynthia We: Well, what a loser doesn't go to the bathroom and they have to go like, what, why would I wait

148
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.880
Cynthia We: I know better.

149
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But can you picture.

150
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the difference between

151
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Your intention of walking in the room, and then seeing how he was very mad when you saw the very mad. Do you remember the emotion that you felt

152
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:43.980
Cynthia We: Oh, I'm

153
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.920
Cynthia We: Surprised isn't really an emotion, but

154
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Again it is. Uh huh. It's a primary one. Actually, no.

155
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.670
Cynthia We: I was surprised. It was the opposite of what I expected.

156
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you're surprised to do anything.

157
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Is embarrassed embarrassed. Okay.

158
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:22.080
Cynthia We: Because you stop usually stop having excellence. When you're really, really little.

159
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.880
Cynthia We: And

160
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to be on there to stay here.

161
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Zero to 100 what level of distress. Are you out right now.

Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Before I go there. I want, I want to find out the, I think what I heard you say the negative cognition. So that's a negative thought that's a belief about the self. So you'll hear me, you'll hear me say the negative cognition.

167
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I

168
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a loser. What a loser.

169
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.200
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think I say that a lot to myself. I think that unconsciously, I say that a lot

170
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: At seven. You remember

171
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What a loser.

172
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:32.970
Cynthia We: Mm hmm.

173
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, really.

176
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of give yourself permission, because I'm going to give you another invitation here.

177
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You're seven you're surprised.

178
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And the negative thought was what a loser.

179
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And

180
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you have liked to have believed about yourself.

181
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: At that time,

182
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.840
Cynthia We: I had an accident.

183
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.110
Cynthia We: Or the accidents happen.

184
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.220
Cynthia We: Make me a bad person.

185
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what does it make you so go to like

186
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.630
Cynthia We: A normal person.

187
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.170
Cynthia We: That has an

188
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: accident. I know.

189
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.590
Cynthia We: Person that makes a mistake.

190
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.700
I'm normal.

191
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, with all of the meaning that you just said it wasn't accidents happened to normal people.

192
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Normal

193
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So you get you get a sense of, it would have been nice if you had that thought at the moment this is normal. I'm normal. This is an accident. I'm in here trying to get help.

194
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And it would have been nice.

195
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I

196
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to kind of be doing a slow iteration here with the little blue light.

197
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Or so want to kind of get you back in touch with your team of Jim Shaughnessy as a protective figure

198
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So as I say them just give yourself permission to really be with them, you know, see yourself interact with it immersed with it.

199
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The more vivid, the more interactions. You can see also there with Sally.

200
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting your growth and your development nurturing

201
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Interacting

202
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: With in Shaughnessy

203
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And wise quality.

204
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Of Bob mayor your writing teacher

205
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're there with it.

206
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let your imagination go just kind of let it, let it happen to see see where it takes you.

207
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.140
When you're with your team. Mm hmm.

208
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel like you're really without imagery right now.

209
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.710
Cynthia We: Yes.

210
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to share my screen with you.

211
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.050
Shortly.

212
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Who wants you to be looking at the

213
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we can just look at the the blue light. The furthest

214
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So it'll be all the way over on one side all the way over. Okay, I'm going to share the whole screen. Make sure that hopefully it'll take up most of your screen to

215
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't really care about the middle part

216
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So Cindy, I want you to really bring up that awareness of immersion into the qualities of your team.

217
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you've got them in your mind's eye.

218
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue to hold them in your awareness.

219
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to be looking

220
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: At the slight yeah I'm going to slow it down a touch. I want it to be slower.

221
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: To be a little patient with the funkiness of this

222
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just the way it is.

223
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Going right way. There we go. Okay, hold them in your awareness.

224
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That quality of

225
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection.

226
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: nurturing your growth and development.

227
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.060
And wisdom.

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together nice inhale into the belly and then

229
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it all go

230
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And just gently.

231
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Share with me, what is coming

232
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.690
Cynthia We: Nothing is coming up. I'm holding them in my mind.

Cynthia We: There's something supposed to come up

238
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're

239
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe wanting more confidence that you're doing it correctly right now.

240
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.120
Cynthia We: Yeah.

241
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.040

Cynthia We: I like the image and I like the I like the on to think of those people as

243
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:47.520
Cynthia We: Yeah, as my protector and my nurturing person and my with my wise person, they're great people. So I feel like I'm very lucky to have

244
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.450
And to have experienced than

245
00:23:52.950 --> 00:24:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Me happy to think about it. Let's, let's do more with them. Then, so what I'll ask you to do next is, I want you to now go to this is part of

246
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The rewiring okay and remember I told you there's no way to do this wrong. I'm right here, guiding

247
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All you do is pay attention to what comes up your work is to not have to edit it for me. I could be of no use to you.

248
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're doing anything that's a contortion for me just, you gotta catch on Claire you really careful because I already told you there's no way to do it wrong. There's no way you can do this wrong. We're going away. Great.

249
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So pull up that image.

250
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can feel the worst part of it.

251
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That second grade experience.

252
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it in your mind, the worst picture of that event.

253
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to surround yourself with this team.

254
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let that imagery be integrated with these qualities

255
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You have it in your mind.

256
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hold it there and then watch the light left and right.

257
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together, inhale through the nose.

258
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling it all out, letting it go

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me what you noticed

260
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.640
Cynthia We: I noticed I stopped breathing.

261
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.120
Cynthia We: Wonder if that's horrible.

262
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I stopped breathing. I wonder

263
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:37.140
Cynthia We: Breathing. Well, it's not so much that I wonder if it's normal. I wonder why I do that like weird. That's a weird thing to do.

264
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're gonna you're gonna go. You're going to go with that.

265
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up that negative image.

266
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to shift gears a little bit.

267
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But that negative image. Worst case of it.

268
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through the nose.

269
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

270
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it all go

271
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you're noticing.

272
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.310
I remember to breathe.

273
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your level of distress from zero to 100

274
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.900
Cynthia We: Higher than it was last time. It's like be

275
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: 5040 45.5. Yep.

276
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember to breathe.

277
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do

278
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Some it faster.

279
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is the desensitisation part. Okay.

280
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You can always stop. You could do this.

281
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If it gets up into the uncomfortable stuff. Think that's like in the 65 starting to get uncomfortable.

282
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm watching the time and I'm also trying to watch you and see if you're getting overly distressed. Okay.

283
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this one is going to be that worst image.

284
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Worse picture.

285
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And the negative thought

286
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a loser.

287
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is faster, try and hold them in your awareness.

288
00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, with me, inhale through the nose.

289
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

290
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting go

291
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And just let me in on what you're noticing.

292
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.910
Cynthia We: Well, I don't really like to hold that in my head.

293
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it. I don't like it. No, it doesn't.

294
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.090
Cynthia We: Make me feel good.

295
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel

296
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:42.510
Cynthia We: Um,

297
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:57.330
Cynthia We: I find myself trying to distract myself like not think about it and not I'm, I'm, I was focused on Scott's sounds from the other were Homer.

298
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.030
Cynthia We: Hmm.

299
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I got distracted.

300
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.180
Cynthia We: Yeah, totally.

301
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And you remember thinking, I have a choice. I can stay with that town outside the room or I can remember thinking, you had some choice in it.

302
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:23.970
Cynthia We: I remember thinking I should be focusing and looking, I don't

303
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:29.520
Cynthia We: I don't think I thought I had a choice. I think it was more just

304
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.340
Cynthia We: I have to focus on today. I was floating. Whoa.

305
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what level of distress. Let me have a number from zero to 100

306
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.890
Cynthia We: Maybe, like, um, I mean, it's about the same as it was last time.

307
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm I'm floating away.

308
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And

309
00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I don't like thinking about it. I don't like thinking right now. I don't like

310
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.270
Cynthia We: I don't like holding my head.

311
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: For this exercise. Can you do it anyway and pull it up. Think about it.

312
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And put that negative thought, knowing that this light is the distraction for you. It's gonna, it's going to be there for you. That's its job is to disrupt

313
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what it's for. So

314
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's there for you.

315
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the mechanism of action right in there. So let's see if we can have a change in that so pull it up WORST piece.

316
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And remember you can always stop. You don't have to float away. You can always say, I need a break or just put your hands up like this.

317
00:32:49.710 --> 00:33:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we'll do it. We'll do it for smaller iterations will do it for like 20 seconds right okay so that that negative and then negative appraisal. The negative thought that worst one. Is it still I'm a loser. That's just, okay, so hold it in there.

318
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you mentioned earlier, I was floating away I

319
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't have a choice. I needed to distract myself and go with that. Okay, so, watching

320
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale.

321
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, all of it out all their exhaled out empty that long.

322
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.380
Letting it all go

323
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring me into your experience happening.

324
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.430
Cynthia We: Um, well, I was able to hold it in my head that time.

325
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.600
Cynthia We: I still don't like it but I like that you did it for less time because I would never tell you to stop.

326
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Go with that worse. Pull up your worst image go with what you just said.

327
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you get a cognition. I'm a loser. I would never tell you

328
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together nice belly breath, all the way to the bottom of that long.

329
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, all of it out, push it all out.

330
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing.

331
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.480
Cynthia We: Feels good to breathe. Think I stopped again.

332
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.240
For you. Mm hmm.

333
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What are some thoughts.

334
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.160
Cynthia We: Yes or no.

335
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.230
Cynthia We: No.

336
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.130
Nothing.

337
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What level of distress you answer 200

338
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.370
Cynthia We: And probably the same

339
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:36.900
Cynthia We: 45 yeah

340
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What's registering let's say muscle tension proclamation right

341
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.280
Cynthia We: There your

342
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.140
Cynthia We: Shoulders. Yeah.

343
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.990
Cynthia We: And like my upper back.

344
00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go with that kind of feel that, let's not run away. Let's be present with it, acknowledge it. Let's bring up that negative imagery will do it for even shorter. Do you like that idea.

345
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

346
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.610
Cynthia We: 20 seconds is OK that's it feels to work. It's good.

347
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll stick with funny so pull that negative WORST piece but pay close attention.

348
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That it feels good to breathe.

349
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was other messages from shoulders and upper back.

350
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And go with that.

351
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Together.

352
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.310
And then

353
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

354
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:20.160
Cynthia We: I wondered if I had a choice, maybe I don't really have to think I'm a loser. Maybe I don't

355
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.170
Cynthia We: Have a choice in the matter.

356
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:25.860
Cynthia We: Maybe I

357
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.690
Cynthia We: Don't have to go to that automatically

358
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna go with that. Maybe I have twice pull up the worst image. Get it in there. You can do this girl got it.

359
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I have a choice, go with them.

360
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through your nose.

361
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And then let's push it out.

362
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.910
Cynthia We: making noise again.

363
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.250
Cynthia We: Hey,

364
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go too far. Stay there.

365
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.450
So Scott's making noise.

366
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.100
Cynthia We: Yeah, and I was listening to is

367
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:42.600
Cynthia We: Trying to figure out what he was doing.

368
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But we go with that trying to figure out what he's doing. Pull up here.

369
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:51.660
Cynthia We: Okay.

370
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up that negative image.

371
00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that.

372
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:45.570
Cynthia We: So I was thinking that this is just like meditation when your mind just goes everywhere except where it's supposed to be.

373
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:51.780
Cynthia We: And and then the teacher when I when I said

374
00:39:53.220 --> 00:40:03.990
Cynthia We: My mind just goes everywhere. And it doesn't stay. And he said, Well, that's the point you just look at it. Watch it. Watch the things go by and don't get caught up in them.

375
00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:09.780
Cynthia We: So maybe it made me feel better to know that everybody everybody experienced that.

376
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.670
Cynthia We: So I wonder

377
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If

378
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.280
Cynthia We: He was just like it.

379
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that

380
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:16.800
Okay.

381
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay here we go pull up that negative picture, pull it up and go with that.

382
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.280
Let's

383
00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of mark the end of the iteration. And then exhale

384
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it go

385
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice

386
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:12.720
Cynthia We: I was practicing letting that feeling go like just pass by, like, a cloud.

387
00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:16.410
Cynthia We: And not getting caught up.

388
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: A little scan just run from feet ankle calves nice size.

389
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Hips see phone

390
00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Back.

391
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: X ray vision goes all the way through the viscera into the gut.

392
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To the diaphragm to the chest back

393
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to the shoulders and throat

394
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To the jaw.

395
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To the years

396
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The eyes into the top of your head.

397
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what messages.

398
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What tightness one what shifts, perhaps just your own awareness, not getting caught up in my woods, but your own experience.

399
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.240
Cynthia We: It feel like my shoulders are

400
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:32.640
Cynthia We: Right here is still tight but not as tight. Um, so it's, it feels like a relaxed a little bit, but it still does have a little bit of tension in it, but I don't feel any might

401
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's still some type in the back, and there's

402
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:38.580
Cynthia We: A little bit.

403
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: No feeling in the chest, though.

404
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your belief about yourself right now.

405
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.500
Cynthia We: I'm okay.

406
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go with that. Okay, I'm okay. Pull up that negative image.

407
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going to slow it down just a little bit of cream hanging

408
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that awareness to the shoulders. I'm okay and then negative

409
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.880
Of course, peace.

410
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't be here long

411
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It will pass

412
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Inhale.

413
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale

414
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a mark that iteration all the work you're doing.

415
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you've gotten the group.

416
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes next is the invitation to share what came up

417
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:07.170
Cynthia We: That I was just feeling like I was okay like doesn't I'm I was not letting anything stick to me.

418
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Not letting anything step.

419
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is I'm okay from one to seven seven is absolutely true.

420
00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Next what a sex. I'm

421
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:31.860
Cynthia We: I feel like I'm very. Okay, maybe not 100% okay but I'm pretty okay

422
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Six.

424
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm very sorry. Okay, go. Let's go with that pull up that negative image. I'm very, very, very okay six hits

425
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It's mark the end of the iteration with a nice inhale.

426
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go.

427
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.600
Cynthia We: Well, I don't believe myself so I feel like

428
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:42.600
Cynthia We: I feel like that that voice that jumps in all the time was trying to jump in and talk me out of being very okay

429
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is, um, let's try

430
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: One to 10 How true is it I don't believe in myself, How true is that

431
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.920
Cynthia We: Um, I think it's very true. Most of the time.

432
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, one to 10 how true 10 is absolutely true. I

433
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.640
Cynthia We: believe in myself, um,

434
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.990
Cynthia We: I think maybe like a five, you feel very oh

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:11.790
Cynthia We: Maybe a six.

436
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want you to bring in

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them around.

441
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:36.330

Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with that you've kind of retreat.

446
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:56.550
Yes.

447
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens with that. I don't believe in myself.

448
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: hold those together.

449
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:07.980
Hold

450
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch a quick

451
00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you noticed

452
00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.660
Cynthia We: Well, I believe in myself when they're there I and I

453
00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.800
Cynthia We: I feel like I had a little conversation with them about it.

454
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.460
Cynthia We: In my head, and they

455
00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.970
Cynthia We: They disagree that I shouldn't believe in myself.

456
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:15.540
Cynthia We: But it doesn't matter either way if I hold them there. Then I can believe in them easily.

457
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, and then we'll spend some time processing. So I believe in myself. I'm in conversation.

458
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that.

459
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up that negative picture. I believe in myself in conversation.

460
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And look at the left and right.

461
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Its destruction.

462
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: New whole

463
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagery

464
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: aeration nice inhale and then

465
00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Close your eyes and turn inward and see

466
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What you notice

467
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.570
Cynthia We: Well, I think I can believe in myself.

468
00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:42.180
Cynthia We: Because they believe in Me and I value their opinions, so

469
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.110
Cynthia We: I can believe that I'm capable of

470
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:54.060
Cynthia We: Doing everything. And if I don't actually feel like that. They're right there. I can call him.

471
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if there's any resistance from that statement from your shoulders, see if anything doesn't connect with one

472
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:12.630
Cynthia We: No, I feel like

473
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:16.500
Cynthia We: This could gone

474
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:20.400
Cynthia We: It's not completely relaxed, but it's not

475
00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.170
Cynthia We: Normal. What do you think

476
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That that change.

477
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.450
Cynthia We: I think that realizing that I could count. I could

478
00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.950
Cynthia We: Ask for help and count on.

479
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.710
Cynthia We: Them to be there.

480
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.750
Cynthia We: Made me feel like comforted feedback.

481
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So Cindy, let's do this together with the minutes that we have left.

482
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Repeat after me with your eyes closed and let me guide.

483
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I can ask for help.

484
00:50:59.250 --> 00:50:59.700
Cynthia We: I can ask

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I can count on them. I can

486
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I can ask for help.

487
00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can count on them.

488
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And my arms are war.

489
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.680
Cynthia We: In my arms are

490
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Heavy

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.210

I can ask

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And count on them.

497
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.520
Just be present.

498
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: running it through your own mantra of repetition.

499
00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.230
All that

500
00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All that blood moving through the body.

501
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Going where it needs to go.

502
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't all need to be trapped up in those large muscle groups, it gets to be everywhere. It needs to be

503
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Sending nutrients and oxygen or it needs to go.

504
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can ask for help and you can count on that help

505
00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Be president with your team.

506
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Faces and how they interact with you with each other.

507
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice if there's any light.

508
00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Weight changes just be an observer.

509
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

510
00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a witness to things as they

511
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: shift and change, no attachment

512
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's spend a last minute kind of processing.

513
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice about the exercise itself. Maybe what was important for your Sunday.

514
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:44.310
Cynthia We: And I like that. I didn't know how it worked. So I wasn't trying to do it right, necessarily, because I have no idea how it's supposed to work.

515
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:52.110
Cynthia We: And I think that a lot of times I do that like to try and get the right answer or time

516
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:54.510
Cynthia We: Yeah.

517
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:57.900
Cynthia We: Like I'm concerned with

518
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.240
Cynthia We: Doing it right

519
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:04.710
Cynthia We: Rather than actually doing it so that it helps

520
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your overall

521
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:12.330
Sort of

522
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Stations now. Like, how are you doing

523
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.210
Cynthia We: I feel, I feel okay

524
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.640
Cynthia We: I feel good. I don't have any feelings here or here.

525
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Nothing in the body and

526
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Shall we do this again.

527
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

528
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:48.180
Cynthia We: I think I think like whatever we just did. I feel like I can remember this, and it was sick.

529
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.980
Cynthia We: Yeah.

530
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's exciting.

531
00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I would love to hear about it. Love to hear how you stayed in conversation, you know,

532
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're about to meet an experience.

533
00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:09.960
Cynthia We: Home today.

534
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.440
Cynthia We: Okay.

535
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:14.790
Um,

536
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I, continuing the individual work. I do want to meet again next Thursday at 10

537
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.080
Yes.

538
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you need anything from me on the front of the couple's piece you need anything.

539
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.580
Cynthia We: I think that we should meet again.

540
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:37.890
Cynthia We: I'm

541
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:53.700
Cynthia We: Like we're both kind of just confused about what to do now. So it was. Yeah, because we came up with a budget. Yeah, we're not really able to spend on that budget right now like

542
00:55:54.810 --> 00:56:01.080
Cynthia We: You know he's he's not working. So we have some money, but we can't actually spend it.

543
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's confusing in this limbo.

544
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:14.490
Cynthia We: Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like I'm you know i'm still it. The minute he said a word about anything. I'm like,

545
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.360
Cynthia We: You know, I'll in attack mode so

546
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that might not be the case. Moving forward, you had

547
00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

548
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It may not be the same. That would be great.

549
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

550
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:36.150
Cynthia We: Really, I mean, I really feel like I just sabotage everything

551
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:38.250
Cynthia We: No time

552
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.160
Cynthia We: Oh yeah okay well I'm what

553
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:43.530
Cynthia We: I feel, I feel like it's not helpful.

554
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you enjoyed something you did today. Oh, you're remembering the positive experience of it will be more likely you'll remember staying in conversation with them as you meet

555
00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Same triggers right outside the door and just observe it. Hey, this time I caught it sooner than the last time. Oh, this took me longer, you're just going to watch it. There's no judgment about it.

556
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I forgot it a whole day or. Oh, I thought about it all day. What fun or no snappy summaries just observing. Okay.

557
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And as far as what I have available I scheduled people again I have seven and eight at 8am booked on Saturday. My preference would be even earlier if you and Scott could pull it together at nine.

558
00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:40.650
Cynthia We: That way. Yeah, we could. I think

559
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:43.110
Cynthia We: Together, double check with him.

560
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: With him see if you guys like it and it'll be, I guess, addressing either sort of on that.

561
00:57:49.320 --> 00:58:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: The interpersonal dynamics about how to navigate or the tangible stuff. I don't know what you guys are going to want over this next window of period, but it sounds like I'm happy to be of service, let me know. Text me

562
00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:04.050
Cynthia We: Okay, great.

563
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Be good to you know to have a good one.
