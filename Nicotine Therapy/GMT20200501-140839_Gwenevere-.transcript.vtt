00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to send a quick little note here.

2
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you already have this setup, just in case we want to do some

3
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.960
Fire Tablet: Turn on the light

4
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.190
Fire Tablet: The light is on. Guess the light bulbs are going

5
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we did

6
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: For three. Yeah, so we can focus wherever you want. We don't need to do review treatment plan goals today. So what is this week been like for you.

7
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.700
Fire Tablet: It's

8
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.650
Fire Tablet: Like a lot of things I cast a lot of things are going on.

9
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:06.870
Fire Tablet: I had to do active shooter training last night again. And it's very long and tedious and grueling so that was tiring.

10
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.940
Fire Tablet: I got really irritated with Cristo, whatever her name is

11
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.550
Fire Tablet: I don't really irritated.

12
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.390
Fire Tablet: That really pissed me off.

13
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You texted me that day. Right. That's a shocking amount

14
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.010
Fire Tablet: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I just

15
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.000
Fire Tablet: The way that she write emails. I know that tone is hard to be read.

16
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.860
Fire Tablet: Yeah, perhaps it

17
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.500
Fire Tablet: But it sounds very insulting and it's just like

18
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:56.610
Fire Tablet: You know, she said, I haven't made kept my end of the bargain. And I'm like, Oh fuck no. You're not going to do that. Sure. To me, I've made payments have made small payments, but I do what I can. When

19
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.180
Fire Tablet: I can

20
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.740
Fire Tablet: And this time is a really, really bad time. Most people can't even pay their rent.

21
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.510
Fire Tablet: And

22
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.730
Fire Tablet: I'm doing the best that I can

23
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.410
Fire Tablet: And I'm happy to make small payments. I know it's not much, but I'm doing what I can and

24
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.230
Fire Tablet: She just the way that she speaks is just like

25
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.930
Fire Tablet: I understand that you're the money person. And that's painfully obvious.

26
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.690
Fire Tablet: So I don't know, I guess how I conduct things just differently so

27
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see if we spent even four minutes on this a little bit longer than maybe maybe normally like you take a second. Just imagine how you would have written her message to you to a client, how might you have done a better job. How might have sounded

28
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:06.570
Fire Tablet: I would have asked her, first off, I would have started the email with Hello. I hope you're doing well, you and your family are healthy, whatever, I would have shown some care to start off

29
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: A hobby, you're

30
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.710
Fire Tablet: You're in a sandwich bullshit with kindness.

31
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.440
Fire Tablet: Kindness bullshit.

32
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.130
Fire Tablet: Kindness.

33
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.790
Uh huh.

34
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.020
Fire Tablet: And the whole thing just felt utter bullshit. And just like an attack. Actually, it felt very attack.

35
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.480
Fire Tablet: I'm accustomed to.

36
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.160
Fire Tablet: Well, let me actually am

37
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello. Hello.

38
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.500
Fire Tablet: Hello. Yeah. Hope your family's doing well.

39
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.490
Fire Tablet: I'm reading this email in response to what No, actually I

40
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:52.080
Fire Tablet: Was passed down some information from bright heart staff that you had some questions about your insurance deductibles and what can I do to help you with that.

41
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.220
Okay.

42
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.420
Fire Tablet: And then also, perhaps I also needed to discuss them.

43
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:07.350
Fire Tablet: Further, some of the things that we had previously discussed and figure out where we're at and how we're going to be moving forward in making sure that payments are made.

44
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.530
Fire Tablet: Would you like to speak on the phone or via email. How can I help us.

45
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.180
Fire Tablet: Both

46
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.560
Fire Tablet: You know I would.

47
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.140
Fire Tablet: That's how I would approach it, but

48
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.720
Fire Tablet: Somewhere along those lines.

49
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see it.

50
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I could see how that would be received more collaborative, I can see

51
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:44.490
Fire Tablet: Like, I, I, as the recipient would be more inclined to want to help and do my part and meet the other person halfway. If I don't feel attacked or cornered. Okay.

52
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did you get through it to get all the way to making it here today. That means had to

53
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that.

54
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.820
Fire Tablet: I room I ruminated.

55
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.390
Fire Tablet: I've definitely ruminated. Then I started drawing

56
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.860
Fire Tablet: Then I. So what I decided was, I'm going to go ahead and send an email to the person above for the one. What's her name.

57
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.440
Fire Tablet: I forget her name.

58
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:25.950
Fire Tablet: I had originally had correspondence with her in the past. She used to be the financial person, but she's no longer the financial person.

59
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.040
Fire Tablet: I don't remember her name.

60
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.290
Fire Tablet: But I so excited, you know, should I

61
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.530
Fire Tablet: I didn't respond. The problem is, is that I responded, while I was taught

62
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.900
Fire Tablet: That, that's what I should not have done because I was essentially doing the same thing that I thought was being done to me.

63
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.910
Fire Tablet: So I was wrong.

64
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.030
Fire Tablet: On on that part Darby Darby

65
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.290
Fire Tablet: Darby now.

66
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:07.980
Fire Tablet: I reached out to Darby and I supported her the email. And my response and I asked her if it would be at all possible to just conduct business between her and I, because I feel as though

67
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.600
Fire Tablet: The correspondence between me and the other lady is

68
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.910
Fire Tablet: It's taxing and it's not healthy for me. The whole point of this program is to grow into better and

69
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:32.460
Fire Tablet: And when every, every single time I've communicated with her. She causes me stress and anger. I understand that she has a job to do. I really, really respect that.

70
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:42.480
Fire Tablet: But there's a way to do it. There's a way to communicate with people, there's a way to approach people and each and every time I don't feel like I'm being

71
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:51.510
Fire Tablet: Approached with respect. I feel like I'm being attacked. And I have to go through a third person to try to make communication happen in a healthy way. So,

72
00:07:52.350 --> 00:08:03.570
Fire Tablet: I tried. I forwarded to Darby, I asked her if I could please, in the future, communicate with her. I'm happy to make payments on the past few balance. I understand that it's there. I am very aware of it.

73
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.270
Fire Tablet: And I am doing everything that I can and will continue to do everything that I can't

74
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.690
Fire Tablet: I'm not just going to back out, you know, I'm also getting something out of this.

75
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.580
Fire Tablet: But I, I didn't receive a response from either one of them so

76
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw note, I must have written it so got to see what I'm in here client seeing Dr. Tracy Jackson next week.

77
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Was. Did you see her.

78
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I did. Okay. And what was your got a scratchy face what happened.

79
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.430
Fire Tablet: She's a nice lady.

80
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.050
Fire Tablet: I felt very clinical very I don't trust her.

81
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.340
Okay.

82
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.270
Fire Tablet: I don't trust her. And I'm not comfortable really telling her

83
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.500
Fire Tablet: Things.

84
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.860
Fire Tablet: I did feel I did feel supported

85
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.260
Fire Tablet: In regard to

86
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.010
Fire Tablet: That my pain.

87
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:26.280
Fire Tablet: Is not because I often feel like people always think that pain is psychological and yes, I do have psychological pain and I know that

88
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:38.310
Fire Tablet: But if you physically touch it, I can physically touch where it hurts and somebody else can physically touch it and cause me pain that tells me that I have a physical pain.

89
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.510
Fire Tablet: Okay, and I did feel like

90
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.710
Fire Tablet: She understood both manners, for me, or at least at the very least she tried to

91
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.630
Fire Tablet: She's new to me. So I'm going to be

92
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.400
Fire Tablet: Naturally, very cautious and

93
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.980
Fire Tablet: I'm not going to just feed into

94
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.430
Fire Tablet: To it. Do you know what I mean. Does that make sense.

95
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do moving forward with her. Is there you to schedule more services, what's, what's the plan.

96
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: At heart.

97
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:25.470
Fire Tablet: I'm supposed to go back again i i'm not trying to do her group one time. See how it goes. Okay, I

98
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:36.780
Fire Tablet: Really don't like group, but I'm going to give it a shot. And if it goes well, I will try it, maybe once a month, but I'm not going to do it like my goal isn't really

99
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.800
Fire Tablet: I see a pain doctor

100
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.590
Fire Tablet: And

101
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.660
Fire Tablet: I like the psychological aspects of working on pain. I absolutely do. But

102
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.980
Fire Tablet: I feel like my pain on the psychological end

103
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.040
Fire Tablet: Is being worked on with you.

104
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just see if I'm hearing you correctly, what's the name of the doctor who's treating

105
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The back

106
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.390
Fire Tablet: Pain doctor rivers.

107
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what is Dr. Rivers doing to address pain management treatment.

108
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.860
Fire Tablet: Well, he put in the spinal simulator.

109
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I haven't been able to go back

110
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:29.400
Fire Tablet: And see him because of I actually had an appointment, but it was during this whole Kovac thing. So it got canceled.

111
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.340
Fire Tablet: On regarding my migraines. I just saw that doctor last week and they put me on migraine meds.

112
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.890
Fire Tablet: That's also a pain. Doctor, but specifically for neurological brain.

113
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:58.530
Fire Tablet: So I was able to see that doctor and get pain migraine medication because I get some really gnarly migraines and then my the doctor rivers. The one I'm supposed to see

114
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:13.020
Fire Tablet: I need to see him, but he's the one that's dealt with all my foot drop the one that's dealt with my spinal cord injury from beginning to end, he knows my spine very, very well and

115
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:27.630
Fire Tablet: He, he's suggesting another spinal surgery on my lower lumbar spine, try to open up a pathway for my spinal nerves, because they're all pinched and collected between

116
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.850
Fire Tablet: Wrong areas.

117
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.380
Fire Tablet: You know, I'm also working on weight loss and strengthening my core

118
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.260
Fire Tablet: And everything that he has suggested I do so.

119
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.900
Fire Tablet: But as for the psychological portion. I feel like

120
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.010
Fire Tablet: A lot of that.

121
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:04.020
Fire Tablet: I work on with you and I don't even realize that I'm doing it, but it's happening because I

122
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:12.030
Fire Tablet: Find myself reading through not just frustrating moments or overwhelming moments, but also through pain.

123
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk a little bit about I

124
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.210
Fire Tablet: Do feel like, oh, go ahead.

125
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about

126
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: how this came about. To begin with, how is it that you would you scheduled an appointment with Dr. Tracy Jackson. Where did that come from. You already getting it because you have a physician here. Dr Arielle you have Dr. Rivers is addressing the pain, I'm assuming, Dr. Rivers is not prescribing

127
00:13:45.300 --> 00:14:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So you you have your Ma te so that's medication assisted treatment that's your upright heart health, then you have a specific pain management doctor, Dr. Rivers and you have psychotherapy with me, how did Tracy Jack's How did Tracy Jackson get involved in your life. How did that happen.

128
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:08.220
Fire Tablet: Oh, dark real we just did it. Okay, meet with her because I've never met with her. Okay.

129
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if it was a matter of the two of you sitting just even one sentence more or two sentence more

130
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Really getting clear that you were already under the care of a specific pain management doctor. I wonder if that would have done the trick that somehow that information and I could be wrong.

131
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.110
Fire Tablet: Because now I'm still going to be my full

132
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going outside my lane right now. So I'm just doing some investigation and asking

133
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I did agree to it, though.

134
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:49.800
Fire Tablet: Oh, I'm up for suggestion. I'm up for doctor, I think that really all she's trying to dr brielle in her case she's trying to get me help in any way that she can get me help.

135
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.860
Fire Tablet: And that's what I definitely took from that.

136
00:14:54.210 --> 00:15:04.860
Fire Tablet: But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to work in my benefit and that's how I do kind of walking away from that appointment is that this isn't really something that I want to pursue

137
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.690
Fire Tablet: Okay, but

138
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:12.570
Fire Tablet: But I did tell her I'd give it a try. Because I do that to please people

139
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to continue to see Dr. Tracy Jackson, or do you want to just return to the care that you're getting

140
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.220
Fire Tablet: I want to return to the care that I'm doing.

141
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.450
So,

142
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like to see you once a month in Group, I would like to at least get that more. So that little crumb that I get to see

143
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is in this social setting where I get to be a witness to really profound progress that I can see in your comfort. Now, I don't know what the internal experience is like for you but outwardly. I see a difference in how you present in group over these years, I can see the difference.

144
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So I won't begin. Yeah.

145
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:07.620
Fire Tablet: I'm going to continue to go to group. Um, I think I, I don't know when my prescriptions do, but I'd like to attend that week that my prescriptions do that's usually what I tried to do

146
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:08.940
Fire Tablet: Let me

147
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's next my

148
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.120
Fire Tablet: Open I'll be either what

149
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The result is the reason I say it is because I must have I wrote it, you know, I take my pencil whenever we talk like this and I scribble it down. Now, if I'm wrong, then

150
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.370
Fire Tablet: No, no.

151
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's only based on pencil mark so it doesn't mean it's a fact. It's just I wrote it down. That's all I can be sure of.

152
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But I did, I wrote down, let

153
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.620
Fire Tablet: Me. Let me put that in my calendar so I don't forget.

154
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it also like a new look on your record and see when you were lasting growth.

155
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can kind of tear

156
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.800
Fire Tablet: Right.

157
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.580
Fire Tablet: Yeah yeah cuz I remember saying, May, the fourth be with you. Yeah.

158
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you are lasting group march 30

159
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.280
Fire Tablet: Okay, so that will work perfect

160
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.730
Fire Tablet: It's that one right yeah

161
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I say I'm assuming that that is good for you. And I will tell you though.

162
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I all this week. I have had my, I have a new group Tuesday at 12 which is brand new. I've only had had it twice, and my 11 o'clock on Thursdays have been purely

163
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Aside from the medication check in, they have been process groups which you've seen

164
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: an inkling of

165
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But they were they were real process group, which means

166
00:17:50.280 --> 00:18:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: A particular client shared something they're going on. And some of it was directly that really powerful. Actually, it's been a couple weeks. I think I'm starting to see that it's possible to do in a half hour.

167
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And. And anyway, my point is

168
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You might end up benefiting from if you want, and can go to a different one. It mean you'd have new faces or not. Some people move

169
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But it also might mean that you're being witness to people that are actually doing psychotherapy in a group setting where they're talking about. This is how I'm feeling right now and it's interacting either

170
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's with something. The doctor had just said. One of them was really powerful.

171
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm still a therapist might be something one person sharing a story and what's coming up for them as they're listening and talking directly to each other. So it was a great deal. This week has been more of a process group where it's not just me up here, psycho educating

172
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.360
Fire Tablet: Is one on Tuesday, you said

173
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That one. Oh yeah, there's a brand new one and I had it twice. It's at noon.

174
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.780
Fire Tablet: I can do that one. So let's do that. I'll just take the

175
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.910
Fire Tablet: Fourth one off.

176
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.870
Fire Tablet: Okay, and I will do the fifth instead

177
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that going to throw off your medication or you is that going to

178
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.800
Fire Tablet: Be a problem. No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

179
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great. So here's what because I think you I think you'd like that.

180
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:26.610
Fire Tablet: Oh,

181
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.240
Fire Tablet: 11

182
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.980
Or 12

183
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

184
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird

185
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Pink.

186
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Green. Oh.

187
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: 12 o'clock. Now I say that, but what could end up happening is

188
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly Monday was amazing. It was this amazing process group all my, you know, all these folks that are only there every couple weeks or every three weeks were there and it was very clinical

189
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was a process group too. So they're they're starting to the folks that have been here a minute are starting to trust one another and it's starting to evolve into the ability to be able to actually talk directly to each other. So I'm excited to see the difference.

190
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But a real process group is about an hour and a half. So it's a lot to ask of 2030 minutes

191
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the best we can with what we've got. So just throwing it out there, you may decide to go on Monday at one also. I've been seeing them do process work in there as well. So anyway, let's go over to some of how you've been healing around the work you're doing in here with me.

192
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How frequent. Are you having nightmares.

193
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.110
Fire Tablet: Since we started talking about the song.

194
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.330
Fire Tablet: A lot more frequently.

195
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was your last one.

196
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.590
Fire Tablet: It was the day before yesterday.

197
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.630
Fire Tablet: And it wasn't like a replay of like an old event.

198
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.070
Fire Tablet: It was like

199
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.380
Fire Tablet: a replay of an old event, but a new event as an adult.

200
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

201
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

202
00:21:45.870 --> 00:22:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's pretty common to have intruding thoughts come up doing this. Cmdr. That's sort of what it's good at is pulling up fragments that normally are tucked away that are isolated from the rest of our

203
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Our lives. Other neural networks. So it doesn't surprise me that that's happening, doesn't mean it's pleasant, but

204
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how much do you have an interest to take just that dream content and do a little bit of work with that.

205
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.970
Fire Tablet: Okay, okay.

206
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's about a replay of some of it was factual. Some of it was literally like, yes, this happened and then of course the imagination of the right brain starts to twist weird things into into dreams.

207
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you share a little bit about what the dream was

208
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.100
Fire Tablet: Yeah.

209
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.010
Fire Tablet: So,

210
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.230
Fire Tablet: I was

211
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.820
Fire Tablet: Like I know grown a grown woman. And I remember

212
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:10.080
Fire Tablet: We were at the hospital and I think it was at the hospital because that's the last place that I saw him after so long is when my mom died.

213
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.930
Fire Tablet: So it was like a hospital rooms.

214
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.810
Fire Tablet: And I'm walking down the hospital Hall.

215
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.480
Fire Tablet: And

216
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.930
Fire Tablet: He comes out of the doorway.

217
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:36.060
Fire Tablet: And I look down when I walk but I'm looking down and looking down, and I look up for a second. And I see him and I stopped and I turn around.

218
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:49.500
Fire Tablet: Walk away, but then he's like, close enough to grab my arm. But when I when I looked up. He was further away, but he grabbed my arm, and he pulled me into the room.

219
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.800
Fire Tablet: And I'm an adult.

220
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.820
Fire Tablet: And then he said,

221
00:23:59.610 --> 00:23:59.910
Fire Tablet: That

222
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.120
Fire Tablet: He said,

223
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.320
Fire Tablet: Let's, let's do the same way.

224
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.210
Fire Tablet: And

225
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.840
Fire Tablet: He had this stupid look on his face.

226
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.050
Fire Tablet: And

227
00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:39.180
Fire Tablet: I was

228
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.460
Fire Tablet: Scared.

229
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.060
Fire Tablet: Yeah. And then I don't

230
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.640
Fire Tablet: I just like I remember being on the bed and pushed onto the bed.

231
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.140
Fire Tablet: And then like a fragment.

232
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:04.320
Fire Tablet: So I have a really bad trigger of people putting their hands over their mouth and talking through their hands.

233
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.140
Fire Tablet: It really bothers me. And that happened in the dream.

234
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: He had his hand over his mouth or over yours.

235
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:14.940
Fire Tablet: Or him my mouth.

236
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:28.260
Fire Tablet: over you. And so, it brought back that oh god so anytime like somebody puts even kids or like when they're playing around with, like, you know, or they do it to themselves, it triggers me

237
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.250
Yep.

238
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.840
Fire Tablet: And

239
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.750
Fire Tablet: He did that in the dream.

240
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.470
Fire Tablet: And then

241
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.550
Fire Tablet: I don't remember very much more what happened. I just remember

242
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.010
Fire Tablet: That

243
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.570
Fire Tablet: McKenna came in.

244
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: came into the room was this in the dream.

245
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:03.780
Fire Tablet: Yes.

246
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. How did you feel. Do you remember the feeling, either in your body, or as an emo

247
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.500
Fire Tablet: Hair share fucking terror.

248
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: When mechanic came into the room.

249
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.960
Fire Tablet: Yeah, sheer fucking terror and I woke up and I was really, really, really upset.

250
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Read crying.

251
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.430
Yeah.

252
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:37.020
Fire Tablet: But I woke up and started crying. I wasn't crying like in my sleep I understood that I was yelling and then I was very stressed and he and he like gently woke me up.

253
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

254
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're crying, what happened between

255
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You and your husband right there.

256
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.090
Fire Tablet: He just helped me

257
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:10.800
Fire Tablet: He held nature of that I was yeah I made sure that I was okay. He just said that I'm safe. I didn't really go into detail of what I dreamt about we just knew that I was not. Okay.

258
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long did it take you to regulate off.

259
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:28.110
Fire Tablet: I didn't like you're late for very long time. Excellent to work and I was really, really stressed out.

260
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:46.560
Fire Tablet: I had a migraine. I got my blood pressure went so high, and I got really, I was just so upset. I think that's what caused my migraine and brought on the migraine and I was ruminating on it all night, along with my migraine. I came home and I went to bed.

261
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:55.680
Fire Tablet: And I couldn't sleep like I was having a lot of trouble sleeping, and I kept waking up because

262
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.450
Fire Tablet: I think I was trying to avoid sleeping, to be quite honest.

263
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.570
Fire Tablet: And it continued on throughout the day.

264
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have an idea.

265
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.320
Fire Tablet: I learned to work.

266
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:21.870
Fire Tablet: And I got distracted last night because we were doing that weapons testing so that helped

267
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.880
Fire Tablet: But I feel really exhausted by it.

268
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think maybe what we'll do is we'll put a little bit of time between the next

269
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: One let's let's continue to go slowly around this. But let's do some other work with it.

270
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do

271
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: More dream work where it's more Gestalt Therapy type of thing where we'll, we'll take a look at

272
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me tell you one theory about dreams.

273
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: One theory.

274
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yours is so specific to actual trauma history that I don't want you to misinterpret what I'm about to say. So some of what you just did was, remember

275
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that was real.

276
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And it got morphed into things that are not real, you'd agree with those two things both it was real and some of its not real. They morph as your mind tries to settle into how it's going to remember this.

277
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And how you're going to live with it. So it's trying to settle on something, some sort of summary. Where are we going to land. And so it keeps bringing that stuff up and

278
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I with this work and pulling it up you know you're working very hard.

279
00:29:47.190 --> 00:30:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So this that I'm about to explain to you. It doesn't is intending not to minimize the fact that some of this was it actually happened. So, at no point do we want you to think I'm saying it didn't happen. It happened. Okay.

280
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so now I'm going to tell you the way in general, one approach of analyzing dreams is that I take

281
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's only a technique. It's not to minimize history. It's a technique. So, so we're differentiating this fact really happen, but this is dream work. This is dream analysis. So one way that I do work with dreams is

282
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I work with that room that that sort of room that you have that safe space. I work in there. And we have some some positive experience with with some of the elements of the characters and experience of that dream. The details of it.

283
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one way. And that's probably the way that I would say would probably benefit today. The other one is probably not going to appeal to you.

284
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is, um,

285
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Every single character in there represents us

286
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And that part, you probably don't want to do and the way it has

287
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.260
Fire Tablet: Understand what do you mean

288
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I yeah so um

289
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say I'm afraid of snakes, which I am I don't like spiders. I'm not a big fan. You know, that's pretty typical most people are afraid of those because they they know that whether they can be venomous, and how do I know if this one is and they're kind of creepy. So, um,

290
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If I have a dream about a snake.

291
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: My therapist might say, okay, well, you know, what are you doing, and how do you feel being you. Oh yeah, I can see it was this Asian so I look like this. Help helping me and then I will also be the snake.

292
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do I want us to sneak

293
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.830
Fire Tablet: Like this.

294
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I didn't think you i. So, so notice that I said I did a lot of sort of preparation and describing that it's a technique.

295
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.560
Fire Tablet: And it isn't for everyone. I would be him.

296
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we won't do that one. But I want you to know that it's there, doesn't mean someday you may say, I want to know what that is. I want to understand what that is.

297
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.000
Fire Tablet: What I'm really curious about it though.

298
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.370
Fire Tablet: Okay, yeah, I am curious.

299
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, okay, um, we won't do it. But yes, the snake you know the the thing that you are threatened by you are that if it's this river. If it's this car that's has no driver. If it whatever the thing every single image. And that's why this is a very distinct intervention.

300
00:32:51.420 --> 00:33:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And it isn't for everyone. And you know, I, I'm certainly participating, whether I think it's clinically recommended or not. And I don't think it is right now for you, but I want you to know that it is one that I do use with people.

301
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And it comes. It's so departs from the normal way of thinking about how the world works, that it can have a pretty transformative effect, who on earth would ever

302
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you did. Right. I don't want to be the perpetrator how I, how could you ask me to do that. I don't identify like no and but all it is is just a conversation. It's just sitting with

303
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what does this character in this dream want, what is it, what's it like to be that that creature that snake.

304
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And some interesting things can happen. That's not what we're going to do, but it's out there. And so we're other theories. And so our other techniques about dream work. I like the one for you, with your room.

305
00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I like the one with your safe room because you get push the image is far away all the way into outer space or further galaxies away you get to put

306
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The villain as far away as you want.

307
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:25.590
Fire Tablet: But the other one. So you've done that with me with the chair right when I switch to the other chair, is that the same concept.

308
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's that is additional technique in

309
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.100
There.

310
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the same technique the empty chair is definitely a separate one

311
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, it can certainly get to our inner ego states and we can get those sort of we can bypass rationalizing intellectualizing and we can be very spontaneous, we can get to poor

312
00:34:51.870 --> 00:35:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Feelings right away if you really get immersed in the activity, but no, this thing that I was I was, um, I mentioned just now is definitely, I don't remember the name of it. It's too many years I just do it.

313
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.750
Fire Tablet: But

314
00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.120
Fire Tablet: It's nothing. I have

315
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.380
Fire Tablet: Done.

316
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:10.980
Uh huh.

317
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:29.460
Fire Tablet: I don't know if that's because being victimized is I have tried to think of why he is the way that he is and almost try to sympathy or pity for him is is that different from this

318
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's different.

319
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I don't know that that that's really the the destination. I don't think that's the destination. It's not one that I have in mind. That's not my intent, it's not

320
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.530
Fire Tablet: I think I was kind of more with my mom.

321
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah with mom, we can have compassion with maybe her

322
00:35:52.290 --> 00:36:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Her failed childhood herself, maybe, you know, she may have indeed been sexually abused herself and then didn't have the register to be able to protect her own children, and then sort of pass this generation.

323
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a failure to protect down another generation to you. That's pretty common to have that intergenerational it just keeps passing down again and again and that might be helpful with with your mom. But no, my, my, I'm definitely not not trying to move you to a position of

324
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Justifying

325
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The perpetrators behavior. I definitely am not trying to lead you there.

326
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:42.780
Fire Tablet: I think it was also like she wanted me to try to understand that.

327
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.810
Fire Tablet: He was her son and

328
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.030
Fire Tablet: He probably experienced trauma to and

329
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.180
Fire Tablet: It was almost like I would say it to pacify her

330
00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.170
Uh huh.

331
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's I think what's really important right now is that that not be the focus that

332
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Rabbit vacation justification. If that were to come if it, if it arrives at all, would be down the line. First you first you first you

333
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are taking care of not other so I don't want that part I think first it's making sure you have done healing that you need to

334
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That other stuff. If it falls in line, great. If not, whatever, but right here that the focus again be

335
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Your healing. You're talking about informations coming up into the conscience conscious that wasn't there quite as often and this work that we're doing probably contributed to it's kind of surfacing again.

336
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

337
00:37:54.870 --> 00:38:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're, we've taken some time and talked. I want to be careful. I don't know that we can go too deeply into it with the time that we have, we can kind of stay and stay sort of on the surface of it a little bit.

338
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't go too deeply into it. So why don't I talk a little bit about what we may do next time.

339
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: We might do something like this, you're in your in your room.

340
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Safe with everything you need, and you'll do more will have more magic exactly what you need to feel safe and this imagery that you have

341
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll work through

342
00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: In the safety of your room.

343
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And he'll be as far away as you need.

344
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:43.830
Fire Tablet: And as you feel safer.

345
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.090
Fire Tablet: For the green

346
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.870
Uh huh.

347
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.430
Fire Tablet: Okay.

348
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.180
Yeah.

349
00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.640
Fire Tablet: So like exposure there.

350
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:51.780
Uh huh.

351
00:38:53.100 --> 00:39:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But in in the safety of your resources and feeling grounded and the piece of you'll tell me, you'll say, oh, you know, on getting flooded and then we can pull back a little bit to the degree that you, you know, because we don't want to be at the 8090 of distress. We want to be down

352
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We still need to be meaningful, otherwise it's sort of won't have the learning experience of really

353
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: meaningful change, but I'm that flooding when you're not going to remember things. Well, it'll just be react very traumatizing i'd really don't want you that stressed out want it or lower. So, um, I don't think we can pull that off in 10 minutes

354
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

355
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to, um, other things, though, like how that dream, what it means to you or what

356
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: how it impacts what you know relationship with with your husband or your kids or maybe just sort of stay a little further couple layers out

357
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.960
Fire Tablet: For me, I didn't really think about me.

358
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.990
Fire Tablet: It was like

359
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.030
Fire Tablet: second nature to be forced to do

360
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.970
Fire Tablet: Things that he wants me to do.

361
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.760
Fire Tablet: But my real threat came when she walked in the room.

362
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:30.240
Fire Tablet: That it made me sick to my stomach. When I woke up, I just felt

363
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:31.830
Fire Tablet: Like

364
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:46.350
Fire Tablet: I think that's my greatest fear because like you said, passing it on to generation to generation. That is my biggest fear. I don't want that to happen to my children, my son or my daughter.

365
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:52.920
Fire Tablet: I don't want them to have the things that happened to me happened to them and live the way that I live.

366
00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And so again going to to just from Psycho education. This is just psycho educational just to talk about that the body can be stuck in the mobility of

367
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not being able to move and not being able to take action and so that the destination.

368
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, my goal. Anyway, and I have to work out with you and see if that we both agree on the same goal, but because I am, I am. I'm telling you what it is and that is

369
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That there be a reprocessing where you actually do push him away and you can feel in your body. The pushing away and remember I told you months ago I said, Boy, I wish I was there. I wish we could do this, the somatic

370
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Work where you're literally pushing and you can feel the muscles doing it.

371
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.080
Fire Tablet: We should give it a try.

372
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, a vote. We need your mood need your husband there to pull that off. That's the thing. So

373
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll do it. Okay.

374
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what that pieces. So notice how right there's a lot of moving parts. There's your body that remembers right there's this incomplete unsettled sort of memory and your relationship with what you will do and won't do to protect

375
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself from being victimized and therefore your daughter. You know, there's all these moving pieces.

376
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And can't do them all in one session, we can't do it all at once. But these interventions, the ones that we are doing are getting at the core, you're working very hard at it. But it does mean it's going to be kind of rough here for a little bit.

377
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning those nightmares might come in.

378
00:42:50.220 --> 00:43:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I do have a an invitation. Now before you go to bed right before you go to sleep to set an intention when you meet your dream life instead of not wanting to fall asleep.

379
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I would really invite you to get grounded in your grounding resources of protection and nurturing

380
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And in wisdom breathing deeply into it that sort of prayer, meditation that blending of clarity and truth.

381
00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And to have a sort of intention of embodiment when

382
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That perpetrator shows up in the dream.

383
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And just to see if you can indeed.

384
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at in the eye. Can you turn and face it.

385
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: With

386
00:43:48.300 --> 00:44:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we've got this dog as a protector and you've got me and I am not sure what you're, you know, this nature of innocence of nurturing wisdom, maybe from your children kind of forgetting exactly what the blending is

387
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But you, you go, you're going to sleep.

388
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's no good if you mess with sleep you're going to be messing with everything else your body the migraine. The pain physical pain, irritability, with family, now you're arguing. Now you're in worst pain more psychological distress irritable at work. If you mess with your sleep.

389
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just an immediate marker that other things could kind of start going sideways so I don't I don't want you to have a disrupted sleep.

390
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So as you. I mean, so just as I'm saying it what came up for you as an idea about how you can set this really grounding loving presence.

391
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.470
Fire Tablet: It happened. So I was just thinking about sitting on the edge of my bed and taking some deep breaths.

392
00:44:54.270 --> 00:45:03.060
Fire Tablet: And it's like, essentially the dog, and I don't think like the kids are at the door and you're with the dog.

393
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:10.530
Fire Tablet: And you guys are like tucking in it's time to lay down and get some rest. And we got you. You're okay.

394
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:17.040
Fire Tablet: You know, we'll keep an eye out. You just get some sleep. This time around, you know,

395
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:19.560
Fire Tablet: And then

396
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:29.910
Fire Tablet: I just

397
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.290
Fire Tablet: Don't know if that's appropriate though. It's kind of weird.

398
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.860
Fire Tablet: But my mom used to like

399
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.900
Fire Tablet: Very few times that she was nurturing

400
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:53.520
Fire Tablet: On she was really sleepy to she would run her fingers through my hair into it took it behind my ear. She was just like

401
00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:01.140
Fire Tablet: Yeah, just keep doing that, but I don't imagine my mom doing that. I imagine you doing that. And I know but

402
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. So, um, I would say doing that right doing that before you go to bed and nervous.

403
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And picturing the animal your pet your dog right next to the bed.

404
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and just feeling it and doing that.

405
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And being very present in that room with the magic of safety right really making sure that anchor room you're in it.

406
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And that if there is any of that negative shadow side that shows up and it can be a lot of different symbols straight up be him. But it could be some symbolize to that it is outside the door.

407
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are inside the room.

408
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have the magic to immediately be in it. It takes no effort at all and that he is outside

409
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're inside

410
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And that going to sleep with that.

411
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And that you will meet that shadow each time.

412
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Like just being safe inside the room.

413
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And seeing if

414
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your Unconscious will let you do that.

415
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And let that be a way to go to sleep, set the intention. If I need a shadow a dark right something of Mal intent, will I know just what to do. I know exactly where I'll be it'll be over there and I will be safe in the room.

416
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: With my dog and with the presence of nurturing and protection and wisdom and just this even this tactile experience of this tender sort of touch.

417
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

418
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see what happens.

419
00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. You're another one. Yeah. Journal some stuff if you want to. If you're up anyway.

420
00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be curious to know, because the more details. We know the more right we can sort of access. What's going on back there and that unconscious years

421
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your opinion about what your dreams are up to. What do you think

422
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.750
Fire Tablet: My dreams.

423
00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:34.080
Fire Tablet: Trying to I think my, I'm afraid. And I think it's just playing out in my brain because

424
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:44.220
Fire Tablet: Talking about this stuff that we've been talking about brings up that feeling that I felt

425
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:46.650
Fire Tablet: That feeling

426
00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:59.250
Fire Tablet: Was still there, even in the dream. And I remember that feeling very, very clearly it's fear and discuss and shame.

427
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:00.930
Fire Tablet: And

428
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.350
Fire Tablet: Pain.

429
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.920
Fire Tablet: And I felt that in the dream.

430
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:09.360
Yeah.

431
00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pull back to just regular neurotic thinking just a regular some lady up in some privileged well off neighborhood who. The only thing she has to worry about is that her hair dresser and manicurist isn't meeting with her weekly

432
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

433
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain is still going to do that that same thing which is it's going to worry, it's going to say, hey, you're not ready for this.

434
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to do, what are you going to do if you don't have your nails and what were your friends think it'll be just awful. You'll be judged and they won't think that you have your shit together.

435
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I went ridiculous. I know you went there with me for a second. Thank you for that. Now come back to you.

436
00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain.

437
00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Is saying, hey, are you know what to do if you're met with this villain again.

438
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you made a decision. Do you know what to do. Are we ready. Do we know what to do.

439
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

440
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It wants clarity and wants to know, you got this. You got this.

441
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it's it's there to heal. It's there to serve you. It's going to happen anyway, no matter how what history, you have the brain is always going to be on the alert for your

442
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in danger. It's just going to automatically do that no matter how much privilege, you have and whatever. So

443
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be useful for you to do right that exposure works so that you can reassure the unconscious. You've met the shadow and you kicked its ass.

444
00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see it.

445
00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It, it needs to. You've got to be able to say to what I've already met and I'm okay. I'm okay. I know my resources and, indeed, I'm making you you you are right now you're

446
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay. You made it through that.

447
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you are okay.

448
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sitting

449
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: In in real

450
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You are. I'm looking now are you

451
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: without injury. Now you've been injured.

452
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are okay and that is key.

453
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To be with. I am okay after all. I am okay and I will be okay.

454
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This unconscious of yours.

455
00:51:54.750 --> 00:52:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is testing that and it would be good if we could get the unconscious to kind of buy in that you are okay and that you you know how to protect you. You know how to protect

456
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The child, you'll know what to do. And so let's see if we can do that in the unconscious. Let's see if we can do that as well there. And then I'm guessing that dream life will change.

457
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:27.030
Fire Tablet: So we did some government to do that next week.

458
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well it all depends on what you show up with. I can't promise it but that's the plan.

459
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hey, if you come back and you're like,

460
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: No of course we're not going to do that. Well, whatever you present with full address. But yes, you want to a few say yep

461
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And look at this and I don't know what you're going to come back with maybe you'll, you'll have some information about something you saw

462
00:52:53.280 --> 00:53:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe in a journal throughout the week from from this invitation as you start to go to sleep with this intention in your mind. I don't know what you'll come back to me with you might have something that might shift, what we do.

463
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:05.970
Fire Tablet: Okay.

464
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:07.770
Fire Tablet: All right.

465
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So, same time different Friday.

466
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:19.410
Fire Tablet: Yes, I'll be there. And then I'll be in in group on Tuesday.

467
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Um,

468
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I can't promise if it turns out I'm the one that has to sort of bring up a topic and I might because this one kind of has a nice fluidity.

469
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be on the topic. If you want to advance notice of radical acceptance. So I have it as a little sticky so my guess is if if it isn't about sort of what clients are going through in the moment, it might be on the topic of radical acceptance.

470
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a pretty

471
00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:57.960
More with that.

472
00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

473
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:00.960
Fire Tablet: I got to figure it out.

474
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Next Tuesday.

475
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, all right. You be good to you. Okay.

476
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.910
Fire Tablet: Okay, you have a wonderful weekend and I will see you on Tuesday.

477
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds good. Bye bye.

478
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:17.100
Bye bye.
