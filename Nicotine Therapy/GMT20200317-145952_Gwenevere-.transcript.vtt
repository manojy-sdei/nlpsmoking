00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about inter personally and that means talking to another person.

42
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What's something that can irritate interpersonal

Gwenevere Abriel: Go around.

46
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Good conversations with your children can be

47
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.630
Galaxy A10e: More my son just told me send me my birth certificate for and get my license and kind of find out the lighting never even sent it.

48
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.960
Galaxy A10e: Should really pissed me off.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.830
Galaxy A10e: Was want to call the customer.

50
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
Galaxy A10e: When was that yesterday's FOOTBALL YESTERDAY.

51
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.570
Galaxy A10e: Just because I get my license back now and I did my first have kidney at it. He sent me a thing as a hey I need that instead of me having to go get one.

52
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.800
Galaxy A10e: Hey, all the government places are closed down. Huh.

53
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. So earlier I asked you if you had any irritation. You said then that that irritated me

54
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we found something when we continue talking it kind of can can come forward a little bit.

55
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.840
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

56
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And your solution was

57
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I could call them and tell them off.

58
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.100
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, but

59
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not

60
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.430
Galaxy A10e: Yes.

61
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.870
Galaxy A10e: Or no

62
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.720
Galaxy A10e: Or, you know, surely piss me off that she really pissed me off that he did that to me. Like why would he lie to me like that.

63
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not a fortune teller. I can't give

64
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.180
Galaxy A10e: You the liar. I didn't think it was a liar like that and

65
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you written him off as a liar. At this point,

66
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.450
Galaxy A10e: Yeah. Now I know you like, you like that.

67
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know that he

68
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.620
Galaxy A10e: My daughter called me and told me that he never sent you that he lied.

69
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So he caught. He had said, I put it in the mail.

70
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.400
Galaxy A10e: Sorry already mailed it off to you. Okay, then my daughter called me yesterday and said is let you know keep nurse of the. I was like,

71
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not, why not your daughter is a liar.

72
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Why can't the donor be a liar.

73
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.860
Galaxy A10e: Yeah LDC NGO

74
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.420
Galaxy A10e: What

75
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.820
Galaxy A10e: It was all day. She called me lying to me about the

76
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But he was

77
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.800
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, he told she just told me the story of why he didn't send it that he was busy and he just lied to me. Okay.

78
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that right there. Remember that list that just this concept of why would he do it. Why would he do it. Why would he do it right.

79
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember that list of

80
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember them in your colon if behaviors list.

81
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember that list.

82
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.240
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I do. Yeah, we wrote it all down our answers.

83
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

84
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember any of them.

85
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.290
Galaxy A10e: No.

86
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: No one expects a pop quiz from their therapist, you know,

87
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Like we just talked about now talking about feelings is a little bit more appealing, isn't it.

88
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just, I'm going to pull this list up to see if I can find it and trigger trigger the memory here. I think it's kind of relevant

89
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You all these icons are too small.

90
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:14.820
Galaxy A10e: To

91
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.840
Dude,

92
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Little documents.

93
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

94
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: clicked it

95
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:31.500
Oh,

96
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go.

97
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think people manipulate, just in general.

98
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.210
Galaxy A10e: Oh, no.

99
00:08:47.220 --> 00:09:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. But it's not just get what we want. Because look, please can you take your headphones off. Wait, don't do it. I'm just giving an example. Please can you take your headphones off, I want to look at your ears. I want to watch the color as it changes.

100
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel in your head.

101
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.430
Galaxy A10e: No.

102
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.720
Okay, so

103
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I don't assume that you don't want to do it. I just asked directly, notice

104
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't just to get what we want. There's another ingredient to that recipe.

105
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the other piece.

106
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: As you do, you know, they probably don't want it to. And they don't wanna do it okay get what you want from others, even when the others are not willing to initially to give it to you.

107
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a reason dishonesty dishonest to get people to do or act in a way which they might not have freely chosen on their

108
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.430
Own

109
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Con people to believe that what you want them to believe it's true.

110
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: present reality, the way you want others to see it rather than the way it really is because sometimes we wear a mask. Like, I might say oh yes I'm loving and I'm so happy. But really, I'm not. I'm just

111
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but this way, I don't, I'm not ask follow up questions. I don't, I can kind of get this

112
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.350
Over with.

113
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's dishonesty right presenting reality particular way. So hide behind a mask and let people see you in an acceptable way. When in reality, you're actually feeling or acting in an unacceptable way.

114
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: maintain control and power over others, even though they think they have to have the weapon meaning to change that have the control and power.

115
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: make other people feel sorry for you.

116
00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though it would be better for them to make you accept your personal responsibility for your own actions. Hmm. Another motivator get away with not having to do things necessary to meet your obligations responsibilities and duties in life.

117
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: make other people what make others feel guilty or responsible for actions or thoughts which are yours alone get others to feel that they are responsible for your welfare, so you do not have to make a decision or take responsibility for anything that goes wrong in your life.

118
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So these are some of them play the victim by the martyr act helpless stupid incompetent act angry.

119
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is the one I'm thinking about

120
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It may not be the only one. But I'm thinking about your son right now.

121
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're calling a lie.

122
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm wondering is,

123
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's another motivation behind it.

124
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That word placate

125
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.500
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

126
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.320
Galaxy A10e: What does that mean,

127
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.620
I'm gonna find it. You see it.

128
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:19.470
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

129
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's this one I'm pretty sure it's number eight. The one I've got highlighted.

130
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a fancy word for it. I think it is. Uh huh. Uh huh.

131
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's what

132
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.410
Galaxy A10e: It means right there.

133
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, so watch vacations going to look like this.

134
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm a client and you're my therapist, it's going to be

135
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I'm gonna, you know, I'm going to do is I'm going to taper down half a milligram every week.

136
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.610
Galaxy A10e: Almost such a low dose, man.

137
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't get hung up on

138
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.940
Galaxy A10e: Guys are killing me.

139
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about grocery shopping

140
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I

141
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Love going to Costco. It's my favorite thing driving 25 minutes away. I'm happy to do it.

142
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I do it. I'll do it every week.

143
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.350
Now,

144
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.910
Do you call what I just did a lie.

145
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to get stopped. I wanted to stop talking to you.

146
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I may or may not go to Costco, but I, I know you want to hear that. I like going because I know you hate it.

147
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't actually like going myself, but I don't want to argue and I don't want to make you angry or disappointed. I just anything you want up trouble twice a week.

148
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Now to call what I'm doing a lie.

149
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.320
Galaxy A10e: Do color, like I say, if you're going to do, say you're going to do something you don't do it. It's a lie.

150
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, which ones. These that you endorsed, which means you do

151
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.240
Galaxy A10e: And I think, was he was eating.

152
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.360
Galaxy A10e: The night. Right.

153
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So you call this just now lie right

154
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't like when people lie. They don't

155
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do exactly what they say there's an inconsistency with what they're doing with what they said.

156
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.560
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

157
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Acting compliant behind the scenes really doing the opposite being non compliant.

158
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Are both of these line eight nine.

159
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.340
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

160
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what's it like to say out loud. I do this line behavior to

161
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:18.990
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

162
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it feel like to see it in yourself for just a moment.

163
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.460
Galaxy A10e: But you know what, I would never, I would never tell somebody. I'm going to send something that is indeed.

164
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so within a little longer. You jumped off that real quick, like it was a hot potato.

165
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.100
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, because I would never do that though, I will never tell you I sent off to the sides of it.

166
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But we're not talking about sending anything I'm asking sit with Evernote for just a second.

167
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it like to sit with I lie to what's it like for you, Sean with

168
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.170
Galaxy A10e: No idea.

169
00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like it either. Let me tell you what because right I'm supposed to be this honest person. I'm a therapist. How could I

170
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.880
Galaxy A10e: WANT EVERYBODY lies. Everybody does.

171
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at all the slick ways like it doesn't say just lie.

172
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: There's all these different things.

173
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: They might be serving because we're in denial, we might be unconscious of them. We're trying to protect someone's feelings. Yeah.

174
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What if there was something else going on behind the scenes with your son, hold on to it. I know your your reference standard is

175
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If I wouldn't do it. Then I hold people to the same measure. But there's other measuring sticks. There's other things to measure one's behavior by not just mine. I don't

176
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Make everyone sort of measure up to how I do things right. I kind of say is it adaptive. What is it doing kind of look behind the curtain like wonder what what they're getting out of that kind of look what's going on behind that.

177
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:00.720
Galaxy A10e: Yeah.

178
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not the reference standard

179
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're you're using. Laughter A little bit. You got a little giggle. So let's look a little closer.

180
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine ever saying to someone

181
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you want. Yeah, I'll do it because they were afraid because maybe you were afraid because you wanted to look good, because you didn't want to have an argument.

182
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Has there ever been something other going on. Besides, I'm thinking, all I'm going to do is lie to this person, like, are you, are you aware that maybe you to have had other motivations for Miss truth telling

183
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Minimizing

184
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.070
Galaxy A10e: Under requires minimizing your involvement.

185
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How about I got a great one under reporting.

186
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did some underreporting earlier. Right, let's just play with it. Play with me play a game. I said, Hey, you got any irritability said not that much.

187
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.650
Galaxy A10e: Lastly, I do my, my mom here teaching

188
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But when we looked further. Didn't you end up saying

189
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I was pissed off mad at my son.

190
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When we look a little

191
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.010
Galaxy A10e: Like laughing his ass.

192
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You. I think you're a liar.

193
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.120
Galaxy A10e: Liar.

194
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I think you're a liar. You didn't say, but you were mad, which is even more intense and irritation. Do I think you're a liar.

195
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it. You do I want to hang up on you and call you names. I do not

196
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know why.

197
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Know why it doesn't bother me.

198
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't think of it as like

199
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.740
Galaxy A10e: Wow, you don't think

200
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I look behind the curtain like this.

201
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that help you

202
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

203
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean she'll lay off show back off, she'll stop asking. I don't want to talk about my feelings. It's hard. It's uncomfortable.

204
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't how I grew up. I don't want to do this. I'm not. I know anger. I know when someone has wronged me offended me that I'm familiar with and I can really get into that we can talk about all my justifications for being right but this feeling stuff this squishy stuff.

205
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going to tell her haven't been irritable and maybe she'll back off.

206
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's my hypothesis. Why do you think you under reported to irritability over the last couple weeks.

207
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:02.640
Galaxy A10e: All i think is at the time. I'm not thinking about really what I guess about thinking I'm always here to. Yes. Yeah.

208
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you're not irritated. Now it's past its fun

209
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.140
Yeah.

210
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I don't think of you as a liar. But can you picture someone out there might call what you did miss truth.

211
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And get offended and insulted and how rude have

212
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of different ways to interpret people's behavior, right.

213
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I don't take it personally.

214
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if you have the wait. Wait for it.

215
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if it's a skill, Sean. This is

216
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You is when we're kids.

217
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're kids. You don't have this, so I'm checking to see because you're you're

218
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a man, you're, you're an adult and but it doesn't mean that we learn these skills along the way.

219
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people, especially if there's a long history of incarceration stuff, whether it's developmental trauma or hasn't been sort of a healthy caregiver, they don't teach this skill which is

220
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: People are going to do things that will offend you, on the surface.

221
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But it has nothing to do with your value. It has to do with their just dealing with whatever's going on in their head in their life and their

222
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: They just took it out on you, but it could have been someone else. It has nothing to do with you. He just happened to be in front of them when they were having their little tantrum, you just happen to be moving through their life you happen to be on the phone.

223
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: With the next person in a text exchange. It happened to be in front of them when they were in a mood. It had nothing to do with your value.

224
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That isn't how most people take that initial response of being offended disrespected insulted. That isn't what most people do if they haven't had that training when they were coming up and they were growing up, most people go to. How dare you.

225
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to prove that you're the wrong one.

226
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And off it goes.

227
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That person never learns how to learn the skill either Shawn

228
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:07.680
Galaxy A10e: And

229
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.340
Galaxy A10e: Guess what.

230
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Then they do the same thing to you. And then guess what you do. Well, now you're wrong. Well, then you're wrong. And now you're wrong. And now your will and now we have another generation.

231
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.810
Galaxy A10e: Of everybody's wrong.

232
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Having the ability

233
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: To be able to distinguish. What's your shit versus mine.

234
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever your son is going through over here if you weren't mad.

235
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be able to sit with it longer. And look, you pull aside the curtain.

236
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'd investigate

237
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You would choose curiosity over being right. You're just used to doing it this way. But there are other ways to go about that dynamic

238
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: People do what they do, Sean, you have done what you have done, I have done he, she, all of us.

239
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all we knew it's all we know it's adaptive we have come to learn this because it worked. Now at some point you're going to be measuring what's working with a different measuring stick. Now I offer some measuring sticks. Sometimes I'll say, well,

240
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's measure it with safety or intimacy or I might measure it with

241
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Rapport there might be different ways to measure, let's say relationships trust is a really important one.

242
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.320
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, um,

243
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If you measure the trust between you and your son. Instead, we just said it wasn't based on

244
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you tell the truth or don't you if let's say that measuring stick. We put it in in this little container off on the side. And instead, we're going to measure how we're doing around trust. We're going to look a relationship between myself and my son myself and my son.

245
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: How do we measure trust. Do you know I can measure trust between you and your son.

246
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:01.920
Galaxy A10e: Or we know not good.

247
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.580
Galaxy A10e: Well,

248
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:07.830
Galaxy A10e: Okay.

249
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

250
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You you had an opportunity and you know you can go back and you can do it again. Be good to go back. It isn't just like you live. It's over. And you can never be trusted again.

251
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.870
Galaxy A10e: And see, that's where I felt I felt like never calling them again.

252
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.790
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I thought so mad, but I'm gonna see my son. I love it.

253
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.020
Galaxy A10e: I'm gonna call it

254
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.790
Galaxy A10e: Well, he acted like it like I'm never gonna call us again that's I feel like

255
00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's love withdrawal, Sean. That's a painful thing to feel as a child.

256
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a last resort thing to do as a parent to pull the love away.

257
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Called a level way. Huh, what is before we don't even know him.

258
00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What's behind the curtain.

259
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What's behind the curtain. Hey, son.

260
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard you send it to get busy or just kind of tell me to tell me to do it when you really Wait, didn't have time. What's up with that now I can't say anything even close to that when I'm offended. I can't, I'm so angry true you click by

261
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I say what's behind the curtain was, I'm going to get to know him. I want to let him know he can trust me, even in this early phase, getting to know each other.

262
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:37.860
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, he just came back from California to. So I think he was out there with his girlfriend. They went to California together.

263
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:44.670
Galaxy A10e: Maybe so he was telling me when he was in California that he did send it when you did Tony did

264
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You forgot, and he wanted to tell you because he wants a relationship with you wants to look like he's compliant and a good boy.

265
00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Behind the curtain stuff you understand it's behind you look and say it's not to offend you, and dis you

266
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's not that thing. What if it's this person. He's a kid, you know, it's all about girls and immediate gratification and, do I look good feel good. What's the next one. What's the next one. What's the next one fun fun fun fun fun fun fun long term nothing about long term.

267
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, you don't have to because you're interested in long term. Do you see it. I want a relationship with my son, the Infinity to

268
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. I see what you have to. You can see it gave me login and your long term memory. I saw what you were doing all right. All right. All right y'all, check that out. Next time or two calls from now find out what's up with that.

269
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're talking about investment in long term you want to have a relationship with him long term. It's not just about this infraction, he doesn't know you

270
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:53.370
Galaxy A10e: Know he

271
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't know if you're going to lose it on him. If you say, Dad.

272
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I forgot. And I told you I did it when I really didn't and

273
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I'm so mad at you that I told you, I'm so mad at you and I have such deep resentment. I told you I did it because I want you to hurt like I heard

274
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are different conversations and they'll never happen. Click never talk to you again don't never happen. If you can't learn this skill. I'm talking about

275
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a skill. Trust me, because once you try and do it. You're gonna be like

276
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Who are rather be pissed off.

277
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's hard because your ego is going to say we're going to die if we do not prove this kid wrong. I feel like

278
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm telling you, it will feel like life or death. So, you know, I make it look easy. But let me tell you something. The moment.

279
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We're offended.

280
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.320
And somebody

281
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

282
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to want to remember that breathing. Then I'll tell you what, then

283
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.090
Galaxy A10e: Right. Totally. I got an argument that guy work ever since then, we've had a good relationship.

284
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.670
Galaxy A10e: Yes, I guess he called

285
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:19.620
Galaxy A10e: He called us some other guy before and he's all. Yeah, that guy. Did you know so i guess he thought that he's calling me brother when he called me out of a what

286
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.300
Galaxy A10e: A little. Go ahead. Alright, I'll break runners and then it was good. Really cool.

287
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.320
Galaxy A10e: Well thank you tested here so

288
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I accept that there is a piece of mail and sort of street tough culture that I will never know firsthand. I just have to own that I going to own it. But I will say there's a

289
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this there's this thing that I've watched and it's not unlike what you just described. That's pretty common throughout male relationships that they will fight and be best friends.

290
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there's something about it. And my suspicion is it has to do with the discharge has to do with the physiological you let every single bit out, you're done. There's nothing left.

291
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And women don't do that. Unfortunately we can't

292
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:16.590
Galaxy A10e: We can't

293
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like each other.

294
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.430
Galaxy A10e: Guys are crazy. Yeah, you guys, your woman to go to know low up is a woman.

295
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

296
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.400
Galaxy A10e: Was a woman or the

297
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Nasty.

298
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Nasty creatures, but

299
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.350
Galaxy A10e: No, no, we will

300
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we never get to discharge and we never get that physiological thing where we scrap it out.

301
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:47.940
Galaxy A10e: Nice to chip on my you know my wife used to do. She's the way we get in a fight that she would wait until I'm going to sleep every night he would wait till I go to sleep, unless you're waking up early to talk now.

302
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:56.910
Galaxy A10e: Draw or not gonna talk also because I'm not really talking. I've asked you all didn't talk that she would do that every single time. So we go to sleep.

303
00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, let's talk about what we just did. Number one, Sean, I want to give you props you tolerated confrontation. Just now I pressed very positive. And I did.

304
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have gotten pissed off and irritated at me. Do you know what you had to do. What skill you have to use in order to not get offended. What did you do

305
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:24.540
Galaxy A10e: With you.

306
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what you could have

307
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do, what was there that you use.

308
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: End up getting assembler

309
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.120
Galaxy A10e: Stanley

310
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You were seeking understanding. Maybe you were listening and seeking understanding is that a possibility.

311
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

312
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a skill that's the one I'm trying to teach you right now. You did it.

313
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. Remember that that phrase I use and you'll hear it lots of times and you'll roll your eyes and you'll start getting annoyed with me and be like, What are you going to stop saying

314
00:30:54.810 --> 00:31:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe it's so strongly that if I had a book that I can write it would be on this phrase shoes curiosity understanding over being right.

315
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And every chance you get

316
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll survive choose it.

317
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The massive positive impact that it has on your psychology on your ego strength watch if that was available to you as a skill when you make contact with your son.

318
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you remember it, but she

319
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.440
Galaxy A10e: Go. Soon as I hang up objection. I needed.

320
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how you did it in real time and I checked in, what should she do you said I was kind of listening trying to understand which were taught. Right. I was seeking understanding you are busy psychologically defending against what I had to say. Put the guard down long enough.

321
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To listen

322
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You thought about it. Maybe there's something to it.

323
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys may try something new. You may not right didn't remember the belly breathing your loss. I mean,

324
00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people, Sean. That's the one thing

325
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to go through years of therapy. That's the only thing they're going to remember

326
00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that powerful, it's that

327
00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.040
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I think you're the first counselor that like

328
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:34.500
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I really don't. I was one of this guy over here. And he told me to stop points I stopped going over there to watch. I don't really. I don't know.

329
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's important. Sean is

330
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To

331
00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Find what it is about me, it's less about the blend of beer, but more about the quality. What is it, is it

332
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I know myself pretty well. I know a lot of times I'm a lot more playful than many

333
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.870
Galaxy A10e: Therapists you're good, you're good at you.

334
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good at it. Okay. Yeah, well good huh. Don't you think that therapist thinks they're good. Oh my goodness. It's like high interest so much as you

335
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When

336
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.230
Galaxy A10e: You got to be going to veer the great

337
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So I, my friend calls if they go into sphere.

338
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.360
Galaxy A10e: Sphere.

339
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Sphere.

340
00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:19.890
Galaxy A10e: So,

341
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but, but the point is not a global word. It's more like member. It's the quality because you want to be a consumer, if you like yourself in here.

342
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.230
Hmm, I wasn't angry.

343
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: My heart rate wasn't running my I wasn't grinding my teeth, my stomach wasn't turning my shoulders weren't tight.

344
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I had a little smile. I was interested in curious. My mind was very focused. I liked myself for 10 minutes. Why did I like it.

345
00:33:53.430 --> 00:34:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I was around someone who just, it's not just me. You look at the qualities that are here not only what you did what you saw here.

346
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The more you can label it. Is it sense of humor. Is it about a 40% confrontation specific words that one of your doesn't say, should that ought to have to. She's not bossy. She's confrontational. She does role play being able to label them, believe it or not, Sean will mean possibly

347
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That outside in the real world, you're going to recognize them and people

348
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: In a friend in your children. Right. And you go, hmm.

349
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to spend time with them.

350
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just that simple. They are who they are and I like who I am, when I'm around them. They bring out the best in me.

351
00:34:50.850 --> 00:35:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Why wouldn't you want to be around healthy people. I think I'm melting. So I want to be around people to bring out the best in me so you become a consumer of what you recognize in here. You like yourself in here.

352
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, what am I doing what is she doing

353
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I saw it in a friend of mine. I thought maybe I'll ask him out for for for dinner one night I'll hang out with him. See if there's more that

354
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So that we start bringing into our lives toxic negative people, much like the models that we grew up with. Nope, I need to recognize maybe in the therapeutic relationship. Sometimes I'm the only one. They've got for a while where it's healthy.

355
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unconditionally accepting you threaten you want to kill me going to have to do something about that.

356
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I got a limit. I got a boundary there.

357
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.370
Galaxy A10e: As somebody every friend you

358
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.770
Galaxy A10e: Know, but

359
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm being funny, but you get it.

360
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.860
Galaxy A10e: Right, but

361
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, be a look at what you see in here. And then notice it in people.

362
00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I want you to have more and more moments where you're curious, we're having to be right.

363
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.170
Galaxy A10e: Nice. It was people

364
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.160

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I do feel pretty strongly about it, but I've learned it from you guys, because this is the one that helps the remember the fancy stuff.

366
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take, let's take irritation with Mother. Let's take that one.

367
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so she's in the other room or you want to have. It's a sound or it's whatever it is.

369
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:42.570
Galaxy A10e: No, she does what she does. This is what she really does she if you see can be sitting there, you're talking to somebody. And if you say, hey, man, I'm doing really good

370
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:51.900
Galaxy A10e: And then you're doing good that she's gonna turn on. She's gonna say something bad about you and she's a start talking trash out of nowhere. She does it all the time. Everybody's like, She's real mean like she doesn't

371

Galaxy A10e: She doesn't say I love us. Yes. Yeah, that she's a real mean he, I mean I can explain it. She's been like that my whole life.

372
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:09.780
Galaxy A10e: Then my sister told me what she's had a hard life you know because she's used to be a lot or boyfriends and husbands, whatever. What I'm telling you. She's just always had some really bad to say about everything too late. If

373
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.000
Galaxy A10e: I can't stand it.

374
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.150

407
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Choose curiosity over being right. You might remember it.

408
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:15.090
Galaxy A10e: She was curiosity over be right and understanding over being right.

409
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand over being right. I understand. Okay, so here's happening mom's being mean it's happening right now. I just remembered it. I did my breathing. I brought that arrow down to the bottom of my lungs it

410
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.640
Galaxy A10e: Pulled the Vegas break

411
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the message of the Vegas nerve. Hey, it's just my mom doing

412
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything. We're not in danger. She's just unkind. I'm okay, what's the thing I gotta remember to

413
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. Then she's being me. Do you know

414
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.200
Your next

415
00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.180
Galaxy A10e: Show is walk away.

416
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Walk away is a great one.

417
00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But it gets one. Look, I'm walking

418
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I getting any more understanding about her.

419
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.090
Galaxy A10e: No.

420
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. But first, to walk because if before we were like,

421
00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yours.

422
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Time it years about this morning. I don't know what you actually do in real time but walking away could be a great first step.

423
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.100
Galaxy A10e: But better

424
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet, don't mess with me now so

425
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't get understanding that way either.

426
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:23.460
Galaxy A10e: You know,

427
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You want her to feel the pain to my customer that doesn't get you understanding what does. And I know this is next level. If you can at least do the belly breathing and remember this phrase.

428
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a month's worth of accomplishment. I'm not kidding you can do those two things. Bam. Gold reached

429
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.320
Galaxy A10e: Your next

430
00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Next levels, this, this is the kind of level that some people are doing. They're doing this.

431
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: My hands are down. I don't have anything to defend already know what's up with her right this. I've been doing this.

432
00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I know how this is going to go, Mom, what's going on with you.

433
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Should be like a weirdo, she can walk out the room herself, something's going to change when you put your guard down

434
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's really going on.

435
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling pretty good about my success. Feeling pretty proud of it. This is hard work harder than I thought.

436
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:29.190
Galaxy A10e: And that's where she will step in and start talking right there when you're when you're talking about. You're doing good, and they'll probably start doing stuff that you that

437
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a direct contrast this is this is asking her, this is seeking understand what's going on for you, Mom. When I talk about my my success.

438
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's seeking understanding. I didn't say you're going to do it this week. You remember the belly breathing where that air goes in the long you expand here. That means our body is relaxed enough. Can you have PTSD, dude. Okay, you get hot and alerted by

439
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.980
Galaxy A10e: Potato chip bags. Yeah, yeah. She

440
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:06.570
Galaxy A10e: She really your deep end of the chips. I want to tell them, just grab a chip already bow. Yeah, I mean,

441
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have your own mean

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.380
Galaxy A10e: To rise it they don't do that again go join right now.

448
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:29.880

Gwenevere Abriel: Ain't nobody gonna hurt you with a chip, but

452
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But this experience for you is very distressing. It is very distressing for you.

453
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're certain sounds

454
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome, and that we can we can do work around that right now. I want to keep using the broken record approach and repeat, repeat, repeat,

455
00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.750
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, over the branding free

Galaxy A10e: We'll see.

465
00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about you feeling better in each day.

Galaxy A10e: Okay there you guys on lockdown over there in

467
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.020

468
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.340
Yeah.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:47.280
Galaxy A10e: Yes, we are here. Now, what about, like, God, the government shut down all the energy

471
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not a news Watcher. This way I can maintain my colleague

472
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.750
Disposition

473
00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Otherwise, I think I would be more upset. But yeah, I said, turn the news on

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:07.320
Galaxy A10e: Yeah, I turned out to watch it, too, because I've been on it's a watch. I don't, I don't really trust it is. I don't like

475
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:18.510
Galaxy A10e: Like they're just no matter what they're always in the cops. It builds a culture wrong. That's what bugs me there. The cop shoots me clearly he did wrong, you got it on video, and they'll still choose to the site.

476
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.520
Galaxy A10e: It's crazy.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're funny. So before I knew that I had set someone out on that time spot.

493
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.160
