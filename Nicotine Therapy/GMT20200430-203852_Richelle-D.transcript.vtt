00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.340
Richelle Direny: Oh,

3
00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.950
Richelle Direny: I keep forgetting to put this thing in my

4
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.820
Richelle Direny: It's a good thing, the thing so loud that when you when you talk them out here in

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.990
A right

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:31.050
Richelle Direny: Look, I was just about to send you. So the thing is we're supposed to make everyone like even though you messaged me on that you're in a virtual clinic. I said, at least like I knew

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.510
Richelle Direny: When I started, um,

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.400
Richelle Direny: I said to give it time because I know sometimes virtual training takes a little while to check over

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.850
Jessica A: One in

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.110
Jessica A: The right

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.140
Richelle Direny: Give it to you by a certain time, we'll have to sneak

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.070
Jessica A: Right, well now they've got they changed it around where they were when you come in.

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:00.840
Jessica A: They send you to somebody else and to another breakout room and I think what they're doing it because the past couple of times I've logged in.

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.840
Jessica A: Which a virtual clinic and then they've sent me to the same guy that I've dealt with.

15
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.760
Jessica A: It seemed like you're trying to break it down like

16
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.910
Jessica A: To certain people. You know what I mean.

17
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.980
Richelle Direny: So you only login with certain people

18
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:35.370
Jessica A: By which I mean I guess it makes it easier because like I asked him if he had fixed the address thing in the system. And he like immediately knew what I was talking about. I didn't have to you know re explain myself or anything. So that made it kind of butter so

19
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.520
Richelle Direny: Do you get my kids got my tricks, though, right, reminding you to it, even though I just told it to you.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.220
Jessica A: Some different sleeping Mamas and

26
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.040

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:21.990
Jessica A: You know that you could have you know some type of heart condition. She's like the the part that bothers me is, is

93
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.970
Richelle Direny: It's bad. Um, a lot of it has to do with

94
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:38.460
Richelle Direny: It's, it's something about rapid eye and a lot of tapping into like the different traumas and different situation. And I think you

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.750
Jessica A: You also have. I see.

96
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.670
Richelle Direny: Right, so depending on just kind of how you react to some of those memories.

97
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:56.250
Richelle Direny: You know, being on this platform. I wasn't really sure how it works. So I wanted to kind of have a conversation, but then Dr. Jamison also said that you guys had she had came to your group like with jargon.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:19.410
Richelle Direny: I did write email, I'll send another one to see, you know, how do they go about getting you an appointment for it.

101
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.330
Richelle Direny: If something that by sitting

102
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:33.930
Jessica A: Yeah, I mean, because, I mean, that's a lot of my, you know, I mean, I went from having my, my whole family around to not you know

103
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.770
Jessica A: Anything. Right. You know, and

104
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.440
Richelle Direny: Because you didn't have to. You see you and you have a system right and you don't really have a good relationship with your son, I

105
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.480
Jessica A: Mean I talked to her, but

106
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:54.930
Jessica A: Her daughter is in a group home right now. And she's with her and I'm

107
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.120
Richelle Direny: Pretty sure she's with her. She lives in the

108
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:11.190
Jessica A: Wash, though she might with the coronavirus saying on around my sister one or home you know for the weekend because there was no score anything all the schools have been canceled.

109
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.630

110
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.580
Jessica A: Like to have my daughter home their life will have you come and get her you you've got to keep

111
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.780
Jessica A: It, you know, everything is is

112
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.690
Jessica A: Is lifted and on the part of that bothered me was, was

113
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.450
Jessica A: When I was still living at my elder apartment and my sister couldn't get her to listen. I mean,

114
00:13:40.500 --> 00:14:03.810
Jessica A: She was molested by her dad, and she blames my sister for it because she my sister had to work in her youngest daughter with her to go the grocery store and made her oldest daughter stay behind with dad and he drugged her in

115
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:05.730
Jessica A: Our draw

116
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:22.770
Jessica A: In this stuff to her that he shutting down and she blames my sister for it because she had begged my sister to wish her mom, you know, let her go. And she's like, No, you just take your with your dad and

117
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:37.770
Jessica A: She kept showing signs and symptoms you know like outburst and everything and my sister wouldn't do nothing about it. And right before my mom passed away, my mom paid to get her moved

118
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.480
Jessica A: Out of the apartment that she was living in with him.

119
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.280
Jessica A: And right after my mom passed away. She

120
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.740
Jessica A: Wrote for my mom passed away, she took him back.

121
00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:06.210
Jessica A: And I just keep thinking of the day that my mom died, you know, my sister was there, she was supposed to be helping me and her husband called said, well, you need to come home.

122
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:24.840
Jessica A: And take care of your effing kids, blah, blah, blah. And my moms like just let her go. You then she was like, I've got you here is I just keep replaying that my mind like you know I begged my dad to take my mom.

123
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.310
Jessica A: But my sister.

124
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.350
Jessica A: Last summer,

125
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:44.310
Jessica A: Pledge, he was having a lot of problems out of her daughter, the oldest one I bought our home with me say that night.

126
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.130
Jessica A: She stayed a couple of days.

127
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:55.620
Jessica A: And my sister said, Look, she's like she's got an appointment right up the road from relived can you bring her up there to me at a certain time.

128
00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.740
Jessica A: And he said, Yeah. Whoa.

129
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:09.630
Jessica A: I didn't have no problems out of this girl like I mean she listened to me, you know, by, you know, Twitter, okay. Caitlin, it's time to lay down

130
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:30.750
Jessica A: She would go to bed, you know, she helped do chores around the house in and she just she was a total different child than what I've seen in my sister's possession, you know, because I was saying, you know, I stayed a couple of nights with my sister.

131
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:43.080
Jessica A: And from one environment to another environment. She, she was a girl that I knew you know the nice that I knew that she was

132
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:54.420
Jessica A: I mean I'm not saying that you know that she was going to forget about what her dad did but she was a total different person. She actually opened up and talk to me.

133
00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.570
Jessica A: You know she hung out with her cousin, you know, which is my son.

134
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:09.930
Jessica A: You know, we went for a walk. So we went to the park. You know, my sister sits in a chair all day does nothing.

135
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.180
Jessica A: And

136
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:21.600
Jessica A: The last time that I have seen her was, you know, the day that I took her up there. They said, well, they said, I

137
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:33.000
Jessica A: Choose to go home with her mom. Yeah. And they told me, and they use my background on me. Of course, on my drug you know history.

138
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:40.200
Jessica A: But even though I was cleaned it didn't matter. Um,

139
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.220
Jessica A: It was, you know, the point that

140
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:54.600
Jessica A: And I didn't even understand why they let let her go on with me. My sister in him no electric for a week and they sent her home mother.

141
00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:13.080
Jessica A: And I went, I went down there to get my soft Caitlin came up to me and she was like always love you. She was like, you've done more for me than anybody. She was like an old Never forget that. That was the last day that I've seen her for almost the whole year, you know,

142
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:14.910
Jessica A: And

143
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:20.160
Jessica A: Now she's in a group home she might not ever get to come on, you know, for it.

144
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.890
Jessica A: And she's only allowed to be gone so many days.

145
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:34.410
Jessica A: But with this coronavirus school and around. I mean, they kind of they they're holding her spot for her.

146
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:46.080
Jessica A: But it it's just hard for me to go down and you know like this weekend. I'm going to go down and stay the night on Friday and spend, you know, probably

147
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:57.810
Jessica A: A couple hours with them in, take the girls and do something with them on Saturday, but it's just hard for me to go down there and and be there because

148
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:04.680
Jessica A: I know that that could be the last time that I'm here for six more months, you know,

149
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.600
Jessica A: But, um,

150
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.350
Richelle Direny: And how old is your child is your sister. Nice. Right.

151
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.700
Jessica A: Yes, she's

152
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:14.760
Jessica A: To

153
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:24.990
Jessica A: So, I mean, I just, I mean, I don't have a anger at basis or I think I have more

154
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:27.900
Jessica A: I

155
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.590
Jessica A: Think I'm more upset with her than anything.

156
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.250
Jessica A: Because she could have said, you know,

157
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:57.390
Jessica A: My sister, you know, has changed. She is a good person and you know she would never hurt my daughter, but she didn't do that. She just went along with them in. But now that trauma services isn't involved. She's like, kind of, let me, you know, back into our lives.

158
00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.550
Jessica A: But, um,

159
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:11.550
Jessica A: You know, so that that was another you know it's traumatic thing. But, you know, my mom knew you know she knew about everything, and she finally, you know,

160
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:22.680
Jessica A: Seeing that I was telling the truth about a lot of the things that my dad and my brother had for old and my mom's head. Oh, she's, she's nothing but she just lying to you.

161
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:37.830
Jessica A: She's just trying to play your mind and you know, just like I said I begged my dad that day to take what he called me and told me to leave that he was on his way home. He was just on a Walmart. I said, Dad, you've got to take her to the doctor.

162
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.450
Jessica A: So,

163
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:56.850
Jessica A: My dad went did go and sign records for her medical records physical medical records mentally. My dad had her he a medical is blocked in locked up. So no other doctors can access them.

164
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:07.440
Jessica A: So I'm just kind of wondering what else he's hiding. You know, why would you do that, you know, um, so

165
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:19.770
Jessica A: When I went in yesterday, my blood pressure was high again and I had taken my blood pressure pills and everything, you know, so she increased my blood pressure pill again.

166
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:37.920
Jessica A: I'm in bed gave me some other meds and I, I just, you know, she said, You know, you're not gonna get through this overnight. She says, you know, it could be, it could take years. She's like, you're never going to forget.

167
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.080
Jessica A: You know, the family that you had that cared about you that were here for you and

168
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:53.760
Jessica A: You know, but every single one of my and locals on my mom's side had died of some type of heart complication. And that's what she's worried about

169
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.670
Jessica A: So she's gonna have heart.

170
00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.090
Jessica A: She ordered a couple of heart test.

171
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.000
Jessica A: For me to have done.

172
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.360
Jessica A: As well. So, um,

173
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:16.590
Jessica A: Because you know she, she's like, you know, I'm kind of actually worried. Right now, you know, with your blood pressure being high in the history that

174
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:27.900
Jessica A: It runs through your mom's side of the family. And, you know, my dad's dad fold fell over have a heart attack. So it runs on both sides, you know,

175
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:35.520
Jessica A: And, you know, they were all on my mom's side. They all died.

176
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.910
Jessica A: A between 40 and 50

177
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.650
Jessica A: Some of them died not till they were in their 50s, but

178
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:59.100
Jessica A: Three of them died before they were 50, you know, and I haven't lied to my son about anything, you know, um, I was just so tired. Yesterday I came home.

179
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.180
Jessica A: I sat down on the couch and I fall asleep.

180
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.430
Jessica A: I woke up now right mirror set up out the blue.

181
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.320
Jessica A: But I had started that total yet either because I just

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.180
Jessica A: I fell. I fell asleep, and that's the first time that

183
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:26.730
Jessica A: I think I was just so tired and over exhaust tonight. My body just gave out, you know,

184
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.290
Jessica A: But

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.100
Jessica A: My sounds like

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.830
Jessica A: Can you run into the gas station, this, this was at three o'clock in the morning.

187
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.080
Richelle Direny: Has he been staying with you.

188
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:47.190
Jessica A: I'm kinda sorta but he's got his own place to um so

189
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:59.490
Jessica A: Yeah, that really been working a lot of hours because of this coronavirus thing but um you know I had told him earlier that day with the doctor Saturn.

190
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:08.040
Jessica A: He started crying to me. He was like, Mom, he was like, I can't lose you. He was like up my mom and dad.

191
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:22.290
Jessica A: For the past 10 years and he was like, we're gonna fix this. He was like, even if I've got to pay for us, like I'm not losing you it made me start crying. Of course, you know,

192
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:31.410
Jessica A: And I told him, I said, You're gonna lose me and I said, you know, I've got confidence and, you know,

193
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.090
Jessica A: That

194
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.690
Jessica A: You know I'm going to be okay.

195
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.010
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

196
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:53.970
Jessica A: He was like, No mom us like you've got older, she did it from my point of view, he was like, I don't have my dad. He was like, my group was calling all my ears and uncles are dead. He was like, I don't have a grandpa.

197
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:55.860
Jessica A: Um,

198
00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.860
Jessica A: He said,

199
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.040
Richelle Direny: Your, your dad doesn't um

200
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.890
Richelle Direny: You're now not very involved with him.

201
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.730
Jessica A: He has taught my son, since he was 15 years old.

202
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:14.040
Richelle Direny: So even though you're you see your dad and you talk to your dad. He hasn't really no

203
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.130
Jessica A: I don't talk to my dad mom or my dad's mad at me.

204
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.190
Jessica A: So,

205
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.350
Jessica A: And that that's what started to think, between me and my brother.

206
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:42.000
Jessica A: I said, you know, because my brothers like my brother had my phone number, but I never called him. I never talked to him after, you know, I started seeing you like I just kind of like backed off totally you know just stopped.

207
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:54.660
Jessica A: Because he didn't have no more control you know his my phone was in his day. He wasn't paying my bills, you know, and so I figured, you know,

208
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.080
Jessica A: We'll see what happens. And he's

209
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.360
Richelle Direny: The brother that your dad wanted you to go

210
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.050
Richelle Direny: Go with him to see, and then you you you ended up having a wife.

211
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:07.410
Jessica A: Because he did so to me when I was younger. Yeah.

212
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:21.990
Jessica A: He pretty much message me and say message. My dad, I said, Look, I said I had some packages at your house. I said I need them.

213
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:23.820
Jessica A: Um,

214
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:32.250
Jessica A: So if you could please drop them off. You don't you just follow my porch. I don't care.

215
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:46.650
Jessica A: I said, other than I use like he told my brother. He told my brother to message me and tell me that he did not get no messages for me.

216
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:59.250
Jessica A: And my brothers, like, I want you to prove it that you messaged him, I said, excuse me, I don't have to prove anything to you. I don't even have to answer to you. I said, and honestly,

217
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.940
Jessica A: I probably shouldn't say it like that, but pretty much told me to go app itself and walking

218
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.700
Jessica A: Yeah I don't you know and I basically had a

219
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:17.400
Richelle Direny: Hard time. This is the brother. Nice. You had a hard time because of what he's done.

220
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.020
Richelle Direny: You. Hi. Okay.

221
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Did you feel it can just even

222
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:37.980
Jessica A: EVEN MEAN IT MADE. I mean it lifted it will auto relief and he and he, you know, of course, starting this to me and stuff. Again, I said, Good luck. I said it over a 13 inch TV set that was 10 is probably 10 years old now.

223
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:54.150
Jessica A: You know, somebody broke into my one of my old houses will be here when I first moved in. When I went to a three day detox and pretty much robbed me of everything I had my neighbor knew I was calling. So, and

224
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:03.120
Jessica A: Um, I told my brother in the truth. My mom and them knew the truth because I had my grandma stuff sort of my house.

225
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.140
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

226
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:11.670
Jessica A: But they didn't take the last I because it was all like from 1956, you know, and they mean pictures and stuff.

227
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.180
Jessica A: But, you know,

228
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:27.810
Jessica A: In in my dad's like, you know, I don't understand why your son don't hate you. I said, because when I was using drugs. I made sure my son had a safe place to go.

229
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.660
Jessica A: I still made sure he had food.

230
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.140
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

231
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.930
Jessica A: I said, I might have been

232
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.410
Richelle Direny: Used

233
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.150
Richelle Direny: I don't know you froze for a while.

234
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.290
Jessica A: Yeah, it's because somebody tried to call me and I've got the

235
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:04.230
Jessica A: The calling restrictions on so nobody can try to call in, but

236
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.240
Jessica A: Anyways,

237
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:16.650
Jessica A: I told them, You know, I said, I might have been not the best mom but I made sure that he was saved. I made sure he had a roof over his head.

238
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:28.110
Jessica A: He had a food, you have a safe place to go pee did not feel safe, you know and and that's exactly what trolls hers has said. They said, you know,

239
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:40.920
Jessica A: I mean, they got involved, but they close the case because I had agreed to go, you know, to detox and then that's what my, my dad, you know,

240
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:57.660
Jessica A: Paid to get my husband to try to pay for all the court costs and everything for my husband to try to take it, which it never happened. They said, I don't even know how you got this child enrolled in the school, but she returning back to his mom.

241
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:07.560
Jessica A: Then that and I think that's another reason why my son has a lottery fact for me because I could have went picked him up in Turkey amount of wherever he was had

242
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.150
Jessica A: But

243
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.450
Jessica A: Me and

244
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:30.240
Jessica A: My brother in law, his girlfriend at the time there Mary know came over here. She had messaged me. She was like, look, we talk. I said, Okay, that's not a problem. And she met me

245
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:48.360
Jessica A: Like that, on the square, hear me, so it's a big ol public place. You know, so I knew I would be protected, you know, just in case they tried to do something, you know, I didn't choose. I said, Look, I said, I don't. She was like, here's what it is.

246
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:55.230
Jessica A: They said, is the I took him and dumped him off at your parents, and he needs to get his life together.

247
00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:11.160
Jessica A: And I'm like, whoa. Well, maybe he should have thought about that before you decide to, you know, to have a child and get married and everything else, you know, is she was like so.

248
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:20.160
Jessica A: Your, your mom. She's like, you know, is doing good. I said, I know that I don't need people to keep reminding me, you know,

249
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.290
Jessica A: Because of that time she was sick.

250
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.520
And

251
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:34.620
Jessica A: She was like, so he is our house. I said, I don't want to reveal him away and switching schools and all this other south and

252
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:41.490
Jessica A: I said that's not what I want to do. And I was living at a sober house at that point time

253
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.440
Jessica A: And

254
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:50.250
Jessica A: I said, You know, I'm living in a sober treatment facility. I said, you know,

255
00:31:52.470 --> 00:32:00.210
Jessica A: He can come there on low, you know, weekends, but he can't come and say they're full time anyway. I said I would have to you know get a place

256
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:02.940
Richelle Direny: As her son.

257
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.170
Right.

258
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:17.070
Jessica A: Because, you know, my, my dad has lied to me the whole entire time that he was with me or that he was with them and he technically never even stayed one night there.

259
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:26.910
Jessica A: But long story short, we waited until some, you know, summer came and he was out of school and then they the

260
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:38.790
Jessica A: Sober house that I was at let him come and stay with me, you know, the summer in till I found a place I was up on my feet and, you know,

261
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.900
Jessica A: They just told me, You know, I had to be out there by by time school start again.

262
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:59.550
Jessica A: Mm hmm. So, I mean, you know, and I mean don't get me wrong, you know, we've had our little arguments and stuff because he is a spoiled brat.

263
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.170
Jessica A: But you know, I

264
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:17.640
Jessica A: We, we have a better relationship. Now then, you know, we really ever have. And he's just, you know, he's really worried that someone's going to happen to me.

265
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.750
Richelle Direny: Here you at where you hospitalized recently.

266
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:24.990
Jessica A: Oh,

267
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:33.210
Richelle Direny: Because I know, I know that the the relationship seems to be on a rocky slope, to some degree, it's like

268
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:40.140
Richelle Direny: I know in the beginning you guys you know he had this girlfriend that seems

269
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:51.180
Richelle Direny: To be somewhat toxic to dribble really both of your relationships because of what she contributed to it. And is that because that girlfriend is no longer around right

270
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.430
Jessica A: Well, she's around um

271
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.260
Jessica A: I didn't go through

272
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.120
Jessica A: With the court proceeding.

273
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.860
Jessica A: Because, you know, even though he's my son.

274
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:02.820
Mm hmm.

275
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.110
Jessica A: He's 18 you know

276
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:18.240
Jessica A: I pretty much look at it like this. If I go to that court hearing and they put her in jail.

277
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:27.180
Jessica A: You know, he's gonna well first off I proved to him that I wasn't the one that press the charges and he apologized.

278
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:37.020
Jessica A: He came to me, he says, Mom. He says, I don't want her to go to jail. I said, Try and I didn't, I didn't do this, you know,

279
00:34:37.650 --> 00:35:01.530
Jessica A: I said, You know, I was trying to help. Emily, your, your cousin. Oh, and she cues you guys have Dayton and screwing each other. I said, you know, that's, that's not on me. I said I was trying to protect our whole I had her baby because she Emily was only 17, I said.

280
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.010
Richelle Direny: I have a son. Your son has a Your son has much higher

281
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.040
Jessica A: Yeah, his, his cousin does

282
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:19.650
Jessica A: I said, you know, there was a baby up there. I just wasn't going to let anybody run up in my home and try to fight anybody with

283
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:34.230
Jessica A: You know, all of you guys. They were all under age, then, you know, and those sooner than my son come down the steps I was already flipped over the rail Lane in the middle of the sidewalk.

284
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:47.910
Jessica A: And I had hit my head. I had a seizure, as is pretty much what happened. So they didn't have trains for me to the hospital, but they had let me go and they got the medical reports.

285
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:57.090
Jessica A: The police department dead in the prosecutor decided to file charges because there was medical injuries.

286
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.840
Jessica A: documented by the hospital.

287
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:19.560
Jessica A: Well, I didn't. Yeah. So, so they didn't press charges against her while she had some other schooling, I guess, when we was the first hearing. She wasn't complying with school, but she was working a full time job at the age of 16

288
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.110
Jessica A: And I told him, I said, You know, I said, I just want you to be careful.

289
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:41.790
Jessica A: And that's why he had left home originally was because of all that and it caused some tension between me and him. I mean, we still talk. Don't get me wrong, but he wouldn't like physically come and see me and that was the hardest single of me.

290
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:53.220
Jessica A: So after I didn't go the court hearing and the charges were dropped you know like we slowly started you know

291
00:36:54.450 --> 00:37:07.440
Jessica A: I would meet up with them or in legal guy ice cream or we would go shopping or, you know, we would do something productive and

292
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:23.940
Jessica A: You know, it meant a lot to him to me and her going along. And I guess I that's the only reason why I really tolerate her is because I love and care about the song so much and I don't want to see her.

293
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:39.570
Jessica A: But he, he told me last week that the cops were there. The week before because the neighbors had heard screaming and yelling and I told him I said tryin i said i

294
00:37:40.530 --> 00:38:01.080
Jessica A: Am not yelling at you. I'm not screaming at you. I said, but as a mother. I want you to please listen to me. I said, if the cops get caught up there and she is there. Is she says you even touch her with your hand, you're going to go to jail for domestic violence.

295
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.690
Jessica A: I said, I don't want to have to come to visit my, my son in jail.

296
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:18.990
Jessica A: I said, I don't want you to lose your job. I don't want you to lose your apartment. I want you to graduate you. I said, if you go to jail, all that is gone.

297
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.690
Jessica A: You know,

298
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.560
Jessica A: You seen you know his dad.

299
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.970
Richelle Direny: You don't respect him.

300
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.590
Jessica A: So,

301
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.570
Richelle Direny: Did he seem receptive to everything that you said

302
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.210
Jessica A: Yeah, he started crying. And, um, you know, so

303
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.850
Jessica A: I went up there and then

304
00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.970
Jessica A: This is what really kind of sent me though I had went up there.

305
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.360
Jessica A: A day or two after

306
00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:07.260
Jessica A: And one of the other person's which was her brother, my son's girlfriend's brother that was involved in, you know,

307
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:17.370
Jessica A: Pushing me over the railing and hit me in the back that I was walking up the steps to go do something with my son.

308
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:33.480
Jessica A: This kid slams the door in my face. I'm like, okay, so I call my son. I say, Can you please come open the door. So he comes in opens the door and he's in his bedroom, I said, trying

309
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.100
Jessica A: I said,

310
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:46.740
Jessica A: He was out there and his girlfriend was like, oh, that's my brother. I said, Okay. I said, Well, I'm saying in here because I don't feel comfortable around him.

311
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:54.900
Jessica A: I said it and try in I said your company needs to have a little bit more respect because he did sleep in the dorm a face.

312
00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:08.520
Jessica A: He was like, Mom, he was like his father nigga issue. He's like, I try to stick up for you, but I know out you. I said, What is that supposed to mean he's like every time I do. Everybody gets jealous.

313
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:15.570
Jessica A: I said, I'm your mom. I said, Who gives a shit what anybody thinks

314
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:17.310
Richelle Direny: I'm

315
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:24.870
Richelle Direny: Obviously, so you're saying. You're saying in the last month or so the relationship between you and your son has been getting a lot better.

316
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.830
Yeah.

317
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.690
Richelle Direny: Then

318
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:46.260
Jessica A: Yeah, and he just said, You know, I'm just being honest. He was like, it's been bothering me for a while he was like, but every time I stick up for you. I get yelled at, or I get told that my mom's a piece of shit. He said that really hurts my feelings. He was like, because

319
00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.340
Richelle Direny: He was coming in there.

320
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:58.350
Jessica A: I think it's his girlfriend's brother and I think maybe a little bit of her and I know her mom cannot stand me

321
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.200
Richelle Direny: If he does he have low self esteem.

322
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.090
Jessica A: He does. He definitely does. And she makes them feel like that.

323
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.850
Richelle Direny: I'm

324
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:23.070
Jessica A: Like I been, you know, I take him to the store and I, you know, let him. So spend so much you know on groceries, you know, if he needs hopeless. I've i i do I help him.

325
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:39.660
Jessica A: You know, but I told him I said she should not be staying the night with you. I said, until she has the age of 17 and she really don't even need to be up there. He was like, But mom, she pays helps me pay my bills. I said,

326
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:48.420
Jessica A: Yeah, but right now with I mean everything the way it is like he's still waiting on his income tax.

327
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:58.110
Jessica A: And I told him I might be waiting on that for about three more months because they're not doing anything with the income taxes.

328
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:08.400
Jessica A: Until you know they decide what they're doing with the rest of this stuff. You know what I mean, that's what I told him, I said, if you need help. I will help you.

329
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:18.930
Jessica A: I said I can't give you that much hope. But I said, Don't forget, as well. I said, you know, if you was the up and get evicted.

330
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:37.500
Jessica A: Because you got into a fight with her, and you went to jail for domestic violence that would be one thing I said, but if you need help pay your bills that bad. I said, you know, you've got another room to come home to. I'm not going to deny you a place to live. You're my son.

331
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:50.550
Jessica A: And he just, you know, he started crying and just like I said about the medical building. He was like, Mom, he was like, We'll figure it out. If your insurance will

332
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.820
Jessica A: Cover it. He was like, I'll pay for it. If I have to

333
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:55.200
You just

334
00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.020
Jessica A: It really broke my heart. You know, I mean, it broke my heart. But it made me have you know

335
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:15.630
Jessica A: To hear something like that come out of a sudden, you know, because right oh my dad's trying to stop me and him from going and my sister and her girls. He said, We're not allowed to go to the cemetery at all.

336
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:56.070
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, I mean it sounds. It sounds like your son. It sounds in everything. And I know that you've kind of struggled with, you know, the relationship with your son, and with your dad and kind of all the people in your family.

337
00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:05.400
Richelle Direny: I think more importantly, you're working more so on building this relationship with your son just kind of getting back to a good place with your son.

338
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:13.380
Richelle Direny: And it sounds like you guys started at least starting a conversation at least starting to have

339
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:24.240
Richelle Direny: You know, a meaningful conversation. So it sounds like you guys are in a good place. But it sounds like individually you both struggle with self esteem or some degree of self esteem. I see that you struggle with it.

340
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:31.470
Richelle Direny: And it's something that you know you have to work on yourself first, though, you're trying to rebuild the relationship with your son.

341
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:42.120
Richelle Direny: You have to work by you first so that you can be in a better place to help him along the way, because it feels like he's doing a lot of defending like you guys are defending each other in different ways.

342
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.230
Right.

343
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.520
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, you do you. Were you guys really do have

344
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.920
