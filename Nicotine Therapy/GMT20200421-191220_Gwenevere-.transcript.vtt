00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's check audio and video. Make sure they're in sink sink sink sink, top, top, top picture.

2
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.770
Saraniah Aston: You see me.

3
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I see it here you and my. Am I insane my audio and video is insane.

4
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.900
Saraniah Aston: Yep, you're great, you're golden.

5
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.680
And

6
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.890
Saraniah Aston: I want to tell you

7
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.060
Saraniah Aston: I give you my word. This is the last time I'm going to be late. Okay.

8
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.510
Oh,

9
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wouldn't have my word.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it taking a really long time inside a virtual clinic.

11
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.730
Saraniah Aston: Sometimes, but usually it's my fault.

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.970
Saraniah Aston: For like I should come like probably like seven minutes earlier than I do something like out

13
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

14
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what I'm hearing it's taking people, especially

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: These afternoon hours it's taking as much as 30 minutes, people are waiting, so you may decide to check in. Like, as soon as you think of it and get that check in part.

16
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.700
Saraniah Aston: Done.

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can

18
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You can come in.

19
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Arm tells you to do you know what I mean, like, just

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.490
Saraniah Aston: Oh yeah, instead of just waiting and then directly going to you.

21
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

22
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.660
Saraniah Aston: That's a good idea. I'll do that. I was running around with my son stand

23
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.730
Saraniah Aston: Now I'm like reading my phone in my jewelry box. There we go. Ah.

24
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So you. You seem like

25
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: A urine kind of a kind of a chipper cheerful state. Is that how you feel.

26
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.040
Saraniah Aston: Um, right now I am. Okay. One thing I wanted to explain to you. I thought about this yesterday.

27
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.910
Saraniah Aston: When I speak to you in. We have the morning sessions like at 11

28
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.900
Saraniah Aston: I usually I wake up and

29
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.640
Saraniah Aston: And like while we're talking I'll probably take my meds or something. And so I'm very raw

30
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:36.120
Saraniah Aston: And it's, it's pretty difficult for me to do it actually is the mornings I take all of my medication. And then, so after I take my medication and I woke it up, and I've gotten over the morning blues that I go through

31
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.780
Saraniah Aston: I'm much more

32
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.470
Saraniah Aston: calmer and

33
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.220
Saraniah Aston: And then, of course, I'm excited.

34
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

35
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.130
Saraniah Aston: So yeah mornings are really, really hard for me, like, really.

36
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Can see that. And so you're almost expecting those morning blues.

37
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, yeah. Yeah. Wow. Okay.

38
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.600
Saraniah Aston: Today I like I thought about it for a while. Last night, that there's a sense that she's going to notice a difference.

39
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:20.880
Saraniah Aston: Me right when we go and me a few hours after I've woken up taking my medication and assessed myself a little bit

40
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's actually not just

41
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't a comparison between group and individual, it was

42
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: More like we've had sessions where you've been very raw the middle of the day was stuff going on with Brother stuff going on with with this potential romantic partner. So that's all just wanted to see my perception matched your reality.

43
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's all.

44
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.910
Saraniah Aston: I am I, I lost my journal. So I have a bunch of these little books little booklets, I have like six of these, and I'm going to fill them all up.

45
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.020
Okay.

46
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cool. So I'm gonna I'm gonna jump I just jumped in talking with you. I'm going to go ahead and open a note. Now, so whatever adjustments you need to make you want to grab a sip of water, you want to move the phone. Get a pillow GET COZY.

47
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Get any kind of anything you need now's the time

48
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: While I open it. Nope.

49
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, you got you.

50
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.530
Saraniah Aston: Did you ever smoke cigarettes when

51
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me your interest.

52
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.110
Saraniah Aston: Oh, I'm just curious. I don't think you have. You don't seem like you, you, you seem very like

53
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.020
Saraniah Aston: health conscious. You know, I still think that you would have smoked, but you don't want to tell me. I mean, it's totally

54
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.700
Saraniah Aston: I just

55
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed that there's a I probably won't. I don't share a lot of my personal information I I've learned over the years that it it is more useful to not but but exploring impressions and opinions and kind of where we get those those things from can be an interesting journey.

56
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So i again i don't know if you remember, but I kind of try to demystify people's opinion about member that first impression you had with me, too.

57
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.060
Mm hmm.

58
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm going to be like this. So some of the looks like that is going to be like this. So there might be some mystery there might be some surprises in there.

59
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do notice that those questions for my clients come when I am opening a note.

60
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I've noticed that I've noticed that when I'm not

61
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.800
Saraniah Aston: Engaged you silent, that means

62
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.620
Saraniah Aston: I know that they want to say something. Yes.

63
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

64
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.170
Saraniah Aston: Let's let you open the note.

65
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, no, it's more like you're not alone. It's like it's a social pressure that doesn't exist quite the same when we're sitting in a therapy setting. There's a an artificial pressure that because if you're, if you think about if you're on the phone.

66
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you're ever quiet for even watch, watch. I'm not talking. I'm not trying to, I'm not talking

67
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, are you there.

68
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.650
Saraniah Aston: We

69
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't wait very long and that same pressure. I've watched over these three years have been working with bright heart.

70
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens in here too. So even though I'll say okay go settle yourself like if you had just gone and gotten a pillow probably wouldn't have happened, but it just, it happens to everybody. We want to fill it. We want to jam it with with words and whatever, but

71
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.580
Saraniah Aston: Content.

72
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That quiet is unsettling.

73
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.130
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. Yes, that's it.

74
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.210
Saraniah Aston: I guess that's it.

75
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

76
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.030
Huh.

77
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I never get to open my note.

78
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.980
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I realized that

79
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I, I'm only kidding. I mean, it's a little dance to to try and with a lot of having to share anything

80
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.160
Saraniah Aston: I understand. No, I just, I forget something, but I know how well

81
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, this is an example of look what we just did. You got to see in vivo in real time. What did I just do what we, what would. What's that skill I have that I just did.

82
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.490
Saraniah Aston: Know,

83
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you do

84
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.800
Saraniah Aston: What skill.

85
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Remember that print out that you printed and pasted in a notebook. You like I'm going to print this out and I'm gonna plop it in a notebook and I'm going to paste it in there. Do you remember what that one once

86
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.700
I know

87
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

88
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.590
Saraniah Aston: This is the book I'd be using

89
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a pretty important one.

90
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's nary a person that doesn't have to face this one eventually

91
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

92
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.030
Saraniah Aston: There's the dual awareness.

93
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a print out, you probably if you did do what you said you were going to do. You're going to print it out. You're going to plop it

94
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there in your notebook or in a collage. You were going to drop it in there somewhere.

95
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.320
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I still have it. I just have to print it out. I can't remember what it is.

96
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no pressure. It's a boundary

97
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.360
Saraniah Aston: Did you tell me

98
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.020
I did.

99
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.000
Saraniah Aston: Oh,

100
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Did you see it.

101
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.270
Saraniah Aston: Now, no, I have to look for it and. But yeah, no, no. I saw. Yeah.

102
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but from the recipient end of it, let's let's flip the switch. Because right I'm promoting you setting those limits setting those boundaries and we make up in our head, what other people will think of us if we do that.

103
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll get mad at us, they might do, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But now you've been the recipient of one. Let's flip the story around and see how did it feel when I set a limit. How did it feel for you.

104
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.090
Saraniah Aston: I'm

105
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.950
Saraniah Aston: Kind of you feel a little stupid, but it's okay.

106
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:21.690
Saraniah Aston: Hold on.

107
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.900
Saraniah Aston: Actually

108
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it again.

109
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.830
Saraniah Aston: I want to be able to do the same thing, though.

110
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on to that. Let's just stay right in this freeze.

111
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens if you set a boundary

112
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel stupid.

113
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What will happen.

114
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:52.410
Saraniah Aston: Normally I will tell someone please don't feel stupid or don't feel bad or nothing will happen and get over it.

115
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.210
Saraniah Aston: And move on from it.

116
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.760
Saraniah Aston: And learn with a boundary is

117
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't feel bad, or you know it is a really popular one.

118
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't take this personally but up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. Right. Don't take this personally that one.

119
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.380
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. Don't take it personally. It's just my preference.

120
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.130
Uh huh.

121
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.560
Saraniah Aston: It's just me.

122
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the truth. I'm going to take it personally. Meaning, others will take it personally. Won't we will end up going to take it personal. You just kind of remember remember right

123
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We do anyway, no matter how you coach us. We're still going to take it, how we're going to take it home.

124
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.540
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, but I take things to present so many things to personally like

125
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.270
Saraniah Aston: I don't want you

126
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's go back. Let's go back a little bit. Remember I was saying we're going to freeze right here because this is a pretty juicy. You got to see something really happen in here.

127
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So I said, I set a limit, and I danced around. I even named it. I said, Now I'm stalling. Now I'm dancing around and I'm trying to, you know, I even talked it through and you felt a little stupid.

128
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. My client.

129
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: My clients feeling stupid.

130
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.800
Saraniah Aston: But it's just for like a second, you know,

131
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.520
Okay.

132
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.420
Saraniah Aston: And it's a momentary like oh type thing. Like, you're such a dummy.

133
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:40.230
Saraniah Aston: Like, like I really feel stupid like or I'm gonna be down on myself. It's like okay tasting. Moving on, it's all, it's fine. It's when

134
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay.

135
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know what's interesting about it and I know I'm sitting here on this topic for a while because these are pretty important.

136
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.320
I'm

137
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice how

138
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Somehow my

139
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Clinical preference and there might be personal to because maybe I'm a type that's a bit private maybe it maybe it's convenient for me. Right. I can see that playing into this, like, maybe that's an excuse. I have

140
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You not me.

141
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But then I balance it with actually I'm really attention seeking and maybe I would really love to tell my stories. So then I checked myself and I'm like, No, this isn't the clinical best interest of

142
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: My client. So I did check myself, but I had to go through all of that I went through all of that and some in here with you moments ago.

143
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it really worth it. Could I share about something.

144
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That happened really a lot and not at any point listen closely to this not it at point would nothing pass through my head of she should know. Not once. In fact, when you said, I felt so stupid. I was like, I had to work hard to try and hmm

145
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that something

146
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Never occurred to me now we're in in the field. The county

147
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Of how that would be so I was so busy. Look what I was doing. Did you see how I was so busy working out my own story like this. This clinically appropriate. Is this about me about her, I was working really hard spinning my wheels, like a little hamster career over here, not once did. I think

148
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: She shouldn't asked me not once. In fact, I'm having to work at it right now to think of how it would be that you would get

149
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.060
That song.

150
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.870
Saraniah Aston: That means I'm glad that you didn't think that

151
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.590
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, but I don't. I don't think you would have thought that either.

152
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is a deeper. This is a bigger picture. This has to do with

153
00:13:49.620 --> 00:14:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to take it not only what's happening in here together because I'm kind of a safe person. I'm not going to get offended. I'm not gonna get I'm gonna leverage love against you. I'm not going to withdraw. I'm not going to pull a resource from you.

154
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, right, that sort of that professional promise.

155
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm safe ish

156
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But out there.

157
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: In the real world.

158
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's different. It happens differently.

159
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.250
So,

160
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why we're kind of taking this moment to really see

161
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

162
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You had this experience this little sting, and you moved on.

163
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how often do you have to deal with listings like that.

164
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

165
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So they're not stings are they, they're like,

166
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes, much more than a sting.

167
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:51.990
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, sometimes like that. This time, this time was just little steep but but yeah sometimes. Yeah, yeah.

168
00:14:54.390 --> 00:15:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So the register of what you're willing to tolerate of what you think is like just a little nap for you like this was nothing because I didn't call you a name. Didn't demean you, I hope.

169
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't this big thing this what how, you know, I didn't shame you, I hope.

170
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

171
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But other people have

172
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.790
Saraniah Aston: Oh, yeah.

173
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so now you just barely notice this little stupid this little sting.

174
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.850
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. Actually, yes.

175
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.780
Yeah.

176
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.060
Saraniah Aston: It's a common thing.

177
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:36.990
In my life.

178
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:54.450
Saraniah Aston: Where I I inquire about things or, you know, push, just a little bit harder to be a little bit more extroverted or something like that, or you know, just try and learn how to be human.

179
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.900
Saraniah Aston: Talk to people and

180
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.090
Saraniah Aston: I guess.

181
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.340
Saraniah Aston: I do that sometimes. I asked questions that I'm not supposed to

182
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:06.750
Saraniah Aston: That aren't

183
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.790
Saraniah Aston: Politically correct or something. Sometimes, or just too deep or

184
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:25.380
Saraniah Aston: Or two human for people to be able to answer. And so I've been snap that many times and and I just kind of shrivel up and

185
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.440
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, wind back into my

186
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're in here. So I'm going to take what you said. And we're going to come right back to him is going to come out for just a moment and just say what you said in here just sticking with our interaction was perfect. It was perfect.

187
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What your part was perfect. You had a curiosity. It's not your job to know

188
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How a therapeutic relationship is right. How are you supposed to know

189
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:08.550
Saraniah Aston: I don't know, but I know I do know because of a lot of experience, but how am I supposed to know exactly all of it. Um, I guess I wouldn't. Nobody really would

190
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, you asked a question you are curious about the person that sets the limits is me.

191
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not you, much like the world. So we'll take the you out there, they will continue to be curious, they will ask questions and they may feel invasive to you.

192
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But they may just have a question they may just be doing their deal. They're just doing doing their human thing. Okay, but how we end up feeling it is quite something else. Right. So it's a constant flow.

193
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like that. I feel invaded. It isn't an absolute that their intent was to be invasive that their intent was to exploit that their intent was crossing a boundary, we

194
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: As a human have to continuously set them set the boundaries, set the boundaries. Set the boundary

195
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to give you a little phrase.

196
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I love this. This is I have it on a sticky. Because now I've just love this so much because I liked how how neat and tidy. It is so I put it on my green sticky and it is this it says, Do not infer intent from outcome.

197
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Will sit with it.

198
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's happening anyway.

199
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So what

200
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.850
Saraniah Aston: Are intense

201
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.080
Saraniah Aston: Front of them.

202
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.650
Uh huh.

203
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're gonna we're gonna come, it'll come back to this. So let's go back to

204
00:18:49.530 --> 00:19:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm this belief. Remember I said we're gonna come out, we're going to talk about what happened in here. And then I said I would come back to something you said think it's pretty rich when you said I'm not supposed to whatever

205
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder if that's the sponsoring belief underneath this as if there's some I've broken some rule that I'm not in the club like what's. How do you do this human thing.

206
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like

207
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're left out of some important bit of information about how to be social or something. Does it feel like that.

208
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.010
Saraniah Aston: Sometimes, yeah. Yeah.

209
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is it not about the person that you talk to maybe doesn't know how to answer your question, or you reached one of their limits.

210
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they were just bored angry hungry irritated lonely. Who knows what wonder why it bounces back to you is if there's something flawed in you wonder how you default to that.

211
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.850
Saraniah Aston: I think I do that with almost everything, though.

212
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I do too. That's why we're coming back to it. I'm wondering if what we're doing is really seeing the

213
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: One of these really core beliefs about yourself.

214
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.500
Saraniah Aston: Well, I can tell you something that I'm

215
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.410
Saraniah Aston: One of those very big

216
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.530
Saraniah Aston: In social situations.

217
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:43.830
Saraniah Aston: People seem to want to know my life story in 60 seconds. And I want to please people so I give it to them and I blow their minds and they don't know what to think. And then I don't know if I'll ever hear from him again.

218
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.890
Saraniah Aston: I don't want to give my whole story.

219
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't I go to girl that's a boundary. So notice someone has a demand will tell me, Well, why do you think, where do you feel and wow, is it that fitted to death.

220
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to keep them around so you want to please them and you are over sharing beyond your comfort.

221
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:08.340
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

222
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know you have a right to set a boundary

223
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even want to talk about whether I was a smoker or nonsmoker like what if, is it going to make

224
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell people whether I had someone asked me, Is that an apartment or house and I didn't answer.

225
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's how consistent. I am. I mean, and that's just ridiculous like come on girl. What difference does that make

226
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:34.260
Mm hmm.

227
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.540
Saraniah Aston: I guess we just don't want to seem bitchy or

228
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

229
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.730
Saraniah Aston: But I guess I am any I'm going that's going to happen.

230
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many times did you think oh that whenever there's a pitch for

231
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

232
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, Bitch square

233
00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.010
Now,

234
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing I can do about it. So my telling you if I'm an apartment, if this is an office. And this is a home if I'm a smoker or nonsmoker

235
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: With I shaved my head. If I stop wearing makeup. But if I stood on one leg and look like this. It doesn't matter what I do.

236
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I will still be seen as a bitch. There is nothing I can do about it. And so once I really got that I've just embrace the bitchiness and me. I was like okay well I'm going to clearly going to get that level, regardless of what I do to help. I'm just going to make it work for me.

237
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.480
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, me too.

238
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:39.960
I guess.

239
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not

240
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So preservation. Well, not more than that.

241
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: More than that, yeah, weapon that it's member member in that imagery that we did about how do I harness

242
00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not rage that I want to harness. That's not it. But it was somewhere in this anger, it's somewhere in this vitality, it's somewhere in this

243
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This energy that's not depression. It's not shame. No, no, it's more in that high energy space. Well, what if it's being a badass. What if it is kind of embracing that I'm bold.

244
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:17.100
Mm hmm.

245
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So what

246
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.650
Saraniah Aston: Is admirable that's really admirable

247
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what you are. So what you're curious and you want to know the piece that gets

248
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of the rug pulled out quick from underneath is this this old thought you have

249
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I wasn't supposed to do that.

250
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the outdated. That's the outdated thought

251
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It being okay for you to do you

252
00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you offend someone whether you let them down, whether they're irritated disgusted repulsed laughing, crying. You have a right to do you

253
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I, meaning I represent everyone I will set my boundary and you will either pay attention to it.

254
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you won't

255
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But how do you know where that boundary is how did you know I maybe, maybe I could talk about family and that would be my comfort zone. How would you know if you didn't go test it out right. How would you

256
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.940
Saraniah Aston: It's true.

257
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, whether you're a smoker or nonsmoker. How does that, like most people would just freely share that

258
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.140
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, right. Um,

259
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.390
Saraniah Aston: But this is a year. You're the therapist, so

260
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, look what else happened. Look how much work we've done already this morning.

261
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:50.490
Saraniah Aston: Because

262
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm such a bitch.

263
00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.820
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I know. Teach me here, which is

264
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh we answer. No question. Tell me already. Okay, but what if that what if that's something cuz look someone says to you,

265
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me all about you gimme gimme gimme. Well, I'm going to bring that list up again, remember I was telling you this boundary stuff is so important, and I know you didn't print it out. That's okay.

266
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't. Okay, well, you had wanted to. It wasn't a command or anything. I have got it sitting here on my computer, we can bring it up anytime we want to

267
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do want to bring it up again because it's so cool. It's so comprehensive, I can't remember all of the things like this thing cam. So we're going to show up, just having happened right now it's going to be right on the screen.

268
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.400
Saraniah Aston: We're just in case people screenshot.

269
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.650
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I have.

270
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.460
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

271
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to find

272
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, me too. So we're going to find the one that speaks precisely to they asked me for my life story in 60 seconds. Let's see if we can find where that is.

273
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:18.990
Saraniah Aston: OK.

274
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.390
Saraniah Aston: You have a strong sense of identity you respect yourself.

275
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: There's even more precision, there's even more you'll find it.

276
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.860
Saraniah Aston: You share personal information gradually and

277
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.850
Saraniah Aston: Natural share mutually sharing trusting relationship.

278
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And say you found it member earlier. I was saying we portion it out we we give little bits to make sure so you

279
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You test it out a boundary here just now. And you asked me about smoking, let's say, and so you felt something out and and you you learned the terrain.

280
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You might have had a map of what people do in in therapy will we talk about thoughts and feelings, because you've been in it. You've seen maps before that's a metaphor, but you've never been in the terrain.

281
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Of having that thought about this therapist. You have never been here before this. This is a new moment.

282
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:26.970
Saraniah Aston: Right, yeah. It is usually share personal information gradually in a mutually sharing personally. That's true. That is exactly how it should be.

283
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:32.520
Saraniah Aston: It shouldn't be all one sided I know someone named and they know my blood type.

284
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is enough. Yeah. Now, the question comes into how do you know if your baseline belief about yourself is

285
00:27:44.160 --> 00:28:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know how to be a human. How on earth are you supposed to trust your intuition on. I don't want to share everything with you right now like some dude. Some gals somebody I don't want to. How are you supposed to trust yourself. How are you supposed to be able to say

286
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, we'll see that for another time. You know, and when we've got, you know, eight hours of sitting at a table, but I'll tell you this, and then you set what you want to talk about

287
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the right to do that. But you are flooded likely with all of this pressure this emotional pressure, even happens, I've got a I've got to spill the fact that to give them what they want, or else

288
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't you don't have to. You could literally be a turkey like me and be like now.

289
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

290
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.450
Saraniah Aston: That's how that's exactly how I want to be.

291
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah portion it, we get to take it nice and easy. We get to register members telling you earlier that a lot of times

292
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You are in some pretty high distress. I don't know how much of it was retained. But when we're around someone who's exploiting us who

293
00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is literally their agenda is to extract information about me. I'll take it on as me, they want to learn everything about me so they can exploit me but they haven't really shared anything about themselves.

294
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:11.520
Saraniah Aston: Right.

295
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Number I touched on that before. Does that sound familiar

296
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. That's where this shows up.

297
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.120
Saraniah Aston: The next

298
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Day. Yeah, no, I'm you can flip it around and say, well, tell me, tell me why you want to know how these things about me.

299
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: How will that help us get to know each other, you can turn it around and you can ask an open ended question.

300
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a boundary, because look what I did. I turned one of their questions into a question if we keep that up too long. Typically, we can pick up on it, it gets annoying.

301
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're just starting at this. I mean, we've got to get some skills. We got against tuning in to your own body when that first zing happens that something important that steak. And you know what's at stake is your boundary

302
00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.850
Saraniah Aston: What are usually say

303
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.280
Saraniah Aston: My boundary. What I do have

304
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.010
Saraniah Aston: When I do say it is

305
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:12.120
Saraniah Aston: It. It's a long story. That's what I said. It's all I know what to say. But that's not good enough.

306
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wait. Remember we set the boundary again and then again and again. Because if you're going to find out, well, let's just say it's not enough. What if it is exactly enough and that the problem is not you

307
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What if this whole time. You've just been around people that don't give a flip about your boundary

308
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.250
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

309
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been blaming yourself. When really it was a matter of having maybe

310
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: People that aren't disrespectful of one's boundary. They were invasive. They were kind of, you know, either over sharing or over right invading into our emotional space. What if there's really been nothing wrong with you this whole time.

311
00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

312
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.160
Yeah.

313
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So very confusing them are coming up when the messages. I've either gotta give everything this emotional just like here here's, here's my heart. Here's all my feelings. Be careful with it. Why don't you I don't know you. But here you go.

314
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.070
Um,

315
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's another way to go about that. And that's what this outline kind of breaks down is if we weren't taught how to parcel out these bits of trust, slowly, slowly, slowly.

316
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is a way of reference point. So over these weeks. Have you had a chance to pay attention to your physiology of when there's a boundary issue that's coming up, like how I can feel it. I feel clip.

317
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.630
Saraniah Aston: You know he's more

318
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Like not in throat. Where do you feel it.

319
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.020
Saraniah Aston: All over my entire body.

320
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.600
Saraniah Aston: All over.

321
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.990
Saraniah Aston: Sometime this. It's that sets off something's right

322
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it, it happens. Tell me about how it's in your left pinky.

323
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.120
Saraniah Aston: Not even aware my limbs really

324
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: not aware of limbs. Okay. And that's not even a limb that's even just like what we call a little digit right

325
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.490
Saraniah Aston: Here's the live

326
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's these little phalanges that pop off of them and

327
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.410
Saraniah Aston: even talking about it maybe just for some reason.

328
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.290
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I wonder what

329
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

330
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.940
Saraniah Aston: And sometimes when I get anxious

331
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.930
Saraniah Aston: I mean, it's okay. I can handle it. It's just like sometimes like when I get anxious. I'll get really, really confused. It's weird.

332
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now that actually has some science. I can tell you why that's happening.

333
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.150
Saraniah Aston: Really

334
00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

335
00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah so right and I told you you're not broken. I tried to tell you, you know, there's nothing wrong with you, you're, you're working just fine. You're working like everybody else's

336
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So that is that's the release of that the amygdala hijacking. And what happens is there's such a flood of an emotion that comes up from the amygdala that it cuts off.

337
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Access to the other parts of the brain, which is up here, and many other places. And it also messes. And I've talked to you about the hippocampus, and the ability to remember

338
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Things accurately and the cortisol that comes from there, but one part of it is, it's so intense.

339
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It completely cuts off access to the other parts of the brain, all the parts of rain have got to be working with each other.

340
00:33:49.860 --> 00:34:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And flowing and Evan info and let's use a little bit of knowledge and experience and expertise and sort of logic over on the left side and a little bit of that emotional stuff like, hey,

341
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This guy's invasive that's that emotional, we need a mixture of all of it. What's happening is just that one part is getting all the attention. It's just an amygdala hijack it's a hijack you completely hijacked

342
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:15.570
Saraniah Aston: Right.

343
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.970
Saraniah Aston: That's awesome.

344
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your name.

345
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.420
Saraniah Aston: Hi jack. Yeah, so

346
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you'll hear it all over. Now that you've heard it from me. I didn't, I didn't come up with it. It's something

347
00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:29.040
Saraniah Aston: You didn't

348
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's not cute. Can't copyright that so

349
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but the science behind it, because you were wondering, how can it be, I can't, I can't think straight

350
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.550
Saraniah Aston: That's right.

351
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Neither can I.

352
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: None of us can that's because I said this all the blood is here and here and you said you can't even fill your fingers. That's because there's no blood in there.

353
00:34:53.430 --> 00:35:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all in part and large muscle groups, my thighs and my biceps and I'm ready to run and I'm ready to fight.

354
00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not in here, the prefrontal cortex that can distinguish now from five years from now, that part of the brain that's activated right now. The only thing that noses, you're in danger, you're in danger. Hey, you're in danger. Hey. Hey now, you're in danger.

355
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't say you're in danger at two.

356
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Says, you're in danger.

357
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.080
Saraniah Aston: So now we're going to meet you start sweating. Yeah.

358
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am.

359
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. It does not have

360
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Moderation. That's why we gotta be able to use the more evolved parts.

361
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:41.730
Right.

362
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And we get there.

363
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We get there through the breath, you've got other techniques which they're out there, but this is the go to is get to the breath.

364
00:35:51.750 --> 00:36:04.980
Saraniah Aston: Right, that's always what I do when I'm anxious, my main goal is to find my full breath a full breath. And if I can get there, that it's smooth sailing from then on out.

365
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you getting that full breath. You know where down into the belly on that. Inhale.

366
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.310
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I'm getting now.

367
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:12.660
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

368
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the tricky.

369
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's hard to do.

370
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: takes effort. And that's what we want. We want concentrated effort seeking getting what part of the brain, the part that remembers how to do it.

371
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.230
Writing

372
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we want to get out of the amygdala. That one's a sound when

373
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in danger, you're in danger. We want to get to the left brain to the logical side and we want to get to the prefrontal cortex. That's the one that can distinguish now from future. That's the one that can

374
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhibit impulse. It's an amazing for most evolved part of our brain, which means it only comes online, believe it or not, it's done growing

375
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Up like 30 so you want to give yourself a really hard time. Yep. Yeah, I know what I'm learning is it said 30 with people that identify with things like an

376
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: impulse control like ADHD for women normally research will tell you go online and check it out. It's about 2425 for women. So y'all want to give yourselves a hard time about why did I make that impulsive decision.

377
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your brain wasn't finished growing. So you guys want to give yourself such a hard time but you weren't growing yet.

378
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:40.020
Saraniah Aston: And then people. There's people like me who have had a diction problems and my brain probably has grown even slower than it could have

379
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's typically a really general went, yes. The answer is yes. Doesn't mean it won't heal.

380
00:37:47.520 --> 00:38:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the happy part. But the truth is, yeah, you can mess with it you stunted it a bit, especially with the marijuana basically when you started solving problems when you let's say you were drinking and drugging at 15 you're basically solving problems. The way you did when you were 15

381
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a weird thing. It's like we're kind of stuck in that way of addressing the world solving problems like a 15 year old if I started when I was 10. What if I started drinking when I was 11 years old.

382
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Still be sort of on an emotional level right in a problem solving, but I might still be kind of looking at things like an 11 year old. It's amazing. We get stuck kind of right there.

383
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.200
Mm hmm.

384
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But give yourself some compassion. Okay, when it comes to not feeling like you have said that phrase human

385
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Several times

386
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.080
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. What

387
00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that you think we all have that you don't have, is it

388
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:11.790
Saraniah Aston: I don't know. I don't know, just I feel very different. Sometimes I feel like I'm willing to open

389
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.060
Saraniah Aston: And other people aren't

390
00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.070
Saraniah Aston: The way I am.

391
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and so you, you could see on paper, what that translates to right

392
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's take it. Let's keep doing this work that we're doing this inner personal stuff around boundaries. This might have some news.

393
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:40.080
Saraniah Aston: I'm just not sure why I do that exactly is it attention or wanting them to like me or

394
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:56.220
Saraniah Aston: Is it, like, is it desperation for wanting people to accept me or think I'm cool. I used to use my life story as a way of being cool of seeming cool. Yeah.

395
00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get answers to the y and I can offer it there'll be one woman's opinion, you've been with before. And they've probably given you a clinical impression around that. Right. Why would you do that, what have people told you what

396
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:19.200
Saraniah Aston: attention seeking that you seek attention and

397
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm attention seeking

398
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I agree. Don't act like I am.

399
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.770
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

400
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.230
Saraniah Aston: I'm

401
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.780
Saraniah Aston: I'm

402
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.050
Saraniah Aston: Insecure

403
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.520
Saraniah Aston: With myself.

404
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:59.100
Saraniah Aston: So I feel like I have to fill up all the space for people to see that there is a person who actually has been through the same thing, you have and you have and you have, and I've done it more and more and more and more. And it's like trying to prove my bad after

405
00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:09.240
Saraniah Aston: That way, by giving it all up and like sharing everything. And it's just ridiculous.

406
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You asked, with

407
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:26.910
Saraniah Aston: Now, I think it's much, much cooler. When I see a person who has control, who is a little bit more reserved has much more like self.

408
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:38.070
Saraniah Aston: Worth I get self respect or self appreciation that and they're super cool and they don't need to see anything about themselves.

409
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.560
Saraniah Aston: That's what I'm be like

410
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's the thing, if we don't address how that feels. For you it will be the same.

411
00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:54.810
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

412
00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: With our few minutes that we have left. Okay. And, well, actually, we get started at 10 after I got a little bit of time.

413
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

414
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: These people, you said it's insecurity, but really the juicy stuff came when you kept talking

415
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention. People have given us a bit of a flippant like this kind of be more complicated. I'm attention seeking. I know I'm not the coolest cat. But I also don't share anything about myself. So how those two things. How can I

416
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Wait, so let's keep going. So then you said some neat things in here.

417
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I only wrote down some of it and it was fill the space.

418
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a person

419
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's you

420
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you don't fill the space.

421
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you

422
00:42:48.300 --> 00:43:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is identity. And so this is at the core, and so you keep wondering why do I keep doing this intellectually. I know the logic of this healthy list and boundaries. And you could probably teach a group on it right you know it.

423
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But in the moment that pressure

424
00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To please how pressure is there and

425
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

426
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That as you

427
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: This is complicated, so

428
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: As we're talking about identity here so

429
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe that the way to the destination, which is going to be you the authentic self. So that's going to be where we're going. But I think the way to get there is going to be rehearsal.

430
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: May seem oversimplified, but every time that you actually tune in.

431
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: To wait a second, it isn't all over. I'm stressed and I've been labeling it all over my body. Now I'm going to be more precise.

432
00:43:55.830 --> 00:44:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel here in my shoulders and then another month passes and you refine it and refine it and refine it. And you know what, and then you get to the point where you're like, who I know

433
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what I like what I don't like. Because I just got a knot in my throat. My stomach just turn. I can feel it. And only a couple maybe areas in my body. It's not all over, not this vague thing it's I'm zeroing in on the message that my body's giving me and I know it. I feel it. It's true.

434
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't have to explain it to anybody I'm experiencing it right now. I can feel it.

435
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And then over time you'll get the confidence, you'll get to know that experience more refined and you'll be able to label it and say,

436
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm excited that feels the same as nervous and then a little bit later, it might be. I'm disgusted with something and I feel that a little different part of my body feels a little different. Yeah, that's the labels disgusted or oh I'm so afraid.

437
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're going to feel it in your body. That's a felt sense, we're going to label it.

438
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This may seem oversimplified, but I'm telling you, I think that's going to be where you're going to find yourself in your truth, not how I label it, not what psychology. Does this and this is going to be over and over and over.

439
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your reality, what are you going through right now. What are you feeling right now and you can get through, through that breath and a lot of other relaxation meditative practices, you can get there.

440
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But this piece that you you did today around when I said, well, where, where do you feel that stress. Right. And you said all over my body.

441
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was a little bit kind of cheeky. And I said, Well, what about your little finger.

442
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: YES, YOU CAN MAKE MAC AND CHEESE YO.

443
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: He's texting me. I forgot he texted me so that's

444
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Number, the thingy.

445
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Member asked you about

446
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wonder, I wonder how you might respond to that. And then I got another really cool, interesting piece of information. I don't even know him. I don't know.

447
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: There no

448
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, then we're going to get to know what parts you can have some conscious awareness of what we're going to get there and how do we do it. We pay attention to you.

449
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Know the label, not people pleaser. I can use any of those terms, but their way out here, the core stuff has to do what is certainly a feeling right then. Does she register intuition. Has that been so invalidated in her her childhood that she has just not been habituated to tuning in Word.

450
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.480
Yes.

451
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:50.190
Saraniah Aston: So what I'm doing is

452
00:46:51.270 --> 00:47:04.740
Saraniah Aston: A little bit. I noticed that I'm doing this is I'm stopping like I'll stop everything like a thought process or whatever, if I need to feel like I need to just to think about it.

453
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.860
Saraniah Aston: Before I go further.

454
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:11.910
Saraniah Aston: I'm really trying to do that. And it's helping

455
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.620
Oh, yes.

456
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You have every right

457
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

458
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on, and I noticed my shoulders are up here. I noticed my jaws take

459
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:27.960
My leg.

460
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I don't mind looking like a fool. What if I'm worth it. What if I get to tune in word and not pay attention more to you.

461
00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I'm going through. I love what you're doing, stop just

462
00:47:49.230 --> 00:48:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for me and you've gotten to up here, up to the thinking and my invitation to you is don't forget the body yes you're paying attention, thinking. So the invitation is next.

463
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: On having that thought because you're paying you've stopped. You're now you're analyzing the thinking you're looking at, well, how's my body doing

464
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't even feel my hands. Okay. Yeah. Oh, I feel nauseous haha

465
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's the next one and then more you really get what's going on with that body of yours. I think we're going to get some some really profound

466
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Change in there because it's not just the mind it's connected to messages and the truth of the matter is, your body responds before that mind of yours.

467
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Body intuitively it, it reacts.

468
00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to have a response.

469
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To your environment.

470
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you come up with a fancy word for it.

471
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.330
Saraniah Aston: never pay attention to my body. Never thought it was very important to do so. So

472
00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:02.250
Saraniah Aston: It's interesting to hear. So, I will. Yeah.

473
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.660
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

474
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I invite if you want it because journaling has been a big part of this for you is to write it down. So maybe you've gotten, you know, here's the date. Here's the time. What are my thoughts. I got them written down.

475
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's my emotion. How about let's not forget about felt sense. And I use the word feeling meeting body somatic. What is it in your field that one. Yeah, a little journal. Okay, I don't know, I might even in my body or it might be

476
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything even know where to start. So you could start with a body scan. How did my feet feel my shoes, my ankles Macau's my knees, my thighs see owns back, shoulders, arms, hands, my neck my head.

477
00:49:49.230 --> 00:50:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed my stomach still got a little something in there so you can do a body scan. If it's so unfamiliar to that can just do it with it on on purpose, sort of scheduled routine of just doing a scan like Superman scan. Right. It goes all the way through.

478
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.440
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

479
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:06.240
Saraniah Aston: Rules idea.

480
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Into the guts. Don't forget the bones attendance, the muscles intestines.

481
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:22.050
Saraniah Aston: Hey, here. Yeah, I remember doing is the hospital and relaxation therapy, we would lay down and start from my head and work all the way up through the toes.

482
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:29.250
Saraniah Aston: So I know how to get to those spots. That was my favorite thing that we ever did.

483
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body finally got a little attention.

484
00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:37.440
Saraniah Aston: Yeah I did then. Yeah, so I guess there was a point

485
00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.140
Saraniah Aston: Your body. Yeah.

486
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty important. The mind is it it's it's beautiful, it's got its job, but we get messages from other parts of us, and sometimes they're holding a lot of energy.

487
00:50:53.280 --> 00:51:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a place we want to go. So if it gets on settling and you're uncomfortable with it. Why, why know about that to whatever comes up for you every single time.

488
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The message persistently pervasively consistently. I want to know what's coming up for you. Now what you think I want to hear. I really want to know your over and over and over. That's, that's what I want.

489
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a little time just with the bits that we have not just sort of track it through sort of

490
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving through our work together here.

491
00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:36.000
Saraniah Aston: Is there a goal. You can give me or something like that.

492
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:37.920
Saraniah Aston: Goal.

493
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: How about this, let's go from don't ever have to ask twice for something measurable and timeframe. Here we go. Happy to give it to you.

494
00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like you to

495
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase from a baseline of zero.

496
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:52.410
To

497
00:51:53.520 --> 00:52:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Three times a day of doing a body scan, accompanied by three breaths, making sure that it goes all the way into the belly.

498
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And then our mouth.

499
00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:11.070
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

500
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:12.540
And

501
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're there. Just pay attention to the emotion that you might label this human experience.

502
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Three times a day, three belly breaths.

503
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right three body scans three belly breaths and then three times. Let's give it an ole a label. Let's give it that emotion word I'm feeling

504
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad and feeling irritated. I feel numb. I feel excited. I feel jealous. I feel angry, I feel afraid just label it. If you can write that down love to know if we can discover a pattern first

505
00:52:50.910 --> 00:53:02.520
Saraniah Aston: Exactly what I'm going to do. That's my goal. I'm going to do these things. And then afterwards I'll just jot down not not stressful. The or stress out about it or anything like that.

506
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:07.590
Saraniah Aston: No whatever my hands and put it on paper.

507
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to have that group down with the journaling. So this is, this is going to kind of go well with it.

508
00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:16.470
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. Yeah. Thank you.

509
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:17.610
Saraniah Aston: Lily.

510
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll be looking for three times a day.

511
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Three body scans and right after that. Now, so right, those three times will be a body scan.

512
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.600
Saraniah Aston: In the belly breath.

513
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.240
Saraniah Aston: Pay attention to the emotion.

514
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.810
Saraniah Aston: And then I wrote, then right

515
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, excellent. So let's schedule another appointment.

516
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:45.540
Okay.

517
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually you can have this time. Again, if you want it equal 28

518
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:00.630
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, this time really seems to be good for me.

519
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: One on April 28. Do you need me to message a doctor about medication, are you good to go.

520
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:10.920
Saraniah Aston: Oh no, I'm fine.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.150
Saraniah Aston: Okay, yes.
