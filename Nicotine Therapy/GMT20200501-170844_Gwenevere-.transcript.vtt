Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

45
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let me make a little note on how many milligrams of the gamma pen. You're at 1000 or 900 today.

46
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.980
1000

47
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're making progress, girl.

48
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.140
Nicole Roybal: You know, um, the other night though.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.860
Nicole Roybal: before last. Yeah, I saw, I forgot to take my last dose of the gavel tension at the end of the night. And so I woke up like at

50
00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:01.140
Nicole Roybal: 330 and I took the orange movements like a 300 300 400 400 and then I woke up around like five and I wasn't feeling like I need to throw up.

51
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.370
Nicole Roybal: Like just holding it in and then my boyfriend gets in the shower at six, and I don't know. I stood up.

52
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:22.350
Nicole Roybal: To get some water and I drink the water and also have to run to the toilet and I threw up. And I felt fine I felt completely fine all night. But then I took together Penton and then I threw up. And I don't know, I feel like it keeps correlating with

53
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Me to I have a feeling when you're tapering off this stuff. We're going to be saying goodbye. I have one other client that

54
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: He complains of

55
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Stomach cramping and he describes it as stomach pain. Now, maybe it's the same experience for you to or each of you have different things, but he's wondering too if its associated with together pen.

56
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And when he takes less of it. He notices. He's having less of the stomach cramping and he's calling it cramping, but every body is different.

57
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe you experience a najah

58
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm wondering as you as you move down on these, these numbers if it's going to start to get better and better for you. I really hope it will be

59
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.410
Nicole Roybal: Well, now that I've been learning now that I'm gone 2000 I haven't been showing up every day.

60
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

61
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.630
Good, good. Yeah.

62
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.460
Nicole Roybal: Just like

63
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:22.230
Nicole Roybal: Like sometimes I'll forget in the morning, and I'll take 600 like at four o'clock or something and then I'll take the other 400 later on and too much.

64
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna look it up. I want to see what what are the if

65
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me speak.

66
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Kappa can

67
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Withdrawal symptoms vary look this up.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.720
Nicole Roybal: Know, just looking at the bottle. It says me cause Disney World Vision.

69
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Neuron okay so we got common brand, blah, blah, blah. What is it,

70
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Kevin paint withdrawal symptoms me see we've got

71
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The symptoms of galloping withdrawal include irritability, anxiety, agitation restlessness excessive sweating sensitivity to light a headache.

72
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Confusion disoriented, disorientation fever hallucinations rapid heart rate and heart palpitation interesting catatonia inability to move status EPA

73
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a condition where so you're now. Okay. But this is hold on both those who abused are known to both those who take it as prescribed can experience some form of withdrawal. When the drug is stopped. Research shows that someone taking Gabba pins for as little as three weeks.

74
00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and at doses as low as 400 milligrams a day may experience withdraw. So this um it's good that you're tapering. It sounds like this. Could this could be problematic. So I'm glad you're going nice and slow with your taper.

75
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me see the amount of time it takes to detox and the severity of symptoms associated with Gary Payton withdrawal depends on various factors include the period of time person takes it the dose presence of medical and psychological diagnosis that may complicate the detox.

76
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, let me see.

77
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A person who stuffing and you have a pen or Neurontin can experience withdrawal symptoms within 48 hours 12 to 48 hours. So it happens pretty quickly.

78
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Because it looks like it says, anxiety, heart palpitations headache sweating seizures handed body tremors. So we don't want you to taper. We don't want you to abruptly stopped because I would much you have a seizure. That would that's unacceptable.

79
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Restless if you are traveling

80
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase confusion light sensitivity post acute withdrawal. What are the long term effects of taking it.

81
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Treatment impatient de de de de de de

82
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I okay, this isn't a great site. I was hoping for. I wanted, I wanted to hear. Like how, what is the reference standard of how fast you can take taper down. That's what I had wondered

83
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your Doc is saying 100 milligrams every week. Right.

84
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Every week 100 down

85
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, I'm not finding anything to score here, we'll do that another time. Oh wait, let me just see this. This is cold turkey. Want to see what they say.

86
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Drugs prescribed more often, it's more off label uses doctors use it for this. They use it for that abuse of it. I didn't even know that was a substance, it could be abused. Honestly, it doesn't give you 40 it doesn't

87
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:35.820
Nicole Roybal: Know, so my acting weird when I first started taking it sometimes like old days when I was at like the higher doses taking 600 milligrams at night sometimes I'd wake up. I'd be sitting up in the bed and like I don't know me and my dad have this weird thing.

88
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.720
Nicole Roybal: Where the typical

89
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.040

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:47.880
Nicole Roybal: Typically, my own arm just sitting there. Sleep sitting up and I'd wake up and I think with that, however, my boyfriend would wake me up from today. What's wrong with you why you're asking so weird.

92
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:49.950
And

93
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I remember, I remember it actually

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.540
Nicole Roybal: So I guess yeah you for you and I have like had a history of sleepwalking. When I was young.

95
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I do see one one website is saying there are common uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms associated Gabba pen and they are anxiety trouble falling or staying asleep nausea and vomiting physical pain and sweating.

101
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.400
Nicole Roybal: It gets me mad that he slips because it reminds me of the withdrawal from the

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:12.570
Nicole Roybal: Weight sledding. Every time I get hot. I believe it's just like hot like all I get like a hot flash because it's hot and my body tells me oh you're having a hot flash

103
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.820
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, it's weird. My mind is just sets. I try to change it.

Gwenevere Abriel: And I was at that age noticing it started happening again. A year ago, every time he would get on me. I would, I couldn't breathe. How do you go out of the room, I go back to my teenage self to where I don't know how to handle it. It's so hard and it hurts role play therapist.

133
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

134
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, oh yeah, oh, you're talking about some real tender memories there at age 13

135
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

136
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: After we met last week. Did you notice anything kind of change in how you're interacting with your dad. Did you notice anything

137
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.290
Nicole Roybal: Know haven't really been over there.

138
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:23.010
Nicole Roybal: My little sister had got her throat was messing with her and her noted got all swollen.

139
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.140
Nicole Roybal: Oil don't want to go.

140
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.420
Nicole Roybal: away for a while.

141
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

142
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:51.000
Nicole Roybal: Well, I guess I go to work with him every Sunday, and he's actually been being super nice to me like I know we both been actually getting along, really good.

143
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.200
Nicole Roybal: That's probably because he Gilbert work.

144
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe. So for a second. Do you still have that drawing to win. You and I did. Let's take a peek at that

145
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so no alcohol.

146
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: House.

147
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Future.

148
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

149
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There's dead and there's no debt in the future either. I'm noticing there's there's this piece so

150
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole.

151
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

152
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it was a matter of not wanting to do it not remembering to do it, not understanding the reasoning for doing it around calling around your student loan.

153
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Which do you think that is

154
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.240
Nicole Roybal: Why I haven't done it.

155
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.080
Uh huh.

156
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.190
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. I guess it just makes me nervous.

157
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:53.400
Nicole Roybal: I don't want to call and then I just fall for everything they say again, and like I tried to understand chat in the chat. I still don't get it. Okay. Yeah.

158
00:18:54.510 --> 00:19:08.760
Nicole Roybal: Because yeah I don't like to ask, like, three times a little bit. I still don't get I still get it members like I'm just like, Well, you're not explaining it right. I don't want, I doubt that will happen, but I don't want it to happen and I just don't want to feel stupid.

159
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I get it.

160
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.520
Nicole Roybal: But they did call me on my other phone and I got a voicemail from them. I need to call them.

161
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: They called you out of the blue, are you

162
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:47.940
Nicole Roybal: They called me out of the blue on the other phone because I haven't. It doesn't work. So I haven't been answering any calls and I check my voicemail. I like 16 voicemail and children work from the i i on tuition place or something. But I have the number and everything. I just got a call.

163
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's look at this together.

164
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just random I

165
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't look at this before. I'm sitting with you now. But let's look at it together. Do you see it here.

166
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is student loan deferment so in this in this it says a student loan to firm. It lets you stop making payments on your loan or reduce the amount you pay for up to whatever amount of years in most cases interest and, you know, an interest is

167
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.840
Nicole Roybal: Just like money on top of it.

168
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.370
Nicole Roybal: Right.

169
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you have interest on thing when you borrow money from a bank, you're thinking to yourself, Well, why would a bank lend me money. They're making interest. So they charged me

170
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: 3% 7% that's why banks make money, they charge us interest. So on a home loan, a car loan. It makes sense now. Well, what's my interest. WELL, I WANT TO LOW INTEREST. What does the bank. Want a high one they want to make money off of you by lending you money.

171
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's what interest is

172
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If we do okay interest on subsidized so this word subsidized you probably don't know which we're going to get down so

173
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.200
Nicole Roybal: Many times I never good.

174
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's okay, so it's it's down here um subsidized is probably, I think we can think about. We can look it up, but I'm pretty sure my interpretation is that the government basically is lending you the money.

175
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll come back to that in a second. So up here. We've got interest with you now know, let's just say this is government on loan, like you're like a Sallie Mae

176
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Or Bernie Mac loan, there's certain, there's a couple of them that our government sort of backs, which is good. It's a good thing that our government backs that loan because that's a good thing. So interest in subsidized deferred loans does not accrue

177
00:21:53.190 --> 00:22:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So you would want to know when you were looking at your paperwork, you would want to look at the different categories of whether it is subsidized

178
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it Perkins loan. I know it's a weird thing but they just have a name, there's

179
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.690
Nicole Roybal: No, I, I have one that's subsidized and I have one.

180
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go. See, you do know. So here's what will happen. Watch that unsubsidised portion, sometimes there's a portion that is an a portion that isn't so the part that's not subsidized

181
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's here interest on unsubsidized loans, if they're in forbearance.

182
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Does a crew and is capitalized and added to the amount

183
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why you keep hearing me say let's talk to them. Let's talk to, let's talk to him.

184
00:22:51.630 --> 00:23:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because you have to turn around and pay him, but because you're the one that's going to possibly owe money. And wouldn't you want to know, because you have it in your head, and I hope you're right that you will. Oh, nothing, but I've never heard of that.

185
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

186
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.840
Nicole Roybal: When I whenever I did like go on the website last

187
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Time I did, I

188
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:19.170
Nicole Roybal: Don't remember what it was. I do remember seeing one wasn't forbearance and one was in

189
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go. So interest on and subs. Yeah. So that might be what's happening. So there's a portion of it that is in forbearance.

190
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Which means it puts a pin in you're having to make a payment, but it looks it does accrue interest.

191
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.180
Nicole Roybal: Right. Probably she said it doesn't for both me. That's why they're calling me

192
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, both deferment and forbearance are considered temporary. Now you see why I'm saying what I am their temporary

193
00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you foresee that you'll be unable to resume your student loan payments in three years or less, you should consider

194
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Another approach. Okay. Let's keep reading. So key takeaways. What to kind of take away from this student loan deferment lets you stop making payments on your loan for up to three years. It does not forgive the loan.

195
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You must apply and qualify for deferment unless you are enrolled in school, at least half time

196
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you may, so hold on to this information when it come back to this one. Okay, let's go down here interest and on subsidized that's the one that's probably covered by our government back by our government

197
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Does not accrued during the deferment Yay, that's a plus. We like that one. We love that one.

198
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Interest on unsubsidized loans does accrued during deferment and is added to your loan at the end of the deferred payment.

199
00:24:54.570 --> 00:25:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: deferment on private student loans varies by lender. So that's like if you went directly to a bank and said, You know, I need an extra 15,000 for books and a place to live, blah, blah, blah.

200
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So deciding to defer when deciding whether to pursue a student loan deferment you should ask yourself the following questions are my loan subsidized or Perkins lungs.

201
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because those interest on those types of LUNGS, DO NOT accrued during the deferment period. But here's the thing. How many years was your deferment period. Maybe it's over. Maybe that's why they're calling. I don't know.

202
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:31.620
Nicole Roybal: Johnny

203
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, if your loans are unsubsidized or private interest will likely accrue unless you pay it while in. So for some people, they're still sending in money, even though it's not the full payment, they're paying the interest. I know that sounds insane.

204
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're not paying. Do you know what the word principle is

205
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.050
Nicole Roybal: No use it.

206
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not the one. It's not the one at your school, it's

207
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.970
Nicole Roybal: NOT REALIZE, LIKE HAVING principles like having your own

208
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Know there's three now. So there's you just did morals. You did one for morals. It's not that one either.

209
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: There's three there's might even be more I know three ways to use the word principal there's that principal's office at school. There's a, you do have morals and principle principles and values. And then there's this one.

210
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The principle is if my house was $100,000 and I have an interest rate of 5% when I send my money in every month to make a payment.

211
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Some part of it goes to paying down my hundred thousand dollar principle means the main loan amount

212
00:26:48.180 --> 00:27:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Which was how much $100,000 and another part of my payment. Let's say I'm sending in $500 maybe 300 of it will go to my principal balance that's a primary balance and then 200 of it will go to interest. And so it takes 30 years to pay this loan on

213
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.140
Nicole Roybal: What part of the house.

214
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The principal. So when you see in writing.

215
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:18.840
The money.

216
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.640
Nicole Roybal: Yeah yeah

217
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, so you've got three that same word has a lot of

218
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of meanings in English language, it messes with your head. It's like, which one is it but that's what that means.

219
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So you really everybody wants a really low interest rate so that all their money that they're sending in to a mortgage or to a car loan goes to paying down the principal, which is the actual cost of the item.

220
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:54.480
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

221
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, listen. Hey,

222
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You got this is going on. It's not like you're not thinking about it isn't making it stop, it's still happening. It's just that you may not know what's going on.

223
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You have faced more

224
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but that's that's the mind, that's the mind of a sort of our child like self. That's the mind of the denial, the addict being an adult, where we have to look at difficult choices. It does take

225
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes the toughness that you're feeling right now. Oh snap, I gotta get my head out of the sand. I don't want to do that. I don't want to think about that.

226
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.650
Nicole Roybal: Go do it like this. Right.

227
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But guess what, Nicole.

228
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it means that you caught it.

229
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This month, or may

230
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead of waiting three years. What if you caught it and you saved thousands of dollars.

231
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at it like that, like, oh, hey, if I hadn't talked to one about it, maybe I would have really screwed myself.

232
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe I'll prove when wrong and it's all subsidized and I don't have to worry about it. Maybe it'll mean you'll be motivated to register for school at least half time. I don't know what the outcome is going to be

233
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll see.

234
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.420
Nicole Roybal: We're good at half full. Not half empty.

235
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Might as well.

236
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.930
Okay, yeah.

237
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you did it in January.

238
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:52.320
Yeah.

239
00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you ever see any of these words like a Stafford Loan or Perkins loan.

240
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.360
Nicole Roybal: Yes, seen those words. Yes.

241
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or yes, I

242
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:09.540
Nicole Roybal: Like the internet right now so I can log in and show you all the stuff, but I could

243
00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.780
Nicole Roybal: I could go to it after we're done, and take screenshots and show you what like it says

244
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay to

245
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.280
Nicole Roybal: Sure you can help me figure

246
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we do this.

247
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you log out. Take a picture of one that you really are most confused about. And we'll take a look at it together.

248
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.070
Nicole Roybal: Okay, give me like five minutes.

249
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:35.880
Yeah.

250
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I just got it literally as he said that this is all it basically said open

251
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:22.170
Nicole Roybal: From March timber of this year because the other thing going on. But then it said the daily interest a crewman is $1 something a day or something. I'm looking at the picture. I don't know.

252
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.110
Nicole Roybal: website to get more

253
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Opening it now. I'm actually just trying to drop it in somewhere so I can look at. Okay, here we go. Now I've got it somewhere that we can look at it.

254
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

255
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at it here.

256
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll do this. So with passage of the cares act the interest rate on all federal student loans owned by the Department of Education.

257
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is reduced reduced to zero between

258
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: March.

259
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

260
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Follow our blog for daily updates or reach out to a concierge advisor. If you have any questions. So you have this, the average interest rate is 4.5 4.4 or five current monthly payment.

261
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is supposed to be 101. Do you remember you used to make that payment.

262
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.690
Nicole Roybal: Know, um,

263
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.940
Nicole Roybal: They had me paying whenever I was in school me paying $80

264
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Or

265
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.330
Nicole Roybal: Whatever I could pay. Honestly, but I would usually pay 40 to 80

266
00:32:50.190 --> 00:33:00.420
Nicole Roybal: Every month but it didn't matter when I was going to school, like it was like, there's like a different payment separate from the student loan like this actual student loan payment.

267
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:07.950
Nicole Roybal: Not fair like that, you're not gonna have to pay until after you graduate. Once you're going to draw will take it out of that money from your job.

268
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Notice how on that other website that we were looking at debt. There's a deferment while you're at least in class part time. Do you remember seeing that

269
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's that may be what they were talking about this isn't a. This isn't a lot of information.

270
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I would want to get on the phone with them. So these are the things I would be asking, I would say, ma'am.

271
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see the status of my loan.

272
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you can't you can't see that it's in deferment I can't sleep.

273
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I

274
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.190
Nicole Roybal: Might be another website. I have to go to sleep.

275
00:33:47.700 --> 00:34:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd say, I can't see if I'm in deferment I can't see if I'm in forbearance and when those end. I'd also like to know if it's accruing if there is an my on subsidized portion is accruing interest and at what rate.

276
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I were back enrolled in school, could I postpone again making a payment.

277
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I like to stay on top of this, but at the same time. I'm not earning a living right now. And so let's talk about how I can both make sure this doesn't be this loan doesn't get so big that I can't pay it back.

278
00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if I understood if I look at this, then I'm like, oh, I'm paying whatever 3030 days in a month. Let me grab my calendar no 30 times

279
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: 1.22 equals 36 I'm accruing $36 a month to my debt. The way I read this.

280
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a bad interest rate, by the way.

281
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's true, and it looks like the government has helped out during this crisis and they're

282
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not getting charged and interest rate during March through September. So you're having because of the epidemic. I'm guessing that's what this is. This is probably a brand new piece of information.

283
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be curious. I'm gonna I'm gonna check on that myself actually

284
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

285
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.950
Nicole Roybal: I go back to school how accruing $36 a month.

286
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.440
Nicole Roybal: What did you say

287
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what, here's what I would do. Nicole, I would say I was very nice to them. I say thank you for taking time and talking with me. I want to stay on top of my loan, please tell me how much

288
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is subsidized and under, under what is it eight Perkins. What's the name of it, please. Is it Perkins is it

289
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the who's my lender whose is it. Is this a federally funded loan. So there's going to be a BB to portion. So how much of it is subsidized and thank you, man. Thank you for that number and how much is unsubsidized and who's my lender.

290
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And they can say, I don't know. I don't know. I say, well, who might know that and then maybe you won't get far enough, and maybe there'll be there'll be like, I can't tell you because people bank sell loans. I know this is craziness, but

291
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: They might sell your bank three different they might sell your loan three different three different lenders or 10 different lenders, so it moves around. It's weird. Yeah, it's good creepy.

292
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But anyway.

293
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got six minutes here. So those would be my first two minutes. How much of this is subsidized how much is unsubsidised

294
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I in a deferment. Am I in forbearance.

295
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm in deferment great for when does it end. Oh, I'm in forbearance. Oh great, when does it end. Do you see those are. I don't know what they're going to say, so I don't. But either way, I'm going to say, well,

296
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the duration of that. Okay, thank you, sir, ma'am. What if I enrolled in school part time, can I extend my deferment thank you ma'am, can I extend my forbearance. How many credits. Do I need to have. Do I need to be making

297
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: An interest only payment. I don't want this to go out of control. You get all of that.

298
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then at the end, you may decide to clarify your original information which was ma'am, sir.

299
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I left my last conversation thinking I never had to pay this loan back

300
00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Would your office ever say that to anyone under what circumstances. I wonder how I came to that reasoning. I wonder how I came to that conclusion and they might tell you I honest to god don't know. I don't know. But I'd ask

301
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.400
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

302
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you left can call

303
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because you left thinking I went to school and I have to pay back

304
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.150
Nicole Roybal: Not exactly. But yeah, kinda.

305
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.060
Nicole Roybal: Be that much.

306
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you go to school thinking you're going to pay back your loan when you left to call the last time you talked with them.

307
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:46.530
Nicole Roybal: Well, I had to get a job and the job to pay it off and there's little bit out of my checks every month, but I didn't get a job.

308
00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:48.900
Nicole Roybal: And I'm painting it

309
00:38:50.130 --> 00:39:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I've never heard of that, where the job you talking about the employer. So if you work for me. I pay for your student loan or it's automatically withdrawn like taxes from your check

310
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.480
Nicole Roybal: Exactly.

311
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're paying you're paying for it. You're with

312
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Your pan. Got it. Yeah.

313
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:09.180
But now,

314
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.050
Nicole Roybal: Okay, what is it that they're going to like give me a job and that job, like most students, keep the job that they give them for like their externship and

315
00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:23.130
Nicole Roybal: They sent me to like worst places like the worst people. So I don't know.

316
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, those are very much side issues, but you're not working. And so let's let me check in with you. I only have a couple minutes before this group starts. But I want to ask you something, Nicole. How are you, how are you, how are you doing with what we just did.

317
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.530
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

318
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:45.630
Nicole Roybal: It's been

319
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool, right now, with no this exercise. What was this like

320
00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:00.330
Nicole Roybal: Honestly, I feel a lot better. I got a lot more information. And now I actually feel a little bit more confident to talk to them.

321
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

322
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.750
Nicole Roybal: Now I know what to ask what to say.

323
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:06.570
Nicole Roybal: How to say without sounding stupid.

324
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.760
Nicole Roybal: Like I wasn't sure how to word anything, you know. Now I know some of the words so

325
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.050
Nicole Roybal: It definitely helped a lot with the confidence. Good.

326
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's outside of I've been doing this recently with so I clients and it's way outside a typical what I was trained to do

327
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've been watching you guys and a lot of you don't have that sort of upbringing, where this is what a parent should be doing.

328
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what am I going to keep you know what I'm trying to say. Like if I keep sort of saying, well, that's not my role. I'm not a parent. I'm not a parent. I'm not her parent. I'm not his parent

329
00:40:53.970 --> 00:41:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's happening is those parents aren't stepping up and you guys are stuck, not knowing words and not knowing stuff. So this week, especially I've been doing a lot of what you and I just did, where I just

330
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I just pull up how to get a GED. I just pull it up and let's go look at it. Let's go find out what reading comprehension really is and see if this belief about yourself is real.

331
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then come to find out. It's really, it's not as bad as people think our mind. Oh my gosh, she's so creative. It just thinks it's just it gets busy coming up with the worst scenarios. It's never it's never as bad once you get there.

332
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:34.440
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

333
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The words. Yeah.

334
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the key is, even though they can come at you with more fancy talk

335
00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have a right to say, Joe, I got to fill in a name because it works that are Joe

336
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you have some things you probably have a list of things that you want to cover with every color, but I'm calling to get three answers. Number one, how much do I owe that subsidized

337
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How much is unsubsidized and I want to know the interest rate. And I'd like to know when the, when that deferment

338
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if I'm in forbearance when that ends and I will have to start making a payment, even if it's only

339
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Interest only even if its interest only payments which means none of it goes to the principal that's that $9,000 chunk. Remember, you know, principle is the main chunk.

340
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And even if its interest only payments Joe Yeah, I know you got some really important things to share with me, but on the front end and you bulldoze

341
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in charge of that conversation and you're sweet and you just say, I know you want to talk about these things over here, but I've got to come away with these these answers or

342
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This this call, I end up having to call again tomorrow. So let's see if we can get, get this information. Sorry. Hold on, Joe. Hold on, I'm writing this down, hold on, please.

343
00:42:51.150 --> 00:43:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, and you right. You have a right to do that. He's not the boss of you. He's just some dude that got this job that knows a few fancy words and that this isn't you know better, you

344
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, my dear. I gotta bounce. Okay.

345
00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.240
Nicole Roybal: Another appointment on Tuesday.

346
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to meet Friday, May 8 at 11

347
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Same way we're doing it now. Yeah. Okay. Then I will see you then.

348
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll message, your doctor right now that you're here. I don't know if you need medication, but I'll just message.

349
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.330
Nicole Roybal: See you later, I'm good, I'm good.
