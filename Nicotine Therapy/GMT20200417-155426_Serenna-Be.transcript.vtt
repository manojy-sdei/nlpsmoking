00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.090
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Yeah.

98
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.300

99
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.560
No.

100
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.300
Serenna Beers: Okay.

101
00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:01.080
Serenna Beers: Well, one of the things about me is, is my specialty is I'm actually trauma is my specialty.

102
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:14.280
Serenna Beers: I, you know, and this isn't anything that we need to do in the next month or anything like like that because you would need to be, you know, somewhat emotionally stable as far as i'm not saying that you're unstable. But you know what I mean, like, there

103
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:24.030
Serenna Beers: There would need to be some time, you know, I don't know how much time that you have off of opiates, or if you're even all the way off of them. Yet, if you've induced with Suboxone yet.

104
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.670
Serenna Beers: But, but

105
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:36.660
Serenna Beers: I do a technique called em, Dr. And it's just where I use a wand and you move your eyes back and forth, left, left and right which stimulates

106
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:52.290
Serenna Beers: Ram. And so it's really your subconscious conscious that I tap into. And I bring all the trauma up from the nervous system where it where it gets stuck to your work working met Emory. So you can process it the way that your brain was meant to

107
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.780
Serenna Beers: Versus how your brain does. So your brain when there is a trunk traumatic event goes whoa.

108
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.700
Serenna Beers: Nope, and pushes it down right

109
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.250
Serenna Beers: We don't deal with it. We don't want to feel

110
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.210
Serenna Beers: It, hence why

111
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:19.350
Serenna Beers: You are substances, you know, in the beginning, you, you probably use substances to feel so like in the beginning you used to feel, but in the end, when it's at its worst and addiction just can troll the trolls your whole life, you use not to feel right.

112
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:20.820
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Yeah.

113
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:38.370
Serenna Beers: And so, you know, that's just something to kind of put in the back of your mind, if, if you ever felt like that was anything that you wanted to work on. I just wanted you to know that that is one, one thing that I do is work with folks around their trauma.

114
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:41.790
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Okay.

115
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.700

Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Yeah.

159
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:32.310
Serenna Beers: Are All right. Okay. So three things. The first one was, you want to get off opiates, or you want to sustain being off of them and follow through with this medication.

160
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.450
Serenna Beers: Assistance and then what is a couple of other other things.

161
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:37.980
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: I'm

162
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.210
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Just gonna be a better person. I think I don't know really. I don't

163
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.690
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: That's the main factor. Okay.

164
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.920
Serenna Beers: What do you think me being a better person means

165
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.660
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: As far as like, what type of

166
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.120
Serenna Beers: qualities do you want to have

167
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.320
Well,

168
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.800
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: I already have already have good qualities. People say, I'm too nice.

169
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.640
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Guys.

170
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.200
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: And they play on that.

171
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.400
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Mm hmm.

172
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.960
That is the worst.

173
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:23.730
Serenna Beers: It's the worst because P P people with big hearts, you know, I know from experience, you know, you open yourself up to hurt but

174
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:40.980
Serenna Beers: Yeah, important that you don't let your heart hardened because others can't really accept being somebody being good to them, you know, and that's that's the hard part is balancing the big heart giving heart with not being taken advantage of.

175
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.090
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Right. And I've been taking advantage of for a long time now.

176
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:45.990
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

177
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.920
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Right People I want to try to help like the homeless.

178
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.430
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Mm hmm. Now did you steal from me.

179
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.200
Serenna Beers: Yeah, which makes it really difficult to open up right

180
00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.850
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: Why, and

181
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.260
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: And

182
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.180
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: They just

183
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.670
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: You know, everywhere I go. There's somebody screwing with me everywhere.

184
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:10.950
Moto E (4) Dr Daux Bakper: You know,

185
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.360
