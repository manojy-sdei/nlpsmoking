00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:14.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you know you've been you've been taking all of this stuff regularly in jail for a year and a half, right.

128
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:26.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so I mean it's it's unfortunate to be in jail. Like, I can't even imagine. But in a, in a sense, it gave your life and your health, some order. It sounds like

129
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:37.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, that's good. Um, what happened that led you to the jail. Like was it drug possession or selling or what was going on.

130
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.420
LG K40: It was a drug possession

131
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:50.460
LG K40: I was arrested for drug possession, and I still had some drugs in my family and when they got me down to the jail, they

132
00:11:51.030 --> 00:12:04.650
LG K40: Found it. And apparently I didn't realize that they hadn't found it. I thought that they searched me and found it, but apparently they are looking at. So when I got down to the jail. It became a felony instead of a misdemeanor possession. And so, you know,

133
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.950
LG K40: It is what it is. I, I

134
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:24.480
LG K40: I believe that the cop was just doing that to try to get me for a felony, but I did, I did 16 months in jail for that trying to bring the drugs and into the institution, but I really wasn't trying to but

135
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.110
LG K40: I'm also on federal probation.

136
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're on probation.

137
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so part of the process. So you got out of jail just recently right just maybe what

138
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: 10 days ago to

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.800
LG K40: Yes. Oh.

140
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:52.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so I'm part of your routine now is to check in with your probation officer, then, is it a weekly check in. How often do you go to the probation officer.

141
00:12:52.440 --> 00:13:04.350
LG K40: Oh I I'm well I'm on. I'm on house arrest. So I because what happened was they gave me seven months from my probation violation. After the after the 16 months.

142
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:17.220
LG K40: So I went to Sacramento to do the violation and the Kobe started happening and I serve two months of it and they decided to just let me out for the other five. Okay.

143
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.570

Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. Okay, so you're living

162

LG K40: With a friend.

163
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.110
And

164
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.230
LG K40: You know, my family, obviously, isn't that great influence on me. So

165
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:56.490
LG K40: That really wasn't an option. I mean I guess I would have had to go there if I had to because coronavirus being what it is, and I can't. I really can't afford to get it if I haven't already caught it, but

166
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.940
LG K40: Yeah. So I'm saying with a friend.

167
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:08.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: How was that arrangement. So far, how is the arrangement is your friend gonna support you. You think continue to do that. Is it okay

168
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.480
LG K40: Um, well, yeah, I mean, I'm on house arrest here. So there's really no backing out

169
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.190
LG K40: Yeah.

170
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:25.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're stuck. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And he's your friend is your friends sober or

171
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.070
LG K40: Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. They don't usually use

172
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:47.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Drink. Good. And so I think you made it sounds like you made the right choice because you really need that kind of environment you need that kind of environment to support your probation your sobriety, or you know yeah okay um

173
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, what was I gonna say

174
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, tell me about any history of suicidal thoughts or

175
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:06.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Any, any danger of suicidal. Do we have a risk of that right now or in the path.

176
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.940
LG K40: No, never.

177
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:22.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's great. So, low, low to no risk of suicide. Okay, great. Um, and in terms of allergies to medications. Do you have allergies.

178
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.430
LG K40: Not to any medications, but I do have really bad allergies.

179
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:27.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like seasonal

180
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.760
LG K40: Yeah, really bad right now.

181
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:42.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really bad. Okay. Um, if you do take like you can try taking like a leg RA, or Zyrtec or Claritin maybe that might help.

182
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.430
LG K40: Yeah, that probably would help.

183
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:58.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so something like that in terms of your meds, the HIV meds, the crayon and the Gabba Penton. Do you have a physician, that's going to be giving you these continue to give them or what's going on with that.

184
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:13.590
LG K40: Oh, I mean, I guess it's really hard to get appointments or anything out here right now but I sure that there is a physician somewhere, you know, I'm gonna have to check that out. I have a 30 day supply

185
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:14.790
So,

186
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.340
LG K40: Yeah, you can't even get into it like I I was having trouble getting my

187
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:36.660
LG K40: Foods number three says for my health, health insurance benefits are the medical benefits and the partnership, because there's they're not open can't just walk in there so you know it took me like a week and a half, just to finally get down there to get the number

188
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, yeah, yeah.

189
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.580
LG K40: So I'm going to work on that.

190
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:55.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, please. Work on that because it's essential, you got to have your medications regularly. So I would say you need a good primary care doctor or an HIV specialist either one.

191
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.580
LG K40: Okay.

192
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: One of the two

193
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:05.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you need that. So really put that as your priority right now, these days. That's what you should be trying to figure out

194
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:14.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe Googling or yelping in the area for HIV specialist or primary care doctors

195
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:25.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then calling their offices, leaving messages saying I'm on medical partnership, whatever. Do you accept my insurance, you know, that kind of thing.

196
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:36.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: You can go about it that way or you call you also call partnership. If you can get through and you say, I need a primary care near me. Who's, who's going to be my doctor

197
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.550
LG K40: Okay, I'll do that.

198
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:53.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Both ways so that in 30 days we get you connected. Yeah, okay, because these are essential meds for you. It's like these are very essential medications. You can't go without them, you really need all of them.

199
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.600
Okay.

200
00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:07.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I'm gonna keep pushing you whenever I see you. I'm going to remind you, and ask, okay, so I'll, I'll keep badgering you hey did you work on trying to find the doctor yet. Okay.

201
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.340
LG K40: All right.

202
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:18.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, um, what else I'm gonna see here oh surgeries. Have you had any surgeries.

203
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Any surgeries.

204
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.560
LG K40: Or threat any surgery.

205
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:31.170
LG K40: Yeah, I had, I had a chest to put in 2008 for collapse one

206
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.670
LG K40: Okay.

207
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: collapsed lung. Wow. Okay.

208
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's a new, more thorax.

209
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, um,

210
00:19:45.690 --> 00:20:06.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: And normally, normally just for review of systems. Do you have any gastric problems like now that you're taking the crayon deuce do still have problems with, you know, like pooping or peeing or stomach aches. Do you have any chest pains, anything that's going on with you.

211
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.060
LG K40: Know a really bad heartburn about it but I take a medication for that.

212
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, you take the protonix the Pen Tool personal. Okay.

213
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.690
Okay.

214
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:25.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. Okay, so the heartburn, you have to watch that I'm

215
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:40.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: And now, now that you've been sober in jail. Do you feel, how do you feel, looking back at your life. I mean, you had this this was a year and a half, where you really were forced

216
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:57.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: To reflect and look back and revisit you know like how your life has been with meth. Do you feel fortunate that you haven't been using. Do you feel grateful. Do you feel unsure, like how are you feeling

217
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.670
LG K40: Well, I mean, it's like if I if I had

218
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:12.090
LG K40: I just wasted. A YEAR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE sitting in jail. So you know if I'd been using George, please. I would have an excuse, but

219
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:20.490
LG K40: I don't know. I've sat in the county jail for 16 months and I pretty. It was pretty much unproductive. The whole time, so

220
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.380
LG K40: I don't know.

221
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.480
LG K40: It's just, I'm just tired of being in jail in prison.

222
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:43.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so you're you're yeah you're in this mindset of I gotta get out of this. I'm so full. I want to get out of this whole legal stuff so that I can move on with my life. So you're focused on that.

223
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.180
LG K40: Right, yeah.

224
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:58.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I would say, you know, I have to commend you for you and you should too. You should give yourself credit, you're saying you are unproductive. But being sober.

225
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:13.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is so big being sober allowed your brain to heal because math is very toxic to your brain. It can really start causing some blurriness and you know just inability to do things right and your sharpness goes away.

226
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:35.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, you can start getting paranoid. So it's really actually very fortunate that you had 16 full months. Nothing. No, no exposure to your brain. So that actually is a big deal. So it's almost like you were in rehab for 16 months.

227
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.070
LG K40: Yeah. So yeah.

228
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:46.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know what I mean. So, so in a way it's you feel like, oh, I didn't do anything by life. But on the other hand, it's like

229
00:22:46.980 --> 00:23:00.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know what, I stayed clean. Like, that's amazing. Like, I haven't done that since I was before I was 12 right. So, I mean, give yourself some credit and try to remember that because that's a big deal.

230
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:20.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: And hopefully I hope with this support of the person you're living with and you know the the the legal trouble that you want to get out of hopefully you can continue this path of, like, I'm not going to use. I'm just going to continue this clean path. Yeah.

231
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:27.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: I hope so. You know, I think I would I would do that.

232
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:37.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: When you're using. Were you kind of inconsistent with your medications.

233
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.370
Yeah.

234
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.350
LG K40: Yeah, so was

235
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.400
LG K40: Sometimes I wouldn't have any sometimes I wouldn't have any medication.

236
00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

237
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.450
LG K40: Um, you know, I just really or I forget to take him.

238
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.520
LG K40: So,

239
00:23:53.910 --> 00:24:02.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's the other piece, you know, HIV is a big deal. You know, it really, that's the other thing it can be after a while they can get toxic to your brain to your body.

240
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:13.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: And taking your medication, even though they have side effects, the medication really suppresses the virus, so that you don't get those brain effects as much right

241
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:23.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's the other plus 16 months you took your meds consistently and you kept your virus levels down you you gave yourself the gift of health.

242
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:37.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, that's awesome. And yet another reason why it's so important that you stay sober, because you have to take care of you and you can't be taking care of you, if you're out of your mind and you're just kind of floating around, right.

243
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:49.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let alone also like the risk of spreading spreading disease to other people. If you are not taking your meds. Right. So always important.

244
00:24:49.980 --> 00:25:03.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: You to think of yourself first, but then also everyone around you because I'm assuming the way you got it. I'm assuming you got it because of someone who shared with you a needle or something that didn't tell you

245
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.060
LG K40: Yes, I got it, I think.

246
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:23.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: And that's just horrible. You know, like the and maybe they didn't know they had it, but maybe they did and they weren't taking their meds and, you know, like it's just so again it's it's about you first, but then everyone else gets affected by you taking care of you.

247
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:38.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I so I would again repeat that. I don't think you wasted time you wasted time, in a certain sense, you feel frustrated. It seems like it was a very unfair, unjust.

248
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:57.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: jail time for you because you didn't intend to do what they said you did not cool, but in a weird way. It just kind of put you in this zone where you were like, you have to take your meds, you have to stay clean and you're good. You like did it so

249
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know I'm

250
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay blessing and a curse you know

251
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.280
LG K40: What's that

252
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's like a blessing and a curse.

253
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.480
LG K40: Yes. Yeah. Yes.

254
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:23.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm OK. So the way we're going to continue the way the program works is you you meet with me and the therapist.

255
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: in a group setting once a week.

256
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:34.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, we have a group that meets on Mondays at 9am

257
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.900
LG K40: You think my name is honey.

258
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: on day nine. Yep.

259
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.250
LG K40: Okay, do you

260
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you able to wake up at like 830 and log on.

261
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.310
LG K40: Yeah.

262
00:26:47.730 --> 00:27:01.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so if you can set your alarm every Monday 830 to log on you log on to the virtual clinic, the same number. Zoom number you call today to get to meet you know the one you checked in.

263
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.490
LG K40: Okay.

264
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:09.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: That same virtual clinic you you log in there and you say, Hey, I'm supposed to do group with Dr. Allah DAG.

265
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:10.950
LG K40: Okay.

266
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:24.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: And they check you. And they say, okay, fill out the survey. Okay. You're checked in. Here's the zoom number every time it changes. So they say here's their zoom number today. And then at nine you log into the zoom number

267
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:26.460
LG K40: Okay.

268
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:44.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's every Monday we'll see you. I think you'll I think you'll enjoy the group. I actually have a bunch of guys in there right now there are no women. I have just guys. There are a few that have methamphetamine specifically as their problem so they can relate

269
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then I have some opioid, we have a lot of opioid use people

270
00:27:50.910 --> 00:28:04.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. But regardless, everyone's. It's a very positive. I find that it's a very positive like group to support each other, you know, it's just a conversation once a week.

271
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:22.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I go through and talk to each one of you as a doctor, you know, because some of you need medication for the opioid problem. So I treat those people with you all check in with you. But since we're not doing men's it won't be very long, we'll go through and then we have the whole group conversation.

272
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.480
LG K40: Okay.

273
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:35.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's Mondays and then you individually should schedule a visit with your therapist, so you will get assigned a therapist with us.

274
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:49.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you should call the virtual clinic and say okay I I spoke to the doctor. I'm going to do her groups on Mondays and I need an appointment with my therapist.

275
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.730
LG K40: So you can call

276
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.150
LG K40: Call the virtual clinic for

277
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.940
LG K40: Therapy apply to therapists.

278
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:57.720

LG K40: All right.

280
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:10.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you meet with her or him and then you guys decide okay every two weeks, you can meet individually or whatever, you know, whatever frequency you and her decide

281
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:21.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you do weekly group with me. But you do individual therapy with her as frequently as you guys decide. So

282
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:31.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's the program, really, that is the program and then I believe once a month, you will receive an envelope with your drug tests.

283
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:47.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's like a drug test cup so don't open the envelope. Just call virtual clinic, tell them, hey, I got the envelope. Show them your opening. You know, you do your drug screen, you show them. Okay, the temperature. That's kind of how we do it. So that's once a month. So that's the

284
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:58.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, and if you can do that if you can wake up and just check in at 830 on Mondays, you'll be doing the program you'll be part of our team, you know, our group and

285
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:09.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think it'll encourage you to keep doing what you've been doing hopefully in the outside world, even though you're on house arrest. It's still different, you know, and you're still yeah

286
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.140
LG K40: Yeah, definitely.

287
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's an adjustment. Right.

288
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.910
LG K40: Yeah, yeah. And it's especially right now with everything that's going on outside. It's like

289
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:31.440
LG K40: It's a weird time to be getting out of jail after 16 months because I remember from when I went in to to just being thrown into the middle of this is like a lot of anxiety, you know,

290
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cuz yeah I

291
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.900
LG K40: Don't want to catch that.

292
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:49.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, no. Yeah, exactly. It's like it's anxiety. So, we will talk about that too in the group because yeah we're globally. It's so weird. But we're all having this very strange anxiety, fear.

293
00:30:51.270 --> 00:31:06.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, at times, it's frustration because of the economics, you know, because because of this, we can't work, a lot of people aren't able to work. And so they're frustrated with the finances, but at the same time, they don't want to get sick. So yeah, it's

294
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.770
LG K40: Yeah.

295
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:18.090
