00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just take it down. Just take it one step at a time. You know, this whole whole thing with CPS really, it can be overwhelming.

104
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You feel horrible. You know, you're stressed out.

106
00:07:48.840 --> 00:08:03.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it feels like it that you know you're running, running in place, but just go through the steps. And do you know what it is that you got to do one step at a time and don't be discouraged, you know, don't be discouraged.

107
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is, you know, really a fight and

108
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the best, you know, the best thing that you can do is stay sober continue doing what you're doing. You know what I mean you suit up show up.

109
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:30.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And do it 100% do it above and beyond, because they don't know how to handle when you doing it above and beyond, you know, definitely.

110
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Want to like read three groups.

111
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.780
Dawn Ninham: But it was fine when we're doing three groups really class time, you know, so I'm just going to do a group every day.

112
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because

113
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.140
There's a week.

114
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And don't forget, also, that you want to get a sponsor you want to do.

115
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do the work that

116
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.600

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.130

120
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My gosh. Okay, so I let me kind of explain to you a little bit how it works. Okay, so you go to meetings and you find one that you like.

121
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you find a meeting that the people that are attending the meeting are serious about recovery. Right.

122
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That are there for the right reasons.

123
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:32.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You listen to the women in the room, listen to their stories. Listen to how their life has changed since they got sober.

124
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are they, do they have more than a year and recovery.

125
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are they working with others.

126
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:53.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you find that person that you connect with in that in in what they share like what they share will will grab ahold of you, it'll have your attention. Yeah.

127
00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:05.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the person that you want to approach and say, you know, look, I'm new. And I need to find a sponsor, you know, can you be my temporary sponsor or permanent sponsor sponsor.

128
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:19.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And put yourself out there, even when you go to a meeting and they asked if there's any newcomers. And would you like to share. And you can say, My name is Dawn, you know, and I am desperate need to find a sponsor.

129
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And people will raise their hands. They'll give you phone numbers. Okay.

130
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's how you get a sponsor.

131
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:28.800
Dawn Ninham: Okay, good.

132
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:36.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's pretty it's pretty simple. But when people don't have all the information and know what to do. It's hard to

133
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:36.630
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

134
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, grab ahold of the right person. Okay.

135
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.270

138
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: gain strength in your recovery, they help you help you build relationships with sober women.

139
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:14.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, there's different things that that you can do within the curry community. You know, it opens the doorway for so much

140
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to build build friendships build support systems.

141
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:31.800

142
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For

143
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:47.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know proof that they're doing what they need to do. You know, so you want to center yourself when you go to these meetings with people that I have more than a year in recovery and that are doing the deal.

144
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.450
Okay.

145
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.560

Dawn Ninham: I told my even my husband says he wants. He's ready. He told me go to do everything but and they the end. Very end question that court was um if if they deny reunification, would you still go to a God. And he said, Yeah.

188
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know, and, you know, you can definitely you know this is not an easy. It's not an easy disease. It's just not. It's just not an easy thing to get under control and

189
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:24.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But once you start and you have days under your belt and you're doing what you need to do.

190
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then it becomes easier.

191
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know. Yeah, I know.

192
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.750

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What happened.

195
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.940
Dawn Ninham: After the three months.

196
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.610
Dawn Ninham: Oh, oh, that's when I the first six months was going on and then

197
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:57.810
Dawn Ninham: We're supposed to buy a house. And so he went to court and I was for the kids stay in foster care for one week one more week we had already gotten her kids back

198
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:09.720
Dawn Ninham: And we realized BECAUSE CHELSEA find out like three weeks later, Charles for Henry took all the money so we could buy the house versus move into so but we let that become our, I guess.

199
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.350
Dawn Ninham: I'm excuse

200
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.340

You know,

206
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is probably

207
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The hardest part of

208
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:44.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting your life together. When you've got to deal with children services and you've got to do all these jump through all these hoops and

209
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you see a bunch of information and the paperwork that you know your perception is not true and

210
00:17:52.890 --> 00:18:05.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, the judge it feels like you're being judged. Every time you walk into court and you know you don't feel like it's never enough. I mean, this is this is a common thing when it comes to them, but I am here to tell you that I've seen people

211
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:14.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pull it, pull it out and you know get their kids back when they never thought that they had a chance to

212
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:26.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until you cannot give up to the last, you know, to the last minute. Don't give up. You keep fighting. You just keep doing it. You do above and beyond what they want you to do.

213
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:39.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And you just compile the information start making the changes in your head, you know, learn what you're going through. You know, work with people. And I'm telling you, it just makes a big huge difference.

214
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:52.710
Dawn Ninham: Is there on the online classes there a way to get a signature or BECAUSE I'M THINKING LIKE THESE PEOPLE, BUT WHEN THAT GUY SAID IN COURT, HE WAS LIKE HE'S LIKE DO YOU KNOW, whoever Cassandra whoever whoever blender.
