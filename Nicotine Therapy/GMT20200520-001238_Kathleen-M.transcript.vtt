68
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.100
Kristina’s 11: I was seeing him every, every two weeks, or every two weeks and then go others like

69
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.930
Kristina’s 11: So I've seen him twice a month technically

70
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.480
Kristina’s 11: And he had me on so many perks. I'd like

71
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.020
Kristina’s 11: I was throwing up in like whole pills. It was so much

72
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.390
Kristina’s 11: And then he got arrested.

73
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.250
Kristina’s 11: And that's just kind of

74
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.810
Dr. Marshall: Yeah.

75
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.270
Dr. Marshall: You said right after that then you went on to box on but then weren't able to pay for it at some point.

76
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.620
Kristina’s 11: Get back and forth to the meetings because we only have one clinic around where I'm from.

77
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.030
Dr. Marshall: Am. Okay.

78
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:13.800
Kristina’s 11: It was a drive. And I was in school and working and I'm a single mom with two kids. I just couldn't get to all the movies and stuff and then Medicaid also came back and said we're not paying for this anymore. So I owe them like a whole bunch of money.

79
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.360
Dr. Marshall: So then. Take me to after jail you're using heroin. How did you get from that to back on Suboxone

80
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.710
Kristina’s 11: Um, I just kind of like took a look at it and realize that that's not the lifestyle. I wanted anymore.

81
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:46.050
Kristina’s 11: Like, I guess I just went back to that because that's what I knew. That's who I thought I was, you know, was struggling because I've been selling drugs forever. You know, and that's what I knew, and so I guess I just was so lost about who I was. I just went back to it like an idiot and

82
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.160
Kristina’s 11: My ex was selling heroin at the time, and he just kept giving it to me.

83
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.690
Kristina’s 11: So it was free. On top of that,

84
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.850
Dr. Marshall: But I didn't know how did you get from heroin to. Yeah.

85
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:06.240
Kristina’s 11: No, actually I just kind of just did it myself. I just went back to I found a doctor that I could afford. I just

86
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:16.950
Kristina’s 11: Was sick of the lifestyle, the people that everything like was too old for it. So I went and found a doctor and it was going fine until I paid him late and that's when you kick me out.

87
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.170
Dr. Marshall: Okay, okay. So how long have you been with with that doctor

88
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.330
Kristina’s 11: I was with him for about a year, I don't know, maybe two.

89
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.510
Kristina’s 11: Okay, and then he just totally dropped me

90
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.430
Dr. Marshall: So have you been on Suboxone now the past time for about one or two years.

91
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.810
Kristina’s 11: Yes.

92
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.500
Kristina’s 11: I just haven't been able to be consistent with it. Yeah.

93
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.000
Kristina’s 11: Because I always lose a doctor like either it's money. I just can't afford it.

94
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:54.780
Kristina’s 11: So I couldn't even begin to get like on the road to recovery. Oh, and then he told me that when I was like, What can we do I start dosing down that doctor was like you know you'll be on this for the rest of your life.

95
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.460
Kristina’s 11: So,

96
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.350
Dr. Marshall: And and what do you think of that.

97
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.330
Kristina’s 11: I cried.

98
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.440
Dr. Marshall: Okay.

99
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.360
Dr. Marshall: Like, that's not what I was

100
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.110
Kristina’s 11: Looking for

101
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.730

Dr. Marshall: No, I'm. Have you ever had any overdoses.

103
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:19.080
Kristina’s 11: No, no, I never used a needle or anything like that. I got lucky. So I just ordered it here and there, but I got lucky. I never had an overdose.

104
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.410
Dr. Marshall: Okay with heroin. How did you use heroin.

152
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.440
Kristina’s 11: That bad they always catch it first. But that's on and off. But I think the first time it started was in 2005

Kristina’s 11: That was a really bad pregnancy but

158
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.190
Kristina’s 11: There was nothing like met like physically wrong with her in that sense. Like you

159
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.500
Kristina’s 11: Came out okay. She just was being dramatic.

160
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:49.020
Dr. Marshall: And all it sounds like fun look thinking of the years all your drug use started after you'd have your kid.

161
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.770
Kristina’s 11: Yes. Yes. Yeah. After the after the electrocution like I mean I had smoked weed like here and there, whatever.

163
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.290
Kristina’s 11: But I just never got into anything until the pills that

164
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.840
Kristina’s 11: I mean, that was when everything went left like really bad left

165
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.300
Kristina’s 11: Okay, like I never was into drugs until

166
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.430
Kristina’s 11: Daddy and I wasn't even trying to get into them. I trusted a doctor, like an idiot.

Dr. Marshall: No. How about your GI system do you get nausea, constipation thing.

176
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:57.600
Kristina’s 11: I mean, yeah, I had constipation issues since I've been on Suboxone. Um, I don't know, I probably just need to start eating normal and healthy.

177
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.010
Okay.

178
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.070

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.810
Kristina’s 11: No, not at all like I have a really bad sleep pattern right now too, because I'm not

180
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:16.860
Kristina’s 11: I just feel like nothing in my life is consistent right now because I feel like when I don't have my Suboxone it's something I'm always constantly thinking of

181
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:21.090
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, so I just can't seem to get everything together. If I'm still worried about

182
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.320
How I'm going to feel the next right

183
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.860

186
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.060
Kind of stuff.

187
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:48.690
Dr. Marshall: And it looks like the dose. He had been on for a while was the sublingual films that eat into the eight milligrams

188
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.370
Kristina’s 11: Twice a day. Yeah, yeah.

195
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.350
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, like I get really drowsy and then I'm good.

196
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.700
Okay.

197
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.710

206
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.330
Kristina’s 11: Not answering anymore. So I'm in the middle of trying to find new Psychiatry's so

207
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.980
Dr. Marshall: I mean, I don't know, that's a problem.

208

209
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.570
Dr. Marshall: Is that an issue. No, no.

210
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.460
Dr. Marshall: We discuss it and no then, then we know what to expect on the urine.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.650
Dr. Marshall: Test and we know what we're looking for. And so anytime. I'll always ask you, but

212
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.470

213
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:33.150
Dr. Marshall: So if you think about before I even asked you how to check and just say, Hey, listen, they changed my SOS. I'm on this or on that.

214
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:34.320
Kristina’s 11: Okay.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:58.860
Kristina’s 11: He's always been a little sheet like you know just all over the place. But, and he goes through reception reception is like like underwear. It is crazy, but

221
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:09.240
Kristina’s 11: I mean, he always. I mean, I never even once got my medicine on time, but at least got it every month. But now he's just for a few months now. It's just been missing so

222
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.060
Dr. Marshall: Great, who are you taking any medicine regularly now.

223
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:23.310
Kristina’s 11: No. Not at the moment I just because I kind of took because I used to get it out to our all day so I just broke it down into one since I get to get ahold of them. So I think that was the last time I had it was like two days ago.

224
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:24.480
Okay.

225
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.510
Dr. Marshall: And how about anything else. I do. I do been on Zoloft search or, you know, any

226
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.380
Kristina’s 11: Loft when I was in jail. They put me on it.

227
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:42.330
Kristina’s 11: Because I just thought like I was there for a while, but all of a sudden I just was like, I just want to scream. I don't know what's going on with me.

228
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:50.550
Kristina’s 11: So they asked me, like, two questions, and then they they prescribed me Zoloft there and it worked like I was on it for a while. When I got out to and then

229
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.210
Kristina’s 11: When I finally got into normal like going Suboxone clinic and stuff. I came off of it.

230
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.520
Kristina’s 11: Okay, so

231
00:16:58.950 --> 00:16:59.670
Dr. Marshall: Do you feel like

232
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.630
Dr. Marshall: You feel like you're having anxiety or depression now.

233
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.610
Kristina’s 11: Mm hmm. Yeah.

234
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:20.460
Kristina’s 11: I don't know if it's because of me feeling like everything's out of whack. Because I can't seem to get, you know, and then what this covert stuff that hasn't helped like being locked in the kids constantly and not being able to work so

235
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.780
Kristina’s 11: But

236
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.940
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, yeah. I mean, right now, but I'm hoping I'm just going to keep an eye on it because I keep a journal for it.

237
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:27.840
Kristina’s 11: Overnight depression.

238
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.480

Kristina’s 11: I had to go to their fee, because the judge when on my part of my probation, because he said I was addicted to selling drugs he put me in therapy so

283
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:23.040
Kristina’s 11: I had been going to that for a while now and I hope, like I used to think it was so stupid, but it really helped.

284
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.240
You know,

285
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.660
Dr. Marshall: So you've been in therapy since around 2017

286
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.400
Kristina’s 11: Yes, yes.

287
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.730
Okay.

288
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.570
Dr. Marshall: And is that still court mandated now.

289
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:46.020
Kristina’s 11: No, no, I finished it, but I, they said, I can continue to go and since I had already established with her. I do continue to because it's hard, finding a therapist that

290
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.360
Kristina’s 11: You know you feel comfortable with.

291
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.320
Right.

292
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.930
Dr. Marshall: Any allergies to medicine.

293
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.110
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, just ultra set and terminal you

294
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.860
Kristina’s 11: Know I like I feel like my skin's on fire.

295
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:10.680
Kristina’s 11: Okay, I don't know, I guess you'd call it a rash or something. But if like somebody even like just bumps into me. I feel like they just cut me with a knife. It's horrible. Yeah, okay.

296
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.790
Dr. Marshall: And tell me you said you're having a job interview.

297
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.030
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, I'm supposed to like you have here at the guy's house now.

298
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.620
Dr. Marshall: What other dog.

299
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:34.230
Kristina’s 11: Is called pipeline construction and my brother works for him and he needs an office help so I used to run the office at Riverside for the Ford dealership where I was from so

300
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:34.650
Dr. Marshall: Okay.

301
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.300
Kristina’s 11: And I have a degree when just college, but I just didn't go the right way after that.

302
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.300
Dr. Marshall: Okay, you have a degree from college.

303
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.180
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, I haven't associates in Applied Science

304
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:45.720
Nice.

305
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.300
Dr. Marshall: And do you have enough, you have a stable living situation right now somewhere.

306
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.960
Kristina’s 11: Yes. Yeah, I've been living in the same spot for about almost three years now.

307
00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:58.560
Dr. Marshall: Okay.

308
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.550
Kristina’s 11: I rent from my mom.

309
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.170
Dr. Marshall: Yeah, and enough food for enough money for food.

310
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.230
Kristina’s 11: Well yeah, I get food. Luckily, I still get food stamps for the kids.

311
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.400
Kristina’s 11: So that helps

312
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.090
Dr. Marshall: Yes, yeah.

313
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.100
Kristina’s 11: I don't get it for myself, but

314
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.180
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, for them to do.

315
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.300
Dr. Marshall: Women when they turn 18 does that and

316
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:29.880
Kristina’s 11: I don't know. That's what we were just talking about, I don't know, because I got to find out because Trump now saying that 17 year olds are now not you know you can't claim as a dependent. I don't know. It's going to take away his Medicaid and his food stamps when he turns 18

317
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.690
Kristina’s 11: So I got to find out. Yeah, it's Trump. I can't

318
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.500
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, my son, I wasn't able to play him on my taxes as a dependent like as

319
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.150
Kristina’s 11: A child. Yeah, he

320
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:48.810
Kristina’s 11: 17 Trump changed it to 17 so you can't like, so for the the covert checks. I didn't even get like there's nothing for him, like every 17 year old child in America didn't get anything

321
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.250
Dr. Marshall: It's so sounds like that's when they eat the most. Yeah.

322
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.970
Dr. Marshall: Yeah 17 year old boy. Yeah.

323
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:02.550
Kristina’s 11: Yeah. And trust me, I mean that boys good kid. But he plays football and he has. Yes.

324
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.630
Kristina’s 11: Yes, and he

325
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.020
Kristina’s 11: Goes he got a concussion. So I'm constantly going to the doctors and

326
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.840
Kristina’s 11: I can't believe I did.

327
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.100
Kristina’s 11: Was I just think it's

328
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.350
Dr. Marshall: Called support and no he is so far behind. I could buy a house of what he oh

329
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.200
Dr. Marshall: Yeah, okay.

330
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:21.720
Dr. Marshall: Well,

331
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.030
Dr. Marshall: So Brian, our health. The way that it works.

332
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:38.190
Dr. Marshall: You know, we do the zoom meetings we do this initial meeting. We do do a zoom group meetings and they tend to work really well because people

333
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:48.570
Dr. Marshall: say exactly what you said all the group meetings I did in the past is where I met people that I did drugs with. And since these are zoom meetings. These are not people that you're going to hang out with

334
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:50.220
Dr. Marshall: Right, very

335
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:51.780
Kristina’s 11: Good idea. Yeah.

336
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:56.640
Dr. Marshall: Yeah, yeah. And it's convenient. You don't have to go anywhere. You know, it's right there.

337
00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:05.130
Dr. Marshall: We actually have a Tuesday evening group going on seven o'clock on Tuesdays. So you could join that next week.

338
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:12.330
Dr. Marshall: And that would also be your med check in with me, so you wouldn't need another appointment we could check in during that group meeting.

339
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:18.420
Dr. Marshall: We just kind of go around the group and everyone talks about if you have anything really personal to talk to me about, we can

340
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:28.020
Dr. Marshall: You know, follow up right outside the group after but a lot. Most people you'll see a really comfortable just saying, I've been taking this dose, people will talk about when they've had a relapse.

341
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.510
Dr. Marshall: Right in the group because everyone's there to just been it's confidential and they support each other.

342
00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:41.310
Dr. Marshall: Yeah, yeah. And there's a therapist that leaves the group. Then we also do the individual therapy and

343
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:48.210
Dr. Marshall: I believe right heart health policy is that you have to at least start that even if you have your own therapy.

344
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.290
Kristina’s 11: Yeah, that's fine.

345
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:56.250
Dr. Marshall: Okay, so another good support system for you. And that's, you know, totally private but zoom session with that.

346
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:09.450
Dr. Marshall: And so the the Suboxone you've already been on it. So you know how it works. But sometimes I talk to people and they tell me. They've never it's never been described to them before how it's working. So I like to go over it.

347
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.490
Dr. Marshall: Are you still there. It's all black.

348
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.140
Kristina’s 11: Oh, sorry. I'm just walking to my

349
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.040
Kristina’s 11: Car. I'm so sorry.

350
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:14.850
Know,

351
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.390
Dr. Marshall: Otherwise, I'll talk for a minute and won't know.

352
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.200
Dr. Marshall: But so Suboxone has two medications in it.

353
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.490
Dr. Marshall: One part of the buprenorphine and one part is the clock zone.

354
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.830
Dr. Marshall: buprenorphine is what we call a partial opioid opioid agonist.

355
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:43.650
Dr. Marshall: So it partially activates your brains with those receptors. So it goes fills all the opioid receptors and works kind of partially on them so it

356
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:53.880
Dr. Marshall: controls your cravings. It also can work for pain management for some people that have pain, but it doesn't have that same effect of that euphoria that really high feeling

357
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.020
Dr. Marshall: Yeah, you don't

358
00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.950
Dr. Marshall: And then you don't get those dips and withdrawals. So it allows you to be a functioning person to be yourself to

359
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.470
Dr. Marshall: Take care of your kids, you know,

360
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:22.080
Dr. Marshall: Be regulated, then the locks on part that's in it will block the opioid, but because you take it under the tongue. And the last one doesn't do anything if you tried to melt it down and ingest it, then, then the locks own would block out the buprenorphine.

361
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.310
Dr. Marshall: So the reason

362
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:28.860
Dr. Marshall: Yeah, they put it in there to protect people from trying to get high on their buprenorphine.

363
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:37.860
Kristina’s 11: I thought the no oxygen because I always thought it was a blocker like so if I would took my Suboxone and then I was like trying to take a Percocet. I thought that's what it blocks. No.

364
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:57.630
Dr. Marshall: Percocet and you're on Suboxone you won't feel much because you have an orphan, even though it's only a partial agonist it latches on more strongly. Which is why you probably may know this from experience. If you're on an opioid and then you take Suboxone you will get knocked into withdrawal.

365
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:06.810
Dr. Marshall: Yeah, yeah. And that's because the buprenorphine will knock the opioids off your brain is going too fast. What's are all

366
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.720
Dr. Marshall: So that's important to know if you ever have a relapse.

367
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.680
Dr. Marshall: Or when if anybody you know get a hold of your Suboxone

368
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:27.750
Dr. Marshall: The way to take it as you want to at least be in some amount of withdrawal before you take any Suboxone and if you're on. Do you want to take a small dose of awesome to start. So you don't knock yourself into full withdraw.

369
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.850
Kristina’s 11: Okay. Yeah. Yes. So,

370
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:38.700
Dr. Marshall: Right now you're not on any other opioid so you won't have to do that. You can start right back on the Suboxone dose that works for your body.

371
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:46.290
Dr. Marshall: And and you should be knocked into any amount of withdrawal. So, so that's how that's

372
00:27:46.560 --> 00:28:02.040
Dr. Marshall: How it works. When we first private. I also prescribed in our can which is the nasal spray. That's for overdoses. And that's just for you to have in case you've got family with addiction. It's just a good medicine to have a hold of, especially over the counter, but

373
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:16.080
Dr. Marshall: And I'll send you an email with how you use that if you ever needed to the important thing to know is if you ever had a friend that overdosed and you use in our can after you use it, you still want to call 911 because it's very short acting so they

374
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:23.610
Dr. Marshall: Go back into the overdose and you could use it again, but you'd want to call 911 so that you know they revived them.

375
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:34.860
Dr. Marshall: So the other parts of bright heart health, or that we send you a urine drug screening in the mail every month. The most important thing to remember is just don't open it.

376
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:42.150
Dr. Marshall: Until you check into the virtual clinic online and somebody there with you and they will have you open it in front of them.

377
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:47.970
Dr. Marshall: Okay, private, and then they just have you hold it up. So don't open that up, and most importantly,

378
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.540
Kristina’s 11: That's good to know. Because yeah I probably would have just did it. Yes, and

379
00:28:52.980 --> 00:29:00.180
Dr. Marshall: If you have any relapses let me know before. So we're not surprised by the urine drug screen. It's not meant as a

380
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:15.900
Dr. Marshall: You know, trying to catch you. It's meant as trying to keep you in recovery. So if we know that something went wrong and we expect it. We're not surprised. That's fine. We're not looking to kick kick people out of the program we try very hard to keep people in the program.

381
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:24.990
Dr. Marshall: The same thing if you're on Adderall will expect that that will be positive on the urine drug screen and we'll know will already know that ahead of time.

382
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.500
Okay.

383
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:41.460
Dr. Marshall: We do basic labs, which they probably ordered as well to start it just looks at liver function and kind of some basic labs and we ask you to try to get those done as soon as you can. Just the. We know that your body is healthy for us to keep private prescribing

384
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.930
Dr. Marshall: I didn't ask you, but I was asked women about could you possibly be pregnant.

385
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.210
Kristina’s 11: No, I had the two side well

386
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.220
Dr. Marshall: That's right. You mentioned that already.

387
00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:05.730
Dr. Marshall: And yeah, I won't go into my spiel. Then on that because it is not a problem. If you ever have friends or things, but it's just something that we need to know because we would adjust the Suboxone dosing. But in your case, we don't need to worry

388
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:20.910
Dr. Marshall: And oh, and then every week before clinic, you'll have what's called a band which is a brief addiction monitor. It's about 10 minutes survey and that monitor your symptom so

389
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.920
Kristina’s 11: My daughter used to do those as well. Yeah.

390
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.080
Dr. Marshall: Okay, yeah. So we'll do that.

391
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:31.230
Dr. Marshall: Let's see. I'll send you an email that just talks about the Narc can and starting with pride heart health.

392
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:37.830
Dr. Marshall: And kind of how you coordinate. If you're having any issues, you can always check into the virtual clinic and ask a question.

393
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:44.880
Dr. Marshall: If you're ever for some reason you missed a meeting or so you didn't get a med refill from me.

394
00:30:45.480 --> 00:31:01.170
Dr. Marshall: Try to check into the virtual clinic and let them know ahead of time, you know, try not to say I'm out of my bed right now, you know, China, I have two days last and I missed my meeting can Dr. Marshall prescribed me to bridge me through or

395
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:12.120
Dr. Marshall: Like that, okay, because they can reach out to me. But if I'm not in a meeting, you know, if I'm not in group right then. Sometimes it takes a little while and I need time to get back to prescribe it and

396
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:24.090
Dr. Marshall: Think that's everything was we talked about, oh, and then I wanted to touch on what you talked about with with eventually getting off Suboxone so

397
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:40.980
Dr. Marshall: Some people. That's true. Some people never do. And some people are fine with that they stay on the same dose or maybe they lower their dollars but they say on that and long term studies show that that's okay. There's no long term damage, but some people want, you know, the freedom or

398
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.410
Dr. Marshall: They have their own reason

399
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:50.670
Dr. Marshall: And they feel comfortable, you know, with how they've been doing, we generally say you should be on a stable dose for at least six

400
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:56.940
Dr. Marshall: To 12 months. So at least you know six months. If you're pushing and you really want to start lowering but 12 months.

401
00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:03.030
Dr. Marshall: That you're doing well. You feel stable with your life. And then we just start tie trading back and you

402
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:17.520
Dr. Marshall: And I were absolutely okay so start doing that some people do that. And then they wind up at a lower dose for a while and plateau, try again. You know, all of that is fine, but there are definitely people who go all the way off so

403
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:25.410
Dr. Marshall: Okay, yeah. So either. Either one is fine, but don't anticipate of talking about that for you know at least six months.

404
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:31.290
Kristina’s 11: Okay yeah cuz I don't like want to put too much pressure on myself. Like, I'm also trying to quit smoking cigarettes right now too. And it's really hard.

405
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:40.860
Kristina’s 11: But I do. I just want to be able to, like, if I want to go on vacation randomly, like I want to have that freedom and not have to worry about, oh, well, I have to, you know, be there for my pharmacy, you know, to get

406
00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:43.980
Kristina’s 11: To knowing and

407
