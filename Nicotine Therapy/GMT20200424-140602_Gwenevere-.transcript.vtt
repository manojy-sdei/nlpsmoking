34
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I had an interesting group because there were only two to clients and Dr Arielle and I was like, well, it really, you know, I'm only supposed to do it with three but I'm like it.

35
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here anyway. So we had a straight up process group where people were cross talking and talking to Dr. Gabriel and she was a big part of it. Um,

36
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was a it was a real Process Group I you know that I kind of had a longing for for you to be there to see to see what was going on in there.

37
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But anyway.

38
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.900

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.440
Fire Tablet: It's it's a weird. We're very different people and

42
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.930
Fire Tablet: It's not that I don't respect her. I do respect her. But

43
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.140
Fire Tablet: She

44
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.900
Fire Tablet: I don't even think she realizes that she's doing it when she talks to me. She talks at me.

45
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.230
Fire Tablet: And not to me and it feels

46
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.380
Fire Tablet: Like an attack. A lot of the time.

47
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:44.760
Fire Tablet: So, it bothers me. And I'm not, I don't do well with attacks as we both know show I I naturally want to turn into a viper and just lashed out which she doesn't deserve, but it's the only response that I know.

48
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.740
Fire Tablet: Right now.

49
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.720
Fire Tablet: And I'm dealing with so much drama at work and drama at home and drama just drama and it's like

50
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.430
Fire Tablet: I don't know.

51
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.730
Fire Tablet: So I did want to tell you though.

52
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.900
Before I forget,

53
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:10.320
Fire Tablet: I talked to a neurologist yesterday about my headaches, migraines, and they started me on imitrex

54
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.370
Okay.

55
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.300
Fire Tablet: And they up to my medication for nausea, does your friend. Okay.

56
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.420
Fire Tablet: To let somebody know

57
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I do, let Dr have real know that that that's part of I have this nobody lets me do it anymore. But I have a little list of things I asked. I liked when I was

58
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Running that part. But anyway, so I often ask, are there any new medications or any discharge medication. So that would be one. When you see her say I have a new medication if you can really know when you started imitrex and how many milligrams

59
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.010
Fire Tablet: I am going to go pick it up today, but it's 100 milligrams

60
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll pick it up today.

61
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm putting it in a note, but she doesn't read them. She's doing other things.

62
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got imitrex 100 milligrams will pick up today, and then up this open

Gwenevere Abriel: The eyes are just so powerful.

86
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.320
Fire Tablet: That's what everybody always says about her.

87
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.280
Fire Tablet: That's my focus is her eyes, since the day she was born. That's been the compliment of decades. I swear.

88
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Me that is that little like

89
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.630

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like it's intense

92
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:09.930
Fire Tablet: Let me get

93
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself set up. I'm going to go see if I can let

94
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: me make this a little

95
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.280
Warmer

96
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: did think about

97
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Darren song.

98
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And

99
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to check on it with you.

100
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, it was a significant event that happened. I found it a significant event.

101
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But I guess I'm nervous because

102
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We see each other once a week. We don't have ongoing text communication we so I worry that

103
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Somehow I won't be able to take care of you enough I'll flood you and overwhelm you.

104
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's my truth. What has this last week been for you.

105
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:44.460
Fire Tablet: Um, so I was actually wondering about the reaching out part because I'm like, should I start doing that more. I'm very used to being

106
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:55.350
Fire Tablet: Alone and dealing with it alone. And I know that the cards are always there for you, but I don't want to bother you. And I don't want to

107
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:06.390
Fire Tablet: Have like interrupt family time and stuff like that for you and other people's time with you because you're important to a lot more than just me, you know,

108
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.340
Fire Tablet: But I was thinking about that.

109
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.380
Fire Tablet: Because

110
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.320
Fire Tablet: This is, I mean, since we did that session.

111
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.820
Fire Tablet: And still there.

112
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.660
Fire Tablet: Yeah, I definitely got more irritable.

113
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.610
Fire Tablet: Definitely

114
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:36.870
Fire Tablet: And I also, I'm trying. I noticed something that I don't feel really good about but like I'm

115
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.920
Fire Tablet: Looking for inappropriate behaviors that aren't there.

116
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: A scanning I call that scanning like you're ready for for somebody to is it to do something wrong you like really that's what you're Scott without that, that that's offensive and like that. Like, like I was talking about.

117
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

118
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.890
Fire Tablet: Yeah, but it's sexualized

119
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, at work, or where were mostly that happening at all.

120
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

121
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of it in the world, there's

122
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of our jokes revolve around it.

123
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Things like that. So, but let's back up to, let's talk first about the outreach part. This is what I tell my clients. Number one, I give what I have to give

124
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm really specific about it. And the first time I meet with them and it's been a while since you've probably heard this and maybe I never even said it because you were one of my earlier clients right is I say, here's my

125
00:11:42.570 --> 00:12:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Cell phone I use it for scheduling, you're not going to get psychotherapy from me on my phone, but I never want you guys to feel like you're going through a difficult time alone. It's just this horrible sort of suffering experience when you think, here I am having this awful.

126
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Experience and I'm doing it alone. I'm alone in this suffering. So what I tell people, as I say, you can share with me. Please do.

127
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You know yours might be something like today really sucks. Feel like everybody's after me. Lots of people are trying to be sexy AND IT'S PISSING ME OFF or whatever your truth is right and and the problem is

128
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in what I say back because you won't get this because there's no way I text will work. So we would have to have an agreement about what I can say back emoji back my preference would be

129
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like that. Sounds like a difficult day do you need to meet sooner but I know you've got some financial constraints and I don't want to be insulting and say, well, if you know I can't, like, that's why. Even a simple text.

130
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I can get myself into a shit storm. It's so that's why it's so risky my preference would be, we already have a pre sorted determined way that I can. I can show you I'm here.

131
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Without adding confusion and and context, you didn't already have this is really, really difficult and I haven't got it completely figured out yet, but I do know, I want you to have access to me.

132
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: To contact me so that in those moments when it's either. I'm going to burn or I'm going to text when text me every time.

133
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.820
Fire Tablet: I'm

134
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I see it.

135
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

136
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:41.250
Fire Tablet: But no, I see exactly what you mean. And I mean I if I if I absolutely needed to

137
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:58.920
Fire Tablet: schedule a meeting, I would finances. Yeah, but like I think finance, like if I had to do it. Like if it was to that point, I would just pay for it and do it in and adjust funds at that point.

138
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's kick a response.

139
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say what my preferences. I like to be able to say, that sounds like you're going through a really difficult time. Do you want to meet sooner and I want to be able to send an emoji or a little flower or something. And sometimes, you know what I think about you.

140
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I look at my little emojis. And I'm like, I have some that I want to send to you, but I never want to like a friend you so

141
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:26.880
No.

142
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to know if I can do these little

143
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: These little I like my little fairy one but there's there's some in here. I want to send these little masks. Like I'm

144
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever, like any of the, the little, the little devil mask or like these little, like, what, what emotions. Do you like when you send them to

145
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Your friend.

Fire Tablet: Just have high hopes.

231
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. So I kind of want to instead just come at it from what I was noticing this weekend so I'm

232
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I received a

233
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: satire of that song. It was so weird. I received a satire of it this weekend, and it's around Trump

Fire Tablet: I hate him.

237
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's why I thought of you. Well, obviously I thought of you because of the song and I was like, Oh, good grief. I could tolerate it. But of course, I was thinking she would she be able to tolerate this probably not. What do I do with this. So, right. So I'm just so you know.

238
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.290
Fire Tablet: That was

239
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.930
Fire Tablet: That's affiliating something else.

240
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.510
Fire Tablet: I get it.

241
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's it's a complete it is the resounding let's see what happens with this because you're probably already feeling a little activation now right

242
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.080
Yeah.

243
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.780

Fire Tablet: Oh,

247
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.150
Fire Tablet: Oh, absolutely.

248
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.740
Fire Tablet: Support that

249
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's happening is these random people on zoom or whatever their little video are singing it they're singing it. You know, like, get rid of this guy. And there's one one singer is taking all of the words of you know that song and twisting it into the White House is doing this and

250
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's really

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a winner academy award or whatever that musical award is that it's, it's, yeah. So I was thinking about you. So we got this far. How you doing,

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:24.150
Fire Tablet: I'm okay i when you said that and the song sort of playing in my head, but I put vote him away.

253
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

254
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.890
Fire Tablet: So, but it's a but the tune is there.

255
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in it's in a noxious tuned to begin with.

256
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:54.090
Fire Tablet: I yeah and it's and it's not even the actual song itself, it's the word over and over and I truly believe that he got that word from watching a center.

257
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.500
Fire Tablet: And I will not watch that movie. Yeah.

258
00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.880
Fire Tablet: So what if we just heard the Lion King. Yeah.

259
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.540
This

260
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now.

261
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens when instead you do vote ham, a way

262
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:18.870
Fire Tablet: To yeah

263
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So just for now. That's all do that with that. Just let that go in the background. Now let me hear what's the name of the lullaby that you have those notes on your chest. What is that several a boy.

264
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.300
Fire Tablet: Okay, so

265
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:39.930
Fire Tablet: Do you know

266
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.950
Fire Tablet: You'll be in my heart.

267
00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.150
Fire Tablet: Oh,

268
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't

269
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see that when that those early those first lines right out the gate around safety and woof.

270
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:26.400
Fire Tablet: Yes.

271
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the key.

272
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.920
Fire Tablet: So they

273
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.540
Fire Tablet: When I would sing it to them. They just, they just loved it.

274
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.230
Fire Tablet: Hold on one second.

275
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.320
Fire Tablet: Okay, um,

276
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:57.090
Fire Tablet: So I when they were little, I would sing a song to them, but they still ask for for that song.

277
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.060
Fire Tablet: All the time and

278
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.250
Fire Tablet: My daughter, especially, but I was gonna get

279
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:21.630
Fire Tablet: I don't know. But though I wanted their music because that song is important to me. I sang it when like I used to put my headphones on my belly.

280
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:28.020
Fire Tablet: And I would play the song into my belly and JJ would stop kicking me

281
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:38.040
Fire Tablet: And rolling cuz he did like somersaults inside of me like he was so tiny and pre meet, but he would roll around and I would get nauseous and

282
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:59.400
Fire Tablet: I used to put my headphones on my belly and he would just kind of start kicking a little bit and then he just chilled out and then McKenna didn't like the headphone thing. I felt that I would stand there and just sway my belly and sing the song, and she would also calm down.

283
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:07.170
Fire Tablet: But they that song is just a big, important thing to me.

284
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.070
Fire Tablet: That definitely helped

285
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.110
Fire Tablet: Yeah, I saw what you did. That was very good.

286
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you.

287
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun and i and i really i like it i love the words and he's got a lovely voice really like it.

288
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.640
Fire Tablet: And I think another thing why I picked that song so

289
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:46.050
Fire Tablet: My dad that's a happy memory for me is my dad in us in the car. He would always sing songs or songs would come on the radio. And he'd be like, who sings it. And what year

290
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:57.180
Fire Tablet: And we would have to get it and I got really good at the game and but I remember watching my dad. He actually has a really good singing voice for male

291
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.600
Fire Tablet: And he would sing like Phil Collins coming in the air tonight.

292
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:18.780
Fire Tablet: And so when I hear that song or eagles Hotel California, it always makes me think of my dad. So I think that those songs are happy songs and they all flow into one another.

293
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Another thing I noticed is this this way thing you just did.

294
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That had a positive effect on you as well as Canada.

295
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:54.630
Fire Tablet: Yeah. Uh, well, when she was inside of me. She was a kicker. And she always put her feet, and my ribs and I hated it. So if I would sit there and seeing. And I would just stand up late and I would just take the whole video and I would just

296
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:55.590
Uh huh.

297
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.500
Fire Tablet: And she would come down and she's going lower and

298
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.960
Fire Tablet: I like McKenna's pregnancy was really hard because

299
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.210
Fire Tablet: Joel left me pregnant.

300
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:16.620
Fire Tablet: So I lost 19 pounds with her inside of me. I was so depressed.

301
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:31.410
Fire Tablet: And her pregnancy was really, really bad. So when she came out, I just remember apologizing to her. The day that she was born, I apologize to her so much, and I just told her, because I gave birth to her on my own.

302
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:40.710
Fire Tablet: And I just said, I'm so sorry that I couldn't keep our family together and I'm so sorry I let you down.

303
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:49.410
Fire Tablet: We're gonna, we're going to make this work. And it was just really, really tough for her pregnancy was tough. The birth was tough and

304
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.440
Fire Tablet: attaching to her was tough.

305
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me

306
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the attachment

307
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:58.500
Fire Tablet: Um,

308
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:07.740
Fire Tablet: It was different than when it was with on this record, it was different than it was with j and j was

309
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.590
Fire Tablet: It was just different, and

310
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.030
Fire Tablet: With her it was guilt.

311
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.150
Fire Tablet: Just utter guilt and a reminder of all of my failures.

312
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:22.830
Fire Tablet: And

313
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:24.480
Fire Tablet: I'm

314
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:27.840
Fire Tablet: I just didn't feel like

315
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.330
Fire Tablet: I could be close to her.

316
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.900
Fire Tablet: I'm like, I was gonna let her down.

317
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:49.830
Fire Tablet: Even even like just Jared would like to sleep in bed with me and he wanted to always be with me and because to me, and for the first few years of her life.

318
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.410
Fire Tablet: It just felt like we were very separated and we went to family therapy.

319
00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:05.970
Fire Tablet: And we did family therapy and we did exercises of me trying to understand her because she has ADHD and sensory processing.

320
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.780
Fire Tablet: She was overwhelming to me. Yeah.

321
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.870
Fire Tablet: Very, very, very overwhelming.

322
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.540
Fire Tablet: Impulsive and

323
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:24.180
Fire Tablet: Wanting to touch and come into my space and it just wanted me to push her further away.

324
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.820
Fire Tablet: So,

325
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:39.300
Fire Tablet: Yeah, really. It really, really sucked. And some of that is very much still still there, but not just with her with Gareth as well. But I noticed that

326
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:41.670
Fire Tablet: It was worse with her.

327
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Something you said just now.

328
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:45.690
Be

329
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A target for us to

330
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Explore later meaning.

331
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be some connection to

332
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: When I attach to.

333
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: McKenna.

334
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm reminded in my failure. And so there might be this odd.

335
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Link That got made because it was hearing you talk about that you somehow let her down, you failed to keep the family together, even though this person clearly wasn't healthy and somehow you're blaming yourself for it. So there's some maybe some

336
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.630
Fire Tablet: There was also something else though.

337
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.190
Fire Tablet: What up, came up with her, I was when I found out that she was a girl.

338
00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:32.010
Fire Tablet: I was terrified.

339
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:32.670
Yeah.

340
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.010
Fire Tablet: I was like,

341
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.360
Fire Tablet: Somebody's gonna hurt her somebody's gonna take advantage of her somebody's going to

342
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:51.660
Fire Tablet: Destroy her and I brought her into the world. It's my phone because I set her up for

343
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.060
Fire Tablet: For pain.

344
00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:00.990
Fire Tablet: And she's so special and. She's so beautiful. I would hate to see her soul destroying

345
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And ultimately, it's your fault because you gave birth to her.

346
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:15.930
Fire Tablet: Hi. Yeah, I brought her into the world. I chose to get pregnant. Well, she was a surprise and unexpected blessing, but

347
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:24.000
Fire Tablet: I wasn't ready. That's another thing I wasn't ready for another baby. I wasn't ready for

348
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:33.180
Fire Tablet: The first baby but I definitely wasn't ready and when I found out I wasn't happy and I felt guilty.

349
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.260
I understand.

350
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.900
Fire Tablet: So,

351
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.050
Fire Tablet: Yeah, I think that's still really flexes me and

352
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:51.270
Fire Tablet: Even when we went through family therapy. I learned a lot of things on how I could help her. And I could help me with her.

353
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.140
Fire Tablet: Which he's

354
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.430
Fire Tablet: He's

355
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.090
Fire Tablet: All the things that I wish I was

356
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.870
Fire Tablet: And all the things that I think I should stay far away from

357
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: She's all the things you wish you were

358
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.090
Fire Tablet: Beautiful so away from

359
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.350
Fire Tablet: Yes, so I don't destroy it, so I don't

360
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.130
Fire Tablet: Damage it so I don't

361
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:24.780
Fire Tablet: Heard it

362
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:32.130
Fire Tablet: Cuz he's really so so beautiful.

363
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.580
Fire Tablet: And I just don't want to.

364
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.080
Fire Tablet: Like she says, I'm sorry, all the time like me.

365
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.060
Fire Tablet: And I hate that. And I know that that's me rubbing off on her.

366
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:58.320
Fire Tablet: So, things like that. It's not like where I want to stay away from her because of a bad thing. It's because I just don't want to just, I don't want to

367
00:36:59.340 --> 00:36:59.790
Fire Tablet: I don't

368
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.820
Fire Tablet: I don't, I don't want her to

369
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.560
Fire Tablet: Ever

370
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:18.450
Fire Tablet: Feel the way that I feel or feel because of me those horrible negative things. I don't want to damage her

371
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.040
Fire Tablet: I don't want to do what my mom did to me.

372
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.830
Fire Tablet: I don't want to do what

373
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.410
Fire Tablet: Others.

374
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.410
Fire Tablet: Did

375
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you able to sit with the things you find beautiful about her. Do you see that your influences there as well.

376
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.820
Fire Tablet: Hold on one second.

377
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.800
Fire Tablet: Yeah.

378
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:57.930
Fire Tablet: Um, yes I do. I see that

379
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.820
Fire Tablet: She's a little oddball like me. She's

380
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:09.090
Fire Tablet: She's an artist. She's definitely an artist because she sees

381
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:19.590
Fire Tablet: The world in a very beautiful way like she'll say things like, when she was a baby like three, you're in the car and

382
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:38.550
Fire Tablet: She was learning how to talk and she had to do some speech therapy and stuff like that. And she said something that I will never, ever, ever forget and it showed me just how beautiful her soul is. And she goes, Mommy. The windows are crying and it was raining.

383
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:41.940
Fire Tablet: And

384
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.890
Fire Tablet: And it was just like, oh god, you know, the way that she saw

385
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.910
Fire Tablet: Rain and the window, and she was looking deeper

386
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.950
Fire Tablet: She was still so small and that just showed how

387
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:08.730
Fire Tablet: How gorgeous. She really is and is just it melted my heart and it's things like that that I don't want to destroy

388
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:18.600
Fire Tablet: Things like that, that I want to stay innocent and beautiful and untouched and untainted and just

389
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.580

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I had my volume down. Tell me what what

419
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Windows crying.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.010
Fire Tablet: I hope that are

421
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.430
Fire Tablet: Harder soon.

422
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.840
So,

423
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay go all the way through. She came in the room, brush your hair, but that was like you had a little, little conversation with her.

424
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's this noticing she's hearing. Just watch yourself what it has this real time experience been like

425
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.790
Fire Tablet: She came into the room and I was worried because i don't i don't like

426
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.790
Fire Tablet: I don't like them being on camera.

427
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.610
Fire Tablet: At all. I want to be buddies see them.

428
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.700
Fire Tablet: But then it is just you so

429
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:16.740
Fire Tablet: Then it's okay for me, it felt better because it is just you.

430
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:24.000
Fire Tablet: And they don't want anybody on camera, seeing them because I'm afraid, like some pedophiles gonna walk home or something.

431
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I can, I can see that I got you.

432
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:28.680
Fire Tablet: And

433
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.130
Fire Tablet: She wants. She wants me to brush your hair because she likes it when I brush your hair. Okay.

434
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.730
Fire Tablet: And

435
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like to take time. We were just talking about her right at that moment, and she came in.

436
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe she was listening. Maybe she wasn't but there she was. And you brush your hair. What was it like to brush.

437
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.570
Fire Tablet: It was like

438
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: She's been you now.

439
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.880
Fire Tablet: Can you go out for a minute. Thank you, baby.

440
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.240
Fire Tablet: It was like

441
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.550
Fire Tablet: She knew I was talking about her. It was like that.

442
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:16.950
Fire Tablet: But brushing her hair.

443
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:29.130
Fire Tablet: Is something that I wish that my mother would have done for me in a kind way. So when I brush your hair. I always try to make sure that I don't hurt her.

444
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:41.370
Fire Tablet: Because my mommy's to pull my hair and to tell me I'm moving and she would like grabbed my hair like in a ball and like jerk my head around in a hurt. Oh, yeah.

445
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.350
Fire Tablet: I never wanted to do that to my little girl. I always wanted to make her feel like

446
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.350
Fire Tablet: My touches gentle and and I'm gentle I'm gentle to you.

447
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.490
Fire Tablet: And I love the way that she smells and

448
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:08.730
Fire Tablet: I like she calls me so she talks like a little baby when she says, Mommy, but I love it. She goes, Bobby.

449
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.110
Fire Tablet: Hello.

450
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Debbie knows

451
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:17.340
Fire Tablet: Yeah, like a stuffy nose and she goes, lovely. I love the lovely and

452
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:17.910
Fire Tablet: It's

453
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.890
Fire Tablet: My favorite thing in the whole world.

454
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.640
Fire Tablet: I'm

455
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:26.610
Fire Tablet: It.

456
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.550
Fire Tablet: And

457
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:39.120
Fire Tablet: I don't know, I just, I like having moments with them any moment with them is is a wonderful moment.

458
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.550
Fire Tablet: But it just feels some of the time, it feels forced for me.

459
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.110
Fire Tablet: Sometimes it's just like get away

460
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that that's every parent has that

461
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:55.740
Fire Tablet: And then I feel guilty.

462
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Every parent has that

463
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:00.270
Yeah.

464
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's that moment earlier. Let's just hold on to that one for a second.

465
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If she was listening.

466
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: what it looked like out here. Was she gave you an opportunity

467
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To have intimacy healthy intimacy love. I know you like brushing my hair. I like brushing my hair. And so she did that, she came in the room.

468
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And made that possible for you to to connect you're giving yourself kind of a hard time. I wasn't this ideal whatever you were saying about your relationship with her and she came in.

469
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And repaired it she made it possible for you to repair. You didn't push her away. You may have been tempted to but I said do the mommy thing you did it. Okay, and you got to feel good and then you got to remember, that's my favorite thing. I love it when she says I love you, papi right

470
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.880
Mm hmm.

471
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.040
Fire Tablet: Yeah, that's a good point.

472
00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So you could look at it the other way. I don't know why she was listening.

473
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen.

474
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Kids are very bright. They pick up on what's going on around them.

475
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.580
Fire Tablet: They are their little geniuses and I am boxes.

476
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So part of not making them crazy is we don't deny their reality.

477
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

478
00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.190
Fire Tablet: I just worry that I heard her, you know, what if I

479
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.130
Fire Tablet: Just love her so much.

480
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:41.940
Fire Tablet: And

481
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.840
Fire Tablet: I feel like I push them away more than I should.

482
00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:04.800
Fire Tablet: But they're, they're so they're so smart, and they're so wise and they are truly a comfort to me.

483
00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:10.650
Fire Tablet: But I worry, most of all, the biggest thing that I worry about

484
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.310
Fire Tablet: Is that I've made them worry about me.

485
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's right in there. We say they're, they're a big comfort to me they're comforting to me I worried that they're worried about me.

486
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So there is just not language. There is a possibility. So, but let's look at the other way around. What do you do in the role of parent that's just in the position of you taking care of them. What are like five things that you do I there. The know does stuff, but just hear yourself, Sam.

487
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.300
Fire Tablet: was apparent. What do you make sure that they're

488
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.830
Fire Tablet: Fed I make sure that their baby.

489
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:54.690
Fire Tablet: I

490
00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:56.700
Fire Tablet: Work.

491
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:01.530
Fire Tablet: To work on school work with them. I

492
00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.940
Fire Tablet: drive them to school from school and school is open.

493
00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:10.710
Fire Tablet: I

494
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.190
Fire Tablet: I buy them. The things that they want and the things that they need.

495
00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:24.240
Fire Tablet: So I think

496
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's a lot. So you do all those things to

497
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What about on an emotional level, what do you do

498
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.770
Fire Tablet: I think that lullaby. Yeah.

499
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:40.560
Fire Tablet: I

500
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:55.740
Fire Tablet: I give kisses and hugs and bunches of love everyone that's what we do is this. So a kiss. And then we give a hug, and then we rub noses for bunches of love.

501
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:56.820
Okay.

502
00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.440
Fire Tablet: I'm

503
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:04.800
Fire Tablet: Gareth and McKenna and I have a competition every day. Whoever says

504
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.920
Fire Tablet: The love thing that we say first wins. So with Jerry, if I say

505
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:14.070
Fire Tablet: I love you to infinity Googleplex.

506
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:21.600
Fire Tablet: And or I love you more than Anthony Googleplex which is like the biggest number in the world.

507
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:31.350
Fire Tablet: Right. So whichever one of us says that first wins that day and then with McKenna. It's, I love you to the moon and back.

508
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:33.270
Fire Tablet: And

509
00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.270
Fire Tablet: Whoever says it first wins that day.

510
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.230
Fire Tablet: So that, that's something emotional

511
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.950
Fire Tablet: But it's a lot of words and there's a lot of touch missing.

512
00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you did start the day with giving kisses and hugs and rubbing noses. So there's touching there.

513
00:50:56.190 --> 00:51:01.980
Fire Tablet: Yeah. And that doesn't happen all the time, and sometimes is a bedtime, but

514
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:13.500
Fire Tablet: I don't know. But maybe you're right, maybe I do not myself too much. That's what the Family Therapist said about me. She says that

515
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:18.780
Fire Tablet: She's never had a moment beat yourself up so much

516
00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.730
Fire Tablet: That's what she said in our meeting. She was like,

517
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.830
Fire Tablet: You just be yourself up and you can't take a compliment.

518
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:40.620
Fire Tablet: When somebody tells you you're doing something positive with your children. You see the negative, you know, and she didn't say it exactly in those words she probably said it therapeutically much better.

519
00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.330
Fire Tablet: But that's the gist that I got from it was

520
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.760
Fire Tablet: Was that

521
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We are right here at the top of this hour, let's let's pull back a little and just run through

522
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What was important for you today. Okay.

523
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:11.010
Fire Tablet: I'm important was brushing my daughter's hair.

524
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:17.430
Fire Tablet: And actually it was kind of important that you got to meet her senior. That's a big moment.

525
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.840
Fire Tablet: Important was

526
00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:25.260
Fire Tablet: Even

527
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.470
Fire Tablet: Talking around that song.

528
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:41.880
Fire Tablet: Okay, that's more than what I would typically do I would stop it nip it in the bud end it right there. It's done. We're done. So, even me saying that song more that song that word that song.

529
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:47.580
Fire Tablet: Is still more than what it would have been six months ago.

530
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

531
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Aware and report on

532
00:52:51.600 --> 00:53:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're aware of some some progress of desensitization is happening. It means that it's not across the other side of the planet. It's now maybe in the same country and you're aware, and that's that's progress.

533
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:28.890
Fire Tablet: Yeah and that and i and i see it because I wouldn't even I won't say the name of the song. If I can avoid it at all costs, but I'll say that song and even talking to you about that song is a is a big step for me.

534
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:35.160
Fire Tablet: I don't think I could have done that a year ago or told you even six months ago.

535
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.920
Fire Tablet: I don't think I could have told you

536
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.090
Fire Tablet: How I really feel about that song. And what it does to me.

537
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it.

538
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.830
Fire Tablet: Very good. So that's why I think that's important. Okay.

539
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And

540
00:53:54.450 --> 00:54:00.360
Fire Tablet: And I also let you in a little bit. I told you some personal things like my tattoos and

541
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.160
Fire Tablet: That's important.

542
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure did. I wrote down you know this. The Stacey and Sparrow and the lullaby and the cherry blossom and I do, I feel, I feel that in

543
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:13.800
Principle. Yeah.

544
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The

545
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:15.630
Gap.

546
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.340
Fire Tablet: Telling you more things that are not

547
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.500
Fire Tablet: The special thing.

548
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.550
Haha

549
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's risky.

550
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.260
Fire Tablet: It is it is risky but I think you've earned it.

551
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:34.980
Fire Tablet: I do

552
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.680
Fire Tablet: So, no we am Dr. Today, but maybe maybe in the afternoon.

553
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's funny when people say that this was end or

554
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:46.260
Fire Tablet: No.

555
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: This is preparation.

556
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Preparation

557
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all it's all treatment.

558
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all just because we're not doing the finger waggle doesn't mean we're not doing it.

559
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.570
Fire Tablet: That's a good point cliche cliche.

560
00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all

561
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pacing what's needed what's needed

562
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a waste of your time. If we go do something and there's not a readiness for it. That's not, that's not being careful. So we're being careful

563
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not smart.

564
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you did a lot of things in here actually be curious to

565
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.380
Fire Tablet: Continue this kind of

566
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Into your life. We also talked about your ability to send a message when you want to maybe opening that little crack in the door just sort of like a I can

567
00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:57.720
Send.

568
00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of feel empowered. I know I can respond, you have a little avatar that you can listen to two and see meals and have some journaling around how that feels. Did I go to. I forgot.

569
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: About it, though, lots of pieces I think to play with.

570
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So we set for

571
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.910
