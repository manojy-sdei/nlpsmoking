00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So it is so interesting. I've got a couple of challenges.

14
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a I've been sending you messages. I can see your messages to me through text, but I'm in Santa Fe with like zero like in some sort of black

15
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Zone of. Yeah, well, I'm in the black hole of Wi Fi not have it not heaven. Let me put it like that. And so I see you trying and trying and trying and trying and trying, about 10 times to try and login to zoom and it's not letting you in

16
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know if it's my fault because I'm on my laptop. I'm not really sure.

17
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But let me, let me just, I'm still trying to problem solve. I have another possible computer that's going to be available either in minutes or. Now let me just do a little problem solving.

18
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um,

19
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So well

20
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you picked up people people protect yeah we protect numbers so that you know personal phone numbers aren't called but I'm really glad you picked up because my cell phone doesn't work.

21
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can't, you know what I mean. The number that you used to. So I keep trying to admit you I took a picture with four of your efforts to try and log in. I mean, you're really trying. I can

22
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But I keep hitting admit and it won't let you in. So I just didn't happen to my folks. Earlier this week, I'm not sure what's the what

23
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, what to do.

24
00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What to do

25
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Um hmm.

26
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Work on work on my phone. I'm gonna go downstairs and see if I can get it to work.

27
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.690
On the computer down there.

28
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Me too. That's kind of creative

29
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

30
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's a speakerphone on this or would it be

31
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Push to talk voice.

32
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: pause for just speaker. Can you hear me on a speaker now.

33
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I just put you on speaker phone. So let's see. Let's see if we can make that work.

34
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of an odd way to do this but

35
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll just have a conversation

36
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

37
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: may go into your record.

38
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I was so distracted with trying to go up and down stairs.

39
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you said within the next couple days you can get to your mom's for the book.

40
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

41
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me write that down.

42
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, have you been doing any of that sort of constructive worry time on in a really intentional way, or did you forget all about it.

43
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How much sleep and even getting

44
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: More sleep. So yeah, how are you making that happen. Oh my god, start giving me melatonin. I like it.

45
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's actually a

46
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: couple nights.

47
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, indeed.

48
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Working

49
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We got

50
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So I you know I noticed James You opened up a little bit in group.

51
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, when you're when you heard Daniel talking. What was that like to hear him share

52
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I can relate to that, homie. Because, like, I've met a lot of people like him in jail and in jail and like that that type of place. Let me get out of our lifestyle that they can't get in here. You're again over stupid bullshit or something of sorts. Right.

53
00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I am glad he was there. So you could hear him because here he is this, you know, I think he said he was like 41 or something and and that he's in this struggle and and sort of choices that maybe he wish he had made earlier.

54
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you feel that, like, this is a chance for you to not have what happened to him.

55
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, good. I wanted that for you. I'm glad I'm glad he said, and he is just he'll just he keeps it real. He says, it just like it is.

56
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm really glad you got an opportunity to meet with him.

57
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, exactly.

58
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I see.

59
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing

60
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's where's the book.

61
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:58.470

62
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.460

Gwenevere Abriel: He will

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick up a book from moms.

65
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And bring it to dads. Is that the plan.

66
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

67
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, and then the sleeping was great. So we definitely want that in here. We want to say that he had his sleep has improved having taken melatonin. How many days. Have you had between six and eight hours of sleep a night.

68
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Melatonin but I don't know how many days that is on a

69
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sunday night Monday night.

70
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Since Monday night, it had

71
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: between six and eight hours. Yeah, okay. That is great. Are you noticing your brain works better when you've got rest.

72
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah dude, so much better. Okay. And so

73
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: taking melatonin.

74
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And

75
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: When it comes to sort of that topic that you raised in group around your

76
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Thoughts of wanting. Okay. I think about ex girlfriend. And then, oh, that's where we drank, and this is we drank together and this is I drink to cope

77
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Over the last few days. What have you been doing to challenge the thought of drinking like what's the next thought, you have to challenge it to get it out of your head, you know, cuz I ran a mile.

78
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: A mile and appreciated a mile.

79
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And working out running increasing

80
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The distance of your, your running

81
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Increasing

82
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a great one.

83
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, um, that's a physical activity. But the thing is, is you know what your brain does run with you.

84
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, though. What's it busy doing while you're running. What's it about

85
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's Heidi is digging deep looking for fill the girl. My runs it's turning everybody that every jot it down is turning on your team back to myself in my head and turning that into Hades her field to take the next steps faster and faster than

86
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything, we've done

87
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me see if I get that I'm taking all the hurtful insulting and demeaning things that I've heard

88
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: From people, the self doubt in me. I turned it into hate it fuels my motivation for the next step, so that I get into the Navy, or I fall down in physical exhaustion.

89
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Well, I could get into the Navy.

90
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. You're turning anger into fuel, I love, I do. I'd like it.

91
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, because that anger can. It's just so much more energized than than a depression is, you know, when you're in a depression and you don't want to do anything.

92
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So at least anger gets us moving now you know I've got opinions about holding on to anger and letting showing it to people and popping off on people. But for now, if it's

93
00:17:51.930 --> 00:18:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's a force of energy that's getting you up and working out. Now let me ask you, continuing to be honest with me. How do we take that same energy.

94
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And get your little eyes inside that book. If all we did was literally, this is the only next step would be opened it.

95
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And you took your hands and we flip the pages through just with our eyes just looking at the different chapters and your eyes landed on the bold, you know how they've got chapter headings and just bold.

96
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just literally I'm not exaggerating. This is a technique you let your eyes land on those those topics, just flip, flip, flip to like one chapter flip, flip, flip, flip, flip and then close the book.

97
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't study anything. Yeah, I'm not kidding. We got to take this progressively because there's some something's going on with you where you don't really just don't want to get in there.

98
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what that does is it is it says to the brain. Oh, I see, hey, I recognize some of those words. Oh yeah, this isn't gonna be so bad. So that's kind of the hack. It's getting in there and saying all right.

99
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I ever met. I see what this is about versus staying on the outside of the cover of the book and going there is no way I'm going to be able to do this whole thing.

100
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is daunting. Right. Yeah, it's just, it's so so intimidating. So as soon as we get it again. I'm reminding don't count on text with me because I'm in this black hole.

101
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do emails together. But what I'm saying is I'm not going to be. I was in Albuquerque. That's what the way I was able to text you yesterday.

102
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, but I can't count on that. I don't know if I'll be because I'm in the outskirts of Santa Fe, like in the boondocks

103
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty but dang, I mean, I'm so used to big city life where I can get ahold everybody I want this is throwing off my game.

104
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's you know, it's not as supportive to either because it means I can't do. I may, you may not get a reminder on Wednesday night next week.

105
00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, it's okay, okay, okay, okay, good. So we've got a plan for our sleeps coming on board. I'm so excited about that. You've got a plan for the book. I think I'm getting your text. So if you want to send me one. Once you get the book like hey I've got it.

106
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I got the book or whatever. I would love to get that and and then I'll know by next week. Hey, he's got it. And then if you want to flip, flip through the pages. Let me check on a couple things at

107
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: was the last time you had any thoughts of self harm as in I want to die. I want to end my life, how, how far back, has it been since you had one of those

108
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A month, a week, a day. How far back.

109
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Since I was in jail.

110
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that like April.

111
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: April.

112
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so nothing recent I'm so glad

113
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: How often do you think about that ex girlfriend of yours, how, how many times a day.

114
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: For own daily with it all my James shut the phone push a chatty your mind she looking at a workaround for that we see your fucking time money effort aging took URL put into a blender it, drink it.

115
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you really want to go back to our theme I guess what I'm pretty sure you don't know. Yeah. Okay.

116
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've got some good depth solid in in inner, inner dialogue, you're, you're fighting for your own sanity and and you're using the rational mind to say, literally.

117
00:21:44.910 --> 00:22:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She's, she's toxic that's just going to break your heart again there's other beautiful intelligent fun women that will also that will also be honest. Exactly. Hello. Pretty comes in and honest form to

118
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It so and I could have the whole time OPI, go for it. And you know what this gives you lots of time to focus on this piece of recovery and on getting your Toshi ready for the Navy.

119
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Um, what else we got we have

120
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the distress level for you. Have you used, you got to be honest with me because if you guys forget these, I just, I'll just go over them again. Okay.

121
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been using the the structured belly breathing where you breathe in for four seconds. Hold it for four exhale out the mouth for for

122
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, and what about if I said grounding in the five senses, would you be like, I don't know what you're talking about, or do you remember it.

123
00:22:54.450 --> 00:23:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I can go over that again. It's another Handy One

124
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I can also go over another emotional regulation skill, which is sort of peripheral focus, it's this way you use your eyes when you're really pissed off.

125
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a handy way and the people I bet, I bet when you get in the

126
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: In the Navy. I think sharpshooters use this when they're, when they're

127
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to fire a weapon. I think they do it. They think, so I'll teach it to you. I don't know if this is exactly how they do it. But I heard someone in in the military, say, Oh, I think that's what would people use in order to get their eyes. Ready to focus on the target.

128
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll teach that to you. Okay, so let's try a little something. Alright, so I'm say

129
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have been doing the belly breathing. You told me, I've been doing belly breathing.

130
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Does not call

131
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Grounding

132
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Review

133
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And

134
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Learned the most race. Here we are, we're doing

135
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Have there been times when you have been in high distress and you called one of your home girls.

136
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And they get you centered, they help you remember your, your core goals and not to go

137
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a short term solution like drinking

138
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's just you chatting with them, is it more like that. Yeah, more like that. Okay, and that's enough, right, because it gets you feeling like

139
00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I might be suffering. But I'm not suffering alone. I've got, I've got these friends. Yeah, exactly. Okay, yeah. Cool. So I'll just say you have been calling

140
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're not trying to drag you back into that life. Are they those girls. Yeah.

141
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel cared for when you speak with them.

142
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I sound like an idiot. When I say your home girls.

143
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good.

144
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because in Florida, what people do is they they they take away they try to stay away from girlfriend, because that's usually a romantic term right so they'll say, friend, they'll say friend girl and I think it sounds ridiculous.

145
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I like yours better

146
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

147
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Okay. I'm emotional

148
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful.

149
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

150
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.590
That's pretty good.

151
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Any slips where you've had a sip of beer one shot, even a sip of any alcohol.

152
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And April, you said, I have not had been busy city.

153
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that was a

154
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: See where it says one

155
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to stay sober and away from the bottle.

156
00:26:51.930 --> 00:27:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I think it on 521 says, interesting. I wonder if you're in. It's increased because I'm 521 I wrote down client reports. Having once a week. Thoughts of drinking. Is it possible you are minimizing it then.

157
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

158
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It was just, it's gone up.

159
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay because you're thinking about her again.

160
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see. Okay, so there we go. When you're thinking about her. It's a real trigger to start romanticizing alcohol use.

161
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody working on the roof, if you can hear that.

162
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then we get on with the book. Okay, so now

163
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about how to channel.

164
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That anger into sort of transforming that into the motivation that it's going to take for you to get that book from your mom's over to your pops keeping it very simple. Is there any interest in putting it in your phone right now as a reminder to pick up the book.

165
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you go for it. Now, I'll just sit here and pick my nose.

166
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You plug it in.

167
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Sweet.

168
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that feel good that you did that.

169
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, one step closer. Right.

170
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, basically.

171
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok and now how are you getting along with your pops these days is or extra attention, what's what's going on between you two.

172
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, me, my dad. Yeah.

173
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I thought you said me in the car. Oh.

174
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm open up that can of worms. I know there's no love there, man.

175
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a call for me to walk away.

176
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: All kinds of chaos here, James.

177
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Adapt. What is it, adapt.

178
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Overcome, I don't know what the slogan is but there's something that's the way life is just add up.

179
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Adapt and overcome. Yeah, that's it.

180
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a great movie. Isn't it

181
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

182
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What else we got in here.

183
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, I want to teach you see if I have never done this over the phone before

184
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You can stop me and say, Oh, yeah, yeah, I know this, but I want to

185
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of, see if you can do it. So I want you to pick one object. Let's say you know the mostly what's in your career in your car, right.

186
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're in your car. Let's say it's the whichever one is has more buttons or knobs are attorney doodads on it, whether it's the blinker

187
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Windshield wiper

188
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to look at it.

189
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And the and what I'm going to like you to do is what this does is it gets your because you're going to be using adjectives to describe it like a black round bumpy

190
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The letter blah blah blah twisty round soft but not soft sorry because it will only be things data coming in from your eyes.

191
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to label it, you're not going to call it a cookie. We won't call it, you know, a stone. For example, if we were looking at a rock.

192
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just going to use adjectives to describe it. And what you want to do is you're going to want to name as many as you possibly can.

193
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to do once you can hear what it looks like. So let's say I'm in a stress moment and all of a sudden, I just realized, oh my gosh, I forgot completely about my car insurance.

194
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder if my license is suspended like I'm having a freakout moment right and I look at this. Yeah. So I look at this thing on my

195
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I look at this thing on my desk and I start describing it. And this is what I would do.

196
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's white round shiny.

197
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Curved circle dust orange triangle bird white lettering boldface lowercase. Then there's letters and there's a bump rich, then there's stamp black stamp on the, on the, on the bottom and another circle, then a tiny dot

198
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, did you see that I did. All I did was described what I saw. So you pick something in your car and just

199
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, as many adjectives to describe it, but nothing that is a label or something that would come from touch because you're not touching, you're just using your eyes is the only means of data retrieval. So just look at something and just start describing it.

200
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: squarish why you are on it right symbols on it.

201
00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: All blog. It's funny. She is fun to play with.

202
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, wait, wait, let me let me do some notice that, click, click, click, would be a sound and a touch right so we want to skip this. We haven't done those we're going to do touch in a second.

203
00:33:52.230 --> 00:34:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's why this is so tricky. We have to force ourselves to only that's why this. This technique works the way it does is because we're jamming everything and no only one sensory input or eyeballs.

204
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did awesome. Aside from the click, click, click, which we're going to get to in the tactile

205
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the hearing. Yeah, yeah. Cool, cool, cool now now to now you can even close your eyes. If you feel safe doing it now. We're not getting data from our eyes. Now we're getting data from our ears. I want you to describe every seeing you here.

206
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Cargo by voting.

207
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Shopping Carts quickly.

208
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: People walking

209
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Towards closing orders working cats now means going out with people talking to students tiring on the road. ENGINE REVVING I think

210
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It should be going into going to an open house.

211
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That is

212
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Not inside your card you notice any anything really close to your body. Anything in there.

213
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That looks like. Let's just hold off. Okay. And then also remember the clicking of the the thing I'm gonna do

214
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The cooking.

215
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, nice, beautiful. Excellent. Now, we've done a vision. We've done hearing. And now I'd like you to focus in for just a moment, really quick. They it moves fast describe

216
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What you smell.

217
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I smell. Smell cigarettes I smoke weed I smell.

218
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I smell my own Marco's blow my nose. I smell does both though because this call to go was telling my papers small Shanghai from across the street.

219
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost no Little Caesars yet I smell the shop oil solve a chemical oil fumes. We use

220
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful is no bakery at the center market. Wow, that's great. There's you do caught so many. That's awesome. And now move to tactile so now put your hand, maybe right on that Clichy

221
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: On a windshield wiper what I do, Dad. And now, close your eyes because you're going to be tempted to want to use your eyes for this, but just describe what information is coming through that hand temperature texture.

222
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you got

223
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's Lauren. It's bumpy. It's got a

224
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Lot of smooth texture like a

225
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Show it on the sauna.

226
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Slowly

227
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Go.

228
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Now notice taste in your mouth. That's usually the hardest one. What you got in their

229
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Taste t is t taste in your mouth.

230
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: exhausted all the cars passing. Okay, what else

231
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Baby lately, like an

232
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Iron

233
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: any leftover toothpaste.

234
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I just jacket. Sometimes people have coffee leftover and there are some toothpaste. Excellent. So, so here's the deal. Did you, what did okay let me ask you, when we did this activity. What did you notice

235
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot more attention to things that I thought

236
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're really good at this one actually, most people can only come up with, like, like, three things. And it's like pulling teeth, but you are actually quite adept at this skill, but what about your mind. Did you notice that this took concentration

237
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

238
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And did you notice that it wandered off to some of that negative thinking or did you really try your very hardest to give me as many adjectives as you could come up with

239
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what we write your mind was busy doing that it wasn't busy fretting over negative thoughts or thoughts. You don't want in there. Isn't that interesting.

240
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it's so silly. Right. It's like this has been around me all along so you know when you're trying to say, Get the f out of my head. Girl, you know, you don't want that image right

241
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This is yeah, this is what you can do it when you're saying that to yourself, then go do grounding in the five senses, then just pick up an object.

242
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you you close your eyes. You feel it, you go, okay, cool rough okay it's curved. Ooh, that's a sharp edge. Now it's smooth. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna look at it, it's gray.

243
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's got some black spots. Oh, it's shifting its round. Now it's sharp. Oh, and what do I hear there's some kind of jackhammer going up on my roof. I can hear my noxious whiny voice.

244
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear James through this speakerphone.

245
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I heard my own like swallowing just now.

246
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: My taste is this nasty aftertaste from coffee, but oh this coffee, so good. That's, that's a judgment should say that's myself but yeah and then, um,

247
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh hands so I can feel the pressure of the edge of this desk on my forearm. I feel I'm like, but

248
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This chair like, you know what I mean. I might move to a couple pieces of my body to try and get even more because my intent is to try and

249
00:39:53.130 --> 00:40:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Get focus there and it was really cool. It took a lot of effort and guess what the brain only wants to focus on one thing I know they say multitasking is some sort of skill, but

250
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't do those things very well. It's better when we do one we really focus on it. So that's what we're using using this skill and it's a

251
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a great way to get your it because guess what James You only need a few seconds to get out of that thought and then get then you go do the bigger distraction, which is a run a workout.

252
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But these little ones, the ones where we have to just get through these intense few 60 seconds.

253
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the ones that give us enough time for our frontal lobe and your hippocampus to come on board, be like, Okay. What's that other stuff we can do

254
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there's this project I started with my dad, I can, I can start signing a piece of wood that to go with that. I can go do that.

255
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It allows your mind to no longer be hijacked by the amygdala by that emotional stuff of that that heartache crap and then you can get your mind on something else. This, this is really a handy one. It's much like the the belly breathing, it can work so fast so well for people

256
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you got to do it with the fidelity. You just didn't today, which is you want to produce as many as you possibly can, like, I want to be like triple a student here. I want to give this lady as many, you know, picture that I'm there just like what, tell me more, tell me more.

257
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it does. Well, I hope it's comes in handy handy. I hope it's remembered and you have a chance to do that.

258
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh well. Cool. And the other one I think I'll wait till next time to to do the peripheral one because I think I am. I'd like to do it when we can actually see each other.

259
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do the peripheral vision piece. So let's. Yeah. Well, thanks for being flexible today. I know this. We had to adapt and overcome today, didn't we

260
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, so let's see. I will see you on Tuesday morning

261
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: On June 2 and then I will see you on June 4 at 8am.

262
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay man be good to you.

263
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

264
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you heard some of that.

265
00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If not just kind of maybe take what you heard me say HI LOUISE and

266
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I repeated. Some of what he said. So hopefully you'll get a sense of what we talked about we we

267
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Did grounding in the five senses and he said he was surprised by how much he was able to describe and he was able to. He didn't his mind didn't wander to other things. And he's going to experiment using this new technique and we can firms next week. I think you heard that part.
