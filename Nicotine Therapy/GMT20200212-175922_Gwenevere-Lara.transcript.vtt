00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any chance you'd be able to be somewhere other than a car today.

2
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.130
Gabriel: The only time available or when I'm at work. I'm trying to park at the moment.

3
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.500
Gabriel: I was at work in my in an office that I borrowed but

4
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.080
Gabriel: It wasn't very private

5
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't

6
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have any days off during the week right

7
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.150
Gabriel: Well, Friday, Friday, my group.

8
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.940
Gabriel: Maybe I can swap out group and then replace my individual

9
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, cuz you kind of are in your car for group anyway.

10
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.970
Gabriel: Yeah. But yeah, I mean,

11
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me

12
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask, so I'm

13
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: At nine o'clock on a Monday what what do you typically doing

14
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.190
Gabriel: I I'm at work at nine.

15
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's your first work day. Okay.

16
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.480
Yeah.

17
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

18
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.720
Gabriel: Yeah, that's the problem. And a lot of times, like I work far from home so

19
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason I'm telling you is, you're, you're not going to get you mean it's one thing we can do this sort of conversation, you know, we can talk about some thoughts and feelings and sort of

20
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.320
Gabriel: Having

21
00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: A discussion, but you're not going to be getting the therapeutic interventions that you would get if you were in in an office or in your home and I don't want you to miss out on this some more psychodynamic

22
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.170
Approaches

23
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:17.070
Gabriel: I understand that, you know, I was almost gonna dry could say, I'm out, I'm working. Nothing far from home. So I'm looking to drive home but

24
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this. You've got pretty darn good attendance these days. How about how about we do this, um,

25
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

26
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What if next week. You just attend individual therapy and no group and then you attend group on February. Let me see.

27
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: 28th, if you sort of extended that

28
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So we did back to back. Individual therapy. This time, and sort of switched this pattern a little bit so that you're actually home on February 21 which is Friday.

29
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.790
Gabriel: Do you have any, do you have any anything open tomorrow.

30
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. Tomorrow's the 13th right now. I have someone from six in the morning, all the way until one

31
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Which my time gets into this other

32
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Events. So it's pretty packed. I mean, I could. I've been trying out this on call thing where I call people last minute, but I don't think that's what you're getting at. Right.

33
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.250
Gabriel: Well, because since I'm working so close because I'm literally like three blocks from where I live. I can leave a little bit before lunch.

34
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.970
Gabriel: And then just get home and then no one's home during that time. And we can do that. This week until we figure something

35
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:06.450
Gabriel: A little more, a little better because next week I'm working out of town. So I'll probably get to the hotel in time for for our group for our meeting and the week after that.

36
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well let's okay so let's do, let's look at

37
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.910
Gabriel: Or what did you recommend. Wait, I just didn't understand what you recommended at first.

38
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was saying, well, I'm I don't let me, let me just see what I can do before I

39
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.410
Started

40
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I like what you're saying, which means

41
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get to your hotel you could maybe be in a in a different setting.

42
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.950
Gabriel: But this week.

43
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.860
Gabriel: I'm not far from home. Right.

44
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What to do

45
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I think next Tuesday.

46
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: At 11

47
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard.

48
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.500
Gabriel: You know what I was gonna, I was gonna call in from the office, but

49
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:43.410
Gabriel: I could I could hear people in the other room and I know that they can hear me. So I'm not going to be at all. Yeah, I better go out and get it.

50
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Done. Don't do that to yourself.

51
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.200
Yeah.

52
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.230
Gabriel: I can open up the way I want to be in fear that they gonna hear me or listen and

53
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.090
Gabriel: Yeah.

54
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The only thing I'm seeing is

55
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing.

56
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.400
Gabriel: For at all for next week.

57
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because I've already got people in there, you know,

58
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.780
That

59
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This little spot. So like, okay, that works for my schedule we got kind of what I'm doing with you now. It's like once there.

60
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you know what I have opened up, you probably won't like this, but if you do, I, I saw someone today instead of 9am on Friday, this coming Friday. But we're meeting now so I don't know it's tell you

61
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Any ideas.

62
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you know what we got to just

63
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can possibly be in your hotel kind of nestled in a little bit.

64
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: On the February 26

65
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.690
Gabriel: What is that a day that's not next week, but the week after next

66
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a Wednesday, the same

67
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We're at the same spot 11 o'clock.

68
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you do you think you could pull that off.

69
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.510
Gabriel: Yeah, we

70
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Settled okay we'll just stick with that until some, something else happens here. Alright, so basically everything staying. Exactly.

71
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Except you're going to

72
00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to try to get in the hotel I guess kind of nestled in a little bit better so

73
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.370
Gabriel: Yeah, you're a

74
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.510
Gabriel: Las Cruces, I believe that week.

75
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

76
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, all right, well let's let's work with what we got here.

77
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.550
Okay.

78
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been able to do these pieces. And while people are in the car. So let me just see what's possible. I see some different stuff in your car.

79
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to place a couple of objects on your dashboard. If I were to try to get some of the bilateral stimulation going, do you have anything in your car that would work like magic that would sit and rest here and here. That would be about a foot and a half apart.

80
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.870
Gabriel: This coke can

81
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have to have those

82
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.450
Gabriel: I have a cocaine and a Starbucks cup.

83
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Would they sit on your dash, could you get them about a foot and a half apart.

84
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:00.930
I don't mind it.

85
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.840
Gabriel: Yeah, it looks like it.

86
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You. Oh, you would want the phone in between. Sorry.

87
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.290
Gabriel: Between

88
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll show you why. Because what you would actually be looking at is you'd be looking at the tempo of my finger pointing to one of those objects, you'd be doing this.

89
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

90
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.110
Gabriel: Yeah, I think I can.

91
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.100
Gabriel: Okay, I think that works.

92
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.310
Gabriel: Yeah, because I have

93
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.500
Gabriel: Yes, because I have the cocaine here and the Starbucks cup here.

94
00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just do a little test. I got to improvise because y'all are mobile

95
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. It's not my first time I've done this with someone in the car. And what they do is they keep they keep just a little bit of tape or sticky.

96
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.990
Gabriel: And then is the sticky notes.

97
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just watch your eyes and wants you to be moving them at this point just resting while you're sitting back once you to be looking

98
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: From the top of that coke can to it be nice if it was a horizontal motion. So from Starbucks cup to coke can and I just want to watch. So I'm gonna

99
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to set the tempo with with my finger. But you don't have to really look at me. See if you can catch the tempo, kind of as a peripheral reference point. But really what you

100
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:45.660
Gabriel: Want

101
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you want your eyes to be doing this. Good.

102
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. OK.

103
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just set the tempo doing really slow one. So you're just out of the corner of your eye. I want you to be looking at the top of the coke can

104
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And the Starbucks. Now I'm seeing it move. You don't want to look at my finger. That's going to be just just referencing the. I'm not going to change the tempo, by the way. So once you've got it.

105
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Then just you're looking at this one and then that one and this one and that one and then the transition between them is not as important as you getting left to right. Nice. That was nice and slow. Okay. I like it. I'm going to speed it up. I want to see if you can go a little faster.

106
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is that straining your eyes because if those objects are too far apart, then it's going to be snow. If I'm doing this and I'm looking all the way over, it's going to pull on the, I guess it's ligaments, or whatever it is, the tendons or something that's holding my balls in my head.

107
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's gonna firm does. Is that how it's feeling or is it comfortable if it's possible, then you want to put right bring them closer

108
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.410
Gabriel: A little bit.

109
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Straining as much

110
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.170
Gabriel: Yeah.

111
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we still want this experience where we're doing this moving left and right because we want to have this left and right hemisphere experience. Does that make sense.

112
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Okay. All right, so I've got the technical parts, just in case it lines up today. So let's spend a little bit of time, what I would call this preparation phase and doing some target mapping with you.

113
00:12:46.920 --> 00:13:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Over we already started a, an important part of it, which was starting to look at where you kind of register that 50% of distress. We went up to 90. We also went down to five basically someone insulting you

114
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were able to laugh it off because you knew. Hey, you're an idiot. I used to be a bully to you're insecure work it out and better than you. Anyway, right. That was like a five, it was like, I'm nothing

115
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we went to 50 which it was distressing a little bit. It was in that space of

116
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: When someone doesn't answer you.

117
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And got you to this thought of. I don't matter which has a bigger connection for you. That's a really old one, actually, as far back as age six, which was a great deal more

118
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Distressing which was up like around a 90 and maybe dad ignoring yo right so the I don't matter at a low level, maybe with Ashley, but when you bring up the bigger one. The older story. It's a little bit even more distressing because it's it's from when you were younger.

119
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let me just check in now into current. Nope. I got to do more. I got to make sure I don't have any of these things put in here. Let's do some more preparation.

120
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Gabriel

121
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see written in here. And sometimes it's because the note doesn't move over from the previous note, did you and I developed the protective figure the nurturing figure and the wise figure because I'll pull for a different note, if we already did it.

122
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.340
Gabriel: I don't think we've done that at all.

123
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

124
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.140
Gabriel: Oh, it's such a

125
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Good one. Oh, I love this one. And it's not only useful for in here, but people use it when they want to feel better out in the real world to. So let's do this. I want you to

126
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture it can be real or imagined.

127
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone that is a protective figure

128
00:14:48.810 --> 00:15:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be an animal. It can be anything but it has to really resonate with you and it can't be conflicted. As in, well, sometimes I think this person is protective and other times he kind of puts

129
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Me in danger. We don't want that figure we want it pure protective figure and it, but it can be a smashing a blending of multiple figures. So maybe, for me, it's

130
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A mama grizzly bear

131
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. They are very protective.

132
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and then it might be this other person. And I'm kind of like with them together. It's like this perfect protective figure. So I'm giving you an example just to kind of get your brain going so give you a moment and just kind of turn inward.

133
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Just have a flash if maybe people are you felt safe.

134
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it wasn't directly in your life who saw it and another family. Maybe you saw it in a book or a movie or maybe in your life and it's up for you.

135
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.760
Gabriel: Um, I think.

136
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.510
Gabriel: You know when you set a mama bear the protective figure. I like to think that that a lion is a protective figure for me.

137
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. I like it.

138
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, great. And now the next one and nurturing figure. This is the type of figured that promotes your health, your development and your growth.

139
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.350
Gabriel: Probably my mom, mom.

140
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: He wants you to grow to develop into your full potential that kinda

141
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.240
Gabriel: Yeah.

142
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.290
Gabriel: Yeah, exactly right.

143
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh right, and then a wise figure

144
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.970
Gabriel: Why is the figure.

145
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise wise wisdom. Right.

146
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.740
Yeah.

147
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:51.840
Gabriel: That one is

148
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.580
Gabriel: Named Hugo in California. He was like a father figure. I mean, growing up.

149
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:06.540
Gabriel: In Los Angeles.

150
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, and let's go over here to another piece of imagery, which has to do with a distancing metaphor. So I want you to

151
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Make this very personal to your own preference. So for some people, and I'll list a few of them.

152
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, a distancing metaphor. Let's say they have a negative emotion or thought

153
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And they want to see it kind of floating down the river there on the on the riverbank with their nurturing protective wise figure and they can kind of see this negative emotion kind of floating away getting further and further away for some people it's a spaceship and

154
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.510
Goes to the moon.

155
00:17:50.070 --> 00:18:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a balloon funk or on a sailboat near as sort of drifting away. But the neat imagery is that it's getting further and further away. So for you, what would you like your distance distancing metaphor to be

156
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.010
Gabriel: An airplane.

157
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:12.510
Okay.

158
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like it. Okay, airplane and any kind of airplane in particular.

159
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.980
Gabriel: Something that I would distance away from me or something that I would distance myself away from

160
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You

161
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, you'd stay put and the I suppose you could get yourself on there. But for this particular mechanism.

162
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be using it probably I would direct you to it. Let's like let's say you were getting activated in an activity. It was getting up to the 90s and you're getting quite

163
00:18:50.490 --> 00:19:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Quite activated, I might say, let's get a little distance from that. Why don't we put that on the airplane and just sort of kind of say goodbye to it for a while. Maybe you'll see it when it returns. So you'd be putting it on here.

164
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:02.640
Okay.

165
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.290
Gabriel: Can I use a Greyhound bus and said,

166
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.610
Yes.

167
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool Greyhound bus like it.

168
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We got it all right let's keep going. One more. I thought you were in group when we did the container big enough right strong enough to hold all your stuff that one.

169
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:30.810
Gabriel: I think I missed one group when when I was in North when I was in South Carolina when my brother graduated

170
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: From the marine yeah

171
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.340
Gabriel: Yeah, maybe they may have been, I grew because I would have remembered that

172
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it is also pretty quick. It doesn't take long. This one is. You know how some people will say, Oh, I just compartmentalize that memory or I don't like to think about something and I

173
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I put it in a box. Well, that's what this is. It's putting it in a container. It's an emotional container for most people. It's where they can put their negative emotions.

174
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.060
Gabriel: So,

175
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The requirements are that it be big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff and then it will want to stay there either. You're going to need to lock it up, have a lid.

176
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Or there's something in there that that stuff will want to stay in there until you're ready to take it out or you and I decide, we'll, we'll go explore that a little further.

177
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So what in your sort of imagination, what came up that a container could be for you.

178
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.780
Gabriel: Um, I was thinking like one of those big whiskey barrels.

179
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:37.620
Gabriel: Nice okay with the pretty things are pretty strong. And then, um,

180
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.650
Gabriel: Maybe

181
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.950
Gabriel: So I could think of as a container.

182
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think my only challenge as soon as I heard that was the word whiskey in it.

183
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:59.640
Gabriel: I'm just because it's a specific type of barrel like a big large one. You know that

184
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:07.110
Gabriel: I can hold something for a long time because we usually hold it for like seven years, depending on the whiskey 12 years

185
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.910
Gabriel: But you know, I wanted, I also was thinking about something else too. I don't like

186
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm just only because it's whiskey. That's all I don't want any other wanted to be a pure

187
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Contain whatever. So I got a little, a little uneasy. Let's keep looking. Keep looking.

188
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:25.530
I'm

189
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.240
A

190
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Big enough and strong enough to hold your stuff.

191
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.750
Gabriel: Maybe we can get a casket.

192
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.300
Heard that one yet.

193
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A casket. Okay. And is there a locking mechanism on there.

194
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.520
Gabriel: Yeah, okay.

195
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that a

196
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Fingerprint key keypad code which got what kind of lock.

197
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.300
Gabriel: It's one of those combination locks.

198
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you the only one that has that code.

199
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.480
Gabriel: Yeah.

200
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful.

201
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Not already has the lead attached to it can easily close it and then it's got this combination code.

202
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And

203
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little bit of work with this one.

204
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: A Truck. Truck this week. The last couple weeks just notice if you were

205
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: irritated or annoyed by this notion of

206
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Not feeling like heard not attended to ignored. Did that come up at all.

207
00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.670
Gabriel: Yeah.

208
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a story when it happened.

209
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:11.760
Gabriel: Um, well, you know, we talked before how Ashley as a child from her past relationship.

210
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.240
Gabriel: The little girl, her name is rating and

211
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.280
Gabriel: You know she's

212
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:23.910
Gabriel: Almost four so she you know she gets into things she doesn't listen and

213
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:34.200
Gabriel: You know, we try to emphasize, sir, you know if she's not behaving. She has to go to her room and she went to a room.

214
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:45.240
Gabriel: And shut the door and we emphasize that whenever she's in her room, she has to keep her door open. So we know what's going on. And she went into the room.

215
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:55.440
Gabriel: And shut the door, and I know that actually doesn't like that. So I told her. Hey, now you have to be in timeout. You have to sit on your bed for a few minutes.

216
00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:07.620
Gabriel: Think about what you did. And when you're finished, you can come back and actually got upset me for doing that. And I said, Well, isn't that what we're teaching her and went back and forth about it and

217
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:21.600
Gabriel: You know. It just bothers me because sometimes, you know, I try to be a father figure as well. And when she challenges. What I do the kids see that and then she's not going to listen to me.

218
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:35.670
Gabriel: And I tell you these things and she says she understands but you know obviously she doesn't understand what she wants to, you know, she's in a bad mood. And I do that and you know I'm doing something wrong. And so when I bring it up.

219
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.710
Gabriel: You know, then after a little while after that then it'll be okay again. And it's like, you know what, maybe I shouldn't is a discipline or at all, you know,

220
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:54.450
Gabriel: You should not my kid anyway. And then we start finding about that. And then it's like, you know, all this started because I was telling her to sit on your bed, something that she'd have other time.

221
00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So it sounds like you thought you were paralleling what the kind of parenting and discipline that Ashley's joining and so were you confused by her reaction.

222
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.270
Gabriel: I was, I was very confused.

223
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.920
Gabriel: And that was an a bother me because it's like, well, what do you want me to do, then

224
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.420
Gabriel: Maybe I should just stay away completely, and let you figure it out.

225
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.620
Gabriel: When but her as an actual

226
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.030
Gabriel: Yeah.

227
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You. This is familiar and similar to right not being that what you have to contribute, what you have, what, yeah, whatever it is. Is it in that same I don't matter.

228
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:46.470
Gabriel: Or is it something else. Exactly. It's that's a good point on falls back to that because it's like she's not listening to me when I when I'm trying to explain my methods mind what I'm doing.

229
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:55.560
Gabriel: Yeah, I didn't know matter because it doesn't matter what I say she has the last day and it's like, how does that equal

230
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.070
Gabriel: What everything she says

231
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.090
Gabriel: It's set in stone, and it's like

232
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.580
Gabriel: Stone.

233
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, pay attention to, let's go to that scale. Let's go zero to 100 try and register turn inward right this awareness of how how upset how relaxed or calm is your body and how distressed. Are you let's give it a number zero to 100

234
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.400
Gabriel: Oh, I was like 100 hundred and 10 and it pisses me off.

235
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

236
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.740
Gabriel: Try and register right now when I think about it when I just thought about it.

237
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.830
Gabriel: It's probably like 90 again because it was it really bothers me that really bothered me.

238
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.280
Gabriel: For about an hour, two hours after that.

239
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:52.440
Gabriel: Okay, I'm gonna kind of segue into other arguments. And it all started because of that. And it really bothered me.

240
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can tell me I write

241
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Each for

242
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And the same the same thought the belief about yourself. Well, let's let me just check in on that. So, picture that event happening. I tried to do what I thought parallel what she wanted. I thought I was doing exactly what I was supposed to do. And I still got in trouble.

243
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You still got yelled at you still got reprimanded for it and you were feeling some confusion and

244
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the belief about yourself. Let's see.

245
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:38.790
Gabriel: But

246
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.100
Gabriel: I know that it doesn't matter what I say that I don't matter. Yeah.

247
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter what I say. Okay.

248
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.000
Gabriel: Yeah, but my opinion means nothing.

249
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And you gave it a 90

250
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.320
Gabriel: Yeah, that really bothers me.

251
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.180
Gabriel: And I guess in a way it goes back to that same idea, but in a different way.

252
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.980
Gabriel: And thought about it like that.

253
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.990
Gabriel: So good. I'm looking at it funny to see how it all kind of ties together.

254
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.990
Gabriel: Yeah, so

255
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's shift gears a little bit. So we have this negative. I call it this negative cognition, right, we have the I don't matter. That's a, that's an important one, and it's it's shown up a few times and maybe even a lot in your, in your life, and

256
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What you think about, let's say that same thing you pull up that awareness, pull it into your, your memory. You can picture you brought her and put her on the bed. You put right on the bed. She was kind of she had closed the door, and then you picture Ashley getting upset.

257
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this I don't matter. Doesn't matter what I say.

258
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about right now what you want to believe about yourself right in that that same event.

259
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But what's an ideal a positive belief about yourself. That would be something you'd like to believe about yourself in an event like that. So take your time.

260
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.050
Gabriel: Yeah, yeah. I want to feel like that I'm being a good day and I'll make

261
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

262
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.060
Gabriel: Seem like

263
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.160
Gabriel: Anything else

264
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:44.820
Gabriel: I wanted it. I just because I don't want her to act out that way. You know, when she's 17 it's it's going to be more difficult to deal with when she's 17 and she

265
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.760
Gabriel: disobeying in different ways.

266
00:29:48.090 --> 00:30:04.680
Gabriel: Yeah. Seems like I got away with this so that I could probably get away with it. If not, let me try it anyway. And it doesn't matter because they'll start fighting and they'll forget about what I did. And I'll get away with it. Yeah, that sort of thing. It just so many things can happen when

267
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:08.400
Gabriel: Things like that happen.

268
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so the this positive cognition would be a good dad. So I want to do a little bit. I'm going to call it an iteration, which means I'll be doing some of the bilateral stimulation and

269
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably about 30 seconds and then you'll see me say, Okay, let's do, let's inhale together. So it will be and then

270
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'll say let it go. Now I'll ask a little, little checking question, I'll say, so what's coming up for you.

271
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But statement not along why we won't get into storytelling, because we may go right back in to the bilateral stimulation. Okay. When we're talking about something positive.

272
00:30:51.420 --> 00:31:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The movement movement is going to be slower, sometimes when we're doing desensitisation it's going to be a little faster. Okay, so right now let's go to that.

273
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Lion. Let's go to mom. So see if you can. For now I want you to kind of close your eyes and go there picture lion, the quality of the lion with its protective nature and your mom.

274
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And your uncle Hugo

275
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And picture. These qualities interacting with each other.

276
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective nature nurturing and once all interacting and and I want it to be around you.

277
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: In around immersed saturated, but I want your presence to be there to take your time and once you get a real solid image. Just give me a little head nod to let me know.

278
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to ask you.

279
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To be to open your eyes. And I'm going to have you look at that top of the coke can and that the pop with that that cop. Okay, so at a nice slow rate just back and forth at the rate that I'm wants you to hold on to that imagery

280
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Of this team of lion quality mom.

281
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And uncle Hugo

282
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it in your awareness.

283
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together nice nourishing inhale in through the nose and then

284
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.450
Let it go.

285
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gently a turn to what shifted. What is going on with you now.

286
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.340
Gabriel: I keep thinking of the image.

287
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And what emotion. Are you having as you keep thinking about it.

288
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.730
Gabriel: I'm just thinking about those feeling like

289
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.240
Gabriel: comforted and wise.

290
00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're thinking about those qualities and you can really, really see those all you need to do that that check

291
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's great that you have the support

292
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish everyone had this

293
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.730
Gabriel: Yeah, I just, it was getting pretty bad there for a while.

294
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:41.640
Gabriel: Yeah, I keep I have that image in my mind, and I see my uncle's white beard and my mom and nurse's uniform and a lion and between them to the huge line large strong main

295
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And what emotion, you're feeling right now.

296
00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:49.800
Gabriel: Just calm.

297
00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.590
Gabriel: Pretty much everything that they represent.

298
00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Common safe. And then, how's the body, pay attention to scan kind of walks out scan through the feet legs nice size thighs seat bon belly.

299
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Chest shoulder want to walk that through and just check in and see if there's any anything going on with the body.

300
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.410
Which are aware of

301
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.090
Gabriel: No, I mean I can use the restroom, but

302
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.620
Gabriel: Nothing. Nothing crazy like no pain or anything.

303
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So on the subjective right those suds how distressed. Are you right now from zero to 100

304
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.990
Gabriel: Zero. Okay, no, really distressed at all.

305
00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that that informs you. I hope that you can see that this imagery that we just pulled up that you can visit that if you start to feel

306
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can catch it quick enough like I don't matter, right, just as soon as it pops up in your interacting with someone

307
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say hold on. Before I take action and act out and sort of say something snarky or maybe you don't want to be upset at a 90 or don't want to be angry. You can go to this imagery

308
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do some breathing with it.

309
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with all of your needs, sort of being met, right, because we're okay. If we have a protective figure he perceived threat.

310
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Of I don't matter. It sort of changes, doesn't it. Once you have nurturing and you have protection and you have wisdom, it shifts the meaning of what's going on around and including in our head.

311
00:36:54.690 --> 00:37:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So in general, I would invite you to use that even as a coping skill as an imagery skills that you can visit anytime you want to.

312
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.770
Gabriel: Yes, I remember.

313
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.940
Gabriel: See the thing is that this this last time when that happened with rate in

314
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.360
Gabriel: I didn't remember to do that.

315
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:21.690
Gabriel: A lot. The last time when we did it a couple Wednesday's ago

316
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:37.680
Gabriel: That Friday we got into an argument, and I did the breathing that we practice. The reason, hold it for two seconds. Exhale 42nd except I put on my headphones and through on some meditation music and it works great. It works perfectly.

317
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:51.210
Gabriel: Yeah, I see I just never believe that it would work. You know, so I never gave it a chance to and now let them like, you know, a little bit of time. I need to practice and more often. Is it that

318
00:37:52.410 --> 00:38:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You remembered it. Sometimes you'll forget, but just realize that when she noticed how you read a 90 you told me you were at a 90 here's what happens.

319
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The VM, Angela. The one that sends the message that you're in danger that one. It only has one job.

320
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It only says, you're in danger. It doesn't nuance. The difference between emotional, psychological, physical, it says, you're in danger. There's something really old in the I don't matter. That is, it brings up a really big threat.

321
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Perception for you and not all all that's doing is saying, you're in danger. Watch what happens that signal comes up.

322
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though maybe watch the hippocampus is here and it takes longer for the message from memory stored in hypnosis, where we keep all our memory right he's great little images of remembering to breathe. It's trying to get there, but

323
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The amygdala cuts it off if you have too much flooding of fear. Right. It's going to cut off remembering and that's what happened. And then you're just in the emotion.

324
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.470
Oh,

325
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So it is hard to remember. But you, you'll get better at it, the more you're practicing the breath. The more you have sticky notes around the more you talk to people and say,

326
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If you ever see me really ticked off or upset. Feel free to remind me to take a breath and all know what to do.

327
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The more you have visual reminders around if you're not shy about it. I would have them around. I would have them in my room. Wherever I get upset a lot

328
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have one in the bathroom like do I tend to go in there and kind of chill for a second, like jump in my car. I'm gonna have a sticky note. Yeah, that's right.

329
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because when you breathe, then the blood goes to your brain. You've got the Vegas break going here and the different parts of your brain are going to be communicating with each other event. So the breath. It's, it's, it's the boat to that's going to get everything else working so

330
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If you forget your normal. That's what everybody does, we all forget to do it.

331
00:39:51.540 --> 00:40:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The more reminders, you have, the more familiar and then you'll have more more wiring, it'll be easier to remember, so hang in there. We'll get there, but at least you have this like AHA experience of. I can't believe it actually works. I thought it was just for a piece or something, right.

332
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

333
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Leave it for it to work. That's what's neat because it's not

334
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: In your head. It's also right it's an actual nerve wrapped around your organs. I mean, it's this is science. This is not just

335
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:26.280
Gabriel: That that I was like, what in NASA work.

336
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So sometimes you forget. That's okay. And so I'm just adding to to your toolbox of things that you can remember to remember this one, you remember, wait a minute. When I first started talking about this with planetary was at MIT.

337
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And then all I did was picture this line in between my mom and and nooses uniform and white beard on an uncle to go, hey, and you had a column body.

338
00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So it isn't just what we would call the breathing is is a bottom up intervention. Right. It started with that origins and one of the most about the one we just did was hop down you use imagery and you regulate the body with the mind.

339
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.220
Gabriel: Cool stuff. Yeah, yeah.

340
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have access to that. So that was a sort of a preparation, just to see how easily you can access that imagery and I can see that you can easily was exciting.

341
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

342
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:41.640
Gabriel: Yeah, when when when I did that with the meditation music and after like 10 minutes. I was just like, Wow, I can't believe that work.

343
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.430
Gabriel: It was, it was really cool.

344
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.740
Gabriel: It was a really cool experience.

345
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:48.240
Gabriel: So,

346
00:41:48.270 --> 00:42:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we're at a quarter of I, I don't want to start something else. I don't want to unravel some of the negative stuff. I like where we're at right now. I like that you're calm that you have this nice feeling when we say they're a little bit longer. Okay.

347
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and let's talk more about what's been working. Let's get behind some of the things you mentioned the diaphragm breathing has been effective.

348
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What else have you liked that you've been doing let's let's do some

349
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: improv. Let's look at, okay, cool things like

350
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.010
Gabriel: I haven't really been doing much else.

351
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:38.580
Gabriel: Trying to stay calm and practicing those breathing exercises. Whenever I remember to do them. I do them like I did. I'm a little while ago.

352
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:47.790
Gabriel: Just, you know, just trying to regulate my, my heart rate and remembering how to do it correctly.

353
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:57.720
Gabriel: So like a good sometimes I don't think I'm taking deep enough breaths or exhaling, or sometimes I'll hold it a little, a little oh yeah like

354
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.630
Gabriel: A little bit more than two seconds.

355
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter. So the reason why we teach it with the with the inhale for four hold for four exhale for for whole for for because it's it's it's easy to teach what I've noticed is that exhale that you do may take six seconds.

356
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:19.350
Okay.

357
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

358
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a, it's a very powerful part of the breath work. So go for it. And when, after you exhale, and you do the whole you may only be able to hold it for a couple seconds and that's fine. It's really about

359
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: paying close attention versus

360
00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just that's not going to cut it. It's my counting on my noticing where that error is going in my trying my

361
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: My best to get it down there in the diaphragm area, pushing, pushing all that air down into the bottom of the lungs. Am I doing that, am I paying attention. I mean we knows, those are the key pieces.

362
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to do, it's important but labeling yourself if you're not is going to get you now into a negative

363
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Framework. We don't want that. We don't want you calling yourself names we want

364
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, I noticed I noticed my shoulders just dropped as I just inhale, like those those mindfulness awareness is are good but labels about how you're whether you're doing it right or not or best not what we want. We don't want negative judgment about yourself.

365
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

366
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:31.890
Gabriel: Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

367
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:40.860
Gabriel: It was a yeah it was just something I was thinking about, because sometimes they would take me a little longer than four seconds. Exhale, but

368
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

369
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.750
Gabriel: Like disrupt my breathing. Yeah. What. All right.

370
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's no it's just fine. It's the concentration on it up.

371
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: In observer a look. Look, I'm look I'm doing it for seven where I was, I was doing it for for six

372
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm doing that. So, um,

373
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Before we go, I just want to just check in on we, you and I, either a, you know, an individual and then again in group had had kind of covered that drama triangle right

374
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:13.860
Gabriel: Yeah.

375
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a chance to witness either yourself moving from from those rigid roles and maybe also you and Ashley Romanian other relationships, and if so, tell me about it.

376
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:36.570
Gabriel: Yeah, I've noticed how actually does. Does that, does the whole drama triangle like I've watched her go from

377
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.280
Gabriel: Hero to victim to

378
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:42.570
Gabriel: The only

379
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:44.910
Gabriel: Those are the only two I can remember but

380
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: persecutor when she gets mad at you.

381
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.000
Gabriel: Yo. Yeah, yeah.

382
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:54.630
Gabriel: All the time. All the time now.

383
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:59.910
Gabriel: I think it has a little orange square, triangle. And I'm just like the way you look at that.

384
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:12.330
Gabriel: Yeah, it's yeah like I can't remember what she was doing but she was trying to do something and then she's like, Oh, well, I'm just trying to help.

385
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:17.910
Gabriel: I'm like okay well I guess I don't have to help you find a wanted even. I'm like, well,

386
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:25.560
Gabriel: Yeah, and it's funny to see like how it just changes so quickly like within seconds, very fast, very fast.

387
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can create compassion, believe it or not, in those moments for people because they don't know what you know they don't know that there's freedom from there literally when we don't have

388
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The information to realize

389
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing it, I can now free myself from that I can opt out, and I can do those other like I can be an advocate coach. I can do those roles more

390
00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You can find compassion, if you want to, for her, if you want to you can be like, well, I imagine that would be hard, like in your mind, imagine that'd be hard because she doesn't know any other way to be

391
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: She's grasping at this ability to control the best way she knows how if you want to kind of meet her with compassion that would be a way to do it because she doesn't know any other way. Right. She's not the one in therapy.

392
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:25.050
Gabriel: So how do you, how do you bring it up.

393
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I am not saying to bring it up.

394
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.160
I'm saying

395
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going on in your head, your head because what will happen if you have compassion for someone while they're going through that. That means that you're not this little fish that bit. Oh, well fine.

396
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm only trying to help get you won't help you know what i'm not going to help anymore. I'm going to offer you don't think I'm it

397
00:47:52.560 --> 00:48:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't fight that bait, you just look at her and say to yourself in your head that would be hard because

398
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't know what else to do but I can see how solidify those roles are and you don't say anything.

399
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You just, you're just a witness to it, but you don't get upset. You don't have to change her

400
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Not to do any of it, you're free now. Now you can see it. It's this time, I know all she's doing is moving from these places and you just you're at peace with yourself. Go with your team lion mom Hugo

401
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You're not activated. Now you can see it from a distance. You see it over there. She's go now. Now she's mad at you because you're not reacting. Now if you don't react. She's getting pissed off at you.

402
00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to keep going. It's going to move, move, move until she gets a reaction from you.

403
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't have to. That's how you opt out. You just that looks

404
00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That looks hard going through. That's all you say it looks like you're you're having a hard time of it right now.

405
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.150
That looks hard

406
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.890
Gabriel: It's funny that you mentioned that because last night.

407
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:16.620
Gabriel: She found like so this Saturday we celebrated my son's one way. The third one.

408
00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:21.000
Gabriel: First, and we celebrated one year old birthday. Yeah. On Saturday.

409
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.550
Gabriel: Yeah, he's a very nice boy and

410
00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:35.670
Gabriel: So we've had some people over and this last night she found like a like a like a like a nail like a woman's nail

411
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:47.790
Gabriel: On the on the carpet and she picked it over, she said, Whoa, what is that like I was like, I don't know. And she picked it up. She's like, it's a woman's nail and like

412
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:54.450
Gabriel: I was like, well, it's talking about now looks like it looks like a kids and and she's like, No, it's definitely a woman's now.

413
00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:03.060
Gabriel: I was like, well, it looks like it was bought at the dollar store or something. And she's like, uh huh. And like looking at an examining it

414
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.440
Gabriel: And now in my head like, and I was trying to be like, Oh, well, maybe it's this or maybe it's this and

415
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:21.390
Gabriel: I was like in my head I was like, why am I, and like trying to defend myself like I did something wrong. You know, because I'm I already know in her head, she's thinking oh maybe brought a girl over and I was like, it's probably my sisters from the party this weekend.

416
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:32.670
Gabriel: Yeah. And then I was like I was like her. And she was like, so I just didn't say anything. I just let her you know go deal with it in her own on our own, and

417
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:39.240
Gabriel: After about 30 minutes like I could see that she was trying to bait me, and I'll get a reaction out of me. Or, you know,

418
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:45.150
Gabriel: Try to control me in a way, it's like, look, I'm going to do this and then he's going to do this like I already know in their mind.

419
00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:55.170
Gabriel: But I saw that. So I didn't do anything. I didn't, you know, didn't try to play the say like, Oh my God, or maybe it says, or, you know, I didn't get nervous or

420
00:50:55.650 --> 00:51:05.010
Gabriel: I did a little bit. I stopped out any minute. She's gonna say this I say that, and like I felt like I took control of the situation. I sent me Emily, whatever.

421
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:12.900
Gabriel: And I just left it alone. And sure enough, it's the over it. Few minutes late or took like an hour, but she

422
00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:30.780
Gabriel: felt like that was a learning moment for me because yeah because I was like the old me would have been like, well, maybe it was, you know, tried making you know try to finding a reason. So I so she doesn't think that it was me, but somehow I had a woman over there, something like that.

423
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Work harder to convince her out. And instead, you didn't work as hard and you kind of left the room and she was left to try and figure it out on our own.

424
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:45.870
Gabriel: Exactly. And she when she figured out that she's the crazy one

425
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.640
Down so good.

426
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.170
Gabriel: Well, I mean, I would like to think that

427
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: No, because no

428
00:51:54.780 --> 00:52:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: One. Of, you know, you just you do best guess she has a particular meaning out of it now.

429
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of you have to make it up unless you have a video of that room to rewind and

430
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:23.220
Gabriel: So, but she she knows she knows she knows that that didn't happen you know she knows that she knows I wouldn't do that. But she's trying to make me think that she thinks that so she can get a reaction out of me. So she can feel like she's in control. I go, I'll have to do this and then

431
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:35.130
Gabriel: I'll make him do this, I already know you know that's at least that's what I think. But I was able to overcome that and I know I'm in control of my own emotion and you're not going to do that.

432
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. You had a learning moment, as you said,

433
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:39.930
Gabriel: Huh, yeah.

434
00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And just to touch slightly on some of the the pieces around the substance use of you had waves of strong cravings are they really further and further getting further and further apart.

435
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.880
Gabriel: But the other. I don't really

436
00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.920
Gabriel: The thing was before my God that I would

437
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:19.170
Gabriel: Get the drug from what call me like if you didn't hear from me for like a week or so he would send me text messages little reminder that I have this and I have this and then that will kick into my mind. So, Ashley went into my phone and block his number

438
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:26.460
Gabriel: So now I can't get any messages. So now it's been easier now it's just trying to get off of these

439
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.200
Gabriel: Beautiful.

440
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.150
Gabriel: Okay.

441
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you happy with the rate that you're tapering, you can certainly speak your mind and most people have ambivalence about

442
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.140
It.

443
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to do it every week. I'm nervous, but at the same time. I'm excited. Now you have a part in this in this

444
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.610
Gabriel: I mean, I am excited because I don't want it. I just don't want to.

445
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.320
Gabriel: Withdraw or feel like I need it and

446
00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing the work. A real you're meeting with me. You're catching yourself doing learning moments you caught yourself breathing, you had success around that basically

447
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what everybody's doing we're all trying to meet the stresses of our life as gracefully as we can. It's not some big magic thing that

448
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: folks that aren't in in sort of this addictive pattern we don't hold some magic mystery here we just do the things that work in a healthy way. And all it means is somewhere along the line.

449
00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: This stuff wasn't taught to you and now you're learning it so just you're doing it. You're right on time okay right on time.

450
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:42.660
And speaking of time.

451
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:48.180
Gabriel: Yeah, I just don't want them cuz they the church closes at noon.

452
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

453
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.530
Gabriel: Sounds good were scheduled for Wednesday at 11am

455
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: 2026 is a Wednesday.
