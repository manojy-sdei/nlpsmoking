00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we will be seeing Omar all one and I'm checking his cures. It looks like the last time he received

2
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:25.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: buprenorphine naloxone two milligram films was on February 28 20 days supply it takes one a day from a doctor Hanscom

3
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Ha, and CEO me

4
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thank you.

5
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hello, Mr.

6
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.150
Omar Alwan: How are you, good morning.

7
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Morning. I'm Dr. Allah DAG, how are you

8
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.830
Omar Alwan: Doing well. Nice to meet you.

9
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:18.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Nice to meet you too. So, um, welcome to bright heart health, it seems that us, is it. I see that you've been on Suboxone before, right.

10
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes.

11
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.550
Omar Alwan: And I've been on it since February 2 of 2020

12
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so just pretty recently.

13
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:40.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, and I have access to a database where, you know, we can see like what prescribed controlled substances, you were given and stuff. So from that it looks like you've been on the two milligram film.

14
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, and you take just one a day.

15
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:56.340
Omar Alwan: Um, so here's the thing. When I first was inducted or when I was first introduced on Suboxone I started off with eight milligrams

16
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.470
Omar Alwan: Okay. My intention was not to stay on it for long, so almost immediately. I was on a gradual taper from

17
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.290
Omar Alwan: A seven to six.

18
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.400
Omar Alwan: I saw um

19
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:22.230
Omar Alwan: Yeah, so that's why I, in my experience with it. I was never truly stable, you know, so it felt like there was a lot of like just small pieces of withdraw that I'm experiencing here and there.

20
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:32.580
Omar Alwan: Yeah, so that's why I'm like reconsidering what I was doing. I don't know. Maybe I should be on six milligrams and consistent with that for a while.

21
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, I like that idea. I like that idea. And I'll tell you why. Because I'm. Is this the first time you receiving treatment for opioid problem.

22
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:57.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. Okay, so we know that the gold standard is maintenance right and but that scares people, because people are like, Well, I don't know. I don't want to be on something forever and whatever it

23
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:09.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is it doesn't have to mean forever. It just means like you're saying just to get stable, you're not feeling any withdrawal and no cravings and you're just normal

24
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:21.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: It right in that zone and we can keep you there for a month, two months, three months, you know, like a good amount of time. It allows brain and your receptors, those

25
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:32.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Receptors that were used to being kind of burned out and used up all the time to return back to normal function. So the longer you stay on it at a steady level, the better.

26
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your healing happens right

27
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.450
Omar Alwan: So, so that is a question I do have

28
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.960
Omar Alwan: So, even while you're on Suboxone there is I guess receptor recovery and neurotransmitter levels there is recovery going on as well.

29
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Absolutely. There's recovery going on while you're on it.

30
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:59.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: And right because of the there's no more oscillation. No more up and down when we would the, the highs and the lows and

31
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right. Announcer your system. It's just a stable and

32
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: It allows the receptor to gain back to normal. You know sensitivities and production and all that stuff.

33
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.260
Omar Alwan: Okay.

34
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's good to know. Yeah, so it's not like you're wasting time while you're on it, you're actually doing. And you're also healing your life.

35
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, because you're all exactly

36
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:29.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: The psychological work that goes behind the, what was I missing that I was going for this. Why was I trying to escape, whatever it was I was feeling like, how do I

37
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Deal with that because what

38
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: If that's how I feel a lot. And what else am I going to do, you know, like you're going to learn

39
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:50.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then hopefully you get to a good place. And you're like, Doc. Okay. I think it's time. Let's do the very slow taper and we go super slow you feel comfortable and then we check in again and whatever. So, like, that's kind of the pathway, I would recommend

40
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.860
Omar Alwan: Mm hmm. And I like it.

41
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sounds like that's what you would want. Okay.

42
00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. And you think you started at eight but you think you'll be okay comfortable at six.

43
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.900
Omar Alwan: Um,

44
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:16.290
Omar Alwan: Yeah, yeah, I think I like six as a number for now and then possibly just going a little down to for staying on for for a bit, but for now six. Yeah.

45
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:26.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: And do you, do you want to do it where you take two in the morning, two in the afternoon and two before bed, do you want to do to to to

46
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.560
Omar Alwan: Or do you want to. Okay, that is actually something I was constantly debating, that's another part of how I switched up my routine is I started off with

47
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.700
Omar Alwan: four in the morning for just before bed. But then I like doing some research online. A lot of people

48
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.710
Omar Alwan: advise that you kind of just stick to one dose in the morning so that your body like and it's kind of like a psychological thing where you're not just

49
00:05:50.220 --> 00:06:03.300
Omar Alwan: You know, waiting for the next dose or whatever. And then I heard that that also makes it easier to get off of it when you're only doing one dose, rather than several doses throughout the day. So what's your opinion on that.

50
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, I think ultimately when we're trying to get off of the medication.

51
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: I haven't had trouble with people dosing a couple times a day.

52
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.560
Omar Alwan: Okay.

53
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: In fact, I think actually that's easier because it kind of maintains the blood like

54
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: The, the medication originally is designed for Once a Day dosing. So it's supposed to hold you. You're supposed to take one dose in the

55
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.140
Omar Alwan: Morning.

56
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:45.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: And supposed to hold you over until 24 hours later, and then you're doing it again, but I find in my experience with patients sometimes people are like, you know, I don't know, I feel like a start getting a little craving or something. Towards the end of the day.

57
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.090
Omar Alwan: That's exactly my experience. Exactly.

58
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:56.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so for that reason, I say, okay, well then how about one in the morning and one maybe after lunch that way just to don't

59
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:10.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Have to do three just do one after lunch or something and then that way. Um, so, then that would be like if you're doing the film's. Is it the films, because they're covered by your insurance.

60
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.690
Omar Alwan: I believe so. Yeah.

61
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.080
Omar Alwan: I mean, that's the one I get from them from the pharmacy.

62
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.600
Omar Alwan: Each time I go, I've never gotten the pills.

63
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we could, you could do like one and a half film in the morning and one enough film of the tools.

64
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.570
In the yeah

65
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.460
Omar Alwan: That sounds good.

66
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:37.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: That way, you're good. It's not three times a day. It's not so tedious, you just remember the day you know one one wake up and one after eat some lunch.

67
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right. Hopefully it holds you all day and you're at six milligrams total

68
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:51.510
Omar Alwan: And then my experience. That's where I was. I guess that my most comfortable and feeling my most stable where it's not something that's like, I'm thinking about where I'm experiencing.

69
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:59.160
Omar Alwan: Cravings or whatever. When I was doing that, like in the morning, afternoon or at night, so I do like that idea better also

70
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:05.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we'll try that. And then we can always adjust. If you need adjusting

71
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:13.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: And. Okay, so tell me a bit of background information. So, so tell me

72
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: First of all, social history wise like where are you living now are you with your parents are you on your own, like what's going on.

73
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:28.380
Omar Alwan: So, um, I actually was going to school in the Bay Area.

74
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.010
Omar Alwan: And then because of, like, I'm a medical student. It was my first year.

75
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.610
Omar Alwan: Do you know Toro, California. Have you heard of Toro

76
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:39.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: No.

77
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.080
Omar Alwan: Yeah, so that's the school that I was going to in the Bay Area.

78
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:50.550
Omar Alwan: I developed the addiction around late fall time and then

79
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.790
Omar Alwan: Went to rehab in February.

80
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.010
Omar Alwan: Because like it just spiraled

81
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.820
Omar Alwan: Very terribly went to rehab in February and then

82
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:00.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Where did you

83
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.150
Omar Alwan: Olympia house. I don't know if you've heard of it. It's in Petaluma

84
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and it was

85
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like did you, did they detox you first and induce you first or what did they do.

86
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:20.760
Omar Alwan: Yeah, exactly. It was like a detox waited long enough, until I can take the Suboxone

87
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:35.340
Omar Alwan: And then, yeah, and I was there for about 10 days because I had to get back for school which I ended up taking a leave of absence for. So now I'm down in Southern California living with my mom and my brother.

88
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, mom, bro. Okay and Southern California.

89
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, I'm in LA, are you

90
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.470
Omar Alwan: Nice. I'm in LA County, so I

91
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.590
Omar Alwan: Guess. This is home to me.

92
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: This is your home. So you're originally from here. I mean,

93
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I grew

94
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.340
Omar Alwan: I grew up in Claremont, California. I'm not sure if you're familiar with.

95
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:56.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yesterday,

96
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, I know. Okay.

97
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.180
Omar Alwan: Yeah.

98
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so now you're back with them, you took a leave. I think that's a good idea to just

99
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Be group yourself and then

100
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.590
Omar Alwan: Exactly.

101
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.120
Omar Alwan: come back stronger, you know,

102
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: That song. Yeah, exactly right with

103
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: This look

104
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.290
Omar Alwan: Aurora.

105
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:27.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: You were kind of wavering, not knowing what you're doing. So now we'll get you stable and then you can, you know, think about, Okay, I think I can start next semester, whatever semester, you want to start

106
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hmm. OK, cool. So you were in med school. Man, that's great. Do you know

107
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: What kind of specialty or you don't know yet. I mean, we're just starting

108
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:48.510
Omar Alwan: Right, I'm just starting. And really, all of them fast fascinate me in a different way. There are some that I lean towards maybe emergency I like intensive care.

109
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.750
Omar Alwan: But in this experience.

110
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.640
Omar Alwan: I actually am

111
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.050
Omar Alwan: even considering

112
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.150
Omar Alwan: Addiction specialist

113
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.020
Omar Alwan: Possibly

114
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:06.270
Omar Alwan: I feel like I have like this level of, you know, connection with the patients.

115
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:06.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

116
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.160
Omar Alwan: Yeah, oh yeah.

117
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and

118
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:26.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: About addiction is you don't have to go through psychiatry, necessarily. So you could you could technically, let's say, do an ER residency emergency specialty and then you have your fellowship and addiction. So you can do

119
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or you could do.

120
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:42.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: What I did was I did family medicine. So you can do family medicine and then do addiction on top and then you can practice both if you want, or just focus on one. So the cool thing about addictions fellowships, you can go on from any special

121
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Something else first

122
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.410
Omar Alwan: Um, that's awesome.

123
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:57.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, okay, yeah. So maybe one day you'll do that. I see. So you were in med school. And then, so this whole thing started like october november 2019

124
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.000
Omar Alwan: Yeah, exactly. Actually, it was around early November of 2019 yeah

125
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: So prior to that you had you been like

126
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.610
Omar Alwan: Did you, good question.

127
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, like so.

128
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:16.410
Omar Alwan: So yeah, that's the thing. It's not that all of a sudden 2019 I picked up an opioid and then it's

129
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:27.330
Omar Alwan: from years ago, like, you know, I would find medicine like a Viking and bottle at home, I would try a couple. So I've had experiences in the past of like

130
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:40.590
Omar Alwan: Like I've been. I mean, once an addict always an addict, but I've been in active addiction before and then got myself out of it because it was with more like relatively benign pills like Vicodin or

131
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:47.220
Omar Alwan: Like even at times, there was with oxy code on but then this time around. What happened was,

132
00:12:48.630 --> 00:13:02.700
Omar Alwan: I started off again with like Viking in did oxy codeine and then I go to the guy that I was getting it from. And he didn't have any more of those what he had was depressed fentanyl pills, which. Yes, I know. I know. It's very dangerous stuff.

133
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: A dangerous.

134
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:14.670
Omar Alwan: Okay, yeah. So, and then also with fentanyl right. The thing is, is you you build a tolerance, very quickly, and it's a very short lived, high right so it's kind of like

135
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:25.710
Omar Alwan: It really grabs hold of you essentially that's why I needed professional help. Whereas in the past, I was able to kind of do it on my own. But I guess.

136
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:43.140
Omar Alwan: Sorry. Um, I guess in this past experience. What I learned is that there's more to it than just detoxing. Yeah. You know what I mean. Recovery. It's a lot of things you have to work towards rather than just getting clean

137
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:54.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah exactly like okay so sobriety or detox, whatever. That's great. That's the first step you want. Yes, but that is not a solution because

138
00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:11.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: You tend to have, you know, we're humans are creatures of habit and we tend to go back to the mental ways we are you know whatever we're thinking about how the same kind of logic is still running your brain.

139
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:25.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you still will find yourself going to the same guy and ask for the same stupid thing you know like if you don't change more than just, okay, I just got sober, you know. Yeah, you got it, you got it so so good. I'm

140
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: So glad you have that insight, because that means you're willing to do the work that's

141
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.610
Omar Alwan: Mm hmm.

142
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now that you took time off of school.

143
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:51.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, it's perfect. This is exactly what you should really hone in on. So I would encourage you to do visits individual visits with the therapist assigned to in bright heart. Um, do you, do you know who that is. I think for you. It's going to be Serena.

144
00:14:52.710 --> 00:15:06.060
Omar Alwan: No, but I actually don't know yet. But that's very exciting. I'm very happy to hear that because I was also on the side actively trying to find a therapist or psychologist, which it's hard right now with everything that's going on, you know,

145
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:12.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, no utilize you're already here with us utilize the the connection.

146
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.640
Omar Alwan: And yeah, amazing us

147
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, that's good news. I think this is

148
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.030
Omar Alwan: Going for you.

149
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:28.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah so Serena. So, her name is Serena and what you do is you call the virtual clinic, like when we're done today.

150
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:28.920
Omar Alwan: So you

151
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Call them back and you say, hey, I want to make my first appointment with my assigned therapist. Hmm.

152
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:47.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: And they'll say, okay, sure, you know, here's your visit time or whatever. And then you can do your one on ones and then you can schedule with her. How frequently do you want to see her weekly every two weeks, whatever you guys can

153
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:57.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Either but that because you need, you want to have that that support to kind of discover what's going on with you, like, why do you do this stuff, you know,

154
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:04.290
Omar Alwan: Yeah, absolutely. To say that I need that is borderline an understatement. So I totally agree.

155
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:14.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: It looks like actually you're assigned to not sorry. Now you're at least here assigned to Rebecca Evans. So, her name is Rebecca Evans. Okay.

156
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: And

157
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Which leads me to the other thing, which is that

158
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:40.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: With Rebecca I run a group. So we do group model here as much as we can, where we meet weekly with you in a group setting. So there's other patients like you that are on Suboxone. A lot of them are

159
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.580
Omar Alwan: There's a few people.

160
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:49.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: That are have alcohol is their main issues on that. But in any case, I do a quick like hey Omar. What's up with you are

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:55.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: You good on your dose want to change. No. Okay. Cool. We'll get you your refill. And then I move on to the next person, whatever.

162
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then we do like a group conversation.

163
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:08.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: The therapist usually helps lead that you know some recovery based thing or like wellness thing. And then, and then it's over. And it's usually a one hour session.

164
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:17.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so we do that. There's a session that I do with her 9am on Mondays.

178
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:26.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, you mentioned in your past like dabbling with Vicodin and oxy codeine and like kind of weaning yourself off somehow

179
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:35.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Went. How old were you when you first started doing this. And we'd like 16 or younger. Like did you start with marijuana, like, what, what kind of

180
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.030
Omar Alwan: Draw. Okay.

181
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:42.960
Omar Alwan: Yeah, so when I first ever started doing any kind of substance was I was around 12 years old and it was marijuana

182
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, okay, yeah.

183
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:45.810
Omar Alwan: Very young

184
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.340
Mom Yeah.

185
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:55.080
Omar Alwan: Yeah, I mean, that's like one of the only regrets. I have in my life is the fact that I started to kind of

186
00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.710
Omar Alwan: Mess with my young developing mind, you know, it's so crucial just yeah

187
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:12.150
Omar Alwan: So anyways, so yeah, marijuana, and then like growing up in my teens. I just wasn't around the right people. So it was like trying a lot of different kind of stuff.

188
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:29.040
Omar Alwan: Never anything that was really addicting or nothing really that I became addicted to until I was around like 1920 years old when I first kind of developed a dependency or addiction to like Vikings. Okay. Yeah.

189
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:41.370
Omar Alwan: Yeah yeah around there and then ever since then, which is like the past seven years it's been like an on and off thing where, like, I would do it for a few months, and then stop for a year to

190
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:58.230
Omar Alwan: Fall back in the cycle. Few months stop for a year or two, and that's what happened this past time to like I had about two years clean and then boredom, depression, anxiety, stress for medical school led to me making poor decision.

191
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.740
Omar Alwan: Yeah. Mm hmm.

192
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so

193
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:17.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: I got you. So you have some really good things going for you though Omar. One is, first of all, you're here and you're making the effort to, like, help yourself so that's good.

194
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:31.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: To you have insight, like you're able to verbalize like, you know, I kind of regret doing this level. I like you know you have insight into what was not the best choice for you in the past, etc.

195
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: And therefore, hopefully you can kind of

196
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:39.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Choose better next time. And then the third thing is you. Despite all of this, you're obviously very

197
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:52.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're intelligent and you're, you're, you must be some sort of like a go getter type of person and accomplish that you get yourself into med school. Right. It's not an easy task to get to that spot to begin with.

198
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:53.760
And then

199
00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:05.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, so, so you can do a lot of great things, but you could be even better. And like live such a smoother life if you get rid of this.

200
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.530
Omar Alwan: Have I know you're right.

201
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.250
Omar Alwan: You're right.

202
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:16.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because it can turn deadly and those press sentinels yeah like you don't know what that stuff is super potent

203
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:23.220
Omar Alwan: And yeah, for sure. I would have never thought I would be doing something to that level, you know,

204
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:24.720
Omar Alwan: Yeah.

205
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I mean, nobody does right nobody

206
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.160
Omar Alwan: Yeah, absolutely.

207
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:35.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, okay, family history. So you mentioned Mom You didn't mention dad his dad around or

208
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:44.340
Omar Alwan: Yeah, yeah. So my dad is around but my parents are divorced. So I kind of my dad lives in Clermont like not far away from me at all. I see him.

209
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:54.540
Omar Alwan: Every once in a while. Not that frequently. So I'm generally kind of closer to my mom, she's really in my life a lot more than he is. That's probably why I mentioned her a bit

210
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.070
Omar Alwan: Okay, yeah.

211
00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:04.050

225
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:56.040
Omar Alwan: I, I don't even think I just take it so that I don't have to deal with the brains apps that withdrawals. You know, I don't really think that has a substantial effect on me.

226
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Haha. Okay.

227
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.100

228
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.000
Omar Alwan: Just this

229
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is that a is that a prescription that you get from a primary care doc or

230
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:20.640
Omar Alwan: Who's giving from yeah so I was getting that from my psychiatrist, um, that he's kind of like a family friend, so I don't actively go and like do visits. It's just something I'm getting now to kind of maintain it.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Me so we can do it for you here.

232

234
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, we can do that for you. And then we can talk about, you know, once we start thinking about

235
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:52.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like okay, you're feeling stable, maybe you want to consider getting off the Suboxone maybe even before we do that, we could try weaning you off of that getting you to 10 milligram. I don't know. And then five or something, I don't know.

236
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.310
Omar Alwan: Yeah.

237
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know what, let's

238
00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:01.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do that. Yeah, it's, it's worth trying. Because you're saying you're not really sure if it's healthy or whatever.

239
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, simplify your life right and how

Omar Alwan: Oh yeah, like

243
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.820
Omar Alwan: Six, seven years, something like that.

244
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.070
Omar Alwan: Okay, yeah.

245
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.120
Omar Alwan: And he does it.

246
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: For depression or anxiety.

247
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:24.870
Omar Alwan: So it actually was for anxiety. I had a lot of social anxiety that I was dealing with for a while it was

248
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:37.230
Omar Alwan: A big factor in my life. Yeah. But since then, I feel like I've, you know, made a lot of strides and I've come a long way. So that's why I'm like, I don't know if

249
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.740
You

250
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.590
Omar Alwan: Want to take this stuff.

251
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, we'll work on on that. When you're ready, and what we want to do it. You just let me know.

252
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:57.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so. Okay, so we continue that for anxiety for now and then see anything else that you're on. No.

253
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.430
Omar Alwan: No, that's it.

254
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:02.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

255
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:12.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Excellent. Okay, so I, I think. Let me see if there's any old review of systems is just, you know, review of systems, you're going, yeah.

256
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.870
Omar Alwan: I know I can review my own systems, if you

257
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Have any like general like Malays, do you get fevers, chills, any chest pains.

258
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:32.700
Omar Alwan: Sure, the only the only substantial one I can give you. And this is something I've been dealing with for a while is just, it's a gut problems, um,

259
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:47.400
Omar Alwan: I don't know if I've grown up with like inflammatory bowel syndrome or whatever. But I guess it's especially relevant now because I think the Suboxone just worsens it with the whole like constipation, that it induces essentially

260
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.870
Omar Alwan: So yeah, sometimes it can get pretty bad.

261
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Isn't

262
00:25:53.910 --> 00:26:01.080
Omar Alwan: So what happens, it's not even like the constipation. That's a bad is, I don't know if you've ever heard of this before, but this is my first time like

263
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:11.160
Omar Alwan: I've always wanted to go see a gastroenterologist or something. But, OK, I can literally feel bowels bowel movement throughout my transverse colon.

264
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:12.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: You feel it.

265
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.970
Omar Alwan: I feel it and I know it sounds crazy, but it's like I can feel

266
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.530
Omar Alwan: Like it and

267
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:28.800
Omar Alwan: Yeah, yeah. And it can get it can be very, it's the pain is as bad as the, I guess, annoying newness of it and just like

268
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:41.130
Omar Alwan: It's just really uncomfortable and bothersome just like I'm just laying there and I just feel like some pressure. Pressure traveling across my belly constantly, constantly so

269
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:52.800
Omar Alwan: I said I looked it up what that could possibly be from because it's kind of strange. It could be just from too much traffic you know like being really backed up.

270
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.670
Omar Alwan: Yeah, inflammation. I believe also can be another

271
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.280
Omar Alwan: Yeah, reason why but anyways.

272
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's kind of me, gas, gas can be really painful and feel like things are moving. I don't know.

273
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:12.090
Omar Alwan: I can differentiate between gas and stool for sure. And you're right. And a lot of the time it's it's tool, straight up, it's

274
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.180
Omar Alwan: It's very tough to do that.

275
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:27.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: It is something that you may. Yeah. Discuss with a gastroenterologist like a good GI doctor in you know hurt to have a conversation be like what's up with that and am I just extra sensitive. What do I do

276
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: I would imagine, though.

277
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Treatment wise I mean fiber.

278
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, like yeah yourself like little more frequently and regularly. So I would get like me relax.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.720
Omar Alwan: Yeah, yeah. I have actually relax right now. You're right.

283
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.620
Omar Alwan: So I can

284
00:27:52.710 --> 00:28:04.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do it as a routines like for your body and see. See if he wants to get into a groove with it if it, if it helps. Bless you. Right. You know, the Suboxone is a partial opioid so it does tend to cause that

285
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right patient

286
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.530
Yeah.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:14.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so that was you get that any other problems on a general

289
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:16.980
Omar Alwan: No.

290
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're pretty healthy otherwise right

291
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.200
Omar Alwan: Yeah I exercise. I tried to stay eating well, stuff like that. Yeah.

292
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, cool. Um,

293
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think I got everything I need from you.

294
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you're okay with trying these group visits.

295
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:51.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, we, it's kind of cool. The last time we met Rebecca actually couldn't log on. So it was just me running it. And the guys had a good time is it's all guys the nine o'clock group that you're going to join.

296
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:58.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Know, nice cool like everybody supports each other. There's people that have been on it for a long time. There's people that just got on it and stuff so

297
00:28:59.340 --> 00:28:59.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean,

298
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:09.900
Omar Alwan: That's my experience in the past with the meetings like that. It's like everybody's very warm and friendly and inclusive. So not only am I cool with it. I look forward to that. Like,

299
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:24.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: What I wanted. I think it'll help. It'll be good and and it's online, so it's so convenient. You don't have to go anywhere, you're there, you can do this program. And it's exactly what you need right now is that recovery themed stuff like

300
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.080
Omar Alwan: Me. Great.

301
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm so that you can be like, Okay, what's going on with me and get back on the horse, you know,

302
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:41.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay so pharmacy wise if we're going to try this one and a half film. So this pharmacists may say don't cut the film, but you can cut the film.

303
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.330
Omar Alwan: Okay, I read that on the strips. I don't understand why not, but yeah.

304
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: You could cut it.

305
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:52.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right. And if if we want to switch to the tablet, we can. I mean, it's the same thing, but usually it's like

306
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:59.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: A insurance issue of like reason they cover the film, but they don't cover the nap or something.

307
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:00.810
Omar Alwan: But

308
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:07.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Anyway, for now, since you've had it before and you're okay with it. You let it melt under your tongue. That's how it enters your system.

309
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:07.980
Right.

310
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: It looks like we have Walgreens on Arrow highway was. Yeah, okay.

311
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's correct. So it'll go there.

312
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you, you can take it like you haven't been on opioids. Right. Are you

313
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you still on the Suboxone now.

314
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:42.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so good. You're ready you can just take it so like starting tomorrow or whatever. You take one and a half in the morning and one and a half after your lunch.

315
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do remember to add me relax to your regimen that might help you

316
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:49.920
Omar Alwan: Yeah, for sure.

317
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: And that's it. But for the. Oh, and then you do your

318
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your once a day when you take your Lexapro, in the morning.

319
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.700
Omar Alwan: around lunchtime. So like with a meal, basically.

320
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.170
Omar Alwan: Okay, yeah.

321
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:15.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: This one enough films on your tongue. I'm going to say twice daily, but, you know, to take it, not necessarily at night. I think the second dose for you should probably be after lunch. Yeah, you know,

322
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.090
Omar Alwan: Mm hmm. Can I just ask them curious. But why did, why would you discourage nighttime.

323
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:27.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: You could do at nighttime. It's just, I'm, I'm just wondering if it would

324
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:35.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's not, I don't know. I wouldn't discourage it if you if you think it's not all day with the one and a half.

325
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.560
Omar Alwan: And feeling okay

326
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:38.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: But if

327
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know what I mean, it's

328
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah that otherwise.

329
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't mind and whatever, whatever is convenient for you and whatever makes you feel steady. I just want you to feel sick. I don't want

330
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: To have a dip.

331
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:57.270
Omar Alwan: Yeah yeah that makes sense because that's when I was dipping the nighttime. So if I take it around.

332
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.140
Omar Alwan: You know, late afternoon, I will have to really deal with that.

333
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm gonna have to deal with it. And if there is

334
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: One is in the middle of the night sleeping. Hopefully, and let

335
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:12.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Me take a new one. So, right. That's kind of why I'm thinking, Yeah, early afternoon or something beef. Yeah.

336
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:19.410
Omar Alwan: And so long as I stay on a steady dose, not just constantly dropping it. I think that stability, welcome.

337
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.780
Omar Alwan: My body will adjust. Yeah.

338
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I think you went a little

339
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Deeper detox.

340
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:27.300
Option.

341
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:36.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I'm glad that you're understanding that there might be a better way to do this.

342
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: You just like more patient, you know, yeah, I mean longer

343
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:48.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's fine. It's a medication you're not doing anything wrong and better use this time to feel clear not use

344
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: And get the psychological treatments and do all the things you need to do.

345
00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that when you get off of this you have some strategies.

346
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: To keep you sober right yep

347
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:14.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then finally, have you ever. Are you interested or have you have you tried doing like a or other community and a stuff.

348
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:21.750
Omar Alwan: Yeah, I have done it before in the past. Um, how I did it, especially when I was in rehab. I was doing that plenty

349
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:28.950
Omar Alwan: I haven't since, but I feel like if I were to seek that it would probably have to be online right now. Right.

350
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:36.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah there's zoom, zoom meetings on. So if you go to. I think it's an A or where you Google enabled.

351
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.620
Omar Alwan: Mind. Yeah.

352
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: The whole thing and it's like okay zoom meeting number 123

353
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.230
Omar Alwan: Awesome. Okay.

354
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: But add that

355
00:33:45.780 --> 00:34:00.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you know your primary thing because you want to get on, you know, stabilize on medication and we're already making you do a group for it. So you're going to do that Monday mornings and then, like I said, I think you should do individual visits as well. So you're going to have that

356
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, anything

357
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:08.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Else you can add you know if you have time on your hands and you're like, yeah, I want to get into this recovery stuff.

358
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.910
Omar Alwan: And you said the group meetings are Monday at

359
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.550
Omar Alwan: 9am 9am. Gotcha.

360
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I only gave you three. That doesn't make sense.

361
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I'll give you, I'll give you a week's worth so you'll be okay through

362
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:48.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you'll get 21 of them because you're taking three a day.

363
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:56.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: I accidentally sent one that just said three films. So that's not the right

364
00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: With the pharmacy might be like, Why do you have to. Don't worry about it. Just tell them. Yes, since three she's supposed to give me 21

365
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. It'll be okay.

366
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:14.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: If they need to verify. They can haul, they can call us the virtual clinic to verify. It's 21 it'll be fun.

367
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:15.420
Omar Alwan: Okay.

368
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, want to have films.

369
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: twice and then instead of three, it's going to be one.

370
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:33.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so any questions or anything else that we need to

371
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:42.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Discuss anything that you that we didn't talk about that you want to. Oh, any surgeries. Have you had any surgeries or anything.

372
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.000
Omar Alwan: No, I don't have any surgical history.

373
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:58.440
Omar Alwan: Or hospitalizations for that matter. Yeah. Um, no. I mean, I think we've discussed everything so far. I can't think of anything right now.

374
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:06.390
Omar Alwan: But I'm sure within the net. By the time we meet next time I'll have come up with a few things on talk about

375
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sure. Anytime.

376
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:22.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: And yeah, like I said, it's a good group. I think you'll like it. Um, and then what I'll do is I'll send you an email. Now, to, to remind you that you have Monday groups.

377
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:29.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: There's a blood test system loaded. There's a blood test, they are they're asking for it through quest labs.

378
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: In this climate if things are closed and you can't do

379
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: It right away. It's okay. Like don't

Omar Alwan: Know,

381
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:49.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: About that but normally it's nice to have that so that we know your liver function is okay your kidney functions okay buprenorphine is processed by your liver. So once a year, it's good to know. Like, okay, not having any problems.

382
00:36:50.760 --> 00:37:00.510
Omar Alwan: No, that's great. I actually really want to do that and what the plan is since quest is closed here until the 19th. That's when I plan to go back, I believe the orders were already sent so

446
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, it's a chemical you're inhaling right

Omar Alwan: So, yeah.

448
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.010

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:32.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, no. So okay, so I would say, yeah, if you want to work on that at some point. I think that's a good thing. And we could do lozenges, or, you know, gum.
