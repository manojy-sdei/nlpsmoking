00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:50.580
Richelle Direny: I'm in understanding and maintaining the mayor. So how, what are some of the objectives is that, um,

150
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.200
Richelle Direny: So one of the things you can do is to learn effective ways to communicate.

151
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.330
Richelle Direny: That's the key.

152
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.070
iPhone: Communication.

153
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.650
Richelle Direny: Communication. Communication could be the death of any relationship and

154
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.790
iPhone: So far I've learned that people say that she's always right. It's, it's really true. It's real.

155
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.290
Richelle Direny: Always is a big word.

156
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:37.860
Richelle Direny: Always is a big word. A lot of the times, women look through different a man looks through a different lens than a woman. So I wouldn't say always, because she's wrong sometimes. And you're right, times

157
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.990
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's, it's, you know, but communication. So learning

158
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.170
Richelle Direny: Learning learning effective ways

159
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.020
Richelle Direny: So I'm learning. I'm learning effective ways how to communicate through different topic. Um, it's

160
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:26.040
Richelle Direny: Once you learn that. And you don't have to necessarily wait until because communication is something that naturally, not just in a relationship.

161
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:38.580
Richelle Direny: Also know that it's not just like normal because on our jobs we could you know you're on a job and somebody say something to you and

162
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:52.170
Richelle Direny: You think, oh, he say that right or he didn't pose that right. And so now because of something that I said to you that have you looking at me sideways, even when I'm speaking to you about things that you need to know.

163
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.100
iPhone: Because you

164
00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:07.920
Richelle Direny: Don't on how I say said something to you. You didn't hear anything else after that. And so now here is this company because of this communication barrier now various a breakdown in communication and everything after that.

165
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.060
iPhone: Is completely

166
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.950
Richelle Direny: complete breakdown in

167
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:23.010
Richelle Direny: Communication simply because you said something and on I'm stuck on and all I heard. And so anything you said after that. I'm just hearing it through this lens or or through this. I'm

168
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:36.600
Richelle Direny: Little Horner, that what they call those things blow horn is like. Now you can through this blow horn Australia negativity and then I'm saying, hey, that. Well, that's what I heard you say so now the breakdown in communication. So,

169
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:44.430
Richelle Direny: Learning how to effective communication. It's knowing the art of

170
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.110
Richelle Direny: Just communication learning of just naturally through us how you communicate

171
00:19:53.190 --> 00:20:08.400
Richelle Direny: If you don't understand being saying and saying hey you know what we understand that. Could you explain that. Or this is what I know what you said and practicing those skills, you will learn that in your regular relationship because everything once you start working through and identifying

172
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.660
Richelle Direny: All of these skills, guess what.

173
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.340
Richelle Direny: You're going to

174
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:25.260
Richelle Direny: Then learn how to implement these healthier effective coping skills. Because when you think about coping skills you're not just thinking about, okay, what coping skill. Can we talked about today.

175
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:37.560
Richelle Direny: No coping skills is all wrapped up into our everyday lives coping skills is. So for instance, an example of what is wrapped up in our everyday life, like I was just on a

176
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:49.500
Richelle Direny: conference call with a few people and one person said something and not to say that I didn't agree with but I was kind of getting

177
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.450
iPhone: irritated with it. Yeah.

178
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:58.650
Richelle Direny: What, how I how I coped with the situation, how I dealt with the situation is that I speak.

179
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.460
Richelle Direny: And why do you think I stopped speaking in that moment.

180
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.460
iPhone: Let them get out what they wanted to say.

181
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.130
Richelle Direny: About what was it doing for me. The minute I said, Because I remember I said I got irritated with the person's

182
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.260
iPhone: Name. Calm down. Calm down.

183
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.120
Richelle Direny: It just gave me kind of calm down.

184
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:23.970
Richelle Direny: Reflect allowed me in that calm down and just to reflect because if I spoke during my irritation. What do you think would have happened.

185
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.570
iPhone: And you would have probably said something wrong.

186
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.160
Richelle Direny: Straight up.

187
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.270
Richelle Direny: I was feeling in that moment I was about to pop off but

188
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:42.630
Richelle Direny: I just said, You know what, let me calm down. Let me just go straight stayed silent.

189
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.980
Richelle Direny: Because now.

190
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.410
Richelle Direny: You know, what if I just

191
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:59.550
Richelle Direny: allow myself to not let my emotions come through this, then this conversation could have went a whole nother direction, simply because of how I was feeling from it. So that was a coping skill.

192
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.470
iPhone: I'm sorry, I think I muted you by accident. I'm sorry.

193
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.270
Richelle Direny: Oh no. What did you say where you

194
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.610
iPhone: Know, and my doubts, call it from my phone. I couldn't hang up.

195
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:22.950
iPhone: Last time

196
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:36.780
iPhone: He kept calling and I didn't want to keep rejecting an angle for your last my folder. So as much as my sister for another phone so I was going to text them like a I'm on point for Coke. I apologize.

197
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.300
Richelle Direny: So, so

198
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.420
Richelle Direny: So that's just what what it looks like when you learn

199
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:52.350
Richelle Direny: Effective ways of communicating is being able to identify those emotions that come up in that new during the that communication back and forth.

200
00:22:52.800 --> 00:23:01.650
Richelle Direny: It's like okay. How am I feeling angry. Am I feeling irritated, am I. How am I feeling is his phone and depending on how I'm feeling. I just now need to learn how to address that.

201
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.940
iPhone: Yes, it can give me one second. Rochelle apologize.

202
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.530
iPhone: Hello, I'm sorry.

203
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.060
iPhone: He

204
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.220
iPhone: English is a language so

205
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.870
iPhone: He just kept calling

206
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.430
iPhone: Him a text.

207
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.250
iPhone: Or phone call.

208
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.290
Richelle Direny: That's the language we speak

209
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.600
Richelle Direny: Somali Somali

210
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.150
Richelle Direny: Go. That's what it's called Somali

211
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.190
iPhone: Somali people

212
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.110
iPhone: Some people say Somalian, but just the language just Somali

213
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.130
iPhone: People, so my lease and the country Somalia.

214
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.650
Richelle Direny: Oh, OK. OK.

215
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:45.390
Richelle Direny: During each time that we meet, we'll just check in to see kind of, you know, ways

216
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:55.650
Richelle Direny: Even the honeymoon period. You could even talk about the talk about like in, you know, something that may be something that was said, whether it's through relationships for work or whatever.

217
00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:11.880
Richelle Direny: Being able to identify that and talk about, like, what is it that I did to implement, um, you know, a communication skill that diffused a possible argument or whatever it is, it is.

218
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:24.360
Richelle Direny: OK. Because, like, literally, like when I say, and that's why I use this example because I know in that moment I was getting so aggravated and the way that I was, I hope, with such passion at times.

219
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:44.580
Richelle Direny: Where I said, Okay, you know what, withdraw retreat. What do they treat retreat. That's what I answer show. Retreat. Retreat, because by continued, then the whole purpose of the communication back and forth would have been lost in translation, simply because my emotions took over at that moment.

220
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:55.320
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Oh. Um, what is something else that you said not so we just talked about communication. What is something else that you said that you would like to

221
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.440
iPhone: Okay, this communication.

222
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.200
iPhone: Oh,

223
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.740
Richelle Direny: Just when you think about some triggers that you have

224
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.220
iPhone: Oh, okay. And

225
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.170
iPhone: I'm

226
00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:20.220
iPhone: Just like like Mike and maybe like having trouble worked or something.

227
00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:21.900
iPhone: We're like,

228
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:35.250
iPhone: Okay. Like, for example, like there was a time when I was having trouble just finding finding work extremely job I will go from, where is the White House and claim your and it was just like

229
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.770
Richelle Direny: What do you think what what what was one of the difficulties you find outside of just finding more

230
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.830
iPhone: And I

231
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:52.170
iPhone: At the time of license was suspended. So I had a hard time getting to work show ups asking people for rides and stuff. And it was like a

232
00:26:52.740 --> 00:27:01.830
iPhone: Consistent person to give me right so sometimes I'm like, you know, like entitlement like are they not picked me a while to come before. Why is this why is that

233
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:10.530
iPhone: Blaming problems on other people. That's really my problem lies, get your license fix whatever they do not have to fill in title like that animal

234
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.240
Richelle Direny: For learning. It's called

235
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.170
Richelle Direny: Self care. It's called

236
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.270
Richelle Direny: I can't

237
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.370
iPhone: Like self reliance and something

238
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.080
Richelle Direny: Not suffer line.

239
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:28.650
Richelle Direny: So,

240
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:36.000
Richelle Direny: I can't think of a bit, but basically the skills that you need to be able to, like, not just work, but just

241
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.940
Richelle Direny: Being life skills.

242
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.930
Yeah.

243
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.730
Richelle Direny: Now for you said right now you're working in construction. Right.

244
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.210
iPhone: Yes. And as an electrician apprentice.

245
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.840
Richelle Direny: Do you are you certified in that

246
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.670
iPhone: And I'm I'm

247
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.420
iPhone: I'm gone, I'm taking classes online for like

248
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:27.570
iPhone: I'm taking class online to become eventually down the line three, four years from now, maybe Engineer But, and they're going to send me to school to be to be certified like it takes like three years to go to the electrician school and but that was like one one day four hours.

249
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:36.390
iPhone: One week one day we four hours a day for like say regularly like this like kids go to school from September to eight to me.

250
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:47.010
iPhone: Just like that every year. So one is four hours once a week and you only take you don't really take a lot of homework home, stuff like that. But you guys very soon and stuff but

251
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:58.410
iPhone: We like a lot of hands on stuff. So I'm working as a medical professional soul school shouldn't be that hard. I'm probably ahead of most of my classmates, because I'm already working as an electrician.

252
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.110
iPhone: So there's really two hours, three

253
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.210
iPhone: Hours, you got to put in long hours, and every hour, you work comes told is your school

254
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:08.880
Richelle Direny: Okay.

255
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.140
Richelle Direny: So,

256
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:23.820
iPhone: So that's why I kind of like finally like made a decision on on like in a career or something like that startups like jump.

257
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:41.250
iPhone: Bouncing around like trying to chase that like I was making more money at the warehouse. But then in the long run. I don't want to be willing, guys, a Hollywood been at the warehouse or 20 years and I don't want to do that because I don't want to be able to like have a career.

258
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:53.790
Richelle Direny: What so the goal would be, um, you know, learning to identify life skills. I'm there that are beneficial to you or that yeah that

259
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:02.130
Richelle Direny: And then how you're going to achieve that is that you will attend a weekly groups.

260
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:13.920
Richelle Direny: Ever scheduled individual session and during that time, that's where you'll be able to share, you know, something that you were able to identify or, you know, things that you need to work through just to learn different life skills.

261
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:31.530
Richelle Direny: And then one of the other things related to like relax because given that this is the year you know he's just three months you're newly married so everything it's somewhat new for you not to say that it's not new for you to

262
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:32.190
To

263
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:41.280
Richelle Direny: You know, start your journey or sobriety, but new in terms of your sobriety now is attached to a marriage so it

264
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:49.980
Richelle Direny: Was hatched to a new life. It's just everything for you. So that would in itself can be overwhelming especially what we're right now in life.

265
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:58.110
Richelle Direny: But seeing that's going on all the newness can get you know the the wonderful nice, it's great. It's my wife is all have come to a

266
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:08.610
Richelle Direny: Halt simply because of everything that's going on and that need and that desire to be that man and to support and to provide to all these things, it comes down to. You're not

267
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.630
Richelle Direny: Able to do that.

268
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:18.750
Richelle Direny: You know that can just meet get overwhelming. So being able to identify another goal, recognizing and defining triggers to relapse.

269
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.960
Richelle Direny: So for you, like, what are some triggers for your realize

270
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:25.920
iPhone: Just

271
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:39.690
iPhone: Like maybe like like right now. It's like, it's probably a little bit harder than it was in the past because even prior

272
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:49.890
iPhone: To this three months there was like gaps in between where I will go back for a little bit, then I'll go back clean again and go back a little bit longer periods probably go back

273
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:58.920
iPhone: longer periods ready. So I've been trying to stop for a while. This is just and one of my triggers is wrong people the wrong place.

274
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:07.020
iPhone: The wrong time. And sometimes that's, that's all, that's all it takes me sometimes like me to walk into the wrong place at the wrong time, and they just

275
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:17.220
iPhone: Have bad their work argue with her some like that and maybe arguments like like really bad arguments. And if I walk out of the house and

276
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:24.720
iPhone: In some of the world personal calls will come pick me up and I go with him on might end up making a mistake, but even write them in there.

277
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:38.370
iPhone: And Leah account myself like good remorseful even while I'm like drinking whatever I'm doing. I'm a damn. I know I shouldn't have done this, I can do that really didn't care as much now care Livermore, it's not even said even enjoyable.

278
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.250
iPhone: Most of time I was doing it because everybody else done

279
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.310
iPhone: Something I was like a fall on

280
00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:07.440
Richelle Direny: Okay, so one of the things that I want you to do is to be able to, I won't say because tomorrow. Listen, I think I don't forget you can group tomorrow, either six o'clock, you could

281
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.970
Richelle Direny: And. But even with the group.

348
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:40.200

357
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:40.830

358
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:54.150
Brittany Mount: Booster like a cell booster and I'm usually like you get full service. There are no problem. But I don't know, like, ever since this whole stay at home stuff and everybody's

359
00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:06.630
Brittany Mount: Using the internet and it's like it's just so drowned out like out where they live. And then I guess there's like a tower down and other stuff. So services been like crappy

360
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:09.060
Richelle Direny: Huh.

361
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:14.280

373
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:43.470
Brittany Mount: Six, seven o'clock in the evening and then she'll get it up like two, three o'clock, and it's just don't sleep at night at all.

374
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.760
Brittany Mount: And she's up and down, and she has to have somebody with her like

375
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.860
Brittany Mount: To help her up and down and all that. Like, you have to be right there with her and

376
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:59.220
Brittany Mount: It's been wearing me out. I'm not getting no sleep time I get to sleep. She's waking up looks like.

377
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:01.410

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:05.370
Oh,

380
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.440
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So then, and then there is there is also

381
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:12.780
Richelle Direny: Dementia.

382
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.990
Richelle Direny: Related to Parkinson's, I believe.

383
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.030
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I'm not sure.

384
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.640
Richelle Direny: There is that one dimension really like you get the dimension because of the Parkinson's, but I think it depends on

385
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:29.220
Brittany Mount: How bad or maybe what like how I don't know exactly. I know she's got them both, but

386
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.350
Brittany Mount: Not sure like this whole like circumstances to it or whatever but

387
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.540
Brittany Mount: Like me, she knows who everybody is as long as like you're around her enough

388
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:53.430
Brittany Mount: If, as long as you come around, you know, kind of frequently like she knows who everybody is and stuff like that. But she'll just be like, so you can be walking to get up together the kitchen or something. And this totally forget like

389
00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:10.560
Brittany Mount: How to walk or some lights like she forgets to like put her feet in front of the other and or so just completely forget what she's doing and turn around and go back to sit down and just, I mean my like most of its minor stuff right now, but oh

390
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:23.040
Brittany Mount: And then she's starting to like kind of see things like my dad has cows and stuff out to their house. Well, she they moved the cows to a different part of the

391
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:31.500
Brittany Mount: Field and stuff, the other day. Well, she got up in the middle of the night and was swearing that the neighbor kids and my daughter.

392
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:38.550
Brittany Mount: Was outside messing with the cows in the middle of the night and she got some Irish trying to steal them and

393
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:49.080
Brittany Mount: Just all kinds of stuff. And she's freaking out. And I'm like, Grandma. Nobody's over there, she said yeah haha look out on the road with their flashlights, like they're chasing the cows and

394
00:51:50.580 --> 00:52:00.120
Brittany Mount: Something I was just like, Okay, yeah, I see. I'm like, trying to do like just agree with her cuz she's not getting any given

395
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:10.470
Richelle Direny: Time. Sometimes. Sometimes I have to say, especially, and I learned this from a person for a welder for a person from working a mental health facility.

396
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:30.450
Richelle Direny: One, especially with a person who's delusional. Sometimes you have to enter the delusion with them, right. You have to just, you just agree because otherwise the fact that sometimes it can be at them round up, it could get really angry and frustrated because they're seeing what

397
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:38.250
Brittany Mount: To get it real frustrated with it like yelling at me like you don't see them, you better use, like, go ahead. What

398
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.720
Brittany Mount: walk outside in my

399
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:46.290
Richelle Direny: Walk over. Hey, sometimes you have to enter it with them and then even when you enter it with them and just say, yeah, it's out there and

400
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:53.970
Richelle Direny: You know what tell this. So, whatever. Okay, I'm going to tell them to go away and arm a time to do this and then that calms them down.

401
00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:57.450
Richelle Direny: Then you can lead them back to what it is that you want to do.

402
00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.100
Brittany Mount: Yeah. Yes.

403
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:06.960
Brittany Mount: She does like woke up in the middle of the night and went straight over to the window, you heard that. You heard him out there. Yeah. When this

404
00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.190
Richelle Direny: All comes with yelling

405
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.110
Brittany Mount: Now the kid, the kids.

406
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:17.460
Richelle Direny: So sometimes to get them to do what it is that you want them to do kind of have to

407
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:30.180
Richelle Direny: Just, just just appeal them and just say appease them and just say, Okay, I will talk to the kids. I'll tell them not to do something. And sometimes, like, even though you just want to go out like let's say if you go out there and you're going to smoke a cigarette or whatever. No.

408
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:34.020
Richelle Direny: Because on the Listen are you, I did not hear you speak to them.

409
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:44.250
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you're gonna be out there talking to thin air, but you know sometimes I mean you're not going to necessarily do you have to just kind of know when and how to do it to kind of

410
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:51.450
Richelle Direny: win them over, but eventually well with the dimension. They're never there they believe what they believe, but

411
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.060
Richelle Direny: Does she have she have any under other

412
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.070
Richelle Direny: Other underlining mental illness.

413
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.380
Richelle Direny: Outside of the fact that she's dimension.

414
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:02.430
Brittany Mount: I don't think so. Like, she's at

415
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.810
Brittany Mount: I'll go on at or just turned 86

416
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:23.400
Brittany Mount: But I don't think there's any other like mental issues or anything, but I don't know because you never really let you know. I mean, she's old fashioned she was going to go to the doctors and stuff until she got like older older and

417
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.700
Brittany Mount: My grandmother just passed away.

418
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:38.520
Brittany Mount: I'm gonna say five years ago and she like he had cancer for 25 years and she had to cut and he had was paralyzed one arm and

419
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:50.460
Brittany Mount: Some other stuff, so she had to like kind of wait on him hand and foot hit basically the last 30 years and that's all she ever knew was taking care of him, and when he died, it just

420
00:54:51.270 --> 00:55:01.350
Brittany Mount: Like she don't have nothing to do. Now, and it is through she's already getting them into, for he past like she would be cooking and just

421
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:11.850
Brittany Mount: Just different little things. But once he passed away, then it started really turn into the light gets worse. But I mean it's not real.

422
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:26.460

Brittany Mount: Like put me back on sometime medication. It's been so long since I was gone. I don't know if I'd have to see them first, or what. And then it's like not really happening again. So I was just kind of like to write it out until all this like

510
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:16.020
Brittany Mount: Little bit.

511
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:25.140
Brittany Mount: Um, I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do with it or how I'm going to do about getting. I mean, I know I'm happy with medicine.

512
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.400
Brittany Mount: Just to get my you know everything back together, which

513
01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:44.370
Richelle Direny: When you think when you think about your anxiety. What do you think is the trigger to your anxiety. Like what, like I've had people say their anxiety is related to maybe fear or anger or whatever it is.

514
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:51.720
Richelle Direny: You know, fear of our relapse, or whatever. What is you think is a trigger.

515
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:56.580
Brittany Mount: Like is this

516
01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.080
I'm

517
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:03.510
Not sure.

518
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:05.700
Brittany Mount: I've had

519
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:09.030
Brittany Mount: It on and off three years, but

520
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.960
Brittany Mount: I don't really know. Like what, when you

521
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.150
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, you had problem with like for years.

522
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:27.090
Richelle Direny: You said, um, would you say that your anxiety has triggered who wanting a intense desire or a desire, I shouldn't even say intense

523
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:31.290
Brittany Mount: Desire to us to help you to get has before like

524
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.970
Brittany Mount: It's like never before guys to have like problems with

525
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:45.180
Brittany Mount: Like my anxiety and like one like relapse and stuff like that. But I was on like Suboxone nothing like that. I'm

526
01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:49.920
Brittany Mount: Being on the Suboxone like I mean I haven't had

527
01:05:51.510 --> 01:06:03.570
Brittany Mount: Issues is my anxiety. I mean, they're probably a month or a, I don't know if it's were like, well, my pills makers and all that stuff. I don't know if that was all like my body count off for a minute.

528
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.940
Brittany Mount: Because once I got back on them and was still happening for a minute, but

529
01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:15.420
Brittany Mount: I don't know once like a lot back after like a couple weeks. But once I got back my system like no

530
01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.650
Brittany Mount: I don't know. Like, what if it was like, you know, with the VM all that was

531
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:29.070
Brittany Mount: Really when I'm honest. Awesome. Like, I don't really have a whole lot of

532
01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.400
Brittany Mount: anxiety issues that

533
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:34.290
Brittany Mount: I don't know.

534
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:42.570
Brittany Mount: Like my mom or whatever, like if I do, if something does happen like Linda. It was like

535
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:48.660
Brittany Mount: I don't really think I don't think about user, not just like I just wanna cry or

536
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:50.640
Brittany Mount: Or

537
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.700
Brittany Mount: Just can't just build it or something.

538
01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:03.570
Richelle Direny: So, so I think it's a good goal, I would think. Is that being able to

539
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:20.040
Richelle Direny: Identify triggers to your anxiety because I think one of the things that I can remember you being the anxiety that came about was when your pills I gotten stolen and not being able to get a real and just kind of everything that surrounded

540
01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:22.050
Richelle Direny: That were you had ended up I think

541
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:23.820
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

542
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:24.720
Yeah.

543
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:28.470
Brittany Mount: Yeah, that's one thing.

544
01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.350
Brittany Mount: But yeah

545
01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:37.350
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but just overall being able to understand to understand the triggers to it.

546
01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:45.330
Richelle Direny: Learning how to I think once you you are, you're able to identify the way you can work on

547
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:50.610
Richelle Direny: Coping or getting through are working through

548
01:07:51.960 --> 01:08:08.940
Richelle Direny: An anxiety provoking moment or situation it's being able to identify being able to understand, Okay, especially, even if, like, when we had crossed that that one day when the pills that gotten stolen and kind of the catalyst that happened right after

549
01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:14.430
Richelle Direny: It saying it's just saying to yourself, um,

550
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:22.500
Richelle Direny: For that to happen, you know, the you allowed your child. Your daughter's father comes to the House.

551
01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:31.590
Richelle Direny: When he came to the house. This is all that happened, then you started in that moment you were having relationship issues, then you have to go seek out because now you're thinking about

552
01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:46.050
Richelle Direny: You're going through the withdrawal or even not being able to get your medication. So that moment that alone everything related to that. And the idea of not being able to get it or being able to afford it or where to locate and everything that could have spawned out of fat.

553
01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.990
Richelle Direny: Could have blown away. Is it attack because

554
01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:55.620
Richelle Direny: Of the thought and this is what happens in that particular situation that day so much other things could have spun out of fat.

555
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.570
Richelle Direny: And just the anxiety.

556
01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:03.090
Richelle Direny: Because of how we think about it and all that we add and take away from the situation.

557
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:12.390
Richelle Direny: Brings on an anxiety attack because now you're getting nervous because now your mind is going into overdrive because it's creating all of these different scenarios. I like to

558
01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:16.380
Brittany Mount: Have thought about that for so long and

559
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:17.850
Yeah.

560
01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:20.730
Brittany Mount: The sun is like

561
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.060
Brittany Mount: Try to move, so I can see

562
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:28.500
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

563
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.510
Brittany Mount: Yeah, deal with that issue for

564
01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:43.650
Brittany Mount: Over a year and then all of a sudden it was like bam here yes what you get here with

565
01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:59.550
Richelle Direny: One of the things that we can do is we you know you being able to identify it and like for each week that you go to group. It's, um,

566
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.600
Richelle Direny: Identify trigger for that week.

567
01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:06.480
Richelle Direny: Okay.

568
01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:11.880
Richelle Direny: Identify a trigger for that week.

569
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:13.920
Richelle Direny: And sharing it.

570
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.170
Richelle Direny: In group. What were you able to do to

571
01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:24.600
Richelle Direny: How were you able to identify it and what were you able to do in the moment.

572
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:26.160
Brittany Mount: Okay.

573
01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:54.000
Richelle Direny: So you're going to do this, um,

574
01:10:55.530 --> 01:11:04.740
Richelle Direny: During either group or are so being able to identify the trigger for that week and sharing it in group I'm

575
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.530
Richelle Direny: Bi weekly

576
01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.000
Richelle Direny: Because you go to the group. He says bi weekly right

577
01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:14.370
Brittany Mount: Yeah yeah it's every two weeks now.

578
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:24.630
Richelle Direny: And then

579
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.980
Richelle Direny: So just what school was implemented.

580
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:31.890
Brittany Mount: What, what, what was the last time.

581
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:34.860
Richelle Direny: And what skill was implemented in that moment.

582
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:44.640
Brittany Mount: Okay, so just like right now I'm those three things for, like, so whenever I have to them.

583
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:47.160
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

584
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.530
Brittany Mount: So like when I get a green light have like different scenario, the time since I do

585
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:58.800
Richelle Direny: Decide what about the scenario and

586
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:06.030
Brittany Mount: Or I like I've. Okay. Whenever I get one of them in groups, like you said, every week.

587
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:12.120
Brittany Mount: Like pinpoint one them identify a

588
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:18.600
Brittany Mount: So when I go to somebody live every two weeks. What I share like to your experiences or

589
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:26.940
Richelle Direny: Whatever experience. I like, I know you go to the group string you go to join groups like you can just, you know, as you're checking in.

590
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:35.820
Richelle Direny: Things that you can share, like, you know, something that you're working on, like, you know, you know, whatever. However groups like in for the group that I run

591
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:39.150
Richelle Direny: I always talk about like with the check in. Where are you grateful for.

592
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:48.240
Richelle Direny: Something, it could be, Hey, you know what, I'm grateful that I was able today to identify a moment I an anxiety provoking moment for me.

593
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:57.300
Richelle Direny: Was x and this is what I was able to do to get through, because not what you're speaking to is your ability to be resilient.

594
01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:11.010
Richelle Direny: That's what you're speaking to you're speaking to your individual ability to become resilient and and in speaking to that you're sharing with others. Hey, you know, you can do this to this is how I was able to do with this.

595
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:22.230
Richelle Direny: I was able to separate myself from the emotion of it all and I was able to consciously cognitively, think about, hey, let me take a step back.

596
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:35.760
Richelle Direny: This situation is making me really anxious and I need to be able to separate myself from this, so I don't get so anxious to the point where I'm unable to control my anxiety that could lead to a panic attack.

597
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:37.770
Richelle Direny: So that's literally what you're speaking

598
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.180
Richelle Direny: To you understand

599
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:41.940
Richelle Direny: So yeah, because in everything.

600
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:51.150
Richelle Direny: That you do. It's an emotion. We all have all kinds of emotions. Yeah, they're not bad. They are emotions that we learn from each and

601
01:13:51.510 --> 01:14:05.640
Richelle Direny: I the emotion of fear, I can learn from it, anger, I can learn from it, anxiety, I can learn from it. Whatever happiness I can learn from it, sadness, I can learn from it. Hell, depression is something that I can learn from. Now you wouldn't say that necessarily is an emotion.

602
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:09.000
Richelle Direny: All of us get diverse like

603
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.630
Richelle Direny: No one.

604
01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:15.330
Richelle Direny: Right. The only person who doesn't get the press is made me a newborn because they don't understand it. You see, I'm saying

605
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:17.310
Richelle Direny: Everybody gets right Chris

606
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:33.480
Richelle Direny: Um, when it becomes depression becomes only an issue when it starts to infiltrate your daily life where it upsets you're on able to function in life. It has consumed you so much that you're you're unable to do any thing else

607
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:41.850
Richelle Direny: That's when it becomes like an issue. So all of these emotions. We go through, we feel we experience the quick question is

608
01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:46.470
Richelle Direny: How can I learn to

609
01:14:48.630 --> 01:15:03.090
Richelle Direny: Be in control while I'm experienced this emotion not allowing this emotion to control me so like I was sharing with someone else, an emotion that I felt today was I was getting annoying. I was talking to. I was on a conference.

610
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:08.280
Richelle Direny: Of their colleagues and I was getting annoyed by something that someone said,

611
01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:18.510
Richelle Direny: And because I was getting annoyed. What do we do when we get annoyed, sometimes when we're speaking in that moaning dependent on the type of person that you are your voice accelerates

612
01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:29.670
Richelle Direny: And when your voice accelerates you speak with a lot of passion. And so with that passion, it can be viewed as very rude. It can be viewed as arrogant. It's, however, that person their perspective.

613
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:44.400
Richelle Direny: Of how you sound when you're speaking in that passion. Well, look, I was getting really annoying, but when in my annoyance in in whatever I was saying the emotion that I was feeling was kind of coming. It was filling up

614
01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.340
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And in that I was wanting to pop off.

615
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:56.730
Richelle Direny: But then I had to catch myself and I had to say retreat for show retreat. And so in that though I was feeling the emotion.

616
01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:13.560
Richelle Direny: Cognitively I was able to identify how I'm feeling in this moment. And so I was quickly able to regain control of myself to be in full control of the emotion retreat and how I handled it was I got real quiet.

617
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:21.750
Richelle Direny: So in that moment for you, like in everything that I just said, what do you think me being quiet did for me scary.

618
01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.750
Brittany Mount: Time to kind of think to yourself, and

619
01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:36.210
Brittany Mount: Refrain like no hold in just a minute. And like kind of thinking of ignorant mind until you could come up like speak without worrying some

620
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:37.560
Knowledge Schrader

621
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.150
Brittany Mount: However,

622
01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:40.230
Richelle Direny: Straight up.

623
01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:40.680
Richelle Direny: He has

624
01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.820
Brittany Mount: Some time on now.

625
01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:49.080
Richelle Direny: That's it. That's the whole time. It doesn't show it is it saying that I'm week. Is it seemed that I'm defeated.

626
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:54.510
Richelle Direny: Is it saying that I have no self control it saying the complete opposite.

627
01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.280
Richelle Direny: It saying I have a

628
01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.320
Richelle Direny: Lot of control.

629
01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:00.600
Richelle Direny: That's a lot of control is saying that I didn't

630
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.970
Richelle Direny: Have enough control in that particular situation.

631
01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:15.450
Richelle Direny: That I took I stepped back to be able to calm down to hear everything. Everyone says without making a comment because if I made a comment will be few the wrong way. And so now the communication line.

632
01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:23.400
Richelle Direny: Has just got so distorted so convoluted and now you go in a direction that the conversation was never intended to go

633
01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:29.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's literally what you're what you're doing when you're saying, Let me find a way to

634
01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:42.990
Richelle Direny: Makes me anxious what triggers a particular emotion or what emotion is triggering anxiety for me if that's one of the biggest things that I struggle with where I lose self control.

635
01:17:44.190 --> 01:17:58.290
Richelle Direny: And once you're able to identify that. So for me I identify that the conversation was annoying me and in annoying me it was getting me angry. And so I had to retreat, so that I can start thinking clearly

636
01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:08.880
Richelle Direny: And in the end, so now I think after I got off the control the call someone reached out to me and they're like, Hey, were you still on the phone. Yeah, I was on the phone. I heard a whole conversation.

637
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:21.330
Richelle Direny: But it didn't marry me to even have a response to it a response because if I did, I knew what I can do. So it's all about knowing you. And that's the thing.

638
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.480
Richelle Direny: To you really truly know yourself.

639
01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.520
Brittany Mount: That's probably not as much as I need

640
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:43.710
Richelle Direny: I mean, and that's it's something it's something for you to really truly think about, do you really know yourself. Because if you know you're I know who I am and how I know who I am, oftentimes if

641
01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:51.720
Richelle Direny: Everyone who comes in your life is telling you the same things repeatedly because sometimes we're blinded to how we respond in a situation

642
01:18:52.050 --> 01:19:00.870
Richelle Direny: Or how we get we're angry and we're frustrated. We're very blinded by that because hey, I put myself in a box. I don't have a mirror to see my reflection.

643
01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:11.100
Richelle Direny: And I don't know how I sound because there's not a recording this playing back how I'm responding to something. There's not a video looking at me to replay how I'm responding to something

644
01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:17.610
Richelle Direny: Because I'm all stuck in myself and being stuck in myself. I can't see my reflection. So then therefore

645
01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:35.220
Richelle Direny: I really truly don't know how I respond in the situation. I think I know. So over the years. If somebody everybody's coming in my life and telling me the same thing. Hey, let me start. Let me think. Am I really truly like this and if I am. Let me find a different way of how to address it.

646
01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:38.700
Richelle Direny: Like one of the things that you said when you like

647
01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:40.410
Richelle Direny: During your, your time of

648
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:59.160
Richelle Direny: In active addiction was a certain behavior that you displayed and how you responded and just kind of hold you with who became and now that you're on this road of recovery you. I remember in one of the sessions you share that your father said he recognized the change

649
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:00.090
Yeah.

650
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:08.940
Richelle Direny: But. And in that moment you recognize okay you recognize the change. What is it about me that really truly did change.

651
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:28.860
Richelle Direny: And it's really identifying what is in me that change. What about me that's changed. Is it the way I walk is the way I look is the way I talk is the way I respond, what is it about me is it that my mother gets under my ever loving skin and I found a different way to respond to it.

652
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.330
Yeah.

653
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:40.170
Brittany Mount: But anymore. I'm just like, ignore and walk away like this smile and

654
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:50.640
Richelle Direny: See you roll your eyes and smiling like or whatever you smelled a walk away. They think, Oh, she does the ocean. Oh no. Oh no, I know why I'm walking away.

655
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.890
Brittany Mount: Because you get an undefined Evelyn. Yeah.

656
01:20:53.580 --> 01:21:08.940
Richelle Direny: I respond to you. I miss something and going to re correct. So let me eat normally ask away because you have to decipher. Is it you speaking or is it that alcohol in your system. This speaking because I really need to know who I'm speaking to

657
01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:13.380
Brittany Mount: Yeah 9% of time. It's the alcohol.

658
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.160
Richelle Direny: In the moment when you're frustrated, you're going

659
01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:25.740
Richelle Direny: To be thinking about, like, yeah, who am I talking to him. I talked to my mama or am I talking to her.

660
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.960
Richelle Direny: Evil Twin Sister

661
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:30.150
Richelle Direny: Yes.

662
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.110
Richelle Direny: You have to think about that, you know,

663
01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:43.110
Richelle Direny: So that, that's just kind of how you find a way. So those are some of the things I'm. What are some I'm

664
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:49.830
Richelle Direny: Self care like your own self care. Like, what is it that you do.

665
01:21:55.020 --> 01:22:00.360
Brittany Mount: I journal a lot. And then like my meetings, I'm

666
01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:06.690
Brittany Mount: Just take some time. Just take a walk is to be myself. I think thing.

667
01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.580
Brittany Mount: Um,

668
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:12.690
Brittany Mount: Ah,

669
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:38.310
Brittany Mount: Just like I like fix fix it builds a relationship with my daughter, more like that helps me a lot is, I was um I've not been the best father before you know all that so helpful like to just build the relationship with her learning how to really parent and then

670
01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:41.520
Brittany Mount: Hey, I'm

671
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:51.150
Brittany Mount: Just i mean i just i take care of myself better now than I did an addiction, like I didn't care. I was getting high.

672
01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:58.170
Brittany Mount: I didn't brush my hair, you're not like I just some days I would just be ratchet.

673
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:09.630
Brittany Mount: That way I make sure you know i mean bay that everything's taken care a lot i g i take care of myself better

674
01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:16.020
Brittany Mount: I'm not ingesting and putting all the bad crap my body oven that are

675
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:20.970
Brittany Mount: Actually trying to lose some weight right now so

676
01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:23.280
Brittany Mount: Eat Healthier

677
01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:34.080
Richelle Direny: I know you said one of the things that you do is you journal. Um, what is how often do you journal

678
01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:45.360
Brittany Mount: I try to at least every like daily, but most of time. It's, it's, like, my god wants stuff because that's kind of

679
01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:51.240
Brittany Mount: It's been like every other day every couple days, something like that. That led to a few times a week.

680
01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:56.010
Brittany Mount: But I wasn't doing it like every day there for a while.

681
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:10.200
Richelle Direny: So I'm and I'm trying to incorporate. One of the things that you're healthy coping skills that you use to identify with your self care routine. And the reason why I want to

682
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:18.060
Richelle Direny: Put it like that, is that at least journal, at least once per week year to even though you said that you were doing it weekly even though you like it.

683
01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:37.500
Richelle Direny: But even if you intentionally say at least once a week, you're going to journal your journey, whether it for that week or for that day, what is something that you did right for yourself whether it's you know you exercise for that day, or that week or you chose you chose a healthier option.

684
01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:46.410
Richelle Direny: For whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner, whatever it is, and just talk about like how did you feel being able to accomplish that one goal.

685
01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:48.720
Brittany Mount: OK.

686
01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.910
Richelle Direny: OK. And it when we, when we meet, because I know we meet

687
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.250
Richelle Direny: Once a month now.

688
01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:57.870
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but

689
01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:17.160
Richelle Direny: When, when we meet you can talk about you know even share like maybe an entry in your journal as it's related to your own self care because you're absolutely right when you when you're an activity addiction, you're worried about whether you how you look for makeup do this, am I looking

690
01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:17.970
Richelle Direny: Right in tight and

691
01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:19.740
Richelle Direny: Am I looking cute.

692
01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:21.960
Richelle Direny: You know, is everything and all in the

693
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.250
Richelle Direny: You're not thinking about that thinking about chasing that next higher, have you

694
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:32.280
Richelle Direny: So it will to put that in and

695
01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:51.750
Richelle Direny: Saying, because again, everything is you're telling yourself how good you feel you're saying, so I felt so good today to be able to do my hair or to do makeup or to put on something and feel good in the skin that I'm in and being able to recognize it.

696
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:55.980
Richelle Direny: Because you're, you're, you're not. It's not that you're doing it, you're

697
01:25:56.010 --> 01:26:10.950
Richelle Direny: Able to recognize it and you're in a state you're in that place of sobriety or in that state of mind that I did something for myself and unlike the feeling that I have and I'm able to recognize it. Yeah.

698
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:23.610
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I was already kind of kind of doing something like that. Anyways, what about I drew like just talking about like day or, you know, anything that happened or

699
01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:35.460
Brittany Mount: Just like talking about different stuff that I've been trying to like eating wise stuff like I've, I've heard about that a couple times so

700
01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:37.470
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

701
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:42.390
Brittany Mount: Oh. Sorry. I keep yawning I sewed higher

702
01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:44.730
Know that's

703
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:49.530
Brittany Mount: Got an hour how

704
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:54.120
Richelle Direny: Did you say that you did, um,

705
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:58.500
Richelle Direny: You said that you wanted to

706
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:02.700
Richelle Direny: Like change your eating here because you're trying to lose weight.

707
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:06.540
Brittany Mount: Yeah, a little bit late.

708
01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:12.510
Brittany Mount: I mean, I'm happy my weight kinda is just where where all the wasteland.

709
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:21.210
Brittany Mount: Do you see here and get my body together or I mean I need to exercise a little bit

710
01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:36.120
Brittany Mount: Something to boost my energy because I just been like just sluggish. You know, I mean Fillon I just try and stuff kind of boost my energy, a little bit shine was fulfilled betters, not so great time.

711
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:42.750
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I would say, do you think it would be too much if you say

712
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.780
Richelle Direny: One healthy meal per day.

713
01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.110
Richelle Direny: Or per week.

714
01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.640
Richelle Direny: What we are realistic for

715
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:55.560
Brittany Mount: That I know we've been eating like every day.

716
01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:12.180
Brittany Mount: Like I've cut down I'm eating like I felt like my starches and like that a child it as many like I have one cheat day weren't there sometimes to cheat days, but like I've been a lot more salads and

717
01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:18.780
Brittany Mount: fruits and stuff like that like shiny and more natural sugar than

718
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:23.460
Brittany Mount: Like stuff like artificial sugar or stuff you put sugar in

719
01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.210
Brittany Mount: I mean a lot of fruit salad.

720
01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:46.110
Richelle Direny: So then what about I'm a realistic because if this is know if you're a haven't been consistent, would it be safe to say to implement one exercise routine per, at least for a week or implement maybe a 30 minute exercise routine for the week.

721
01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.590
Brittany Mount: Yeah, we're gonna say, I need to start something i just i hate

722
01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.120
Richelle Direny: When you, when you think

723
01:28:54.330 --> 01:29:03.690
Richelle Direny: But think about exercise like what I've done in the last few days, I literally just walk someone like you saw me back because I'm thinking, oh, it's, it's so sunny honor, because I'll take a walk.

724
01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:07.560
Richelle Direny: Oh, crap. It's raining. So every weekend. Yeah, but literally as wanting

725
01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:26.100
Brittany Mount: A WALK, I walk all the time and stuff but like maybe like been talking about like trying to, like, just do some workout video or something, at least a couple times a week, something like that. And I just kidding.

726
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:34.680
Richelle Direny: But then, so that's why I said if you did it. Um, if you did it like at least will implement one exercise routine per week.

727
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:44.220
Richelle Direny: At least you know I just need to get one for the week. And don't think about. So like, even though you want the time you're not thinking about it as exercise, but it is a form of exercise.

728
01:29:44.640 --> 01:30:00.210
Richelle Direny: So if you think right yeah in my walk today I'm going to be intentional about, you know, I'm going to grab a bottle of water, even if I just walk around the block or whatever it is that will be or I'm gonna tie myself. At least I know that I've did at least one for the week or

729
01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.840
Richelle Direny: If you are watching like a video because since everything is on zoom

730
01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.310
Richelle Direny: Or it's on.

731
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.450
You know through

732
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:22.590
Richelle Direny: Everything. So you can at least turn on the TV and you do it if you're a game where she has any type of video games. I know that, especially ones to the V or the patient or something like that. The ones that are interactive

733
01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:23.580
Brittany Mount: That

734
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.660
Richelle Direny: Let me tell you something. Yeah.

735
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:36.090
Richelle Direny: Because if you play one good game any one of those interactive things. I guarantee you the next day is going to tell you you worked me yesterday. And that's why you feel in this pain.

736
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:41.280
Brittany Mount: You yeah when you've been those things I used to have. Where did

737

Brittany Mount: Years ago and and whatever happened to it. Yeah, yeah, those things.

739
01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:52.560
Brittany Mount: If you're not used to working out and you jump on this, again, both of us.

740
01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.720
Brittany Mount: Yeah, you're gonna pay for

741
01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:00.570
Richelle Direny: The next day, your body is gonna say, Oh, you think he was gonna get away with it.

742
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.760
Brittany Mount: You remember what you did to me yesterday. Yeah.

743
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:09.690
Richelle Direny: So um yeah I know it too well because I was just like, whoa.

744
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.190

773
01:34:03.630 --> 01:34:07.020

776
01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:38.460
Brittany Mount: Just there things that kind of sometimes and with my mother, she would definitely

777
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:48.360
Richelle Direny: Like to go ahead

Brittany Mount: I don't like running into those old people, or I'm

784
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:36.750

Richelle Direny: How does she

815
01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:22.470
Get

816
01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:31.050
Brittany Mount: 11 well and July, so I don't want to get nothing like that. I was having like

817
01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:40.680
Richelle Direny: Oh no. Yeah, I've heard of. I remember getting my news and and I heard of and texting or somebody told me that someone had their seven you're getting acrylics off like

818
01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.560
Richelle Direny: She wants them, but it's not happening.

819
01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:56.160
Brittany Mount: For I'm not paying $50 for an 11 year old to get acrylic she's gonna break off. Boy, am I get home.

820
01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:58.890
Richelle Direny: Oh, well, my daughter wants to get him but

821
01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:05.970
Richelle Direny: I told her, there will be a time when you will be able to get them, but understand even though you see me with them. Sometimes

822
01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:09.930
Richelle Direny: It the worst kind of pain is if you hit that sucker.

823
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:13.170
Richelle Direny: And it breaks down the center

824
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.960
Brittany Mount: Of her on yeah you'll never be that pain.

825
01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.500
Okay, so

826
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.320
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it hurts like a mother.

827
01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:38.460
Richelle Direny: So all right, then. So, um, all right, then. So let's go ahead. I'm like, I said. So just kind of recap on some of your, your goal is just, you know, being able to identify your triggers.

828
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:46.770
Richelle Direny: I'm being able to share them in group and just just being more aware of yourself just being more aware of yourself.

829
01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:58.260
Richelle Direny: Some of the things I have to find a way. But even when I do groups or our individual session is kind of having the background like a quote of the day that will be able to apply to you.

830
01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.740
Richelle Direny: Because some of them that I've seen that are really good. I'm

831
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:08.340
Richelle Direny: To try to get them to share them with you through text messaging, or what have you. But like, even in groups or in session.

832
01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:16.920
Richelle Direny: Is to be able to kind of have, like, this is the quote of the day or something that will be applied to you that I think would be very encouraging. Because sometimes

833
01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:25.440
Richelle Direny: And things are very encouraging. Like, one of the things that I found. Like I shared it on told my groups was you don't understand the storms that we go through in life.

834
01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:34.980
Richelle Direny: We've gone through many things in life, it's, I don't know if you've ever heard that songs are really old song which talks about, I could see clearly. Now the rain is gone.

835
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:35.940
Brittany Mount: I could see

836
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:41.010
Richelle Direny: Um, yeah. What is it, the sun. What is it I can see clearly. Now the rain and

837
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:43.470
Richelle Direny: I forgot the other part of it.

838
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.540
Brittany Mount: I went to the all the obstacles in my way I

839
01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:50.310
Richelle Direny: Can now. Yes, I can see. Yeah, I could see all the obstacles in my way. And you think about it.

840
01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:59.520
Richelle Direny: You're um and I think for a while. I'm going to kind of put that in the background and kind of really talk about that, like in group because when you really think about that line.

841
01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:11.490
Richelle Direny: Your rain your store that you were in. Think about your active addiction. That was a storm that was like that was like a raging storm.

842
01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:28.230
Richelle Direny: And everything that was associated to every trigger you had every high you chase like everything that was going on in your life. Everything that whether you use it was be due to an accident. It was due to a bad memory from your past, it was due to family history.

843
01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:45.840
Richelle Direny: Of that storm. Now you're on this road to recovery. It's saying that your rain is gone now. You're at that place where you're slowly getting you've detox you're bringing it out of your system. I can now see the obstacles that are in my way.

844
01:41:46.170 --> 01:41:56.790
Richelle Direny: I can see everything. And so for you and I would think. But you tell me when you think about like seeing this person each day on the corner.

845
01:41:57.330 --> 01:42:02.730
Richelle Direny: And knowing what she's what like what is that for you. Is that like an obstacle that you can now see clearly.

846
01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:03.840
That you're learning. Yeah.

847
01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.970
Brittany Mount: Yeah, yeah, I see, yeah.

848
01:42:11.190 --> 01:42:15.540
Brittany Mount: I try. I don't want to be rude and like not not offer, but

849
01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:32.940
Brittany Mount: I just don't understand what else I'm say I'm like you, I don't like I just don't talk. I don't often everybody. I'm like, okay, like that. And she still begging, please let me say, or can you say I saw broke

850
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:37.980
Brittany Mount: My boyfriend will throw a fit if I bring anybody there.

851
01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:42.360
Brittany Mount: I can't have that they're not in my house. I know.

852
01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.780
Brittany Mount: I guided else I can say like

853
01:42:48.210 --> 01:43:01.500
Richelle Direny: In the question I asked you, knowing yourself if she was in if she came to, let's just say for for half a second. Think about it. She came into your house, your boyfriend your daughter everyone seeing she's in active addiction.

854
01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.680
Richelle Direny: knowing yourself. What would you

855
01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:08.040
Brittany Mount: Would that be a trigger really on things like

856
01:43:10.170 --> 01:43:10.800
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

857
01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:16.380
Brittany Mount: I don't, I don't know what I mean. Yeah, probably in a way

858
01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:22.410
Brittany Mount: It would. It would, I'd say, you know what, it's going to end up triggering me but

859
01:43:24.090 --> 01:43:30.660
Brittany Mount: Just seeing like her like that like standing at the gas whatever I hear it's like, wow, like

860
01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:51.000
Brittany Mount: Man, I used to be like that or whatever, like in everybody knows that she's high because she she she never brought in to talk with you, but maybe tomorrow, same time, you know, stuff like that. It's just like I can see what doing. Now, which one are all good. I didn't care like

861
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:59.520
Brittany Mount: Okay, come on out school on house, but now I brought that in my house like everybody say hi getting

862
01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:09.690
Brittany Mount: Like just being so shaky. Is it what I haven't let her come stay here. Like that's going to cause all kinds of issues.

863
01:44:13.050 --> 01:44:26.220
Richelle Direny: And so that that goes back to knowing yourself knowing, you know, knowing yourself, but at the same time separating what you've known of yourself and say, I can see clearly. Now the rain is gone.

864
01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.510
Richelle Direny: I can see

865
01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:36.720
Richelle Direny: Yeah, when I was in active addiction. Did I really look like that was I really looking like that and if my daughter so used to see me like that.

866
01:44:38.190 --> 01:44:39.210
