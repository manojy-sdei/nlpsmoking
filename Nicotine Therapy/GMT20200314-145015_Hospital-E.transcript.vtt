00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.540
Dawn Abriel: Okay, great.

8
00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.420
Dawn Abriel: So I was just doing your tart chart. I don't think I've ever met anyone who had so many prescribers

9
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.300
Dawn Abriel: On high now 29 you have 29 prescribers

10
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.720
Dawn Abriel: That's I think it's a record.

11
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.750
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my gosh, that's not good.

12
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.180
Dawn Abriel: Most people have to

13
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.810
Dawn Abriel: So,

14
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.900
Dawn Abriel: Let's see. I can do that later.

15
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.080
Dawn Abriel: Oh, I see what happened. Let me just

16
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.140
Dawn Abriel: I'm just trying to

17
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.640
Dawn Abriel: Okay, July 4 of july 4. That's what I did wrong. I'll be right back.

18
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.810
Dawn Abriel: Forth.

19
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.450
Dawn Abriel: Now let's see if it pulls it up.

20
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.460
Dawn Abriel: I will get to your chart.

21
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.140
Dawn Abriel: I didn't get a chance to look over the surveys that you did, but I'll do those at the end.

22
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.850
Dawn Abriel: Okay, is have you been in programs before

23
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.100
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I have.

24
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.430
Dawn Abriel: What number program is this for you.

25
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Too.

26
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.740
Dawn Abriel: So this is your third or

27
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.940
One.

28
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.320
Okay.

29
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.190
Dawn Abriel: And where are you living

30
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.780
Lyndsey Lorett: I live in Gallup New Mexico. Okay.

31
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.040
So,

32
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.110
Dawn Abriel: That's

33
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.890
Dawn Abriel: 210 miles away.

34
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.760
Dawn Abriel: This is his patients.

35
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:12.840
Dawn Abriel: And what, what can you tell me about what worked for the other programs. How did you like being in them.

36
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.430
Lyndsey Lorett: I think when I have structure and consistency. It helps a lot.

37
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.690
Dawn Abriel: To get a lot of that when you were a kid.

38
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, no, not so much.

39
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.220
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

40
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.500
Dawn Abriel: That's, that's usually the case.

41
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:44.160
Dawn Abriel: When was the last time you had an opioid I see that you're on some buprenorphine already. So did you have a sub this morning.

42
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.740
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I did. And

43
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.850
Dawn Abriel: How much do you take

44
00:07:48.510 --> 00:08:10.290
Lyndsey Lorett: I take three pills three eight milligram pills a day. Um, I would definitely love to go down, or even get off of it. Um, I've had a really rough last year. This last year medically um has been extremely difficult. Yeah.

45
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:26.430
Dawn Abriel: I believe it. People don't that it's a funny thing about buprenorphine. It really does save lives. I mean, you're not out hustling, you're not outscoring you're not out at risk for having fun and they'll drop down a pill. Right.

46
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.030
Dawn Abriel: And dying.

47
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:34.740
Dawn Abriel: Right but 24 milligrams of buprenorphine is a huge amount of medicine.

48
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.040
Lyndsey Lorett: I know that's what they say. Yeah.

49
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.050
Dawn Abriel: So here, let's think of it this way. One milligram of buprenorphine.

50
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.800
Dawn Abriel: Is equal to 20 to 40 milligrams of morphine.

51
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.530
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my gosh, yeah.

52
00:08:52.650 --> 00:09:05.490
Dawn Abriel: So if you came in with a dislocated shoulder and I wanted to give you some pain. I'm an emergency doctor by training. So if I wanted to help you with a pain in your shoulder. I'd give you two milligrams of morphine.

53
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:14.160
Dawn Abriel: You can even break up a pill to get it that small of the buprenorphine. But because over the years, you develop tolerance.

54
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.770
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Have a lot of receptors.

55
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:24.270
Dawn Abriel: That when you don't have that much medicine, the receptors are naked and they're screaming for their medicine and

56
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.810
Dawn Abriel: Now the another good thing about buprenorphine is you don't develop tolerance to it.

57
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:37.530
Dawn Abriel: Okay, but it has a lot of side effects, it decreases your immune system.

58
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:46.770
Lyndsey Lorett: I, I am struggling so much with my immune system right now because of my open wound and all of the surgeries.

59
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.980
Lyndsey Lorett: I've been on I've bought Murcia six different times over the last year.

60
00:09:53.550 --> 00:10:08.940
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, so many antibiotics over and over and over. And it wasn't until last week that they finally said you don't have mercy in your wound growing. So now I can finally move forward on fixing the wound.

61
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:10.950
Dawn Abriel: Wow.

62
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:26.910
Dawn Abriel: Sounds like you've been through a lot. So I'm yes I'm not only do I encourage it. I, I really think it's irresponsible for a doctor to not help people get

63
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.720
Dawn Abriel: To taper down even that will

64
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:42.360
Dawn Abriel: Not tapering off they've, they've got a taper down. So let's make sure you end up in one of my groups because I'm more aggressive about that than other people are

65
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.570
Lyndsey Lorett: I night really truly want it.

66
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.860
So bad.

67
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.990
Dawn Abriel: Are you working

68
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:55.410
Lyndsey Lorett: I can't because I have my intestines outside my body. I can't work.

69
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.570
Dawn Abriel: Gotcha. So, and are you a morning person, by any chance,

70
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.420
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I am. I have a 14 month old.

71
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.580
Dawn Abriel: Ah, OK.

72
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.000
Dawn Abriel: Would you be able to do Tuesday morning at seven o'clock for a group

73
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.090
Dawn Abriel: Absolutely. Okay.

74
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.550
Dawn Abriel: I think you'll like the group.

75
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.130
Dawn Abriel: The therapist.

76
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.210
Dawn Abriel: Is happens to be my daughter.

77
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.560
Dawn Abriel: She

78
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:39.240
Dawn Abriel: She lives in Florida. I live in Santa Fe. So we run three groups. A week together where she's the therapist and

79
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.200
Dawn Abriel: So means I get to interact with her some to

80
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.570
Lyndsey Lorett: It is a very good therapist.

81
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Is she

82
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.710
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

83
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.270
Dawn Abriel: That's good. Yeah.

84
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.420
Dawn Abriel: And and you know I am biased, but

85
00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:00.720
Dawn Abriel: I do work with other therapists, too. So I do get to see how skilled and she's been involved with

86
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.730
Dawn Abriel: Addiction for 16 years now. So she's got a lot of experience.

87
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.170
Wow.

88
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.130
Dawn Abriel: So you were never an IV drug user

89
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.480
Lyndsey Lorett: No, never.

90
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.110
Dawn Abriel: Any overdoses.

91
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.040
No.

92
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.570
Dawn Abriel: I'll get my cursor to go where it belongs.

93
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.830
Dawn Abriel: And no medical complications from the opioid use

94
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.270
Dawn Abriel: No. Okay. And no legal issues.

95
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.950
Lyndsey Lorett: No legal issues.

96
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.060
Dawn Abriel: All right.

97
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.900
Dawn Abriel: And was your life kind of centered around the opioids for a while.

98
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.570
Dawn Abriel: You get them how to, yes.

99
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.740
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. As a result of a bunch of surgeries.

100
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.390
Dawn Abriel: And no doctor showed you how to taper off the opioids.

101
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.420
Lyndsey Lorett: No. No one ever even tried, they just kept throwing more pills at me. Yeah.

102
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.100
Dawn Abriel: That's where I think

103
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.390
Dawn Abriel: I we really failed the public

104
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.640
Dawn Abriel: The medical profession failed you.

105
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.030
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

106
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:42.240
Dawn Abriel: How old were you when you did you ever start marijuana or cocaine at a younger

107
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Age. No, no, I didn't even I don't even drink alcohol.

108
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:56.430
Dawn Abriel: Well that's at least you've not your, your system isn't compromised because of that. Yeah.

109
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.860
Dawn Abriel: Has the opiate use resulted in loss of relationships or work.

110
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.690
Lyndsey Lorett: No.

111
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.370
Dawn Abriel: Patient can't

112
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.520
Dawn Abriel: Surgical

113
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.500
Dawn Abriel: All right.

114
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.970
Dawn Abriel: And are sleeping anxiety issues for you.

115
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:39.360
Lyndsey Lorett: I do it. Yes, I found my husband last last year. This week he passed away. Um, and I've struggled so much this last year to actually go to sleep without replaying it in my head.

116
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:43.980
Yep. Yeah.

117
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.980
Dawn Abriel: I think we have four people in my groups who've had that happen.

118
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.140
Dawn Abriel: Really. Yep.

119
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:06.630
Dawn Abriel: And and it they, you know, they say the same thing, it, it, they play it in their head and that's you really want to talk to go into your about that because that you can get over that.

120
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:07.770
Lyndsey Lorett: Can I

121
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.250
Dawn Abriel: Oh, yes, yes, yes, you can. You can get over it.

122
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.590
Dawn Abriel: You'll never forget. You'll, you know, the loss will always be there.

123
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:24.750
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, but the trauma that intrudes on you that can be calmed down.

124
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:33.270
Dawn Abriel: Okay, that you can be in your life you'll always remember him. It'll never be a nice memory. You know that the ending

125
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.530
Dawn Abriel: It won't

126
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.760
Dawn Abriel: It won't be

127
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.120
Dawn Abriel: Dictating

128
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.010
Dawn Abriel: Your sleep.

129
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.360
Yes.

130
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:43.800
Dawn Abriel: So,

131
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.210
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever been hospitalized for a behavioral health issue.

132
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:49.230
No.

133
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:57.930
Dawn Abriel: And

134
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.330
Dawn Abriel: What's your stress level right now, mild, moderate, or severe

135
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.640
Lyndsey Lorett: I would say moderate

136
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.020
Dawn Abriel: And your self esteem.

137
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.350
Lyndsey Lorett: I you have pretty good self esteem.

138
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:20.820
Dawn Abriel: Sure helps

139
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:41.970
Dawn Abriel: Okay, now this will probably take us the most time. Let's go over your medical history. First of all, do you know your blood type.

140
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.170
Dawn Abriel: Looks like you're frozen.

141
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.000
Dawn Abriel: I'll wait for you to come back into the

142
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Can you hear me.

143
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.860
Lyndsey Lorett: I can I do not know what happened.

144
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.540
Dawn Abriel: Well, I asked you if you know your blood type.

145
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.790
Lyndsey Lorett: I do not know my blood type.

146
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.630
Okay.

147
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.600
Dawn Abriel: So why don't we start with you telling me what your medical problems are

148
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

149
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.780
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, so I had the C section in

150
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.910
Lyndsey Lorett: In December, and seven days later, it just split open the whole thing.

151
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:14.640
Lyndsey Lorett: I we tried for several months to close it with a wound vac it kept getting infected. So the VAC wouldn't work.

152
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:30.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, and then when my husband passed away. We moved and I developed a hernia in there and now the hernia so big it's coming out of the wound. Yeah. So my medical issue would be that

153
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.040
Lyndsey Lorett: Not many doctors want to fit the surgery.

154
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.030
Lyndsey Lorett: They

155
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Hate it.

156
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:48.210
Dawn Abriel: holds no good way there's there's really, they have mash that they can use, but they're, they're not they fail so much so often.

157
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.430
Lyndsey Lorett: I just don't understand why someone can't can't just fix it.

158
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.680
Dawn Abriel: Because any

159
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.730
Dawn Abriel: The any pressure on it pulls it apart.

160
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.500
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so really the

161
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:10.320
Dawn Abriel: The only true way to prevent it from happening, is to

162
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.470
Dawn Abriel: lose so much weight.

163
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:32.220
Dawn Abriel: They just, it looks like it from your picture. It looks like it so it, it would be like, get it fixed and continue to lose a lot of weight then it won't open up because then it will there's time enough for it to scar. So there's a funny thing that happens about scars.

164
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:42.960
Dawn Abriel: And if I if I if I close out. How do I show you this. If, if I close a wound on the hand.

165
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:54.540
Dawn Abriel: Uh huh. I want to say the wound went across my hand. But that's not the way the hand moves the hand moves cross ways not up and down.

166
00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:05.910
Dawn Abriel: Right scar tissue when it gets laid down, it gets laid down into a mesh just every which way, but the tissue is lined up in

167
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.580
Dawn Abriel: Perpendicular in line with its action of movement.

168
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.480
Dawn Abriel: So when when they repair your belly.

169
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:23.190
Dawn Abriel: The scar tissue is going every which way, and only a few of the fibers are going in the right direction. Okay.

170
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.570
Dawn Abriel: So there aren't very many fibers that will that will hold it together.

171
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

172
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:35.910
Dawn Abriel: But if but with enough time, all of those other fibers around will

173
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.930
Dawn Abriel: coalesce they'll come together and give you a good, a good strong scar.

174
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.390
Lyndsey Lorett: So are you saying that it would be better to Naturally, naturally, let it heal.

175
00:21:48.900 --> 00:22:12.000
Dawn Abriel: No. Well, no. And please, you know, I'm an emergency doctor. I'm not a surgeon. Right. So I learned this a long time ago. I've been at a medicine, medical school for decades. I, I read up but you know you really want to go by what it you know and and I assume you've gotten second opinions and

176
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:21.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, every you know know when no one. They say it's like a 12 hour surgery to redo my whole abdomen, including a tummy tuck.

177
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:36.510
Lyndsey Lorett: And because I've had Murcia, so many times. Only in the wound. My nose doesn't test positive note. Nowhere else test positive but they can't close the wound with Murcia in it.

178
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:37.770
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and

179
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.780
Lyndsey Lorett: So they keep throwing antibiotics at me that feel like I feel like crap. When I take

180
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:50.880
Dawn Abriel: It up. I bet you do. And without having all the good gut flora without having the, the natural

181
00:22:52.500 --> 00:23:01.080
Dawn Abriel: lactobacillus that the needed in your gut. People get depressed because their gut flora is altered.

182
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.430
Lyndsey Lorett: I am taking the most expensive probiotics. You can find

183
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.820
Dawn Abriel: Well, expensive. The trick is the freshest

184
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:18.960
Dawn Abriel: That's the trick the freshest when you go by him and they should be the ones that are in the refrigerator section.

185
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.360
Dawn Abriel: You look to see the one that has

186
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.070
Dawn Abriel: The longest out

187
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.930
Dawn Abriel: Date.

188
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.790
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, OK.

189
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.780
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it's freshest and you can you keep them in the refrigerator.

190
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:31.590
Okay.

191
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.020
Lyndsey Lorett: All right, my

192
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.540
Dawn Abriel: My regime in the morning is I take a probiotic with Kieffer

193
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:55.530
Dawn Abriel: Kieffer Kieffer has a lot of lactobacillus in it. So I take my vitamins and my probiotic in the morning and I make sure that sometime during the day. I almost always have a salad and I put

194
00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.400
Dawn Abriel: They make these fancy sauerkraut, like they make fermented beats.

195
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:08.070
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Anything, anything that's fermented is going to have those good bacteria in them.

196
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.000
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

197
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:17.040
Dawn Abriel: So i don't i don't like sauerkraut by itself by just put a tablespoon and mix it in my salad, and I don't even taste it.

198
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.540
Lyndsey Lorett: There you go.

199
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.300
Dawn Abriel: So just a thought.

200
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.920
Lyndsey Lorett: So, and I yeah

201
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.000
Um,

202
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.240
Dawn Abriel: Have you had any other surgeries.

203
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:44.220
Lyndsey Lorett: And yes, they last year, both June and July, they tried to do skin grafts to cover the hernia. Um, and then they attached a wound vac after the skin graft and it sucked the skin graft right off.

204
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.940
Dawn Abriel: Great planning.

205
00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.640
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah. No, it was not

206
00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:13.890
Lyndsey Lorett: What I have done really really well with only taking pain medicine during while I'm in the hospital. And I think once or twice. I've gotten home with a prescription, but my in laws literally write down the time and and they hold the medicine and

207
00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:21.480
Dawn Abriel: If it happens again. Work with me. There's no reason why you should have to switch over.

208
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.710
That's what I was

209
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

210
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.180
Dawn Abriel: But, but here's the thing. Let me, let me show you a picture.

211
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.460
Dawn Abriel: I really, I should make sure I've got an exam, right after years so

212
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.580
Dawn Abriel: I can't spend a whole lot of time.

213
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:56.610
Lyndsey Lorett: I do really well with ibuprofen, um, I usually know when I'm infected when the ibuprofen doesn't help.

214
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.060
Dawn Abriel: Can pull the pain. Yeah, yeah.

215
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.830
Lyndsey Lorett: And if you had asked me many years ago, I would tell you, ibuprofen doesn't work.

216
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.210
Lyndsey Lorett: But it's actually been a really big help. Yeah.

217
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.370
Dawn Abriel: And that's wonderful.

218
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.930
Dawn Abriel: It's just that it has its own risks.

219
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Of taking every day. Yeah.

220
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.850
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it really wreaks havoc on your gut lining and on your kidneys.

221
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:34.650
Lyndsey Lorett: The pain, though it's, you know, at the end of the day, I usually only take two doses once in the morning and once at night.

222
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

223
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.900
Lyndsey Lorett: I can't, I can't do it without it.

224
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:46.260
Dawn Abriel: For what you want as long it right as long as you have to, you have to, it's just

225
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.170
Dawn Abriel: As soon as you can. You, you want to not be on it.

226
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I agree.

227
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.740
Dawn Abriel: So look at this graph.

228
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:56.730
Okay.

229
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:04.590
Dawn Abriel: This is a you know a representation of on the left here are the

230
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:11.160
Dawn Abriel: Percentage of opioid receptors that are occupied

231
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.060
Dawn Abriel: Okay so appear is 85%

232
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.350
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And down here is the dosage of buprenorphine.

233
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:25.110
Dawn Abriel: Okay. So do you see how flat. This line is here, up at the top.

234
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:32.970
Dawn Abriel: Yes, that this means that you're 24 milligrams. If you bring the line up, you're

235
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.810
Dawn Abriel: Occupying 82 83% of your opioid receptors.

236
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my god.

237
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:55.530
Dawn Abriel: And there's no room to give you something more so that you can like in the in the or or after a surgery that you there is nothing that really addresses the pain.

238
00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:01.260
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. And if you went up a whole eight milligrams, you're only occupying 85

239
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:09.420
Dawn Abriel: But we don't get the dose down real slowly real slowly and you're saying one milligram

240
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:10.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Uh huh.

241
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.920
Dawn Abriel: You can go up by one milligram

242
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:14.910
Lyndsey Lorett: I have

243
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.290
Dawn Abriel: Be way up here.

244
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

245
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.000
Dawn Abriel: So there's just all this room for pain relief.

246
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.410
Lyndsey Lorett: Wow.

247
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:37.740
Dawn Abriel: When you're at the lower doses, that's one of the main reasons why I have people get off the medicine because they get in car accidents, they go for surgery and they're at these really high doses for, you know, six, seven years.

248
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:45.660
Dawn Abriel: And they have to be put on Ketamine or propofol or something really outrageous so

249
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Not all I don't do that. I don't want to do that. I would rather work.

250
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.480
Dawn Abriel: I hear you.

251
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

252
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.830
Dawn Abriel: I hear you. Okay, so we will work on that.

253
00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.930
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Um, so I really should get through this. Or I'm gonna

254
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.460
Dawn Abriel: Have any other surgeries. You've got your tonsils your gallbladder.

255
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.200
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, your appendix.

256
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.560
Yeah.

257
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Yep. Okay.

Dawn Abriel: Is

261
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.570
Dawn Abriel: Looks like, Oh, I see. Did you start to come into the program, another time.

262
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.750
Lyndsey Lorett: I did right before I found out I was pregnant.

263
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.730
Dawn Abriel: Hmm.

264
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:39.270
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so some of this is already well the OB history is wrong.

265
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.560
Dawn Abriel: Let me go fix that. So you've been pregnant. How many times

275
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.080
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Alright, so now I'm going to run through the really long list of

276
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:39.270
Dawn Abriel: It's called a review of systems. So, stop me if any of them apply to you.

289
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:25.860

Lyndsey Lorett: This is crazy.

291

Dawn Abriel: Who told you to take it that way.

301
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, but all the doctors that have prescribed it

302
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:03.960
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

303
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.240
Lyndsey Lorett: It's not good to take it that way.

304
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.040
Dawn Abriel: Well here's the thing.

305
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:17.280
Dawn Abriel: It's a medicine. It was created in 1998 99 came on the market and it was meant to be.

306
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.570
Dawn Abriel: A pain medicine for end stage cancer patients.

307
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.880
Dawn Abriel: And they made it to be long acting so it stays in your system.

308
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:47.130
Dawn Abriel: For 24 to 36 hours, which means you have to take all the medicine at one time to achieve what we call the blood level, it has to have enough in your system to carry you through that time. So you take eight milligrams and it, it starts to get up to the blood level comes down.

309
00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.600
Dawn Abriel: You take another eight and it starts to you're not getting all the medicine right

310
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Did not know that

311
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.730
Dawn Abriel: Most doctors don't know this. I don't know why.

312
00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:02.520
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so here's the thing I want you to start taking it first thing in the morning.

313
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:03.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

314
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.710
Dawn Abriel: But we don't know if three is too many

315
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.690
Dawn Abriel: And you'll know if three is too many if you get kind of whoa fuzzy headed

316
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.380
Dawn Abriel: And if that happens, back off by like a half a pill.

317
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.810
Dawn Abriel: Okay, looking two and a half.

318
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:26.880
Dawn Abriel: Okay, my

319
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.630
Lyndsey Lorett: Thinking taken three all at once is a lot

320
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.270
Dawn Abriel: You think so, but it really isn't.

321
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.230
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

322
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:47.400
Dawn Abriel: All right, isn't. I know it sounds like it but but it isn't because you you're never really getting up to where it needs to be to occupy all of the opioid receptors that have developed

323
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:57.090
Lyndsey Lorett: That makes sense. But towards the end of the day when the pain is worse. I find the subtext working the best

324
00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:04.770
Dawn Abriel: Right. That's because the first and second dose. There's some of that still there.

325
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:15.150
Dawn Abriel: But let's see. I mean, you might be an exception, but my guess is that three is going to be fine.

326
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:19.140
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Um, and it might even be too much.

327
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay. Well, that would be great. So

328
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.600
Dawn Abriel: Well, yeah, then you don't have to remember it.

329
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Three times a day. Yes.

330
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.110
Dawn Abriel: And I

331
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Learned a lot

332
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.090
Lyndsey Lorett: From you.

333
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:50.520
Dawn Abriel: These questions are meant for people that might have dementia. So you bathe yourself dress yourself feed yourself. Go to the bathroom by yourself and go from one place to another by yourself. Yes. You know who you are, where you are, what time of day it is. You can make your

334
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.790
Dawn Abriel: Own decisions, you have a memory that's appropriate for your age.

335
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.550
Dawn Abriel: You can focus your attention and you can read

336
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.500
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, well,

337
00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.340

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:00.630

Dawn Abriel: Three tablets in the morning and you put them under your tongue, you make sure you don't eat or drink anything right around that time so that they can really absorb they absorb under there's a network of vessels under your tongue that are real close to the surface.

518
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.430
Dawn Abriel: So they can take in medicine.

519
00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:57.480
Dawn Abriel: Well, from that area. But as soon as that medicine comes up and hits your tongue. The enzymes break it down. And you don't get the benefit of the medicine.

520
00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.610
Dawn Abriel: Oh no. So really, just let that slobber sit there

Dawn Abriel: Yeah. Oh, and that's another thing.

523
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:18.030
Dawn Abriel: That I make the most mistakes I make are people who are on tablets.

524
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:26.190
Dawn Abriel: Oh, every single week. You cannot trust me, you have to say, Doc. Remember I'm tablets.

528
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.200

Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, okay. What if they get it wrong.

533
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:12.780
Dawn Abriel: That's why you do not touch the package. You say,

534
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.020
Dawn Abriel: Please open the package and make sure it's

535
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.660

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.490
Dawn Abriel: Okay tablets.

537
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:21.630
Lyndsey Lorett: Got it.

538
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.520
Lyndsey Lorett: All right. Okay.

539
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.590
Dawn Abriel: Now I will tell you that

540
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:36.000
Dawn Abriel: as we as we go along and you do the tapering I might switch you over to a film that has known the lock zone in it.

541
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:42.600
Lyndsey Lorett: Are you there.

542
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.100
Dawn Abriel: Uh huh, I'm here.

543
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:45.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, sorry.

544
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:53.190
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so when you're in group there can't be anyone walking around in the background.

545
00:51:53.460 --> 00:52:10.710
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, because if someone accidentally sees someone they know in group that would just be awful right just a huge violation of HIPAA and you're going to go back to virtual clinic after we're done. And you're going to ask them, How do I do the brief addiction monitor the BAM.

546
00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:13.530
Dawn Abriel: And I do the the ACE right

547
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:21.000
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And once a month right heart health will send you a manila envelope. It looks like this.

548
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:35.910
Dawn Abriel: When you get it, do not open it. If you open it, it's null and void. They won't use it. You've got to go to the pharmacy to do your, your urine drug screen. But if you go to virtual clinic and you say, Hey, I got this in the mail. What do I do

549
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.500
Lyndsey Lorett: Uh huh. You

550
00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:43.890
Dawn Abriel: Open it in front of them and you'll take out one of these, you'll open this and there's a urine cup in here.

551
00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:44.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

552
00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:55.920
Dawn Abriel: You take the urine cup to the bathroom, not your phone. We don't need to see up just go to the bathroom, come back and you'll hold the cup up to the camera and you'll turn it

553
00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:58.560
Dawn Abriel: Okay, will read the results.

554
00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.670
Lyndsey Lorett: And that's it.

555
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:05.400
Dawn Abriel: Once a month your urine drug screen. So if for some reason you don't get one.

556
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:13.380
Dawn Abriel: Go to the virtual clinic and say, there must be something wrong with my address. Maybe you guys don't have it right

557
00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

558
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:21.390
Dawn Abriel: It's really up to you because if you don't do a urine drug screen, you don't do a Bam, they don't let you into group.

559
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:23.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, okay.

560
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:31.860
Dawn Abriel: It's real important. So if you change addresses, make sure that bright heart health, are some of the first people who get that information.

561
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:32.730
Sure can.

563
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.120
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't. Yeah.

564
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.590
Dawn Abriel: I've saved lives.

565
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:52.830
Dawn Abriel: How it knows it's just really wonderful.

566
00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:04.380
Dawn Abriel: When I first started doing it. I had a young lady who was sitting in her car like you are saw someone pass out with a needle in his arm.

567
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.160
Dawn Abriel: She went

568
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.220
Dawn Abriel: And saved his life while we were in group.

569
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:16.230
Lyndsey Lorett: Wow, that's got to be a cool feeling as a recovering addict, to be able to do that. Yeah, yeah.

570
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:17.940
Dawn Abriel: It's really tickled.

571
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, so

572
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:26.670
Dawn Abriel: I'm at some point in the real near future, and if you can do it today. Go get your labs drawn

573
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:33.810
Dawn Abriel: Yes, because I need to know baseline, mostly, I like to look at liver function tests so

574
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:34.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Hey,

575
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.550

Dawn Abriel: Hey, hold on a second. I need to say something for the transcriptionist IT'S MARCH 14 2020. This is Joshua say your last name for me love

610
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:36.030
Nyah,

611
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.480
Dawn Abriel: Nyah, righty. Alrighty, now you're ready. Okay.

612
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:51.780
Dawn Abriel: I have a fighting chance of not massacring it later. Now you're Roddy and living in Albuquerque. So you are greater than 17 miles.

613
00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:53.700
Dawn Abriel: Away.

614
00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:03.360
Dawn Abriel: I have to ask you the last time you had any kind of opioid

615
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.390
Joshua Nyarady: On today, I

616
00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:08.910
Dawn Abriel: Was yeah

617
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:10.800
Joshua Nyarady: Sentinel

618
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:13.530
Joshua Nyarady: Fine fentanyl pills.

619
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.120
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

620
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:25.170
Joshua Nyarady: I'm really scared and nervous to stop because it's terrible. It's one of the worst feelings. I've ever experienced.

621
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.450
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, although

622
00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:34.320
Dawn Abriel: Given the way they're contaminated with car fentanyl right now.

623
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:38.640
Dawn Abriel: You should be petrified that

624
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.090
Dawn Abriel: That you haven't overdosed.

625
00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:43.860
Dawn Abriel: There.

626
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:49.770
Dawn Abriel: Anyway, I don't need to go into that. So what's your dosage these days.

627
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:59.490
Joshua Nyarady: I don't know. I'm doing about a pill and a half to two pills a day what they're telling me is

628
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:07.800
Joshua Nyarady: What be considered like the knockoff of the 30 milligram oxycodone, but they're way stronger than that.

629
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:22.650
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so here's the thing with going on to switching from fentanyl to buprenorphine since there's no we don't know what the dose is

630
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:36.270
Dawn Abriel: I don't know how to match it with how much Suboxone to give you. So we're going to have to fiddle with it. We're going to have to stay in touch. Over the next few days and make sure you're getting enough buprenorphine.

631
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:41.130
Dawn Abriel: For northeast is a long acting opioids.

632
00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:48.450
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Your system 24 to 36 hours. So you take the, the film under your tongue.

633
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:50.850
Dawn Abriel: And you let it sit there

634
00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:52.140
Dawn Abriel: For

635
00:59:52.680 --> 01:00:00.120
Dawn Abriel: At least two minutes. You cannot eat, drink or smoke. Especially, you can't smoke before you take your medicine.

636
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:03.630
Dawn Abriel: The Smoking cramps down your blood vessels.

637
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:13.500
Dawn Abriel: And so those blood vessels that are in charge of absorbing the medicine, don't do a good job and you don't get the full benefit of the medicine. So really no smoking before you

638
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:15.690
Joshua Nyarady: Okay.

639
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.000
Dawn Abriel: Before you take it and

640
01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:23.070
Dawn Abriel: Do you ever an IV drug user

641
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.090
Know,

642
01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.560
Dawn Abriel: I'd saved you some heartache.

643
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:36.660
Dawn Abriel: But you you have noticed that you've had to take more and more opioid to get the same. Yeah. And he had an overdose.

644
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:37.560
Know,

645
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:45.600
Dawn Abriel: And no medical complications or legal issues around your drug use.

646
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.350
No.

647
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:47.970
Dawn Abriel: Super

648
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:56.640
Dawn Abriel: Has your life sort of revolved around finding it using it, thinking about it.

649
01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:07.830
Joshua Nyarady: I'm somewhat. Yeah, it's like, God, I have projects that I'm supposed to be doing around the house and it's like if I don't if I don't have any I can't work. I can't do them.

650
01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:12.240
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And how old were you when you started using any illicit drug

651
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.610
Joshua Nyarady: I mean 1415, I guess.

652
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.410
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and what did you start with

653
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.780
Joshua Nyarady: I started using cocaine.

654
01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.080
Dawn Abriel: Not marijuana

655
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.770
Joshua Nyarady: Now, I never, never got into marijuana

656
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:31.110
Dawn Abriel: Really, isn't that interesting.

657
01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.550
Dawn Abriel: And when did you start with the opioids.

658
01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:42.150
Joshua Nyarady: Um, about a year ago I had, I had a surgery on my

659
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:44.070
Joshua Nyarady: On my hand.

660
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.140
Joshua Nyarady: And

661
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.630
Joshua Nyarady: I just I used

662
01:01:52.710 --> 01:02:08.940
Joshua Nyarady: Then, and then it just kind of like the way it felt, and I knew somebody that had some extra regular same Megan oxycodone pills and and then before you know and you know, two, three months later, is like, Oh, we have these and okay

663
01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.250
And so now

664
01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:12.900
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

665
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:18.090
Dawn Abriel: So we, we know from the brain research that's out there.

666
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:19.560
Dawn Abriel: That

667
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:21.990
Dawn Abriel: And

668
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:33.270
Dawn Abriel: Because of your childhood something else, something was going on in your childhood that made you predisposed more likely to become addicted to opioids.

669
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.670
Dawn Abriel: Sorry opioids change your brain. So

670
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:52.260
Dawn Abriel: It is a brain disease. It's not that you don't have willpower. It's not that you're a bad person. It's a function of that chemical and and the nasty things it does to your brain. So

671
01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:00.660
Dawn Abriel: We. We. That's our philosophy. I mean, that's how we treat people as though they have

672
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:05.040
Dawn Abriel: A disease that we can help them.

673
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:10.440
Dawn Abriel: You know, eventually get off of all the drugs that they want to get off of

674
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:17.400
Dawn Abriel: And and i and i gotta tell you there's a very funny thing that happens.

675
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:28.830
Dawn Abriel: You're going to eventually, you know, in a maybe the end of April or so you're going to start tapering off your Suboxone very, very slowly.

676
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:50.340
Dawn Abriel: But when you get down to a particular dose and there's no predicting what that is, but all of a sudden your hand might start to hurt because there's this weird wiring in the brain where it remembers that dose of opioid connected to that pain.

677
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.740
Dawn Abriel: And people experience.

678
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:55.650
Dawn Abriel: The same pain they had when they started the opioid

679
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.230
Dawn Abriel: Wow. Isn't that crazy

680
01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.790
Joshua Nyarady: That is crazy.

681
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.920
Joshua Nyarady: Yeah, never would have thought that

682
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:06.510
Dawn Abriel: So it's the brain playing tricks on you. Your hands not hurting

683
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:15.390
Dawn Abriel: It's not coming from the periphery to the brain. It's the brain doing a closed loop in there. Okay, so don't be surprised. I

684
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:18.510
Dawn Abriel: Just like to warn people so there

685
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.370
Dawn Abriel: Any change in relationships and work because of the opioid use

686
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.600
Joshua Nyarady: Know, I've managed to keep all that

687
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.060
Joshua Nyarady: In a good standing.

688
01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:39.300
Dawn Abriel: And is this the first program you opinion. Yes, it is.

689
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.880
Dawn Abriel: Well, let's hope it's the last

690
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:43.110
I agree.

691
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.040
Dawn Abriel: Any anxiety or sleep issues.

692
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.280
Joshua Nyarady: Yeah, I do have trouble sleeping.

693
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.390
Joshua Nyarady: Oh yeah, anxiety,

694
01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:04.650
Joshua Nyarady: I mean, yeah, I mean I pretty much like stressed out all the time because I'm you know I'm basically hiding something from my job and

695
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:09.300
Joshua Nyarady: I worry about losing my job is in the house so

696
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:17.370
Dawn Abriel: Sure we sure see that a lot. Have you ever been hospitalized for a mental illness.

697
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.990
Joshua Nyarady: I know

698
01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:25.950
Dawn Abriel: And what would you say your stress level is right now, mild, moderate, or severe

699
01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.590
Joshua Nyarady: Probably severe

700
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:31.410
Dawn Abriel: And that's

701
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:41.310
Dawn Abriel: Let's see people finding out about the opioid use

702
01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.410
Dawn Abriel: And anything else relationships financial school

703
01:05:46.950 --> 01:06:02.850
Joshua Nyarady: Not really. Financial but I had a flood. A couple of months back, and I'm trying to do a renovation on the House to fix it all and it's it's just kind of everything's just overwhelming and I just realized that this is just getting in the way of of everything.

704
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:14.100
Dawn Abriel: Isn't it awful, the way you think a project is going to be this little thing and then you can't do this until you do this, this and this.

705
01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.760
Joshua Nyarady: Yes, that's, that's exactly how it's been it's been

706
01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.150
Dawn Abriel: Yes.

707
01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:25.110
Joshua Nyarady: Just taken so long. It is I, you know, I'm down to one bathroom in the houses just crazy. It's just

708
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:28.470
Dawn Abriel: Ya know, I really feel you

709
01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:37.890
Dawn Abriel: We have a project going on all they wanted to do is put a roof on my house flat roof to peek roof to put insulation in there.

710
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:38.670
Joshua Nyarady: Huh.

711
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:44.160
Dawn Abriel: I have to change out my furnace system to put a roof on my house.

712
01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:46.560
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I feel you.

713
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.990
Joshua Nyarady: Know I, no, no.

714
01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.500
Dawn Abriel: Okay not, this is not about me.

715
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.680
Dawn Abriel: And your self esteem.

716
01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:58.650
Joshua Nyarady: Um,

717
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:09.330
Joshua Nyarady: It's probably it's it's fairly low, it's not. I mean, it's not super low but i mean i know i could be better for sure.

718
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:10.260
Okay.

719
01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:15.210
Dawn Abriel: No.

720
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:17.760
Joshua Nyarady: Definitely not proud of myself.

721
01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:20.400
Well,

722
01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:22.920
Dawn Abriel: Again, remember

723
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.220
Dawn Abriel: This is not all your fault.

724
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:42.390
Dawn Abriel: Because of your childhood, something was going on where you didn't get big. I'll tell you the difference when people get surgery they get out opioids. Most people say

725
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.460
Dawn Abriel: Oh,

726
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.920
Dawn Abriel: It made me a little woozy

727
01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:57.270
Dawn Abriel: And it took it took the edge off the pain and then I forgot to take the next dose there's there's those kind of people and then they're the kind of people who say

728
01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:05.700
Dawn Abriel: Oh my goodness, that felt like a warm hug that felt like the nicest thing that's happened to me.

729
01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:09.630
Dawn Abriel: Now, that there are set up for addiction.

730
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:11.970
Joshua Nyarady: Yeah yeah

731
01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:13.590
Dawn Abriel: So,

732
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:21.420
Dawn Abriel: I want you to, I want you to not be mean to yourself. Okay. Okay.

733
01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.650
Dawn Abriel: I know I all I have to do is say that right and it'll magically go away.

734
01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:28.140
Joshua Nyarady: Yeah.

735
01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:46.950
Dawn Abriel: No, I'm not that stupid. I know it's gonna take that that's what the surgery is for, right, because being on a soapbox on is like a little window of opportunity you had this long acting opioid where you can get your life together. You can do the remodeling.

736
01:08:48.240 --> 01:09:05.130
Dawn Abriel: And but it doesn't change the brain wiring. The only thing that changes the brain wiring is the therapy and being in group. So take advantage of it. You'll never get therapy cheaper than having a paid for in this program. This is like

737
01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.520
Dawn Abriel: An incredible opportunity.

738
01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:11.670
Dawn Abriel: So make them really work for you.

739
01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:13.410
Joshua Nyarady: Okay, okay.

740
01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.840
Dawn Abriel: So we have gotten long winded today.

741
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.560
Dawn Abriel: Do you know what your blood type is

742
01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.140
Joshua Nyarady: I do not. Okay.

743
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.670
Dawn Abriel: I have to list off a whole bunch of things, stop me if any of them apply to you.

744
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:27.300
Joshua Nyarady: Okay.

745
01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:35.010

748
01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:08.190
Joshua Nyarady: Of the girl that the that's the acid reflux right now.

749
01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:09.570
Dawn Abriel: That's replace gastric

750

Dawn Abriel: Reflux Disease.

751
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.620
Joshua Nyarady: Yes, I have acid reflux, I take a map Rizal every day.

752
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:19.320
Dawn Abriel: Okay, remind me that when I go to medicine.

753
01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:30.270
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and your kidneys bladder and penis work the way they're supposed to. Yes. And you don't have hearing aids. You don't have allergic.

755
01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:46.680

869
01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:17.220
Joshua Nyarady: Yeah.

870
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:25.710
Dawn Abriel: The heart. The heart birds a drag, but it because it changes the pH in your stomach so dramatically.

871
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:30.900
Dawn Abriel: It, it kills bacteria later on in your gut.

872
01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:37.020
Dawn Abriel: And you didn't, you don't have a healthy gut so

873
01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:44.220
Dawn Abriel: That's a whole different discussion. Do you have any allergies to medicines penicillin.

874
01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.800
Dawn Abriel: In Silicon

875
01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:49.290
Dawn Abriel: The most common

876
01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.380
Dawn Abriel: And what happens when you have it.

877
01:19:57.030 --> 01:20:02.190
Joshua Nyarady: I don't know. It's unknown. I was in my adoption file. So we just stuck with that.

878
01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:03.450
Okay.

879
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:06.600
Dawn Abriel: If you ever need it.

880
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:17.910
Dawn Abriel: They can do a little skin test, they can put a teensy weensy bit just under the skin and if you have a big reaction, then you have a true allergy.

881
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.170
Joshua Nyarady: Oh, I didn't know that.

882
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:36.540
Dawn Abriel: Uh huh. But if you don't, most people say, Oh, I've got an allergy to penicillin and really all they had was a reaction, not an allergy, like they have a little upset stomach. That's not an allergic reaction that's you did it on an empty stomach. Right.

883
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:43.470
Dawn Abriel: But since we can't go back and figure that out. But if you ever really need it. And that's what they would do.

884
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:44.250
Joshua Nyarady: Okay.

885
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:54.000
Dawn Abriel: We have a lot of different antibiotics. Nowadays, so it's it's hardly ever necessary, but there are one or two bugs that only penicillin will get

886
01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:54.930
Yeah.

887
01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:08.550
Dawn Abriel: And I have to ask you questions about your functioning and cognition. So you bathe dress feed, go to the bathroom and go from one place to another, all by your lonesome self.

888
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:09.240
Yes.

889
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:20.970
Dawn Abriel: You know who you are, what time it is. You make your own decisions. You have a memory that's appropriate to your age, you can focus and you can read

890
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.260
Yeah.

891
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:29.280
Dawn Abriel: When I do too many of these in a row. I get pretty silly.

892
01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:36.000
Dawn Abriel: I gotta, you know, mix it up for my own entertainment.

893
01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.810

Joshua Nyarady: Yeah, I got it. Okay.

898
01:21:56.130 --> 01:21:58.920

Dawn Abriel: Now we have to do a
