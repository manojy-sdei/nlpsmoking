00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How's our connection. Today you can

3
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear me in real time. Everything's in Sing Sing Sing Sing

4
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.300
Cynthia We: Yes, I think so.

5
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Far out. Let's see how long that last

6
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It. All right. Um, let me get a

7
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.330
Cynthia We: Long time, a long time to check in today.

8
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Cynthia We: Yep, I call it Quarter two, and it took me all 15 minutes and then some. Yeah.

9
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you see why I invite you guys get in there early haha

10
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.580
Yeah.

11
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't want to miss out on all this healing.

12
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so they

13
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.060
Cynthia We: Understand, they didn't understand about um

14
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:56.610
Cynthia We: That that Blue Cross Blue Shield is covering the copays, they thought that I was trying to get my my out of pocket maximum, and that's why I didn't need to pay co pays. Okay, when in fact

15
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.960
Cynthia We: Blue Cross Blue Shield is covering co pays for therapy because of the times, we're in right now. Yeah.

16
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe trying

17
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.820
Cynthia We: To talk to someone else, I guess.

18
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To someone else also what you may do is put it specifically in writing in an email.

19
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.140
Cynthia We: I did. I did.

20
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

21
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:29.220
Cynthia We: But apparently they didn't understand it but I sent it to the person I dealt with in building before. So maybe I don't remember know that she's still there. So maybe I

22
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.950
Cynthia We: Maybe just somebody I could talk to

23
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.980
Cynthia We: Specifically for billing. Maybe I should send it somewhere else.

24
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe. Let me see. So the person I think of in billing is a Krista

25
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.060
Cynthia We: Yeah.

26
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I think she's still there.

27
00:02:44.250 --> 00:03:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I because I think this woman when when I first got here. Darby I think her whole role change. And I haven't heard her name. So my guess is her role has changed. So I'm thinking it's Krista bidding, but I haven't messaged her and so long. I don't even know I'm

28
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't, you could do send that same message. And you can see see me. Um, do you, you know mine because you send me messages so CC CC me on it and then I can

29
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I can kind of follow

30
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

31
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I can follow it and say, I think this is what she's saying, and blah, blah, blah, blah.

32
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.150
Cynthia We: Okay, cool.

33
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see where

34
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that. Okay.

35
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic.

36
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.500
Cynthia We: And also the guy that I spoke to said he'll have my care coordinator call

37
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.420
Cynthia We: Me, I don't, I'm not really sure who my care coordinator is but

38
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know either. I'm guessing it's a woman by the name of Angelina

39
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.380
Cynthia We: Angelina, because

40
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: She's the one I coordinate with the most

41
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, last name,

42
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know her last name. What is your last name.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Novartis, and I E V like Victor a like Apple r e s like Sam Angelina A N G E Li N A numerous and I be VA r e s

44
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.380
Cynthia We: Okay.

45
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.920
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah we r e a c

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Ii Ii Ii Ii never us and I EV a are, yes.

47
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.360
Okay.

48
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.810
Cynthia We: Okay, so she should know who that is actually

49
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool.

50
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.140
Cynthia We: And I think they've connected me her before but I didn't realize she was my character.

51
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.460
I don't know.

52
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Things change every day.

53
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.080
Cynthia We: Yes, it's difficult to get some organization exclusively

54
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't get there, though I think eventually it'll get yeah I think it's very organized. I mean, very organized for healthcare.

55
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.260
Much

56
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.370
Cynthia We: I'm impressed with the organization, most of the time.

57
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

58
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me. Um, unless you have something that you kind of have right on the tip of your tongue something you're presenting with can have something come

59
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.460
Cynthia We: I don't have anything

60
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

61
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.170
Cynthia We: Well,

62
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.560
Cynthia We: Maybe I'm I feel like we've been

63
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.530
Cynthia We: A little smoother. This week we Scott and I

64
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, how did you

65
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

66
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.090
Cynthia We: I try to talk to him about beauty when

67
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.280
Cynthia We: I'm

68
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:50.010
Cynthia We: And and we were able to talk about money, like in a moment. That wasn't happening right then, you know, it was we were talking about it in theory.

69
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.280
Cynthia We: Which I think helped keep our emotions down

70
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.290
Cynthia We: And I'm

71
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.610
Cynthia We: I felt like we did a good job. See, this is very focused on getting this thank you thing out for for work. So

72
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.140
Cynthia We: He's, he's more like himself when he's focused on work.

73
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So you talked about beauty as in a value system right

74
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.790
Cynthia We: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

75
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.020
Cynthia We: And then I'm here very defensive the heat sees beauty to he just doesn't understand what the hell I'm doing.

76
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.080
Cynthia We: But I'm

77
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.190
Cynthia We: I feel like

78
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.860
Cynthia We: I just feel like he was able to hear it.

79
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It was defensive, but ultimately he could hear it.

80
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.830
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah defensive it for because he sees beauty to and then

81
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously, and that's why I

82
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, beauty is in the eye of the right

83
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.040
Right.

84
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:16.860
Cynthia We: Um, so, so I feel like we we've had an okay time like it has not been as explosive around here and I noticed that he he had a book in his the Amazon card how not to lose your shit a cleanse or something like that over that delusion that I've your kids.

85
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's an interesting thing that he must have some sort of

86
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Awareness of what's going on. That's cool.

87
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.600
Cynthia We: Well, yeah, he's been pretty pretty

88
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.620
Cynthia We: Explosive with ticket.

89
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So what makes

90
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.920
Cynthia We: Me crazy sometimes as he routine and that's his job.

91
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So although you two seem to have a decrease in escalation. There seems to be an increase with Scott and Teagan

92
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.420
Cynthia We: Yeah.

93
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just take one at a time. You said that money did come up and I had had a my mind.

94
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Something I thought you might introduce it was a little different. And I'm wondering, last time I don't know whether it played out and let me let me hear what did you guys talk about around money this time what you talk about

95
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.470
Cynthia We: We talked about the yard.

96
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:32.700
Cynthia We: Okay, there's getting up every time I went to the gardening or and I talked about, um, I see a project and I don't realize how big it's going to be. I think I can do it all for this amount of money you know and and that I told him I thought that that had to be very frustrating for him.

97
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.100
Cynthia We: Oh, very frustrating for me.

98
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.680
Cynthia We: And, um,

99
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:44.370
Cynthia We: I think just admitting that he was able to say, okay, well, so now what is it that you want us to do.

100
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.390
Oh,

101
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.710
Cynthia We: Shit, I need to fill the paths.

102
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But Cindy Don't, don't walk away from this you have

103
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a healthy portion

104
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Of humility and

105
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.980
Cynthia We: Yeah.

106
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What became available to you was when you own your grain of truth. Right.

107
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, then

108
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.620
Cynthia We: Your truth.

109
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is again. Yeah, but keep showing up right for all of us. And then he didn't have to keep

110
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Convincing you have what you need to own, so he he could stop arguing

111
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, Nikki was able to be generous and say, oh, right. He can rescue you out of that self.

112
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You out of it. I mean don't overdo it. We don't want to go oh pity party I'm worthless and weak and I should die. We don't want that to be right, but we own this little piece and all we need is humility to do it.

113
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.950
Cynthia We: Okay, wow.

114
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.570
Cynthia We: I've heard that a few times.

115
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.050
Cynthia We: I didn't even realize that that's what I was

116
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you're doing.

117
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Really important.

118
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.660
Cynthia We: Really, really, really impressed in

119
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: intimate relationships. So as soon as we're owning our part. Well then, they don't have to spend all their energy saying look to own it, own it. Look at it, you have a part of this, then you're already doing it. They don't have to. And so immediately. He said, Oh, well,

120
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you want to do with the garden. Isn't that something

121
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.230
Cynthia We: Yeah.

122
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty cool.

123
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.530
Cynthia We: Yes, it is very cool.

124
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I thought you were going to do this week. And I wonder if you completely thought, oh no, this won't work. Right. I want to do it. Or maybe you did it. I'm going to find out.

125
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I had it in my head that you are going to say to Scott, you know, it's got just give me $200. It's on me. I'm going to have this for whatever amount of time. These are random numbers.

126
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna give you $200 cash.

127
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna watch how I budget myself in real time.

128
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's on me if I run out of money that's on me.

129
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

130
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I wondered if you had done that or if it was so

131
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:19.380
Cynthia We: I tried. I did it because I'm because that was like what we talked about before. And that was the whole plan around putting him in charge of mine and just given me a certain amount so that he could plan for my certain amount. And then I could budget in my certain amount

132
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.760
Cynthia We: Okay, is

133
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:26.910
Cynthia We: He just said Wikia we just can't right now because because it's so tight and we don't really know.

134
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.630
Cynthia We: That will I work, you know,

135
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:39.180
Cynthia We: But right now we're, we're just and what we're getting. What we're bringing in so

136
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.860
Cynthia We: Any amount to is I'm

137
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.960
Cynthia We: Too much

138
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So a little, a little check point here. Um,

139
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone on the outside might say that

140
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: $70 would as a random number 65 whatever

141
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: On a garden.

142
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Is hobby and that's frosting superfluous and over the top. Now, every family is going to say that I'm or Starbucks is over the top. So every family is different, um, where do you see that there's actually more flexibility, then really you're giving yourself credit for

143
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.580
Cynthia We: Oh, um,

144
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.790
Cynthia We: I see that there's a lot of flexibility.

145
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:34.650
Cynthia We: And I'm

146
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:46.530
Cynthia We: Having because we are getting Starbucks every day, or at least I am and I'm and I have spent a lot more than seven. Yeah, because the garden so

147
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.700
Cynthia We: I that argument was about, um, what

148
00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:06.780
Cynthia We: What I think of as important. Like why I think it's important, why I care and and it was about a lot more than just

149
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.170
Cynthia We: Gardening. Really, it's like

150
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.980
Cynthia We: It's, it's something that does me

151
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:22.290
Cynthia We: That and there's the whole neighbors thing and people noticing stuff and me feeling okay about myself.

152
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.060
Cynthia We: So,

153
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.850
Cynthia We: Yeah, I see that, um,

154
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.980
Cynthia We: We have a we're not during normal times, but we have a lot more flexibility than

155
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.190
Cynthia We: We ever used to, you know,

156
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not like a few months ago, it was pretty bad. Yeah. Yeah. It's not bad.

157
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:56.430
Cynthia We: Yeah, he actually said the day that he could, he could get by Ms forever if we didn't have to pay certain bows and and we were only bringing in this man let me keep

158
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.750
Cynthia We: Up with us.

159
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.660
Cynthia We: Because he doesn't feel he said he feels less stress than usual. Okay.

160
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:21.780
Cynthia We: Because I'm not allowed to go out to go shopping, really, there's no I think a lot of that is that he has control over what's being spent, because everybody's on lockdown. Right.

161
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you want to spend some time while you don't have these ongoing pressures to have some re experiencing of that old conditioning from childhood around money about image about how it still

162
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like deeply attached to your identity, whether you like it or not, it seems like it's got a hold of you.

163
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.310
Cynthia We: Totally. Okay. Yeah, that's a great idea.

164
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

165
00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.330
Cynthia We: He doing oh so thick, a lot of it has to do with um

166
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.770
Cynthia We: With me networking

167
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.870
Cynthia We: Kind of money.

168
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And I would say that, except what you do is I don't disagree with you. I'm sorry, let me rephrase that. Oh, absolutely contextualize noted, sorry about that.

169
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Already I already had a plan. I was what I was going to say, and then you said that. So, I'm so sorry. Um, I guess what I'm thinking is

170
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to check myself on something. First I need to make sure that this is something that you want to let go of and not something I want you to let go of. So I need to. I need to just make sure that this is a direction you want to go and it's not me.

171
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pushing you.

172
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.050
Cynthia We: Okay.

173
00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.010
So,

174
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you like to continue to be someone who, at times will choose

175
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To be irritable sometimes impatient and spend money on things that preserve an image of you being someone who cares about your property over the feelings of your family members, is that okay

176
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.110
Cynthia We: Um,

177
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.470
Cynthia We: I would like to change.

178
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.840
Cynthia We: Okay, I'm not sure what you just said. But yeah.

179
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.240
Cynthia We: I don't, I don't like the first one.

180
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be that it doesn't exist. So that might be my imagination. She let me just see how there ever been times when you've been irritated with

181
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: With your family.

182
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because people you wanted to make sure you looked good on the outside.

183
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like that about you that you do that sometimes.

184
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of person does that

185
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.050
Cynthia We: Um,

186
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.050
Cynthia We: Well,

187
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:29.610
Cynthia We: I remember being very upset about it was regarding kids acting like brats in public.

188
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What if someone sees them acting like brats. What, what do we think when we see that family you and your

189
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.630
Cynthia We: Mom is a bad

190
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:40.830
Oh,

191
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a big one. Okay, bad mom.

192
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm right. And so that's kind of similar. Like if I don't care about my property. I'm just a renter, they don't take pride. Same kind of thing, right. I

193
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.020
Cynthia We: Guess right

194
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.930
Cynthia We: Less than person.

195
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Less than. That's it.

196
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we do a little bit of work around that one. Do you happen to already have. Are you already on a laptop.

197
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.150
Cynthia We: Yes.

198
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, great. I don't have my little blue light. So if we end up doing that today, it's going to be my finger.

199
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I could probably pull it up pretty quickly though. So let's do a little targeting around that so it's less than

200
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you get in touch with that picturing kids being kids sort of having a difficult time inhibiting impulse. They want to yell, they

201
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's the supermarket or wherever they are, they see you know bright colored things and they want to grab it. Can I have this or they're arguing with each other, whatever is going on, whatever that imagery was to sort of bring that into your working awareness.

202
00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And then get a sense that someone sees you, and is looking at you and then your kids and you

203
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe

204
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: They're thinking you

205
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Are less than

206
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.440
Cynthia We: Every specific instance. Okay.

207
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you feel in the body as soon as you have that image.

208
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.190
Cynthia We: I'm embarrassed and

209
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.250
Cynthia We: Humiliated.

210
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Embarrassed and humiliated.

211
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And now let's go body when you are in embarrassment and humiliation. Where do you feel that

212
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.880
Cynthia We: I'm not sure.

213
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, it might show up as we continue to investigate this a little bit further. So let's go to. So we don't know sama response just yet. We'll get there.

214
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So now be in touch with humiliation, which tends to be humiliation is this piece around

215
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, someone doing it to us.

216
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Verisign. It's kind of like

217
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, I wish this had to happen.

218
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Humiliation is almost like someone put us in this position publicly that might feel like humiliating like

219
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You brought out something that I didn't bring out but there it is someone else kind of in public brought out this thing and it was embarrassing. So there might be this out someone else doing something to you is that what humiliation was

220
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.360
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah yeah

221
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.050
Okay.

222
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then see if you can go back in time, let's try and bridge this to an early

223
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Humiliation

224
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Early child early

225
00:20:59.280 --> 00:20:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: History

226
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: At first experience of embarrassment. If someone had

227
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Humiliated you and you felt

228
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Less than

229
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be rolling out a couple things I'd be curious to know what ran into your mind there.

230
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.760
Cynthia We: Um, I wondered effective use the same instance that I used for shame.

231
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.180
Cynthia We: I was laughing and telling jokes.

232
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.980
Cynthia We: Yeah, mom.

233
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

234
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.610
Cynthia We: got mad at me for the very much

235
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.590
Cynthia We: Yeah, I'm working on.

236
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. I remember that.

237
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. And then you kept going and you just didn't blow Hughes about

238
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.950
Cynthia We: Yeah, I didn't know

239
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you didn't know, let me just see if I've got it in here.

240
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you driving the boat. Where did you get your license. So

241
00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.250
Cynthia We: It's funny.

242
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Funny.

243
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.660
Cynthia We: One or two times it's funny.

244
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I mean, you know,

245
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.240
Cynthia We: Okay, so good. LAUGH But hey, why not

246
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I just read it.

247
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:21.180
Yeah.

248
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought it was the funniest thing. I kept repeating it. I loved it. The adults were laughing at something I said Uncle Jerry was laughing I was having fun and mom said

249
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Cynthia enough

250
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: In front of everybody. He

251
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Just felt it like

252
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Like my whole my shoulders just

253
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I hated it.

254
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She told me it was inappropriate for a child to talk to an adult like that.

255
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt deflated horrified and embarrassed.

256
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And the negative cognition. Then when we had explored this was, I'm an idiot, I'm stupid and the positive cognition, the one that would have been convenient was learning

257
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This time it's attached to what belief about yourself.

258
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.420
Cynthia We: This other instance is

259
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.440
Cynthia We: So to me,

260
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:48.720
Cynthia We: That I'm a bad mom that I that I have that I don't have any skills and I'm an idiot.

261
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad mom, I have no skills and I'm an idiot. There's that idiot thing again.

262
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.160
Yeah.

263
00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So the image and you don't have to tell me you know for this to work. You don't have to tell me, but I'm just curious. Is it, is this the earliest experience because you were eight of really getting

264
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone intentionally like doing this and bear shaming you in public, making you feel small in public. This is the earliest one you can remember

265
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.210
Cynthia We: Yeah, I think it is, um,

266
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:28.770
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

267
00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so this time it's

268
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got a connection to current thing. So like to. I'm going to label this a little differently. And I'd like you to tell me how in current day

269
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I was talking about some I was talking about the yard and I was talking about certain things, but I want to know for you. What's. How does that kind of keep showing up.

270
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that have to do with impression management, let's say,

271
00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.790
Cynthia We: I'm

272
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.010
Cynthia We: A keep showing up in

273
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.970
Cynthia We: The like I

274
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.180
Cynthia We: If everybody thinks I'm okay on the outside the maybe I'll be okay on the inside.

275
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.900
Cynthia We: That makes but that doesn't have anything to do with taking yelling at me in the grocery store.

276
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How about hold on to it for just a second. So if everybody thinks I'm okay on the outside, then I'm okay on the inside.

277
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it then everybody will think I'm on me.

278
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.860
Cynthia We: There we go, we go

279
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

280
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And

281
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.900
Cynthia We: And that will help me be okay.

282
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If I look to others, like I'm a good

283
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I

284
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I will believe I am a good mom and it will help me be a good mom is that the same sequence.

285
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.180
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

286
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:33.990
Cynthia We: He specifically was yelling at me about money, which brought in this whole level of, like, oh my god, I can't believe that my child is repeating my husband and everybody is staring at me as if I'm a beaten woman.

287
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:35.460
Cynthia We: Like

288
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.860
Cynthia We: People had pity on their faces when they looked at me.

289
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You can yell at me, much like Scott does about money in the shopping in a

290
00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.490
Cynthia We: Trader Joe

291
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets it to yell at me about money, just like Scott does in Trader Joe's that get it.

292
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:13.740
Cynthia We: Yeah, and he sounded like an abusive husband, like he sounded like my image of what

293
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.690
Cynthia We: An abusive husband sounds like. And when I looked at the people

294
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.360
Cynthia We: That were close by. It wasn't the usual

295
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.390
Cynthia We: They look sad for me for me.

296
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.410
Yeah.

297
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:33.570
Cynthia We: Yeah.

298
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, what, what's the feeling just now. What is that, what's that emotion.

299
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.580
Cynthia We: Um,

300
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.840
Cynthia We: I was totally humiliated, because I felt like

301
00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:04.740
Cynthia We: First of all, I couldn't control him. I couldn't stop him from doing it. And no matter what I said. You want to stop. And second of all, the image of

302
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:17.370
Cynthia We: I wanted to explain. No, no, it's not like that. I know it sounds like that, but it's not. He's not beating me. It's okay. It has been as a beating like the idea that I would, um,

303
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:23.910
Cynthia We: I don't know. I

304
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so just, I know you went to all of these thoughts. But let's start with I heard, I heard humiliated.

305
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's a that's from perception of other people's eyes just imagine

306
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine the store was empty.

307
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.210
Cynthia We: Okay, mom, he shouldn't be worrying about

308
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.630
Cynthia We: He doesn't understand that we're not that worried

309
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.840
Cynthia We: That we were okay we were fine and I'm

310
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: He didn't understand that financially, you were okay. Is that right,

311
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.000
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

312
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.360
Cynthia We: Financially, we wrote it. That's why I say the grocery store and then. Okay.

313
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:29.490
Cynthia We: Because all he hears from from his dad is this, you know, bitching about spending too much money at the grocery

314
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:36.030
Cynthia We: So his idea of security being secure I'm

315
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.580
Cynthia We: Upset that he can

316
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:42.900
Understand

317
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so there is some. We don't have to get derailed but just so you know, Sunday. If you see an expression on my face like I don't know what you're saying it's because there's a breakup in the in the audio so

318
00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you kind of repeat yourself a little bit because I'm missing important pieces so I'm sorry for the clunky nature of it just hang in there for it. We usually get through. Right. WE ARE YOU TELL A HEALTH AND GET WHAT WE CAN from it, it is not

319
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.480
Cynthia We: To either the

320
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we're not going to get through rail. We're going to stay here. We're going to stay here.

321
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.840
Cynthia We: In the computer, write it down because it pisses me off.

322
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you're solving things once you solve my problem.

323
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to the grocery store. Okay, let's let's stay there. So I got a little some different information. Once I removed all of the audience and the eyes that are seeing this. Go on. You had something different to say in

324
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.050
Cynthia We: Yeah.

325
00:30:52.320 --> 00:31:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: We're able to make contact with your son, you were able to make contact with him and see all he's doing is echoing when he's been hearing at home.

326
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And if no one were around LITERALLY LIKE YOU'RE LIKE IT'S SUNDAY only goes on Tuesday afternoons and nobody's there. She does a self checkout.

327
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.580
Cynthia We: Nobody sees me

328
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What might might you have done and what might have said.

329
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.500
Cynthia We: I'm

330
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.940
Cynthia We: I might have been able to explain that to him.

331
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:43.800
Cynthia We: In a way that wasn't so frantic and embarrassed that I was not able to

332
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.770
Cynthia We: stop him from doing it so

333
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:56.250
Cynthia We: I've been a really easy him. He's his mind and let them know that it was not bad.

334
00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.260
Cynthia We: It was not

335
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.370
Cynthia We: We're okay we're gonna be fine.

336
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:11.880
Cynthia We: And we had enough money to stop shop at Trader Joe's on a regular basis. Daddy was working

337
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you go to content, you would be able to use his mind. He knew what was going on. You could see a pattern you see it being played out.

338
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And so he took on this role. And so here he is acting like an adult. He's acting like what he hears at home, you would recognize it and you would in calmer tones, be able to eat this mind.

339
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Now excellent do the next piece which is what about the emotional part. What about the distress that your son. The only thing he can do.

340
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Is act out

341
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: God's behavior.

342
00:32:53.340 --> 00:33:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about your when you did the first part was fantastic, right. You wanted to create safety you wanted to reassure your son. Everything's okay. That's fantastic. Go to the next level, which is the psychological nature of what he was doing.

343
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are Teagan

344
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How does he get to drop, full stop, never having to worry about money again. What does he need in order to be able to just

345
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Play be a kid and not be concerned with that. What does he need even in the market, because this is a teaching opportunity when we're parents. It's all the time. So there we are in the market is doing this you reassure him and then what

346
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.160
Cynthia We: He wants

347
00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, Linda. Why don't you get into this his face and find out.

348
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What it would be like for you.

349
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To have to be

350
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: A

351
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your what your father.

352
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:12.210
Yeah.

353
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

354
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, really. You want it to just

355
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just going on a shopping trip because you're bored at home or you don't have a choice. This is an errand, and we can't leave. I can't be lifted home.

356
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just looking at the next bright colored cereal box because that's their down there on the low shelf so bright and pretty and they're just for me and I'm picking one up and I'm looking at him like, what about this one, this one, this one looks all good.

357
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.430
Cynthia We: would let him have those whatever snatch one

358
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.700
Cynthia We: But I'm not sure that that's the right answer.

359
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay longer that's the easy one. That's the

360
00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's using money.

361
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And thing I no

362
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Longer notice I did, I asked about

363
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: A psychological impact that that's the solution for his distress.

364
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.400
Cynthia We: Can tell me

365
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you got to get there on your own.

366
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You will. So just toggle and you oscillate between being Imagine you're in that home and maybe that's where you go to

367
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe what it's like to have been around. Was it your father, was it your mother that you had to take on an adult role. Did you ever take that on.

368
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.090
Cynthia We: No.

369
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.430
Cynthia We: I don't

370
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.380
Cynthia We: I don't think so.

371
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.700
Cynthia We: I don't think I ever had to

372
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.950
Cynthia We: I think my parents were very much adults and they never, never talked about money.

373
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this just feels like foreign just some foreign this territory.

374
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.700
Cynthia We: Completely foreign and the

375
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.360
Cynthia We: As is the attitude that goes with

376
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:20.460
Cynthia We: Talking to your parents like that. I just don't get it, because I would have been smacked spanked or

377
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.310
Cynthia We: Just allowed

378
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so I see, so it's probably this one. It's probably I won't be my parents here. I'll buy you this. So it's this off. Is this indulgent approach.

379
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really addressing issues as there's coming up because I don't want to hit smack schools. I don't want to do this. So here, everything's gonna be okay, here, here, here, let me buy stuff that seem like we're getting closer. Yeah.

380
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:59.310
Cynthia We: My parents as they got us as we got older, I bought us things as a substitute for spending time

381
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Sister

382
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.720
Cynthia We: And I have an ongoing joke that love is money.

383
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it does show up here in your marriage, but let's stay focused on Teague. And this is a pretty good one. You've got a really, really good image here.

384
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to imagine

385
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Your Teagan

386
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You've all you've been hearing in the house.

387
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Is how your mom.

388
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: cannot manage money.

389
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all you've been hearing your Teagan you're going to the store with mom and

390
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What feeling might you have a few or tea and just even drive into the store.

391
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.710
Cynthia We: Things I

392
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And what as a, what are you eight 910. How old are you, so

393
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.480
Cynthia We: Here's like a

394
00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: An eight year old. What is an eight year old know what to do with anxiety.

395
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:06.690
Cynthia We: To don't

396
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't. So let's go back to the teaching moment.

397
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to number. I said, well, we made the child feel safe as far as money goes, Look. Sweet Pea plenty of money right here. If we calculated this up together. Let's just round it up to 2246 810

398
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: There's only about $30 in here. I've got, I've got 75 so we're good. And even if we have to, I would put something back so no worries there.

399
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But you sound.

400
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Who, Who do you think you send it on giving your solution. So I'm not going to do that.

401
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.290
Cynthia We: Right, your solution.

402
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Give them to you. I'm just

403
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's better when they're kind of concluded on your own, because it's this leading up to its that this is the path I took and I got this solution, believe it or not, there's a

404
00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Spray of dope. I mean, that's going to help you remember when you you nibbled on the breadcrumbs. You found along the way on your own.

405
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I'm doing. I'm not trying to be a bitch.

406
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

407
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's good. I'll stay there in a more permanent way.

408
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When it's yours when you came to the this logic sequence on your own. So here you are, you're in the story you see your son. He now feel safe. And you can either give him everything he asked for.

409
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But is the psychological his lack of knowing what to do with this family dynamics. This family anxiety you taught him.

410
00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything in the store in this scenario.

411
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't buy him stuff.

412
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You just say accordingly. Okay.

413
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So well he did get something he got reality.

414
00:39:54.330 --> 00:40:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: He did get reality like no mom really does have money which contradicts all the yelling and the house. He does have that because you showed it in this scenario. It's like, See look, we got it. We're good.

415
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel any safer that you can go now kind of walk up and down the road and not worry about money, you feel better and maybe he says, Yes. And now parts done. But what about the anxiety on the way to the store. What about the teaching moment about that.

416
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The way he spoke to you.

417
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, not about the root word will get to the root will go to it will go to route in a minute. I'm talking about your little boy as an eight year old talking like an abusive man.

418
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.920
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's

419
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.210
Cynthia We: horrifying to me.

420
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:58.320
Cynthia We: But we're not horrifying. And I don't know. I don't know what to do about it, or I didn't know what to do about it and it's stuck with me. He's 13. This is like five years ago. I'm stuck with this image.

421
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And and even right now as I'm inviting you to sit with it. You look like you're going to

422
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:10.500
Cynthia We: Jump out of my skin because I don't know what to do. And I can't, I can't.

423
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:14.730
Cynthia We: I can't

424
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.420
Cynthia We: Change what he's heard and I can't change the dynamic between Scotland.

425
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.570
Cynthia We: I feel very afraid that

426
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.160
Cynthia We: Um,

427
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.730
Cynthia We: This is what he thinks relationships look like

428
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know I get you.

429
00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But how can you and I move and we could be doing em, Dr. Right now, instead, we're kind of doing CVT and

430
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.470
Cynthia We: That's kind of okay

431
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Though, but

432
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to point out that

433
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't sit with how Teagan feels because you're in your feelings right now.

434
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That is going to get in the way of the parent, I hear you saying you want to be.

435
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Go have what it takes you have every that's why don't spoon feed you have what it takes. It's, it's just feel

436
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What he feels for a second.

437
00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: On the drive to be with anxiety about

438
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to choose an alliance between my mom, my dad, I'm going to choose one which which 1am I to choose.

439
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.390
Cynthia We: He might be like trying to protect me from a

440
00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice angle.

441
00:42:45.690 --> 00:43:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We go. So if you if you could, right. So if I imitate that behavior I here at home. Maybe I can prevent this actually from happening when we get home. If you just are careful with money seems to be about money. So if I do it.

442
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we can prove it. Okay, perfect. Prevent mom from from this abusive behavior.

443
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Me ask you, is it so repulsive to you that that is happening in the store that you can do nothing but just

444
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But if dissociate from it.

445
00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.450
Cynthia We: Is yeah totally.

446
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember that these are the topics we talked about very early on, like, what is really happening. He's uses his height. He uses his large stature.

447
00:43:51.180 --> 00:44:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You think right and feel and know it feels to you, intimidating, you look at your son, your son gets scared and and that that in some ways it right it's abusive, but we haven't sat with it. We don't. It's like a hot potato.

448
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.160
Cynthia We: Yeah, I don't want it. It's really

449
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.210
Cynthia We: It's really not him, it's

450
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:20.280
Cynthia We: It's, it's not the same person.

451
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.460
Cynthia We: That I marry and

452
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:29.730
Cynthia We: And I'm so uncomfortable with it and I'm so

453
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.920
Cynthia We: frustrated because it's fear.

454
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.590
Cynthia We: Because he anyone do anything about it.

455
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:45.300
Okay.

456
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you were in the in the group. Right. And I was talking about radical acceptance, but this would be one of them, right, then this is happening. This is the one. When you say

457
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you are yelling at me right now it's in your head, you're thinking this is happening. I cant pretend like this isn't happening. I know my children hear this. I hate it. I don't want this to be the normal for my children. It's happening. You can't pretend like it's not it's happening.

458
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what happened in that imagery with Tegan in the end Trader Joe's was you, not in acceptance.

459
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.570
Cynthia We: Yeah, you're right.

460
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't like it doesn't match what you married tough nobody's it's there.

461
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.680
Cynthia We: It's there.

462
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's called radical acceptance. I am being yelled that

463
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.360
Cynthia We: Disrespect in a way that's not okay.

464
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And when your next move is and therefore, it isn't happening and I will pretend like it's not and I won't see the effect of my children. What has this contributed to

465
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.190
Cynthia We: More of a

466
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work.

467
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.540
Cynthia We: Doesn't work because on

468
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Our head in the sand work short term, it hasn't just like a drug does. I don't have to deal with it right now.

469
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why this stuff I talked about is hard. It's hard to do. This is happening.

470
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Will like take action that is consistent with what I believe in right now.

471
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are in acceptance. If you stop pretending like this is not happening.

472
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.510
Okay.

473
00:46:46.410 --> 00:47:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When because we only have now we only have what to do with stuff now. I mean, aside from the reprocessing techniques. But right now, when you hear yourself or someone else doing something that doesn't match this ideal of you as a quote unquote okay good mom right

474
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That one because that's the core of the core one. I'm not being a good mom right now. This isn't good mom behavior and then you go shame.

475
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you catch one of those. I'm not good mom because I'm not addressing this yelling. I'm not a good mom because I just lost my own patience with my child either one of those doesn't matter which one you're doing it stop acting like you're not

476
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard for me to say as a therapist but that's radical acceptance. It's I just lost my shit.

477
00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that I owned it. I can fix it. I rupture I repair I rupture I repair.

478
00:47:52.020 --> 00:48:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the next 24 hours which one you think is more likely to happen. You're going to rupture a communication and connection with a child.

479
00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Or Scott's gonna have a rupture and you're going to hear it, or there's something between YouTube. It's going to happen. What do you think's more likely to happen over the next 2448 hours.

480
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:19.620
Cynthia We: I'm that Scott's gonna have some explosive thing going on.

481
00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're

482
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.560
Cynthia We: either with me or with you again, it

483
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't about you.

484
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

485
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you can you kind of move between the present. It's not happening right now and going into this future where you're going to, you're going to hear escalation nearby in the house right

486
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you open to that.

487
00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.350
Yeah.

488
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.470
Cynthia We: Yeah, totally.

489
00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Not difficult

490
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now what normally you would do is it'll be fine. You use probably rationalization and minimization is your coping skill.

491
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We all do it. That's how I know how to name it right but if you didn't

492
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If instead you said this is happening. And this is not acceptable.

493
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This does not work for me.

494
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what action can be taken that matches you get to still use all the skills that maybe you learned in here from other therapists or self help writing and journaling and books and all these fancy things

495
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Were before you did not sit with the truth of the matter, what is happening. He just is not okay.

496
00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.610
Cynthia We: Really, stop it.

497
00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:00.900
Oh,

498
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:11.340
Cynthia We: Wait, I hear the escalation. I could actually instead of hiding

499
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.840
Cynthia We: I could actually go walk towards it.

500
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's it. So as soon as it registers, you're walking towards it. Now you're going to need to remember all this stuff about belly breathing mantra safe place in your little greenhouse, you're going to need all of this imagery because you have a lot of time and investment put into hiding

501
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot more comfortable for you then walking towards danger, you're going to need to have to remind the body.

502
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're okay. And I actually don't know if you are. That's the truth. Because remember, I'm always wondering, is this a domestic violence situation. Remember I told you that I'm always kind of way in the background, wondering

503
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm always kind of like it's but i want i told you it's back there. I'm always wondering, so I

504
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Never wear

505
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.060
Cynthia We: I don't feel

506
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:07.800
Cynthia We: That when he's angry, I feel scared, but I

507
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:19.320
Cynthia We: He's been talking a lot lately about, well, I've never, I've never hit any. So how can you be scared me.

508
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so leave that I

509
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:23.250
Was

510
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to get you. Do you believe that for the most part. So, this

511
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:29.550
Cynthia We: This will most probably that yeah

512
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So for the most part. So, this you notice how you said I could walk toward it.

513
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:36.150
Cynthia We: Yeah.

514
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's it. That's all you need. While you're walking toward it.

515
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be us acceptance. Again, these are these are great tools we use them like back to back every five seconds every two seconds over and over and over. I accept that I'm scared right now. I accept that I don't know what's about to happen.

516
00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that if I stay at all, my gosh, I feel so tight. Oh, I can barely breathe. Okay, I accept that.

517
00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And I better take care of it. Notice that it's another opportunity. Use a skill I better do some breathing. Before I enter this room before I address this loud voice.

518
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I need my whole brain working on only part of its working on completely consumed with fear. In fact, I can't even think straight. What the f. Am I gonna say, I'm gonna say if I walk in the room. No, I'm not ready. That's acceptance. So I sit there and I regulate

519
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there actual dangerous, you can. It is he hitting me is my child in danger know there's just perceived threat just just

520
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, now I don't know you're going to have to weigh that

521
00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.650
Cynthia We: really believe that I just believe that

522
00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.530
Cynthia We: Somebody has to call

523
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's you, and

524
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.340
Cynthia We: As somebody, it might might

525
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.420
Cynthia We: Help for taking

526
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're in actual yeah

527
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This we have four minutes this point, you've already walked, you're in the hall, you accept a loud voice you accept that you are anxious, you feel the tight chest you do the breathing.

528
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to this greenhouse

529
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And your heart rate starts to change it starts to go down your breath loosens up and then you remember what this is where the core belief comes in. This has to do with why are you walking or that as

530
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:33.420
Cynthia We: A good mom.

531
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a good mom. There we go. I'm, I'm a mama, not even good, bad, I'm a mama. And that's it.

532
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth gets settled in even more and you accept that a lot of things a lot of things, but right now it's mama bear time even right it's it's it's time take

533
00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:52.500
Your

534
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Time to protect

535
00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

536
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot is going to happen between right then and how you deliver that. But the, the likelihood that it's going to be received. If you are not in actual bear mode is so much higher. If instead it's Scott. I know you're talking about something really important

537
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is about what's going on, sweetie. Can I just talk to you for two minutes and we'll come right back in here. It is really important that we talk

538
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Now something. I don't know if that's the recipe but something

539
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:39.240
Cynthia We: calmness and without getting

540
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.780
Cynthia We: Wrapped up in yelling, I think is important.

541
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I talk to you for a minute. I know you're doing something really important. And can I talk to you for a minute.

542
00:54:52.080 --> 00:55:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Not you're getting angry loudly guaranteed and none of those no blaming NO SHAMING just talk to you for a minute. It's really important.

543
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just keep repeating it.

544
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: This is this is important. This is clearly can kind of see it's important for all of us right now and just, just keep repeating it. What's happening for all of us right now is really important and kind of talk to you for just a minute.

545
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Until he feel safe enough to turn his attention away from because he's being probably in his mind, a good daddy.

546
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So you're about to pull him away from a really core value which is get your homework done. Do what you're told. And so to pull him away from that. Just like pulling you away from one of those would be very difficult ones for Ron locked on that role.

547
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So being able to say it out loud, I'm you know you're you're making sure your, you know, that tetons doing what he needs to do connect talk to you for just a minute.

548
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll come right back in. I know how important this is.

549
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

550
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:05.310
Cynthia We: I can do that.

551
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:06.240
Okay.

552
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I make it look easy.

553
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.290
Cynthia We: I know you do. But it's okay because I've got the image in my mind of using

554
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.540
Cynthia We: Okay, Glenn.

555
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:22.500
Cynthia We: Calmly

556
00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:24.900
Cynthia We: It's good. Hey,

557
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But look at how many steps and that that's there still

558
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how many and that's not you know that all the work that goes in and having walked in the room yet like there's all these head out of my, you know what, and it's like, Okay. Nope, I accept this is happening.

559
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I tried the other way. I tried. I tried it for years that just doing the right thing will work. Now I'm going to take care of myself. I'm going to get regularly and use my brain.

560
00:56:55.350 --> 00:57:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a good momma. I'm a mom, I'ma go to the mama thing is, is what Mama's do I'm gonna connect with my husband. We both care about our children deeply, let me connect with him on that level, I gotta go.

561
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:09.150
