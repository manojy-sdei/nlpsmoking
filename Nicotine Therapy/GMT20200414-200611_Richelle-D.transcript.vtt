00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:23.250

41
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:40.470
Richelle Direny: And we noticed like even going into the second month, like a month or two of you being consistent with group you're an active participant whatever we have our sessions were meeting and what have you.

42
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.630
Richelle Direny: And then then moving over to a month.

43
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:50.220

48
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:32.340
Richelle Direny: Very early just to make sure I know that they, they say, you know, to check in really early. It's kind of hit or miss. Sometimes you check in and you're there like early and other times. I'm your, you know, it's

49
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.080
Richelle Direny: taking forever to get in.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:50.340
april carte: You know they have other things going on, you know, there's like a million patients. So I tried to check in a little early. That way I can make my appointment on time.

67
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.890
Richelle Direny: Natalie know

68
00:07:50.910 --> 00:08:07.530
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, but if I noticed, like, you know, the consistency. Then, you know, then the, the, the medication will get bridged or however they decided to handle it. Um, and, you know, anything that is said over you know it's a recorded session. It is confidential.

69
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:17.280
Richelle Direny: However, you know, if you say anything or mentioned anything that seems to be a threat to yourself for authors or anything like that, you know,

70
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.490
Richelle Direny: Confidentiality kind of goes out the door at that point. Got it.

71
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.760
Richelle Direny: Got it. Alright. So in any case,

72
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.790
Richelle Direny: How did you hear about bring her

73
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.280
april carte: A friend of mine.

74
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.030
april carte: His name's Paul

75
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.470
april carte: Mm hmm. And he told me about it because

76
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.360
april carte: I asked him what because I already knew that he was in a program

77
00:08:43.710 --> 00:09:01.530
april carte: And I asked him about it. And he's like, it's a really good program. You don't have to go to the doctor, you know, everything's through video chat, it's confidential. They have counselors, so I got the phone number from him and then contacted her

78
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.440
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

79
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.070
april carte: Baby. Yeah.

80
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.460
Now,

81
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:24.720
Richelle Direny: HOW LONG LIKE IF JUST GIVE ME A look a little bit history about when you, you know, kind of, when you started. What was your drug of choice. Like, when did the

82
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.750
april carte: Well, I was

83
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.070
april carte: Percocet and it's actually been about

84
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:53.550
april carte: Well I dabbled with them a little as a teenager, but it never got to the point of an addiction, but about two years ago, I started taking them more often.

85
00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:07.140
april carte: And then eventually every day because I was a waitress. I was making money every day I was helping with my back pain leg pain. You know, I was on my feet 1314 hours a night.

86
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.860
april carte: So I started taking them more consistently.

87
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:20.070
april carte: And, you know, eventually I had to have them. I had became you know addicted.

88
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.310
april carte: So that's when I started

89
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.960
april carte: You know, seeking them on everyday basis.

90
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.170
Richelle Direny: And you said it was about. It started off with back pain.

91
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.090
april carte: Yes.

92
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.990
april carte: And how

93
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.180
april carte: Are you I'm

94
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.250
april carte: 30

95
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:40.800
april carte: So,

96
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.130
april carte: It was

97
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.310
Richelle Direny: Kind of an exposure to any drug or anything like that started at the age of 30

98
00:10:48.570 --> 00:11:00.750
april carte: No no no no no I dabbled with the pain pills. The Percocet. When I was a teenager, you know, on and off. But it was never an everyday thing.

99
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.250
april carte: And so it got

100
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.020
About 30

101
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:05.460
Richelle Direny: Oh, yeah.

102
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.030
Richelle Direny: That's all I can say that addiction started

103
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:10.560
april carte: Yeah.

104
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.400
Richelle Direny: Now, and so, no.

105
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.370
Richelle Direny: Dependency to alcohol or anything outside of the the pills.

106
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:20.940
Man.

107
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.130
Richelle Direny: Have you ever

108
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.500
Richelle Direny: Heard, have you ever been into treatment outside of Bihar.

109
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.010
No.

110
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.420
Richelle Direny: No.

111
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.260
Richelle Direny: So this is your first time ever, attempting to say, you know, like you say to yourself, Okay, I kind of need to

112
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.410
Richelle Direny: You need to address the addiction to the end. What made you come to that place where

113
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.580
Richelle Direny: You said that

114
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.650
Richelle Direny: You know what I need to address this.

115
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.460
Richelle Direny: I need to work.

116
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:54.810
april carte: On because like I said before, I was, you know, doing them on and off. I could stop at any time.

117
00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.430
april carte: This time I couldn't just stop.

118
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:22.170
april carte: I had to have if I did not have it. I was sick. I couldn't go to work. I couldn't get out the bed. So that's what I said. I have a problem. And unfortunately, it took me a good. I'd say six more months until I sought out help for the problem. So I been knew that I've had a problem.

119
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.060
april carte: You know, I just didn't get help until later on down the line.

120
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.590
april carte: Because I didn't want to. You have to want to win. I didn't want you

121
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.330
Richelle Direny: And that's what I was asking like, what was that turning point. What was that moment where you're like, Okay.

122
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.840
Richelle Direny: Like, I really like what happened. Okay, made it

123
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:57.210
april carte: To be honest, um, the money part was never an issue. I always had my money form and money for everything else. And when it came to the point where I was spending more money on those as opposed to things that me and my family needed

124
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:15.720
april carte: Then I said, You know what, this has got to change. I'm tired of waking up sick for one tired of spending, you know, half most of my money on them. I'm tired of being dependent on something, you know, I didn't want. I didn't want to do it anymore. You know, it just

125
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.610
april carte: Literally, one day I woke up and said, I don't want to do this anymore.

126
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:29.070
april carte: And I'm sure there was more leading up to that point. But honestly I just I got tired of it.

127
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:43.020
april carte: I had tired of having to depend on him. I got tired of spending my money on it. I got tired of being addicted and I wanted to change. At that point, I actually wanted to. And I think that's

128
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.780
april carte: You have to want to, you have to

129
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.760
Very true.

130
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.040
Richelle Direny: Any, any journey starts with you wanting to start the

131
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.810
Richelle Direny: Journey. You don't look like a

132
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.600
Richelle Direny: Good idea. You have to want to

133
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.660
april carte: You have to be and I wanted to show

134
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.080
april carte: So that's when I talked to, you know, my friend.

135
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:10.830
april carte: And he gave me the phone number. And that's what I started mom.

136
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.900
april carte: So that's when I started

137
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.150
april carte: And I'm happy that I did.

138
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.010
april carte: You know, I'm very happy. I feel like

139
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.430
april carte: You know I'm in control. Now,

140
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:36.690
april carte: I feel like I'm not controlled by the addiction anymore. And that's exactly what I wanted to not be controlled by it.

141
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:41.640
Richelle Direny: In

142
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.020
Richelle Direny: Yes.

143
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.950

april carte: When I had my first son it shipped a piece off my spine.

372
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.750
Richelle Direny: Medical standpoint you live.

373
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:17.550
Your life.

374
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:19.590
Richelle Direny: Where you will

375
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.720
Richelle Direny: Type of medication.

376
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:32.940
april carte: For the, for the chip piece off my spine. I actually went to physical therapy for that and sciatica, but they said, I'm always gonna have some degree of pain.

377
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:39.210
Richelle Direny: And with with me on the Suboxone to be done and

378
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.770
april carte: It helps

379
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.100
april carte: But I still take Tylenol as well.

380
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:51.810
Richelle Direny: So then

381
00:31:52.860 --> 00:32:01.560
Richelle Direny: So goal would be, I mean, yes, you would want to at some point off of, you know, every medication that's what you're saying. Your goal is, but then for really

382
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:07.320
Richelle Direny: pinpoint what you're saying. I mean, from a medical standpoint, you're saying that you were told cause of

383
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:19.800
Richelle Direny: You know the sciatica, and all of the nerve pains or whatever you're having, you're always going to be some degree of pain. So then front of from a medical standpoint, they're saying that that will never go away. So you will always have to

384
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:25.380
Richelle Direny: Dependent on so so then it is

385
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.110
Richelle Direny: What is it that you can work on

386
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.200
Richelle Direny: From a physical standpoint, holistically.

387
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:39.450
Richelle Direny: That you can you do to not necessarily completely come off of the medication, but to decrease the amount that you're dependent upon

388
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.880
april carte: Well, I could lose weight.

389
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:50.280
april carte: There are certain exercises that I could do, of course, I hadn't lost that one pound.

390
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.890
Richelle Direny: Have not lost that one power.

391
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.850
april carte: Lot one. No.

392
00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:55.890
Richelle Direny: I can tell you right now being

393
00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.920
Richelle Direny: Important. You might not lose one you might gain five

394
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.990
april carte: That's what I'm saying. Yeah, it's hard for me because I love food. I've always loved food.

395
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.970
april carte: Um, you know, even when I had my addiction. I still never lost any weight because I like to eat.

396
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:19.590
april carte: Um, so, um, they said if I lost about 80 pounds, which is a lot that it will take a lot of pressure.

397
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:23.760
april carte: It will take their articles.

398
00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:31.890
Richelle Direny: And so what we can do in our next session because then it's looking at real, okay, I'm a realistic standpoint. What exactly

399
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:44.910
Richelle Direny: My when you say a lot of it comes from pain. So then, okay, well, the doctor saying that you're always going to be on some pain medication because of this medical underlining medical condition that you have that cannot be

400
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.590
Richelle Direny: You know you can stitch it away, or you can use it away. It's

401
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.490
Richelle Direny: Something that you can only just can learn to cope with.

402
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:54.390
Yeah.

403
00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.920
Richelle Direny: So then our plan will then be it's

404
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.360
Richelle Direny: Tapping

405
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:01.140
april carte: Into

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.220
april carte: From

408
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:21.360
Richelle Direny: A nutrition standpoint, nutritious standpoint, like working through and making goals related to your nutrition your daily activities and maybe this is a goal that

409
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.260
Richelle Direny: We're trying to get

410
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:23.760
april carte: Yeah.

411
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.340
Richelle Direny: I know it's hard.

412
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:42.360
Richelle Direny: So we'll walk every day for 30 minutes if you can, if it means putting the kids in the stroller go and walking on so those things. So we could get a little bit more in that because then you will realize

413
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:42.690
april carte: That

414
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:49.470
Richelle Direny: You know, you think like okay well I don't need counseling and there's something wrong with me in other areas, but then

415
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:51.750
Richelle Direny: You'll realize, you know, it's hard.

416
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.010
When you think about

417
00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.670
Richelle Direny: So my kid just turned up the senior heard the house the vibrating eat.

418
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:01.410

422
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.680
Richelle Direny: And so what's stopping us from doing that. Oh, I want

423
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:33.120

427
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.560

431
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.990

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:29.820
Richelle Direny: And the reality is when you go grocery shopping. What's the cheapest

440
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:30.360
