00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.940
iPhone: Got a lot, actually, um, I

8
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.360
iPhone: Well, my ex.

9
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.460
iPhone: I went to court. A couple weeks ago and my ex.

10
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:35.370
iPhone: Got 50 well not 50% capacity just yet but you basically GOT CUSTODY OF MY SON. For the first time in four and a half years. So it's been been hard.

11
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:46.800
iPhone: You know the actually he's there with him right now I go and pick him up at like 715 after my meeting, but um but yeah

12
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.670
iPhone: So, and yeah.

13
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.270
Shawn Phalen: When, when we last spoke, you were in the process. I think you just done a paternity test.

14
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.900
iPhone: You are in the process of getting all that stuff rolling. So now, so now he won't have to pay child support.

15
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.780
iPhone: So it, I kind of feel like

16
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:20.130
iPhone: I don't know, it's, I guess it's better. I like the last few days of it better than they were the first week you know i was i was a mess, you know,

17
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.030
iPhone: And I want my son to know his dad you know that's not the issue. The issue is

18
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.130
iPhone: Just all the things that he has said to my daughter. Over the years, you know, my daughter seven I don't want him doing that to mission, you know,

19
00:02:39.510 --> 00:03:00.750
iPhone: The good thing is, is you know because I've had my senses birth just him and I we my son's very loyal to me know and his dad's not going to be able to come in and talk bad about me. You know, he already proved it last week, I think it was the first time that he was taking him.

20
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.840
iPhone: You know, he was getting them in the car seat and there were on the driver side.

21
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.950
iPhone: And the back passion or the, you know, back door and the driver side and I was on the passenger side, given my, my daughter kiss.

22
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:32.160
iPhone: And he was trying to reach around and Buckle My son in and couldn't see the buck the belt buckle and he said to my daughter. Hey, why don't you help me out. You knucklehead. Well, my son, but he was calling in knucklehead. And my son goes, Hey, don't call my mom and knucklehead.

23
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.780
iPhone: So it was a good feeling to know like, you know,

24
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.940
iPhone: So where's loyalty there with my son. And so, you know, I know. Like the first five years are the most important

25
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.050
iPhone: And so I'm you know and things have actually not been bad between him and I it's kind of weird.

26
00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:04.320
iPhone: You know, I was devastated when I left court. I don't think I've ever cried so hard on my life I had to pull over and side of the road, I cried so hard. I couldn't see eyes were swollen shut the next morning, because I cried so hard.

27
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.540
iPhone: But

28
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.220
iPhone: You know I everyone told me that there's no way the judge is going to give him 5050. No, he doesn't know one like he you know there's no way

29
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.440
iPhone: There's a way

30
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.850
iPhone: Because he did

31
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.910
iPhone: In California, the courts really do 5050 they're just really

32
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.420
iPhone: Know it

33
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.950
iPhone: Yeah, you know, he had a he had an attorney, and I didn't and I you know I felt very alone that day, you know, and I just felt like

34
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.100
iPhone: You know, I even said to the judge when they called us up there, you know, he asked me what I would know what is it, but I wanted, you know, and

35
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:59.100
iPhone: It was like the first time that I didn't know what to say, you know, and I in the courtrooms filled, you know, with other cases, waiting to be seen and I

36
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.820
iPhone: Might just stood there was probably like I felt like 10 minutes but it's probably a good solid

37
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:18.660
iPhone: 45 seconds and it was silent in the courtroom and I did not know what to say. And in fact, I started crying and you never pride in court ever even when I want to, like, I'm always able to hold us together.

38
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:30.210
iPhone: You know, and I started crying and I looked at the judge. And I said, Your Honor. I feel completely lost when I told him, you know, I said, I don't know. And, you know, and then I made a comment about

39
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.890
iPhone: You know, my son, and then, you know, then the judge embarrass me because it's not just my son. It's our son.

40
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.800
iPhone: But he's never been in his life, even though I'm trying to tell them all along. He was a daddy. You know, he

41
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.420
iPhone: So, you know, it's not, I'm not used to saying our son, you know. And so he said, you know, Mrs. Bullock. I need to stop you right there.

42
00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:06.450
iPhone: You know, it's not, it's no longer your son. You know, you need to change the way you say that are, you know, and so, but it was, um, you know, it is what it is I you know I obviously in front of my kids I don't act sad, you know,

43
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:21.300
iPhone: I try to, you know, be happy for them and excited. You know, you're going to go to your dad, you're gonna have fun and, you know, and then when they leave a breakdown, you know, but I don't do it in front of them. So great, you know,

44
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.580
iPhone: But that's that. Okay.

45
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.960
So,

46
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.170
Shawn Phalen: You seem like you're doing well, though, like

47
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:41.460
iPhone: I am I, you know, works really good, you know, I, you know, I'm things are a little bit better between me and my step daughter and

48
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:55.200
iPhone: It, you know, it went way down hill for a minute, like worse than when I talked to you, you know, she went to school, making claims that I was abusing her CPS got involved the police showed up at my door.

49
00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:05.460
iPhone: You know, and then I ended up calling the principal that day, you know, basically, to tell my side, you know, she's definitely not being overused.

50
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:15.750
iPhone: And, you know, took about a week, I think, was like Thanksgiving break happened and then when when they got back the principal eventually called me.

51
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.700
iPhone: I was at work, but I answered it. And we talked for 45 minutes, you know,

52
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.850
iPhone: And she was happy because obviously, you know, they only hear the child side, you know, and

53
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.980
iPhone: You know, so now the principles aware of what's going on and you know

54
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.990
iPhone: You know, but it got really bad at times, you know, but it seems to be a little better because

55
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.850
iPhone: The school

56
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.460
Shawn Phalen: So she went into the principal's office.

57
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:58.860
iPhone: So that I stuff that I suffocated her suffocating her all kinds of shit, all kinds of stuff, you know, and I told that, you know, I was very honest with the police. I had to office to show up at my door. It was a Friday.

58
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.620
iPhone: I just gotten back from taking my kids to see Toy Story for

59
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.150
iPhone: And

60
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.580
iPhone: My while we were only back to maybe 20 minutes and you know I got a call.

61
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:28.860
iPhone: I mean, they showed up. So they were here for like 30 minutes or so. And, you know, and I was honest, you know, I mean, I think what happened was, she had her grandmother had bought her a recorder. A little handheld recorder.

62
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.200
iPhone: And that morning.

63
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.990
iPhone: You know she

64
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.960
iPhone: She really knows how to push your buttons.

65
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.790
iPhone: And

66
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:55.200
iPhone: Long story short, she ended up recording me okay and and it didn't make me look very good. You know, I'm human, right, because sometimes you know I know I shouldn't cut up the kids, you know, but when they get so angry sometimes I do what you know. And I did that day.

67
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:02.010
iPhone: On recordings, and she took it and played it for the principal. That's how you know

68
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:11.820
iPhone: And I know it doesn't make me look very good. And, you know, and I even told the officer because office. Please hurt it to, you know, I mean, it wasn't like nothing abusive on the recording it just

69
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:18.090
iPhone: You know, if you didn't know me and didn't know the situation, you know, an outsider just listening to it.

70
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.580
iPhone: Would be like, you know, but they also didn't know the whole hour that led up to that recording

71
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:40.410
iPhone: The bunch of stuff. She wasn't listening. She's back talking. She wouldn't get ready for school. I mean, I'm like running late. You know, and so long story short, she went to the recorder. Oh it after she did it. That was she after she recorded me and I didn't know she was recorded me, she said.

72
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:48.840
iPhone: After whatever I said, whatever. I said, because she pulled it out. She's thank you got what I needed. What she said to me.

73
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:58.890
iPhone: You know and I you know I probably should have taken, taken it but it's like, you know, you know, I didn't think she'd go and play it for the principal but whatever, it doesn't matter. You know, it is what it is.

74
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.950
iPhone: You know, she got in trouble, she was, she was grounded. You know, you don't you don't go and do that like you're on somebody's life you know

75
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.500
Shawn Phalen: Right in hers in, you know,

76
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:28.200
iPhone: What's funny is I just called child protective services, the day before on my ex, and then the very next day they get called on me. I was pissed. I was really angry but you know we've been able to work through that, you know, she's

77
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:39.090
iPhone: It's better you know she went to her. Her mom's in Washington on Christmas break, and ever since she's been back you know we haven't had any

78
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.560
iPhone: Big you know anything. It's been pretty

79
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:55.020
iPhone: You know, I think she may be realizes I you know I don't know I don't really know. You know, I'm trying to, I'm still working through the issues I have with her, you know,

80
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.030
iPhone: But it is better.

81
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.830
Shawn Phalen: What does her dad say

82
00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.850
About

83
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:10.230
iPhone: The OH HE WILL HE WAS PASSING what happened was is when I had dropped her off because I take her to school every day that morning after she had said, you know, thank you got what they wanted.

84
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:23.850
iPhone: And when I was driving her to school, she said as she was getting out of the car. She says, I'm going to break you up. I'm going to break you in my data just like I did. Sam his ex girlfriend.

85
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:32.340
iPhone: And I just kind of laugh us a tailor she should not break up your dad and Sam and she's oh yeah I did and she said something along the lines of, I acted

86
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:43.140
iPhone: You know I acted so crazy that you know that it made her so crazy or angry or something. And she ended up, you know, leaving her dad or something like that.

87
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:52.110
iPhone: And I said, Well, if that's what you can have beliefs and that's fine. But that's not the case. Like, and so when after school, he wouldn't picked her up.

88
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.720
iPhone: And I because she was going to drive out to her grandma's house for the weekend. And I said, no, you need to bring her home.

89
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:08.490
iPhone: Because at this point she hadn't seen her since the police showed up. She didn't know. I didn't even know if she knew the police was showing up. But she did talk to the police, and she knows, you know, the police showed up at the school and talk to her, and

90
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:20.370
iPhone: But then she tried to deny saying that I never said that. I said, You didn't tell me you treat your to try to break me and your debit. She's like, no, you know, and my end. He looked at her. He goes, Taylor, you

91
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:26.040
iPhone: You said that to me before. So he knew that she had said that there's no way you mean so she's

92
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:37.110
iPhone: You know she lives a lot. She still does. You know, like you'll ask her a question even something so stupid as and did you wash your hair. Yes. And I'll be like Taylor.

93
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:46.020
iPhone: Did you and then she'll go okay but it's hurting first initial thing is to just immediately lie about everything. It doesn't matter what it is, it could be the stupidest thing.

94
00:12:46.500 --> 00:13:04.140
iPhone: You know, the stupid things. But it's like a, you know, and so then she had a little hiccup at school. Last week, the principal called me again about something that, you know, the kids. So Taylor said about a little girl who has she has scoliosis, and she has to wear a brace.

95
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:17.400
iPhone: And the principal had gone in to all the sixth grade classes and spoke basically to educate the students that they were going to have a student that come into the school.

96
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.020
iPhone: That was a bracelet back race. You know, it's like a full BACK BRACE you know

97
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:30.720
iPhone: And basically, you know, explain to it like it's it's a disability, you would make fun of somebody in a wheelchair. You wouldn't make somebody you know

98
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:41.520
iPhone: And so when Taylor said something about you know your brace girl or ugly brace girl or something like that, you know, she

99
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:51.120
iPhone: She got attention for two or three days, you know, she denied saying that, you know, I don't know if she does or not. So the principal called to tell me you know that you need to

100
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.370
iPhone: You know if she comes into school tomorrow and admits to what she said she won't have the attention again.

101
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:11.880
iPhone: But if she doesn't, she's going to have another day full in house different or detention and then Monday, she comes back, it'll be business as usual. And she she said that she didn't say it, you know, and so she had the tension, you know,

102
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:20.730
iPhone: But it's nice that the principal and I have been able to talk. And so we kind of know you know she knows kind of what's going on and

103
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.250
Shawn Phalen: Yes, she sees the, you know, she sees

104
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:39.420
Shawn Phalen: Her manipulation and her his attention getting you know that's what she's, she's acting now because she wants attention and

105
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:46.770
iPhone: She's 11 she's probably pretty advanced for 11 years old, you know, surely 12 next month so

106
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.570
Shawn Phalen: So you're entering that health stage.

107
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.850
iPhone: I know

108
00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:07.320
iPhone: I know I know she hasn't even started appearing jack. Oh my god. When she starts a period is the hormones. Yeah, I'm not looking forward to it you know and i i'm hoping

109
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:17.910
iPhone: And maybe I mean to say this, you know, but I'm hoping that you know I know she wants to really go live with her mom. Yeah, I was gonna we yeah

110
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.490
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, we had kind of talked about that.

111
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.480
Shawn Phalen: It, you know, in the past.

112
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:31.140
iPhone: I kind of addressed it as she probably feels some abandonment issues and Taylor.

113
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:38.400
Shawn Phalen: And that she's probably really missing her mom because she didn't get to really say goodbye to her right was

114
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.740
iPhone: Not, I mean, not, not really, you know, not

115
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.470
iPhone: Busy her mom was close at all, which is what what's kind of weird like

116
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:58.680
iPhone: You know, I mean the sheet call it had CPS called her and her mom to for choking her her long good choker. You know, so

117
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:13.500
iPhone: I don't know i i think that she just doesn't like me. And so she. This isn't one live here. And so anywhere else is better than here, you know, but you know the way my boyfriend looks at it is, we kind of feel like

118
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:23.940
iPhone: If we let her go now. Right. Eventually, you know, he's afraid she's gonna come back pregnant or, you know, but if we let her go now.

119
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:33.660
iPhone: And she moves out to Washington with her mom, you know, he's almost certainly not going to work out, you know, and then in the beginning, it's fresh and it's new.

120
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:41.880
iPhone: But when things start to get settled down, you know, she's going to hate her mom or not, you know, and then her mom's not going to be able to handle her

121
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:48.810
iPhone: So her mom's going to end up kicking her back. And by then, you know, at least now we have some control over.

122
00:16:49.590 --> 00:17:03.990
iPhone: You know she leaves for two or three years and comes back when she's 15 then is there was going to have a nightmare jail with, you know, but then it's like, I don't know. I'm hoping you know I guess hit her mom was talking about maybe moving back from Washington.

123
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:12.750
iPhone: And if she does. And she can absolutely go looking you live with her, she'll be closing. I mean, he won't feel like he lost his only daughter.

124
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.830
iPhone: You know,

125
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:25.530

126
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:36.600
iPhone: Getting to the age where you can't be sharing a room, but I don't want my seven year old sharing a room with her because I feel like that dynamic is way too old for my daughter.

127
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:44.010
iPhone: You know, say, I mean, I mean it's selfish that I want her to move out. So my kids can have their own room and you know

128
00:17:46.080 --> 00:18:01.320
iPhone: It's just been, you know, I mean, it's been a struggle. Right. You know, it's been, you know, you guys. It hasn't been easy. You know, we talked about that before like blending families and and you know it's

129
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:09.000

130
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:20.550

iPhone: So, I mean, I know you guys have had some ups and downs, for sure.

133
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:42.330
iPhone: And what's crazy is her her dad and I, uh, he's so good to me. Like, I can't even tell you he could not be better. You could not be better to me, he's he's, he respects me.

134
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:53.610
iPhone: He's just very good to me. And we him. And I was like, we've been together just hit two years and on January 19 now we've never had a fight.

135
00:18:54.090 --> 00:19:02.550
iPhone: With never it's like we get along so good. The only issue that we have and the only time to him and I have argued, was because of his daughter, you know,

136
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:11.850
iPhone: And he knows that, you know, we talked about that. It's like if you know. And so, and he knows how difficult. She can be and how disrespectful and she is

137
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:19.740
iPhone: You know, and I told her, I said it's not what you say to meet your tone of voice, you know, it's okay to relieve an errand for two minutes and you're like, Okay.

138
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:27.840
iPhone: And because I like patients. Now the sets me off, which is when I'm like why why do you have to say it like that. Just say okay

139
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:36.990
iPhone: It's everything's like long and drawn out. Okay, I know I you know and and because it's gone on for so many months I

140
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:48.180
iPhone: It could be the smallest thing, but in the immediately just it really gets to me, you know, and so I'm really struggling because I, you know, I've got

141
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:55.500
iPhone: A lot of depression lately with, you know, just with a lot of stuff and you know like a part of me probably should be back on medication and

142
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.150
iPhone: And then I find out last week or the week before that.

143
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:18.090
iPhone: med Mark who basically I have a grant through they're paying for all my services, my prescription. They're changing things, and as far as I know, on Friday because I have another week of meds medicine.

144
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.090
iPhone: They're not covering my medicine anymore.

145
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.330
iPhone: And so I so I'm really anxious and

146
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:41.940
iPhone: I'm really anxious and like nervous and scared and that if they don't make. I don't know how much it's going to be, but I can't afford $300 prescription or I mean I can't

147
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:49.410
iPhone: I can't afford to go to group every Wednesday night like I have been, you know, I go every Wednesday night religiously for six months now, you know,

148
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:59.160

iPhone: And so I'm really nervous. Like I I'm trying to think about it. But, you know, Friday's four days away. I'll be out of medicine by Friday night, you know, and

151
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:28.320
iPhone: You know, I don't think it's the best thing to try to quit cold turkey like that you know i'm i'm on three strips today, you know, and

152
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.900
iPhone: You know, I haven't had any relapses at all, you know,

153
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.040
iPhone: till June 29th was my last time I used to pill.

154
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:47.160
iPhone: You know, I don't. And I don't want to even think think that way, you know, if I can't get so I'm I feel

155
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:57.570
iPhone: A panic and I feel panic, you know. So tomorrow I'm going to call okay pharmacy. They said that, I guess I have to go see one of their doctors now and I know that

156
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:04.920
iPhone: Bright heart I think takes my insurance because I do have insurance. So if worse comes to worse.

157
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.250
iPhone: You know, it's very important to me to continue to see you. So I want to continue, get on a regular schedule with you.

158
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:21.870
iPhone: Very important that I continue my relapse prevention. Right. I really like it. I really, you know, I don't always like doing it on, you know, it's like, oh, I'm tired, you know,

159
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:34.440
iPhone: But when I do it, I feel good. Every time. So it's like, you know, I want to continue these things, but I don't know if I'll be able to afford it. So I'm just, that's kind of where I'm at, with that and i'm i'm panic that it's

160
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:40.920
iPhone: They don't cover me. It's like, I don't know if I can continue to afford expensive, you know,

161
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.960
Shawn Phalen: So do you have

162
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.470
Shawn Phalen: So what is your insurance, you said you haven't

163
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:53.910
iPhone: You United Healthcare. I have a PPO. Okay, so why don't you cooperate hurt and have them switch it over.

164
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.240
Shawn Phalen: To United Healthcare

165
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:08.040
iPhone: I mean if if I will have to if they don't. So tomorrow I'm going to call the pharmacy called me and they're the ones that told me, like, you know, because

166
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:19.320
iPhone: The pharmacy that goes through is called mercury pharmacy. They have a contract with med mark. So a lot of the night. Mark patient go. Is there only open Monday to Friday. It's a small pharmacy.

167
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:34.860
iPhone: She's the one that called me and said you know that the I need to see one of their doctors in order for them to continue. So I don't know, I just, and then when when I was called and told that I think I had court. The following day.

168
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:48.390
iPhone: So I told her I would call her after Court and Court happen and I was a mess for a week and then I just kind of been procrastinating, you know, and so you know tomorrow after work, I'm off Wednesday, this week.

169
00:23:50.070 --> 00:24:02.190
iPhone: You know, I'll call tomorrow, and I'll see if I can schedule an appointment with one of the MED Mark doctors and to see because it would be nice to have them continue pain. I haven't paid opinion, six months. It's been awesome. You know,

170
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:10.800
Shawn Phalen: Because you don't you don't want to be without that soapbox and because you'll start to feel no not well.

171
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.690
iPhone: Well, I mean, if I have to pay for outright like yeah

172
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.220
iPhone: You know,

173
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.870
iPhone: I mean, I might not be able to pay for a month supply, because that's what I've been getting because I've been going to group every Wednesday.

174
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:31.680
iPhone: I they give me a month prescription. Now, you know, because I'm trustworthy. I guess is what they say.

175
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:46.410
iPhone: You know, but if you know I don't know. I have no idea how much it costs, I don't know anything. So also, I'm going to call them pharmacy tomorrow. She says her get together a list of doctors that I could see in the area make appointment and then just kind of go from there.

176
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.740
Shawn Phalen: But how long do you think it'll take to get in to see a doctor.

177
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.270
iPhone: I have no idea.

178
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.340
iPhone: I mean, I could

179
00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.550
iPhone: I'm a book called bright heart tomorrow because if I would, I don't want to happen is for them to switch everything on my insurance.

180
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:13.440
iPhone: med mark, find out about it right then they say, oh, well, they were just, you know, and kind of wash their hands at me and not and not I want to still try to get with, you know, to have them.

181
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.300
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so what you need to do is call bright heart and explain what's going on.

182
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:30.270
Shawn Phalen: Because it might take you, depending on how busy based doctors are it might take you a week or two to get into see one of them. So you can't have

183
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:42.540
Shawn Phalen: We cannot have that laughs you know without taking the Suboxone so just explain what's going on to them and then see what they say. So just something

184
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:53.880
iPhone: To everybody's on the same page that makes her or call on Wednesday when it whenever you have time, you know, and just make sure that they know what's going on. Okay.

185
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.910
Cuz you want to get that taken care

186
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:04.470
iPhone: I should have already done it. I don't know what the heck I'm waiting for you. I just have been through so much and going on and

187
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:16.380
iPhone: I don't know, I've been sleeping a lot, you know, on my days off. I have been sleeping a lot less I know when you know when I could suppress my sleep and then I haven't. No, I haven't called

188
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:24.720
iPhone: A everyone in my family. I haven't really talked to anybody. Since court, it's been, I had to go ahead court on

189
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.430
iPhone: The 19th of January. So it's been like three weeks and

190
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:40.350
iPhone: You know, I'm sure my family. At this point, may I don't know if they think I've relapsed or none of my family knows I'm on Suboxone you know only my mom, my real mom.

191
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.930
iPhone: But nobody else knows you know

192
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.460
iPhone: But

193
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:56.400
iPhone: You know, I need to start reaching out to my family and not just kind of, you know, when I get depressed. I just retreat and talk to nobody, and answer calls you know I sleep a lot

194
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:06.060
Shawn Phalen: So do you think the depression is just because of what happened in court, or do you think you know this is kind of creeping back up on you and you need to go back on medication.

195
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.290
iPhone: Um, I think it's a mixture of

196
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.500
iPhone: A lot you know mixture of

197
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:26.220
iPhone: The whole child support thing. I'm really worried that you know once he does get 5050 so as it is now. My son is on the same schedule as my daughter.

198
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.790
iPhone: But he comes home a subset my house.

199
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.840
iPhone: He only gets one overnight and it's Friday nights.

200
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:44.070
iPhone: But once we go back to court. On April 2. I don't know if they're going to get. I know they're going to give him more overnights. I don't know if they're going to

201
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:53.400
iPhone: It because it's gone so great. Now they if they're going to just 5050 exact same schedule is Emma, or if they're only going to go a couple more overnights

202
00:27:53.790 --> 00:28:00.870
iPhone: And they'll have maybe two or three overnights and then we'll do that for a couple months, but I'm, what I'm worried about is very stressed out about

203
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:09.330
iPhone: Because I make more money than him. Not by a lot. And really I don't make that much because I have written, I had built his dad and has no bills.

204
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:21.720
iPhone: So even though I might make it $2 more an hour, which is what I make $2 he has a lot more money than I do, because he has no rent. There's no car payment like his dad gives him a gas card.

205
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.590
iPhone: Like you know i mean he has a lot more money than I do. Even though, on paper, it looks like

206
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:41.340
iPhone: You know, I make more and I'm really concerned that I'm going to have to pay him child support because I make more money than him once he gets 5050 well and if that happens because I pay him job for now.

207
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.830
iPhone: But he pays me a lot more. So they just deduct

208
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.710
iPhone: What I pay him from what he owes me. So once it goes 5050

209
00:28:53.790 --> 00:29:02.940
iPhone: Like, I won't be I will not afford to be able to pay in child support, and I might have to. So I'm very nervous about that, like, you know,

210
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:04.710
But

211
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:21.990
Shawn Phalen: Here's, here's the thing is that when you can when anybody has when anybody's asked him to child support, you have to fill out an income. Income declaration. So he has to list all of his expenses. He

212
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.160
iPhone: Hawaii. Hawaii.

213
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:34.200
Shawn Phalen: You, you can contest that and you can say, look at you know you live with your dad. I mean, I would fight I fight him on that because he lives with his dad, he

214
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.680
He doesn't have rent, he's you know he doesn't have the expenses that you have. So

215
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.000
iPhone: Also I'm

216
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:54.840
iPhone: I works going really, really well. And I just got signed off to become a store manager. Well, I guess, a few months ago, but

217
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:56.940
iPhone: It's

218
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:08.910
iPhone: Great to them right now. You know my district manager said to me a couple days ago. So we're going to be ready to take over the store. So it's coming. And when that happens, my, my

219
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:21.900
iPhone: My income will increase significantly is be the most I've ever made in my entire life. You know, it will be life changing. And at that time, very much so like

220
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:35.400
iPhone: Very much show. And so I I took. I want all this to happen now because I don't want them to use my store manager income, you know, it's like for making like 40,000 1000 like double

221
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:45.150
iPhone: You know, and so I'm nervous. You know, and it's unfair because he's always gotten away with whole life not paint the chalkboard doesn't pay for anything. He's got three other kids.

222
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:53.070
iPhone: And my tools we've got five kids these ever paid for anything he doesn't pay for. He's never gives me a penny for medical he's ever paper prescription he's ever

223
00:30:53.520 --> 00:31:04.530
iPhone: You know, and he it's just something here. He's just had this free ride with deliver home and Dad never hit rock bottom because his dad's always there to bail them out or, you know, and it's just very unfair.

224
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:19.050
iPhone: Yeah, and it's hard to prove that in court. It's hard to prove a lot of, you know, stuff like that. So how much do you pay him now and child or it's only 100 and something dollars and he pays me 1000 and something

225
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.230
Shawn Phalen: So he is actually giving you money every month.

226
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:42.690
iPhone: Well, it's so yeah I get direct deposit like I got a $600 payment. A $500 payment $200 payment my last one was $73 that was January 29 I haven't received anything yet. So now that he has custody.

227
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.550
iPhone: Obviously by sure it's going to decrease significantly

228
00:31:49.980 --> 00:32:00.990
iPhone: And then he still owes me like 3500 of back child support, which has to pay me the monthly support which is 1018 but that also includes half of my child care for Dominic

229
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:09.120
iPhone: So not it's not all support, it's you know, it's like 600 and something support and the other 400 or something for childcare.

230
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:15.390
iPhone: And then he has to pay an additional 300 on top of that, for the back child support.

231
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:23.850
iPhone: So I don't really know how the whole child support works because every time I it seems like I've been getting payments every two weeks. They've been totally different amounts so

232
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:33.060
iPhone: I haven't received anything since the 29th, which was only $73 so I'm not really, I'm not really sure. Like, I have no idea really

233
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:37.170
Shawn Phalen: So even if you were like, even if you do have

234
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.250
iPhone: A child support. I don't think it's going to increase.

235
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:56.280
You know, so I don't think it's something that you should be stressing out over, you know, I just feel like you just have to kind of take that as it comes and you just have to roll with it and just do your best to

236
00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.460

245
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:54.900

250
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.380

251
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:21.720
iPhone: Courts know that if you're saying that

252
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:27.480
Shawn Phalen: It's not right, then he's gonna have to provide something that shows me. I'm not even

253
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.640
iPhone: Know,

254
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.850
It something that

255
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.760
iPhone: You can request, I'm sure.

256
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:42.570
iPhone: I definitely well I'm I mean I'm the last time we went to court back in 2016

257
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:57.840
iPhone: He had to pay me we he ended up getting 5050 custody that day. And so he only owed me back child support, and I got one check for 40 $800 one time and my end since my kids have been born

258
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:08.610
iPhone: And that's the time we before we went into court. We both had to talk to the child support, lady, whatever. And she said that

259
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:17.400
iPhone: I was supposed to. It wasn't very much. It was like $18 or something stupid, but that I had, I was responsible for paying him like $18 a month.

260
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.790
iPhone: And I was like, are you kidding me like I was so taken back by that. I'm like, I paid for their medical I'm happy for everything.

261
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:33.060
iPhone: And so she said, well, when you go in front of the judge you can plead your case and the judge can determine whether and the judge agreed. No, you shouldn't have to pay him child support.

262
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:41.400
iPhone: Right, you know, but that was with one kid now it's two kids. I just, I don't know if you're right. I shouldn't dwell on it. I shouldn't think about it. I'll just

263
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.700
iPhone: You know it is what it is. I mean, if I have to, you know, and it comes up, they have to. I have to

264
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:56.520
iPhone: Figure it out. You know, I'd rather it happened before I get my store manager income right so I'm like, I'm kind of rushing things like I don't want him to try to

265
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:10.740
iPhone: Then on Japan like you know $600 a month or something, I don't know. I don't know how that will work, you know. But usually when it's 5050 like I should. It should just be 5050 like nobody pays anybody

266
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.140
iPhone: You know, but

267
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:34.290
Shawn Phalen: So I think that what you need to focus on for sure is you need to focus on your insurance stuff first thing that you need to figure out, like, that's, that's your, your task for the week is to get that figured out, but that's that's so far above everything else right now.

268
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.060
iPhone: Law call tomorrow I'll call tomorrow. And then, you know, like on my lunch break or something and

269
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.990
iPhone: I should have done it already. It's like it's coming up and I am I'm bionic because if they kept on my description.

270
00:36:50.250 --> 00:37:03.570
iPhone: You know, I mean, it's like, I'll make myself afford to pay because I can't. I feel like you know at this point I will go through withdrawals. I don't you know I don't want to go through that. I don't want to relapse. I want to

271
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:09.570
iPhone: You know, but I also don't want to be on Suboxone forever either right but you know

272
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:23.220
You can't just go cold turkey up Suboxone you know that's not that is not indicated, you need to have it, you know, medically, you have to talk to the doctor you to

273
