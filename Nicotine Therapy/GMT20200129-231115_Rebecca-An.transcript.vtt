00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hey,

2
00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.389
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hello. How are you, yeah.

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, sorry about that I thought was important was set for for but then I just realized you're probably in New Mexico. Hmm.

4
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:11.550
I am

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I yeah I, for some reason, you know, working with clients in a different time zone really kind of throws me off a little bit.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.190
Matt Huss III: But I'm still trying to figure out this whole video

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.860
Matt Huss III: Program. I'm in

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So once you get used to the basics of it, it's I think it's a pretty

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: convenient way to get services definitely where you would normally have appointments that you'd have to go

10
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can actually just sit at home and do the same thing, which makes it even seeing the doctor. It's kind of amazing, you know,

11
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.090
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so far it's been really easy and stuff.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.660
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I was just I got confused on

13
00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.940
Matt Huss III: A

14
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.060
Matt Huss III: I'm sorry, I forget her name emailed me telling me to contact you.

15
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh god, yeah, it's just because I think she her schedule is just gotten over full and so I'm taking on you know a bunch of the people that still need bio psychosocial roles and individual therapy so

16
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's, it's actually kind of a cool system and that way you know

17
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So on your for your bio psychosocial really is it

18
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'll ask you a series of questions. It really doesn't take very long. And we'll talk about what at the end of it will talk about what you want to get out of treatment.

19
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:47.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the things that you want to work on and then from that point forward will schedule. I'll schedule you out for weekly appointments with me.

20
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we'll start working on those issues. And then we'll reevaluate what you've been working on an individual therapy and then we'll kind of adjust from there.

21
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just kind of take it from there. Does that sound like a plan.

22
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Okay, so the first question on the bio is why

23
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What, why are you seeking treatment and why now.

24
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.690
Matt Huss III: Um, well, I have

25
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.660
Matt Huss III: I've been seeking treatment for the last 15 years

26
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.650
Matt Huss III: 20 years that I've been using

27
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.010
Matt Huss III: Nothing ever worked except a

28
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.630
Matt Huss III: Medication program that I was in, in Florida.

29
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.410
Matt Huss III: For a few years and

30
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:53.130
Matt Huss III: I was able to stay clean for a few years. But then I got off of it and tried to go back to school and relapsed again and

31
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.310
Matt Huss III: So,

32
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.460
Matt Huss III: And then I that so after years of us going again. I ended up

33
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.180
Matt Huss III: getting divorced and

34
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.390
Matt Huss III: You know, so I

35
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:25.140
Matt Huss III: And I hated my corporate job. I was in, and it, which was a big reason I was using was because I was miserable every day. So I wanted to start over, because I gave her the house the car everything which she

36
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.730
Matt Huss III: totally ruined my financial life, but that's a separate issue.

37
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:42.510
Matt Huss III: I saw this as a chance to start over and go back to school and try to chase my dream job of teaching philosophy at the college level.

38
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:59.670
Matt Huss III: And so I tried. First, I tried to find an inpatient program there apparently they are really, really hard to find. And if you do find one. It's extremely hard to get into um

39
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.770
Matt Huss III: So, so then I did find a program

40
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.740
Matt Huss III: And

41
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.370
Matt Huss III: Called first choices. Something where it's the same thing as this where I go into group and then I see a doctor.

42
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.340
Matt Huss III: Once I think it was like, once we got to the point where it was like once a month.

43
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.230
Matt Huss III: Because I was in it for so long. Well, not that long, but

44
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.850
Matt Huss III: They

45
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.460
Matt Huss III: They really they, it was, it was

46
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.180
Matt Huss III: I my therapist kind of really

47
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:56.490
Matt Huss III: Disenfranchised me I guess is the best toward at one point, she just really treated me in a way that I was never expecting or didn't expect.

48
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.810
Matt Huss III: Out of her and we got really close and oh and I opened up to. She was the first person I ever opened up to

49
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.250
Matt Huss III: And then all of a sudden she

50
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.830
Matt Huss III: kind of ignored me and stopped trying to see me and

51
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.680
Matt Huss III: I don't know. It's an anyways and and I was driving having to drive an hour down to the south Valley.

52
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.030
Matt Huss III: Every two weeks and then, you know,

53
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:39.990
Matt Huss III: The doctors, I saw, I ended up seeing five different doctors within months of being there because it was just this walking clinic.

54
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.930
Matt Huss III: And it was just, it was, it was such a problem and then I found your program and

55
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.500
Matt Huss III: figured, well I'm going to be in school.

56
00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:04.710
Matt Huss III: I got into you and them officially for the first semester this semester, and I'm at school from like nine to three or four every day Monday through Friday.

57
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.700
Matt Huss III: And figured I would try this so that

58
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.780
Matt Huss III: I wouldn't have to go anywhere traveler like it wouldn't

59
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.150
Matt Huss III: affect my schedule.

60
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.430
Matt Huss III: Anything, um,

61
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.680
Matt Huss III: So,

62
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:32.760
Matt Huss III: So yeah, so, um, so I have. I've been clean for good. You know, I don't. I lost track.

63
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.790
Matt Huss III: It's been, like, seven, eight months now. I guess since I started that last program.

64
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.330
Matt Huss III: And then I've just been in this program for a week or two, one week. Now, I guess.

65
00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:46.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um,

66
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.410
Matt Huss III: Yeah, this is the end of my first week.

67
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so

68
00:06:52.050 --> 00:07:00.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, tell me about your history with substances. When we were first exposed. What was the first drug you ever used

69
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.280
Matt Huss III: Being a sort of drinking when I was 1413

70
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:18.810
Matt Huss III: I tried smoking marijuana when I was like 14 or so and hated it. My life. I still hate it. I don't know why it makes me paranoid and

71
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.490
Matt Huss III: It just really screws with my head.

72
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.110
Matt Huss III: And then, you know, and then I went through high school partying a lot and you know

73
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.740
Matt Huss III: And, you know, partying and women and

74
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:50.970
Matt Huss III: Money and that kind of stuff became more important to me than anything I was young and dumb so and so I experimented with basically everything. Not everything but

75
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.320
Matt Huss III: cocaine, ecstasy.

76
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:05.340
Matt Huss III: Those are basically the things that I would go out and party with but I'm after high school I moved

77
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.610
Matt Huss III: To go to school, out of state.

78
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:20.850
Matt Huss III: Or no, no, but I was still in high school, I was like 18 or 19 when somebody handed me an oxy cotton 80 milligram for the first time.

79
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.650
Matt Huss III: And

80
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:34.530
Matt Huss III: So, and then all of a sudden and and it was all of a sudden the miracle cure for me for my anxiety my depression motivation energy levels.

81
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.950
Matt Huss III: And up north. They were $1 milligrams. So it was like once

82
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:50.340
Matt Huss III: Like in a blue moon. And then I moved to Florida and they and it was like a $30 pill became $5 once I moved

83
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.730
Matt Huss III: And especially, and especially when they were pumping them out in the beginning, all the doctors

84
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:07.740
Matt Huss III: So then it became once a week, I became, you know, a couple times a week, then every day and

85
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.880
Matt Huss III: Then in my early or mid 20s.

86
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:28.650
Matt Huss III: I shot up for the first time and that was it for me that was basically when I started losing everything and I couldn't hold down a job or

87
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:37.350
Matt Huss III: Couldn't stay in school. Couldn't you know I all I, you know, from then on, it was basically just chasing

88
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.590
Matt Huss III: The drug

89
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much were you using at the end of your use.

90
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.760
Matt Huss III: At the end of my use

91
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.690
Matt Huss III: Are shooting up three

92
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.770
Matt Huss III: Roxy Cotton's three times a day. So nine milligrams three times a day.

93
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When did it finally get

94
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:11.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Finally get bad enough for you to make the change. At what point, what would basically what I'm asking is what was your bottom where you finally said, all right, I gotta do something different.

95
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.630
Matt Huss III: Remember, a point

96
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:45.450
Matt Huss III: Where I tried cleaning up except for when I first. The first time I got arrested.

97
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:53.100
Matt Huss III: And then had to go through withdrawals in jail. And then I was putting drug court for two years.

98
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.410
Matt Huss III: And then after that, after relapsing after getting out of drug court. That's when

99
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.870
Matt Huss III: And I, I failed. I had to fail, out of another school

100
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.950
Matt Huss III: And

101
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:20.370
Matt Huss III: That's when I started Suboxone for the first time and it worked.

102
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.340
Matt Huss III: But it was it was i was i

103
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:35.190
Matt Huss III: I remember, I remember overdosing one time in the house and I was alone, and I would have died if I didn't

104
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:45.660
Matt Huss III: I just all of a sudden, I just, I don't remember anything except using and then my head coming up out of my lap breathing in a ton of air.

105
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.770
Matt Huss III: And I still didn't even try to get help. After that, I still so

106
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.310
Matt Huss III: I've always

107
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.290
Matt Huss III: Ever since I started stealing for it.

108
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.970
Matt Huss III: Or

109
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.780
Matt Huss III: pawning stuff for it. I wanted to stop.

110
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:14.880
But

111
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:24.570
Matt Huss III: I had no support system. I was I was, and the withdrawals were so bad that I couldn't

112
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:33.540
Matt Huss III: Unless I was forced to do something or go to jail or something. At that point I just couldn't get myself to do anything.

113
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:54.900
Matt Huss III: It. Yeah, it's really, it's hard to remember exactly, exactly what happened that far. Yeah, and especially since I was on and off so many times.

114
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:07.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. I'm, I'm, tell me, have you were diagnosed

115
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At your last treatment center with opioid use disorder.

116
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, any mental health diagnosis.

117
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:23.430
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I told my doctor already this that I also see a psychiatrist because

118
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.010
Matt Huss III: One of the

119
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.680
Matt Huss III: Times that I was clean.

120
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.990
Matt Huss III: Uh huh. I got so depressed that I couldn't get out of bed for literally three or four weeks, and I'm not kidding, except to go to the bathroom.

121
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:53.970
Matt Huss III: So I went to a psychiatrist. I've seen few difference. I actually have seen like five to 10 different psychiatrists, because I moved so often and I'm and they've all diagnosed me with severe clinical depression.

122
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.860
Matt Huss III: Severe

123
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.710
Matt Huss III: Generalized anxiety.

124
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.110
Matt Huss III: Social anxiety and panic attack disorder.

125
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.230
Matt Huss III: So I'm on medications for that as well.

126
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. Um, any, any past suicide attempts, or thoughts.

127
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:25.290
Matt Huss III: Not the thoughts. Yeah, but I'm never actually hurt myself or attempted anything

128
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:34.410
Matt Huss III: It's, it's like suicide to me has always been the like the easy way out.

129
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.920
Matt Huss III: But selfish.

130
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.730
You know,

131
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.160
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

132
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any homicide thoughts or plans or into

133
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:55.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past self harm, such as cutting, burning, that kind of stuff. Okay.

134
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the next piece wants to know about your family unit.

135
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The family that you grew up in

136
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And where you're adopted where your parents together on throughout your childhood or did they divorce.

137
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If so, what age. How many siblings do you have

138
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just an overview of what your family dynamics were like

139
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.620
Matt Huss III: Okay, um, my mother and father got divorced before I could even remember.

140
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.930
Matt Huss III: And so as far back as I can remember. I think it was around two or three years old.

141
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.960
Matt Huss III: With my mother and my stepfather.

142
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:48.120
Matt Huss III: And he had his own business and he ended up actually got he what he did. Well, so I had a very easy good childhood.

143
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.150
Matt Huss III: My dad, I didn't

144
00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:02.550
Matt Huss III: Really seen or know my dad because apparently I just, I found out years later.

145
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.730
Matt Huss III: That he was addicted to crack for 20 to 30 years

146
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.390
Mm hmm.

147
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.340
Matt Huss III: So,

148
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.740
Matt Huss III: Probably after the divorce or something and then I'm not sure when it started.

149
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:23.760
Matt Huss III: But he ended up moving out here to New Mexico with his mother.

150
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.180
Matt Huss III: After he lost his job and his

151
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.650
Matt Huss III: apartment in Brooklyn.

152
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.610
Matt Huss III: And was able to quit cold turkey.

153
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:40.620
Matt Huss III: So,

154
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:52.200
Matt Huss III: But I grew up, you know, Michael. My stepfather and my mom and me. Oh, and my brother, who is a year and a half, younger

155
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.620
Matt Huss III: Than me. We went on vacation every year.

156
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:04.410
Matt Huss III: You know they they constantly bought us whatever we wanted

157
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.720
Matt Huss III: Enabled my usage for a long time.

158
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:24.750
Matt Huss III: I never I was never disciplined never I was never, never got in trouble for anything.

159
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:28.500
Matt Huss III: So,

160
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.050
Matt Huss III: All I did was learned to live better, I guess.

161
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how many siblings do you have

162
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.370
Matt Huss III: My younger brother just one

163
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And were there any mental health issues, um,

164
00:17:52.500 --> 00:18:07.890
Matt Huss III: Yeah, him and my dad both use uppers to stay up all day and they use downers to go to sleep at night and my brothers on steroids. On top of that, so he's got stage three kidney disease.

165
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:23.160
Matt Huss III: I almost had I almost got I was, I almost got tested to see if I was a match because he got dehydrated and went into Stage five KIDNEY DISEASE, AND HE WON'T TELL THE DOCTORS why

166
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.970
Matt Huss III: Because it's steroids and drug use.

167
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.910
Matt Huss III: You know, so they can't help him fix it. You know, so I don't know what's going to happen to him.

168
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:41.940
Matt Huss III: Um, but yeah it's but because of my my drug of choice is not prescribed. It's like I'm the

169
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.200
Matt Huss III: Family junkie.

170
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.700
Matt Huss III: You know,

171
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.340
Matt Huss III: Even though.

172
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:58.230
Matt Huss III: My mom's never been addicted to anything or anything, but I mean her side of the family all alcoholics.

173
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:05.850
Matt Huss III: My dad side is he had a sister, who was a heroin addict and actually died from it.

174
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:12.840
Matt Huss III: So,

175
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

176
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:22.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah okay, that's perfect. Let's go back a little bit further and talk about how it was for you in school.

177
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And did you graduate. Did you have a learning disability.

178
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:34.740
Matt Huss III: No, I'm all the way through eighth grade I PERFECT STRAIGHT A's.

179
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:48.300
Matt Huss III: No problem. No issue I, you know, and then even into high school, I never even went to school just and I hit. I just, I could show up for the tests and take the test and still get straight A's.

180
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.080
Matt Huss III: And it's been like that all my life, even in state colleges getting my MBA.

181
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.670
Matt Huss III: It's really just been

182
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:17.340
Matt Huss III: Too easy. And now, this actually this semester and you and me being in a university is so different that I'm kind of freaking out, but that's that's new. This that's now. But anyways, back then. Yeah. Before using I was, it was

183
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:37.230
Matt Huss III: I was the one I was the person in the family who was supposed to be whatever I wanted to do and be, you know, I was supposed to be a lawyer or a politician or, you know, who knows, whatever I wanted to be now and

184
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.250
Matt Huss III: You know, so

185
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:49.650
Matt Huss III: And then, but I'm now i'm still living with you know my dad, trying to get off of drugs so

186
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm all right any current legal legal issues.

187
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:58.710
Know,

188
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any and who do you currently live with.

189
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.340
Matt Huss III: My dad. Okay.

190
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any children for you.

191
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.180
Matt Huss III: I do. I have two children.

192
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.850
Matt Huss III: They're still in Florida.

193
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.850
Matt Huss III: My daughter, I have full time because her mother disappeared when she was about two or three

194
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.830
Matt Huss III: Drugs.

195
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.760
Matt Huss III: So I raised her

196
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.610
Matt Huss III: By myself, you know, and with my mom's help and stuff but

197
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.920
Matt Huss III: So she's with my mother and her new boyfriend.

198
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:43.950
Matt Huss III: In Florida right now. And my son is five years old who was with my ex wife.

199
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.450
Matt Huss III: Hmm, who

200
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.360
Matt Huss III: He stays with her.

201
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.250
Matt Huss III: Right now, even though I have

202
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.930
Matt Huss III: visitations and everything I can. The only reason I came out here was to

203
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:07.230
Matt Huss III: Get off of stop using and then the plan is to

204
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.730
Matt Huss III: Go back and be able to live independently and

205
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:23.910
Matt Huss III: Like a normal adult. And then, you know, get a place for me and my daughter and then be able to see my son every weekend, like I was supposed to do.

206
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:32.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, any did I ask you if you have any financial concerns.

207
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:43.800
Matt Huss III: Are. Yeah, you were. Yeah, me and my dad basically live off financial aid from school.

208
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:44.940
Okay.

209
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Is there anything else that you think is important that we know about you.

210
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.610
Matt Huss III: Know, probably a lot and I don't know.

211
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.890
Matt Huss III: People love that question.

212
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past trauma.

213
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: History of any kind of

214
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Abuse

215
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As a child,

216
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Teenager, okay.

217
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, perfect.

218
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:33.660
Matt Huss III: Now yeah i just i think i was self medicating for for, you know,

219
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what it is that you would like to work on in treatment.

220
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:46.680
Matt Huss III: I

221
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.630
Matt Huss III: Since I've been clean I've come to realize that I am emotionally really screwed up.

222
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:05.970
Matt Huss III: I've numbed my mind for so long that when I do have an emotion. I don't know how to deal with it.

223
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.000
Matt Huss III: I'm very

224
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.040
Matt Huss III: walled off.

225
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.200
Matt Huss III: From people

226
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:25.440
Matt Huss III: The only reason I'm able to talk this much with you is because I've been doing it so much recently actually for the last few months.

227
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.190
Matt Huss III: Before this, I wouldn't talk to anybody about anything I bottled everything up. I

228
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:39.600
Matt Huss III: You know I I cry for no reason. Every so often.

229
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.690
Matt Huss III: I forgot what I was answering. Sorry.

230
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is it that you would like to work on by your

231
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.560
Matt Huss III: Oh, yeah, yeah. Um,

232
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.160
Matt Huss III: So yeah, so being able to

233
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:12.810
Matt Huss III: Being able to open up, you know, not just emotionally but socially.

234
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:23.070
Matt Huss III: Able to figure out what made me keep using even after getting clean why I kept relapsing

235
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:30.750
Matt Huss III: What are the, like, what are the underlying issues which I'm I know for sure there's probably a ton.

236
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:44.760
Matt Huss III: And you know I my self esteem issues. I hate myself I've huge self esteem issues.

237
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.670
Matt Huss III: I

238
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.290
Matt Huss III: Every

239
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.240
Matt Huss III: I have huge huge regrets and

240
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:02.670
Matt Huss III: You know, I can forgive anybody for anything except myself for even the smallest thing.

241
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:16.710
Matt Huss III: So that's a big reason like I'm constantly hate myself for the decisions I've made and what I've done to people and where I should be right now in life and where I am actually at

242
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so what I on the clinical side of that, what I hear her that we want to work on is you need some

243
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You need to be able to learn how to communicate.

244
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You need addiction education on the disease of addiction, so you understand what it all entails and it'll give you in that pier in that education piece. You'll learn

245
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About

246
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why we get stuck, you will learn about why you keep going back to it and all of the things that addiction, you know, causes for us. And so you and I will work on those pieces we will work on some self esteem.

247
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we will work on guilt and shame.

248
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We will work on self forgiveness.

249
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the goal is for you to be free of guilt.

250
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To begin the process of self acceptance and loving yourself.

251
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:44.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And to identify the qualities that you actually have and not focus on the things in the past that you've done.

252
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That hold you and bind you into guilt and shame.

253
00:27:49.200 --> 00:28:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And especially guilt and, you know, in a lot of people that come into recovery they struggle with, with all of these issues. Why you know is always a big question.

254
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:17.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why is it that I can get some time under my belt, but I just you know i relapse, or I return to it, or you know, why does it have such a strong hold on me and

255
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the one I can definitely answer that question. It's like, really, honestly, it's like diabetes or cancer and you have to

256
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:40.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Continually stay in the recovery mode, you have to put yourself first, you have to really double up on self care. You have to be self aware about what you're thinking.

257
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:56.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When your diseases really dragging you into down the road, you know those high risk roads and you have to really do a lot of thought changing. You got to take those negative thoughts and really kind of learn how to turn them in your head.

258
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:14.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's the emotional piece to emotion regulation is a big one, you know, really kind of learning about those feelings, you know, do my thoughts push my emotions are doing my emotions push my thoughts because sometimes you never know who's, who's beginning it and who's ending it you know

259
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes it can just be all over the place. And so, you know, my hope. What we can work on are you know self forgiveness guilt and shame self esteem.

260
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really try to identify any kind of underlying issues that kept you in what were you running from what is it that you were trying to numb from and really kind of explore those questions and hopefully be able to find answers and with all of that.

261
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that feels like a lot. Does it to you.

262
00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:05.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really, it's really not. But it really is because we're going to really just kind of take pieces and really explore them. I will give you different

263
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:17.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tools and techniques to be able to work to changing these things okay and but you gotta promise me that you will absolutely you know do what I asked you to do.

264
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be open to and if you're uncomfortable with it with doing it, just tell me I'm not, I'm not comfortable with doing that right now. And so we'll put it aside and we'll work on something else. Okay.

265
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we'll just kind of take it one step at a time. And, you know, just to let you know, Matt, you're in a great place, you know, self discovery, you know, is, is an awesome place because we learn about ourselves, we learn to like ourselves.

266
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:53.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Despite of, you know, what our disease wants us to think about ourselves, you know that what I know is addiction, has one goal.

267
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's to take you out. Me and

268
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:15.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No matter how it gets you there. That's what it wants. And what we were like the frontline warriors right right now in early recovery really trying to battle those thoughts and do the next right thing and get rid of all the baggage. You know that comes with this disease.

269
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I think you're in the right place.

270
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I think that we can definitely

271
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:36.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: explore and learn, learn new coping skills for situations and really kind of opened the doorway for you to have some freedom over low self esteem and guilt and shame.

272
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think

273
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.970
Matt Huss III: Sounds good. Um, yeah, I just, I just, and then I remembered

274
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.250
Matt Huss III: Two other big ones.

275
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.430
Matt Huss III: That you know

276
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.250
Matt Huss III: People, people that I've always talked to other people that have anxiety.

277
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.780
Matt Huss III: They say they can

278
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:14.730
Matt Huss III: They know what their anxiety is over, but I feel like I've constant anxiety, but I can never like pinpoint a thought or a fear or worry

279
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:15.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

280
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:22.050
Matt Huss III: I don't know if that's common or uncommon or what I just

281
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:23.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

282
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, some people

283
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:38.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Some people can identify can identify it can feel it when it comes on can can use emotion regulation tools to help bring it to a manageable level.

284
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And sometimes there may not be a specific reason. It could just be your body adjusting because an early recovery and it can take up to a you know, a year or more to get through post acute withdrawals.

285
00:32:54.270 --> 00:33:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is the second half of withdrawal. So you've got the withdrawal piece where you're sick and you know not feeling good. And that's usually what a lot of people run from right

286
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:09.690
Matt Huss III: You know, I've been through those a million times where I relapse is the

287
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:16.500
Matt Huss III: Six to eight month period where I'm hit with like a sack of bricks of anxiety and depression.

288
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:30.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That sounds to me like post acute withdrawal symptoms and you think about, you're doing good. You're trudging along you're trudging along. Everything's good. And then all of a sudden you know your anxieties high emotions low

289
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And part of that is

290
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A piece of that market to say it's all from that I'm going to say that a piece of that is your body's trying to find what normal looks like.

291
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.790
Matt Huss III: You know, it has a yeah that's that's that's a

292
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.050
Matt Huss III: That's one too. I have no idea what it's like to be normal.

293
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:58.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, remember that that up in the first year of recovery it. There's a lot of healing that's going on, physically, there's

294
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's that really kind of causes emotional ups and downs causes you know mental ups and downs can cause our depression to be worse can cause our anxiety to be worse.

295
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really taking a look at how can when it, when it it and if it happens again. How can that be managed. You know, so that, you know, all right. I know what this is. And I know what I need to do.

296
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we can definitely work on those tools as well.

297
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.250
Matt Huss III: Yeah, because I've been

298
00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:54.360
Matt Huss III: I've been depressed, like I get spells of depression, where, like, I can't get out of bed for like three or four days, but this one for the first time I'm still able to function, but I'm just not able to enjoy anything or be excited about anything or

299
00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:00.210
Matt Huss III: Which I never really am anyway. But it's still a like it's

300
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.410
Matt Huss III: I still have to fight with myself to get out of bed to go to school to do anything. I, you know,

301
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're, are you on an antidepressant.

302
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:18.240
Matt Huss III: Yeah, a ton of it like the highest dose possible and and Wellbutrin on top of it to like help it work.

303
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, but

304
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.570
Matt Huss III: I still get these about

305
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:22.590
Sure.

306
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so we will work on

307
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work on that piece to, you know, a lot of it is

308
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:37.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a piece of it. That is about how we think, you know, our thoughts and ever, ever heard the saying our thoughts become things

309
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.410
Matt Huss III: No, nothing. So

310
00:35:40.950 --> 00:36:01.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so what we think and where our mind is what we're thinking about if we're in a negative headspace and we're staying there and we are negative on life on recovery on ourself on where we're at in our life. It plays a factor on our emotional will be

311
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.760
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm always negative about that. Yeah.

312
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:12.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Haha. Okay, so there's a there's a piece of it that we can certainly work on. All right.

313
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And because I'm really good at at combating those negative thoughts and it takes it takes practice. So you got to work with me and practice the things that I asked you to do. Because I can tell you from experience that getting on the other side of that.

314
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is a huge relief, you know,

315
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:39.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's, it's just saying, wait a minute. You know what I'm gonna, I'm not going to follow fall down that rabbit hole because I know where it leads me

316
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I'm going to find the good things in today and whether it be the weather, whether it be you know your hair looks good today whether or not you know you're feeling good, whether or not you're putting healthy food in your body.

317
00:36:52.530 --> 00:37:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And identifying that whatever it might be. Those are the things that combat those negative thought processes, but you've got to be willing to really practice them, you know,

318
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's, it's the way that we talk to ourselves as well. That's another piece of it. And again, you know, having the having that voice, the disease of addiction. I call it the voice.

319
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:27.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It really is a self defeating self loathing disease, and it really once again.

320
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It really wants to take you out.

321
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so being able to put barriers in place every time that those thoughts come up or every time that those feelings come up really kind of hold them at bay.

322
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And see that you're doing everything you can to make your life better. And by doing that, you start feeling better, emotionally, you start feeling better, you know, with your thoughts are you see your thoughts are changing.

323
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if they don't, you can easily rectify them and get them on a different path. And that's how we

324
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:15.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We get we become developed and in self awareness and and maintaining in recovery, you know, as well as being able to manage and control.

325
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our anxiety and depression are in our depression with with medication. So, so we have some things to work on.

326
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:34.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm definitely. Glad to work on them with you and I can tell you that I that I know what this processes.

327
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:52.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: firsthand experience. And so, you know, I'm definitely not going to give you information just out of a textbook and things that I've learned. I can tell you what I've learned. You know, with my personal journey and experiences and other people that I've worked with and their journeys to

328
00:38:53.880 --> 00:39:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which will really, you know, between that we should be able to to help you through this. Okay, next. Okay, so tell me what is a good time for you.

329
00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: During the week to be able to meet with me on a weekly basis.

330
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:14.340
Matt Huss III: Or I have, I have my group meetings every Wednesday at seven.

331
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.260
Matt Huss III: So I was hoping

332
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:21.150
Matt Huss III: To do this kind of thing every Wednesday, but a little later than four. Because it, it was

333
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.030
Matt Huss III: We had to kind of rush from school.

334
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To. Yeah. Well, here's the deal.

335
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What insurance. Are you on

336
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:31.770
Matt Huss III: Medicaid

337
00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:37.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay so Medicaid says that you can't have two services in one day. Oh.

338
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you do group on Wednesday, then we have to do our individuals on another day.

339
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.450
Matt Huss III: Of the week. Third, yeah. Any, any Thursdays would be fine on

340
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.590
Matt Huss III: Mondays. I can't do it because I'm not class until like seven o'clock.

341
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, I can't do it on Mondays, either.

342
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're good. I'm in group ALL WE ALL DAY ON MONDAY AND

343
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:12.900
Matt Huss III: I just honestly, um, I just, I'm just, I just would like to make it as close to Wednesday's as possible because I don't know why, but

344
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:21.180
Matt Huss III: Because I have to walk to the pharmacy, which is two miles away to get my medication. And I don't know why.

345
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:32.160
Matt Huss III: He this program like only gives like you have to fill a prescription every two weeks. Every twice a week or something like that.

346
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:48.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's so that you had that, what it is is really getting you in the habit of being present and actually getting you know therapy on top of group support and education.

347
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:54.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because a lot of times people think that, you know, if they if they're on a medication that's that's that's all it is.

348
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot more to it.

349
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.470
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been, like I said, I've been at this for

350
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:13.140
Matt Huss III: A while. Now it just, it would it would just be nice to be able to have it have to do it once a week instead of twice. That's all.

351
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, if we are meeting.

352
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.000
