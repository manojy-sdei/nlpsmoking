27
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.720
Dawn Abriel: The appropriate to our program because we are an outpatient

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.890
Dawn Abriel: Program, you know, we're not a

29
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.930
Dawn Abriel: If you need

30
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.090
Dawn Abriel: inpatient care then then we're not appropriate for you. Have you been in programs before

31
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.880
Kristy Chavez: I've been one. It was an outpatient also but I'm just going the provider, he, he didn't want to do the Suboxone anymore. So just been not finding a provider that's been

32
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:29.430
Kristy Chavez: You know, stable with me. I just want to be with just one provider and just get all my just do it all at one time instead of, you know, my primary care and then somebody else.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.750
Dawn Abriel: You bet. So

36
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:51.930
Dawn Abriel: For the sake of Chantel i'm going to share my screen so that she can see. And you can see what I'm writing to. I mean, it's your charts. So it's not any big

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.870
Dawn Abriel: Oh really, yeah. Somehow, the same way it helps you not have the cravings for

196
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:52.110
Dawn Abriel: Opioids it helps with the cravings for tobacco about. So you'll notice Chantelle that I've asked the question, but I'm not feeling at the end. And that's because the transcriber will fill in all these little bubbles.

197
00:18:53.580 --> 00:19:05.160

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.630
Kristy Chavez: Paxil

311
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.850
Paxil

312
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.940
Dawn Abriel: Oh, I see. I had to

313
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.700
Dawn Abriel: Put it in there instead. And that's a 30 grammar 40 grams tablet.

314
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:21.840
Kristy Chavez: That's 40

315
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.650
Dawn Abriel: You just take the high dose of everything.

316
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:26.970
Kristy Chavez: Yeah, I guess.

317
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.420
Dawn Abriel: This morning it once a day.

318
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.650
Kristy Chavez: Today, yes.

319
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:36.210
Dawn Abriel: Anything else

320
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.090
Dawn Abriel: Already

321
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.470
Dawn Abriel: Do you have any allergies to medicines.

322
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.760
Again,

323
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.480
Dawn Abriel: What happens with augmenting

324
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.800
Kristy Chavez: My throat swells up

325
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.540
Dawn Abriel: That's pretty good indication of

326
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.920
Kristy Chavez: Reaction and bad one scary.

327
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.360
Yeah.

328
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.680
Dawn Abriel: Anything else

329
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.780
No. Okay.

330
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:28.260
Dawn Abriel: So show and tell. I want you to notice when I when I clicked on it. It came up a blank screen like this. You have to scroll. Make it scroll up before you. I don't know why it automatically doesn't give you the field.

331
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.710
Dawn Abriel: But I remember when I first started using this program I thought were to go, where'd it go and

332
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.390
Dawn Abriel: Just be aware of that.

333
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.240
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so this question, Christy is meant for people who

334
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:54.810
Dawn Abriel: Might have early dementia. So you made yourself you dress yourself you feed toilet and go from one place to another, all by your lonesome self.

335
00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:05.100
Dawn Abriel: You know who you are, where you are. You make your own decisions. You have a memory that's that's appropriate for your age, you can focus and you can read

336
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.320
Kristy Chavez: Yes. All right.

337
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.390
Dawn Abriel: Now I'm going to have you get your pulse.

338
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:13.530
Kristy Chavez: And

339
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:20.790
Dawn Abriel: You do it like this, you've got a muscle that goes from your jaw down to your throat here.

340
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:30.330
Dawn Abriel: If you take your right hand and you feel the left side of your neck and you just you. It's in front of that muscle.

341
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.900
Dawn Abriel: Okay, got it, bump, bump, bump.

342
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.710
Kristy Chavez: Yes.

343
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.650
Dawn Abriel: Okay, hold it there and I'll tell you when to start counting

344
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.580
Okay.

345
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:40.980
Dawn Abriel: Now,

346
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.280
Dawn Abriel: Stop.

347
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:57.390
Dawn Abriel: Those 1010 How tall are you,

348
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.530
Kristy Chavez: Fight for

349
00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.530
Dawn Abriel: Your current weight.

350
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.850
130

351
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.830
Dawn Abriel: Now we're gonna do a little physical exam.

352
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:20.550
Dawn Abriel: I have this Chantelle in my intake exam I have it in my shortcut notes.

353
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.040
Dawn Abriel: So text shortcut.

354
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.770
Dawn Abriel: And then they come up

355
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.580
Dawn Abriel: Think we went over that before. If not, we can go over it again.

356
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.760
Dawn Abriel: Christy. I want you to get real close to the camera. See, I need to save

357
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:53.520
Dawn Abriel: And go out of stop share just for a minute, get real close to the camera and pull your eyelid down so I can see under your eyelid.

358
00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:00.660
Dawn Abriel: Great let go pull back, make your eyes go all the way to the right.

359
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:09.900
Dawn Abriel: All the way to the left, all the way up and all the way down. Let me see you breathe out of you decided you nose.

360
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:22.170
Dawn Abriel: Good. Stick your tongue out at us and move it side to side. Lovely and bite down no job pain, no teeth pain.

361
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:22.800
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

362
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.160
Dawn Abriel: Bring the camera down a little bit and let me see you swallow.

363
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.750
Dawn Abriel: Super. Take a big deep breath.

364
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:50.460
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And I want you to press on your belly upper right upper left lower right lower left, and just let me know that there's no pain. Oh, I think you got a call coming in because it went on mute, you know, automatically mutes when you get all

365
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.770
Kristy Chavez: Sorry. Oh, sorry I accident.

366
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.060
Okay.

367
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:55.680
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

368
00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.210
Dawn Abriel: Good. And now prop your camera up

369
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.230
Dawn Abriel: On something and I want to see you pull your fingers.

370
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.620
Dawn Abriel: Perfect no pain when you do that.

371
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:18.540
Dawn Abriel: You know, now this is the hard part or take your camera and I need you to show me your ankles.

372
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.220
Kristy Chavez: Okay.

373
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.760
Dawn Abriel: Good one.

374
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.260
Kristy Chavez: There's the other way.

375
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:41.850
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, good. So this way, she can tell I get all of this coordination, right, I can. You can really tell if someone has a neurological deficit by that not only do I get to see the ankles for edema, but

376
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:50.790
Dawn Abriel: The coordination, it takes to move the camera to the ankles gives a lot of neurological information so

377
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:57.090
Dawn Abriel: Now let's decide on the program are you working currently

378
00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.520
Kristy Chavez: No, I'm not. Okay.

379
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.040
Kristy Chavez: Just cool

380
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.790
Dawn Abriel: Oh, so do you, do you have a school schedule already

381
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.460
Kristy Chavez: No, not yet. I'll get it on the Friday.

382
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.530
Kristy Chavez: this coming Friday.

383
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.320
Dawn Abriel: So I'm wondering

384
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.810
Dawn Abriel: Does that mean

385
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:23.550
Dawn Abriel: Does the sharing help Chantelle, should I go back to it.

386
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.350
Shantel Escobar  NP: It does tremendously.

387
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.210
Dawn Abriel: Oh, good. Okay, then let's do it.

388
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.320
Dawn Abriel: So we're way over here.

389
00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:36.300
Dawn Abriel: Wait.

390
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:45.210
Dawn Abriel: There we go. Okay, so I will fill this in in a minute, but we're going to always there's

391
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.550
Dawn Abriel: The assessment.

392
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:54.600
Dawn Abriel: I actually use a different program for

393
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.670
Dawn Abriel: F7 is

394
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:14.070
Dawn Abriel: fills in these and then I just take away the ones that don't. So this is not a problem. And this is not it's easier to take away than it is to remember all these numbers so

395
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.590
Shantel Escobar  NP: I like all of, oh,

396
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.030
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it's handy.

397
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:25.200
Dawn Abriel: And I have a shortcut for new new patient plan.

398
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.900
Dawn Abriel: If I can get to it here.

399
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.120
Dawn Abriel: Move this all the way up to the top.

400
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.770
Dawn Abriel: Let me yeah new patient plan. Okay.

401
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.410
Dawn Abriel: So I'm guessing you would want

402
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.900
Dawn Abriel: Either a noon, because you probably don't have classes at noon. Do you know

403
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.030
Kristy Chavez: Probably in the morning.

404
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.570
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

405
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:06.240
Dawn Abriel: I think that, so our therapists are kind of

406
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:17.310
Dawn Abriel: We've had a big influx of new patients. So I've got, I've only got a couple of therapists who are seeing new people. And I think there's a

407
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:25.710
Dawn Abriel: Group at noon on Mondays.

408
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.740
Dawn Abriel: It wouldn't be it wouldn't. Although it wouldn't be tomorrow because they're Tomorrow's a holiday.

409
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.730
Dawn Abriel: But I think Dr. All lemon

410
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:43.470
Dawn Abriel: Has

411
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:45.150
Kristy Chavez: A

412
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:54.060
Dawn Abriel: Ll I am a and you're going to get an email that has his name and and what if I can figure out who the therapist is

413
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.130
Dawn Abriel: I'll give you her name, too. I think it's Serena.

414
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:12.930
Dawn Abriel: So you see where I'm going. CHANTELLE to group assignments. And so now I'm going to go, just look for that noon.

415
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.020
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it's

416
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.030
Dawn Abriel: To be

417
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.340
Dawn Abriel: Determined, I think he's I think he has opened this up.

418
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:31.830
Dawn Abriel: I tell you what.

419
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.480
Dawn Abriel: It's either that one or Friday at

420
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.480
Dawn Abriel: One that he has

421
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.110
Kristy Chavez: 131 30 no

422
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:49.980
Dawn Abriel: Patient Yeah cuz let's put you in the Friday at 130 and then you can negotiate with him.

423
00:37:52.560 --> 00:38:00.450
Dawn Abriel: If you want to go to the Monday, but that way you get started with someone this week so Friday at 130

424
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:01.440
OK.

425
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:16.950
Dawn Abriel: So now we'll go back here in this back up when I get out of carry OSHA tell I almost always just save and close, just so I don't lose information.

426
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.200
Shantel Escobar  NP: I hear you.

427
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:30.600
Dawn Abriel: So right in here where it says group clinical will say Friday 130 with Dr.

428
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.750
Dawn Abriel: And cirie now.

429
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.330
Dawn Abriel: I'm, I'm a little hesitant.

430
00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.710
Dawn Abriel: Christina start you at a full three

431
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.860
Dawn Abriel: You know, the, the goal is for this medicine to last you 24 hours.

432
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.080
Dawn Abriel: Right and

433
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:15.630
Dawn Abriel: This, it was made as a cancer medicine for end of life care.

434
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:17.880
Dawn Abriel: So one milligram

435
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:24.540
Dawn Abriel: One milligram of buprenorphine equals 30 to 40 milligrams of morphine.

436
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:32.790
Dawn Abriel: Oh wow, it's very concentrated you're taking 24 that's that's so

437
00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:53.910
Dawn Abriel: What, what I would prefer that you do is you. Well, first of all, let me run through the routine your Suboxone goes under your tongue, you must not smoke. You cannot smoke before you take the buprenorphine because all nicotine clamps down your blood vessels.

438
00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:05.970
Dawn Abriel: clamp down your blood vessels. You're asking those blood vessels under your tongue to do a job, they can't do they can't absorb your medicine. If those blood vessels are cramp down

439
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:14.160
Dawn Abriel: Okay. That's why smoking is so so dangerous, right, because you clamp your blood vessels in your head, you get a stroke or

440
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.750
Dawn Abriel: Your heart, you get a heart attack.

441
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:22.500
Dawn Abriel: Kidneys, you get kidney failure. Anyway, but you really won't get be getting your medicine, if you smoke within a half an hour.

442
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:23.820
Dawn Abriel: Of taking your

443
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.110
Dawn Abriel: Your buprenorphine.

444
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:31.650
Dawn Abriel: Okay, you have to let it sit there for a least a full two minutes. Just let it collecting your mouth.

445
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:39.780
Dawn Abriel: Because as soon as it gets up into your mouth it deactivates and you're not getting the benefit of the medicine.

446
00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:40.740
Okay.

447
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.460
Dawn Abriel: So let's start you off with

448
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:54.540
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to prescribe to a day but start off with one and just just really pay attention to how long it lasts.

449
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:55.380
Kristy Chavez: Okay.

450
00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:08.790
Dawn Abriel: The idea is to take it once a day, you should not be taking it throughout the day it last it stayed half of it is in your system, half of it by 72 hours.

451
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:20.430
Dawn Abriel: Oh, it lasts a long, long time. You, you should not be taking it to three times a day, once a day. So when you finally get to your dose. It's a once a day dosing

452
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.440
Dawn Abriel: Okay, but

453
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:29.580
Dawn Abriel: I for the next couple days, you might be having to kind of creep up. So say you take a full

454
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:37.530
Dawn Abriel: Film this morning, you go get your medicine and by eight o'clock tonight.

455
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:56.130
Dawn Abriel: You're having runny nose, and your gut hot and cold sweats will then you know you're going to need more. So what you'll do is in the morning you'll take one and a half and see how long one and a half. If one and a half last 24 hours will then you get to stop there.

456
00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:58.620
Kristy Chavez: Okay, makes sense.

457
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:00.210
Dawn Abriel: And

458
00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:07.620
Dawn Abriel: It really shouldn't be based on what the doctor wants it should be based on your body.

459
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.310
Kristy Chavez: Okay. Right. Yeah, I'm learning that

460
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.110
Kristy Chavez: Now,

461
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:29.460
Dawn Abriel: And and you have to be also very careful. I mean you you're alive. So something's working where you can take opioids and benzodiazepines, but boy, you really don't want to take them at the same time of the day.

462
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.070
Kristy Chavez: I don't I take about different times.

463
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.240
Dawn Abriel: Oh, good.

464
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.840
Kristy Chavez: Good, so I'm my goal is to get off of them.

465
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:42.810
Dawn Abriel: Yes, and and let Dr. Solomon help you too. I know your primary care is

466
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.630
Kristy Chavez: YOU ANYMORE THOUGH.

467
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.070
Dawn Abriel: Now, okay.

468
00:42:47.310 --> 00:43:00.570
Dawn Abriel: Tell Dr. If Dr. Solomon doesn't want to do it with you then then then tell him that I will do it. I'll put you in one of my groups. It just so happens that my therapist is full right now, but I'll work with you.

469
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:08.910
Dawn Abriel: If because I've done it before I send people off for benzodiazepines, so I'm comfortable doing it. I think he is too, but just asking.

470
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:15.030
Kristy Chavez: Okay, I don't have any more. Now, either for either that I'm adding those

471
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.960
Dawn Abriel: Aha. How long have you been out

472
00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:25.050
Kristy Chavez: Since yesterday, too, since I took my last time around I yesterday.

473
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:31.980
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, then I will order you some I rarely, rarely order them because I don't believe in them but

474
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:35.670
Dawn Abriel: I'm afraid you'll go into withdrawal and

475
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:40.530
Dawn Abriel: Have seizures. If I don't, so I will make sure you get some benzodiazepines.

476
00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:41.790
Kristy Chavez: Okay, thank you.

477
00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:43.890
Dawn Abriel: Haha, and

478
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:46.260
Dawn Abriel: So,

479
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:55.380
Dawn Abriel: The group is what you've committed to is an hour a week of group work, an hour a week of individual therapy.

480
00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.310
Kristy Chavez: Okay.

481
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:08.550
Dawn Abriel: The buprenorphine is a space holder it, get it allows you to not have to do the hustle. You don't have to go looking for the drugs. You don't have to be worrying about it. You take it once a day, you're set.

482
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:19.050
Dawn Abriel: The work the medicine is the tele therapy. It's the work the information you learn and do with the therapist.

483
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:27.720
Kristy Chavez: I agree. Okay. Yeah, cuz you don't have to worry about it, like how you worry about it all. Dave your medication or, you know, just it's horrible.

484
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:29.190
That's right.

485
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:30.900
Dawn Abriel: So,

486
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.350
Dawn Abriel: You do need to go get some lab work done.

487
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:47.880
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so the quest bright heart health has a contract with quest labs and you just call the quest lab and say,

488
00:44:49.020 --> 00:45:06.930
Dawn Abriel: I'm with bright heart health, and they should be able to download the order and you just go get it. If, by chance, they don't have your order there don't leave call brown bright heart health and say, I met this quest lab fax over an order.

489
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:21.060
Dawn Abriel: Okay, lead that easy. Shouldn't be coming and going. And oh my goodness, why bother with all that rigmarole just a call. But it's even easier than that we haven't had any problems in a long time. They've been keeping up with our list.

490
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:32.640
Dawn Abriel: If there are any abnormalities on the labs, your doctor element or I will get ahold of you and say, this has to be looked at more carefully.

491
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:50.100
Dawn Abriel: Okay, we do. He prescriptions electronic you're never going to get a piece of paper with your med order on it. So that means when you call the pharmacy, you'll say my doctor sent in an electronic prescription. Is it ready

492
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:59.940
Dawn Abriel: Okay and I strongly, strongly recommend that you say to them, I will be asking you to count out my strips when I get there.

493
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.230
Dawn Abriel: Okay, you can blame it on me. I am perfectly comfortable

494
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:14.940
Dawn Abriel: You can say my silly doctor. She just insist that I do this, but it's for your protection because people steal from the pharmacy they steal narcotics.

495
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.320
Kristy Chavez: That's true, yeah.

496
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.060
Kristy Chavez: And that'll be come on me.

497
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.620
Dawn Abriel: That's right, because we can't write for more

498
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.540
Dawn Abriel: Right, give you more and they'll all they'll see as well. We. That's what we packaged

499
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:36.510
Dawn Abriel: So great, but you got to tell them beforehand and you cannot touch the package if you touch the package, they will not take it back.

500
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.590
Dawn Abriel: Oh, by law, they can't take it back.

501
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.790
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so

502
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.670
Dawn Abriel: Hold your own hand sit on.

503
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:52.740
Dawn Abriel: You know, whatever it takes, don't take the package and say, I'm going to need you to count those out for me in front of me. My doctor ordered.

504
00:46:53.040 --> 00:47:08.550
Dawn Abriel: 10 I need to make sure they're attending there and they will. Oh, you're holding up the line, you know, or you don't have to do this, we know what we're doing and you say, oh, my doctor is going to get so mad at me. I just can't afford. She's a bitch. I can't sit you know she'll just

505
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:09.630
Kristy Chavez: Whatever.

506
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.620
Kristy Chavez: But get it done. Okay, I will do that. Okay.

507
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:13.980
All right.

508
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.770
Dawn Abriel: And every month right heart health will send you one of these

509
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:31.620
Dawn Abriel: A manila envelope. When you get it in the mail. Do not open it. If you open it, they will not use it. So you go to the virtual clinic, just the way you went here with me.

510
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:41.850
Dawn Abriel: And get in with us. And you say, Hey, I got this in the mail. What do I do with it and what what you'll do is you'll hold it up and you'll open it up in front of them and

511
00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:42.330
Kristy Chavez: Take

512
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.880
Dawn Abriel: One of these and then you'll open this in front of them and you'll take out a little urine cup.

513
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:50.190
Dawn Abriel: trading off to the bathroom.

514
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:55.530
Dawn Abriel: You'll make a deposit and you'll come back. Do not take your phone to the bathroom with you.

515
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.090
Dawn Abriel: We don't want it up.

516
00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.780
Dawn Abriel: And then you. Yeah. You think that's funny how

517
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:16.860
Dawn Abriel: You hold the camp up to your camera and you just turn it really slowly and the care coordinator will read the results of your, of your and that's once a month.

518
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:28.710
Dawn Abriel: Which means if you ever move, you have to make sure bright heart health is the first place to know that you have a change of address it costs about $25

519
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:30.510
Dawn Abriel: To

520
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:36.330
Dawn Abriel: The whole thing of mailing it the thing itself. So if, if you

521
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:48.930
Dawn Abriel: Don't have one then they send you to the lab or they don't charge you for sending a replacement, but they don't because the insurance will only cover it once a month.

522
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.040
Okay.

523
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.250
Dawn Abriel: To go to group.

524
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.880
Dawn Abriel: You have to

525
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:04.920
Dawn Abriel: fill out a survey each month, called the BAM or be as brief addiction monitor

526
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.480
Kristy Chavez: Okay.

527
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:22.350
Dawn Abriel: You can fill it out an hour before the day before you truly just don't want to wait till the last minute, if you wait to the last minute, you'll be late for group. If you're late for group right you get your medicine. When you, when you've been in the group for an hour.

528
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:23.610
Dawn Abriel: So,

529
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:29.700
Dawn Abriel: You show up for group you get your prescription. You don't show up for group then it gets complicated.

530
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:30.600
Kristy Chavez: Okay.

531
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.040
Dawn Abriel: That makes every

532
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:33.840
Dawn Abriel: If you ever do need to

533
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:52.230
Dawn Abriel: Miss group. It's just like any other appointment, you have the common courtesy of saying, Go to the virtual clinic or calling up bright heart health and saying, I won't be in group today. We don't need you know this year adults. This is your program. This is for you.

534
00:49:53.460 --> 00:50:02.610
Dawn Abriel: But also we have a lot of people who drop out, you know, their addiction is more important to them than their treatment and we know that so

535
00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.130
Dawn Abriel: We will charge

536
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.000
Dawn Abriel: For the missed appointment. Unless you call and cancel.

537
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:09.900
Okay.

538
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:31.560
Dawn Abriel: In group, you have to be just like this. We prefer that there be good Wi Fi. In fact, the only time we've ever had to, you know, say we can't do this is for people who don't have enough data or don't have enough Wi Fi where they can't do the telemedicine.

539
00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:39.060
Dawn Abriel: Helen medicine right if they can't be on video and can't hear. Well, then they're not getting the medicine.

540
00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.110
Kristy Chavez: Right.

541
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:47.160
Dawn Abriel: And everything is done like this, the group, the individual everything. This is an online business.

542
00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:50.160
Kristy Chavez: I like it like this and I like it. Well,

543
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.630
Dawn Abriel: Most people do.

544
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.030
Kristy Chavez: It's very convenient.

545
00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:08.850
Dawn Abriel: Now, and here's the very most important thing I can say about group. If anyone should ever walk behind you and I look accidentally look at your screen and recognize someone that they know

546
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:19.020
Dawn Abriel: That will be such a horrible violation of privacy. And as soon as that might have. If we see someone starting to walk, we will kick you out of the zoom

547
00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.400
Kristy Chavez: Okay, so

548
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:26.190
Dawn Abriel: Make sure you're alone and group encounters in the individual, it doesn't

549
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.080
Dawn Abriel: You know, you need the privacy but but especially important for group.

550
00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:31.980
Okay.

551
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.500
Dawn Abriel: I have to send you some Narc can by law. If I order a narcotic. I have to order Narcan also

552
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:59.370
Dawn Abriel: Okay and I in in the email. I'm sending you there's a little description of where you go on the computer to learn how to use it. It's really pretty simple. You take the cap off, stick it up their nose and squeeze. But, you know, the whole YouTube video to

553
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.070
Kristy Chavez: Tell you tell you that

554
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.720
Dawn Abriel: Official yeah

555
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:15.960
Dawn Abriel: So after we're done here. I want you to go back to the virtual clinic and do two things.

556
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:19.680
Dawn Abriel: Okay, to have them teach you how to do the BAM.

557
00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:36.090
Dawn Abriel: Okay refund monitor because you because you're going to have to do that every week because so you'll do the BAM, you'll go to the virtual clinic and you'll check in before group because the group room number the zoom number changes every week.

558
00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:53.220
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so see you and before any appointment. You go to the virtual clinic and check in, just like a doctor's office. You walk in the door. You go to the front office in the front office staff. Look at your insurance card. They'd night. Take a payment, you know, did you get your labs in right

559
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.780
Dawn Abriel: And then you go into the

560
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:55.800
Dawn Abriel: Exam Room.

561
00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.100
Dawn Abriel: So it's a similar arrangement. OK.

562
00:52:59.250 --> 00:52:59.460
Dawn Abriel: So,

563
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:20.310
Dawn Abriel: The other thing you're going to do with the virtual the care coordinators, when you go back, because you're going to do the ACE survey aceee adverse childhood experiences and that's just one time. It's only 10 questions, but it gives us an idea of your childhood experiences.

564
00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.860
Dawn Abriel: Okay, there was any trauma there that

565
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:27.180
Dawn Abriel: Would be important to us to know about. So when is your group.

566
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.310
Kristy Chavez: On Friday at 130

567
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:30.660
Kristy Chavez: Yes, ma'am.

568
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.960
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and where you're going to do after you're done with me, Russ.

569
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:39.630
Kristy Chavez: I'm gonna go back to virtual clinic and ask where's having to do the BAM and the a survey.

570
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.070
Dawn Abriel: Okey doke.

571
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:43.980
Dawn Abriel: It was really nice meeting you.

572
00:53:44.010 --> 00:54:03.690
Dawn Abriel: I think you're gonna like this program. You're going to like Dr. Solomon. He's a good guy and Serena's a good therapist again ask him if he's comfortable with the benzodiazepine taper and ask him sooner rather than later, because it's easier to switch groups in the beginning that it is

573
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:04.830
Kristy Chavez: And

574
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:11.100
Kristy Chavez: When you get into it. So do I do that. Just let me to on Tuesday when they're or

575
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:15.420
Kristy Chavez: African work or joy mastermind group they

576
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:26.010
Dawn Abriel: Asked him on group day, but I'm going to send him an email the same email I send to you. I'm going to send you the therapist and the doctor so that they know they have a new patient

577
00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.950
Kristy Chavez: Okay. Sounds good. I

578
00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:42.450
