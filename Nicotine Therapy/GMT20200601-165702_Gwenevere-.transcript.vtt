Gwenevere Abriel: For lunch. I kind of need to eat. I'm noticing starting to get a little lightheaded.

5
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.400

Jessica G: Yeah.

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to go grab a snack. And then we can both be true in each other's ears.

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.500
Jessica G: Okay.

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.870

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go do that.

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.320
Jessica G: Okay.

Jessica G: Yes, I feel, way better.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

18
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You got this sort of light hearted smile on your

19
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: House, how is this weekend for you.

20
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.350
Jessica G: Well,

21
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.710
Jessica G: It's been pretty good or above everything else like it started off.

22
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.290
Jessica G: Really have we had a breakdown

23
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.740
Jessica G: Welcome, we're moving into the new place already

24
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.030
Jessica G: Oh,

25
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You are. You're in the new place.

26
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so what's the deal with the bedroom, how did that play out.

27
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:37.320
Jessica G: It was a whole thing. So I got home from work one day and then he told me that he got the keys to the new apartment. And I was like, well, when are we going to start moving in and he was like

28
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:49.050
Jessica G: Sunday. And I was like, Well, I work sending is like will pack your stuff now. And I was like, whoa. Okay, so I'm going to be packing everything now. Meanwhile, you do what

29
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.520
Jessica G: You know,

30
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.130
Jessica G: And then he was like, well, I know where my fun stuff is going to go.

31
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:11.610
Jessica G: And I'll just be quiet because I think we would. And then I was on my phone for a while and rate. What did he say, and I'll say what do you mean by that, that, you know, we are some stuff is going to go on and he's all why

32
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.770
Jessica G: I was like, What do you mean why I'm asking you a question. Well, why do you ask

33
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.260
Jessica G: Like, what the heck. Tell me, I'll tell them quit quit being like, like quick stop.

34
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:35.310
Jessica G: Being like that and tell me what you know, what are you trying to say like, do you have something to say, you know, like, Well, I just know that my son stuff is going to go in his room.

35
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.330
Jessica G: And I was like,

36
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.020
Jessica G: That I just feel like that's messed up because

37
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.080
Jessica G: Like, you couldn't even at least give me the option, you know, like

38
00:06:53.130 --> 00:07:03.600
Jessica G: You can have been like, you know, well, I hear you. I understand that you feel like you need this for your mental health and, you know, there's the room day if you want it, like, you know,

39
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.950
Jessica G: Instead he's like oh, that's the rooms going to be my son's room. You need to figure out where your stuffs going to go like

40
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.530
Jessica G: Why, because I didn't pay anything because I didn't pay the deposit

41
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so in real time.

42
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this where the meltdown followed after that. Okay, so

43
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The details in this discussion are important. So you and I, you're after reflection. This is where you are today. But at the time.

44
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You try to steer him.

45
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And yet, there's still a bit of

46
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: There's still non direct communication.

47
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you took the option of not telling him in advance. That was a decision you made you said, Well, I don't want. I'm not going to do it in advance and say I want a room that was your choice.

48
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.050
Jessica G: Well, like

49
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:17.040
Jessica G: We had a conversation and I said it multiple times to him, like, Well, I'm gonna have my I want my own room like you baby can be in a room, you know,

50
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not

51
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.740
Jessica G: But I'll go, I don't like follow up.

52
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't say, hey, Ramon, what are your thoughts on that. Is that right,

53
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well he's letting his opinion and preference be known. He let you know.

54
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Z. Okay, so

55
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You did your part, it would have been a mature thing for him to have spoken a I want him to have his own room and then to to have heard his reasoning that would have been a appropriate time to do that.

56
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But he stayed quiet when you originally said that to him.

57
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.430
Jessica G: Yeah, he mostly just started telling me you know to shut up.

58
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

59
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.200
Yeah.

60
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is nowhere in the realm of healthy

61
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:17.610
Oh,

62
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

63
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.420
That just know

64
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so he's power tripping he he's seeing his power is in fact that he's

65
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing in money and but you're the one that wanted this two bedroom apartment to begin with. Isn't that right, you don't want to tell them hey

66
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it was such a if this was something so important to him, you know, might have brought this up earlier. So this is coming from something you wanted, which was to have your own space for your own mental health.

67
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So how did it go after he started saying, Shut up.

68
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, however it escalated.

69
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I know where my son stuffs gonna go then what happened.

70
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.810
Jessica G: I just didn't say I didn't have anything to say after that.

71
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:20.340
Jessica G: I was just really upset and then I felt like he was trying to pick at me like he

72
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:33.360
Jessica G: Like he would go. He went near me, and he had like this work phone and he was like playing each ringtone really loud, like right next to me.

73
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:50.760
Jessica G: And stuff like that you know and and i don't know what he was doing it on purpose to try to make me upset, but I just didn't even play into it and then another incident happened later on. And then my, my brother and his girlfriend Shane went over.

74
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.360
Jessica G: And I was a coach for them and

75
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:04.020
Jessica G: Even my brother who's like a total advocate for him was like what's going on with him. Like, why did he do that, you know,

76
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.680
Jessica G: And

77
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.940
Jessica G: So that was on my mind until the end that whole night. And then the next day.

78
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:27.270
Jessica G: Like I was in a good mood. I just, I have to get over it you know until I was in a good mood and everything was all good. And he was the one I was in a bad mood and quiet.

79
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.030
Jessica G: But I was off from work and

80
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.830
Jessica G: And

81
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.880
Jessica G: He was working just that just

82
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:51.930
Jessica G: stayed on my mind and bad about it and thought about it and better better than so, like, finally I broke down like

83
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.440
Jessica G: I'm gaining a really should pay our work so hard like

84
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:05.100
Jessica G: And I can't do nothing for myself. Like I wouldn't work. You know, and it's just

85
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:16.740
Jessica G: I felt hopeless at the moment and then I called my mom to talk to her. And then I think it just made it worse because she was like

86
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.070
Jessica G: She was out

87
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:29.490
Jessica G: With her boyfriend's family and it's just that's the whole thing in itself, but she's still listening to me and everything.

88
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:39.120
Jessica G: I just broke down and cried and cried and cried and I let myself cry and I let myself.

89
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:48.150
Jessica G: Be upset. And then I started taking deep breaths. OK. Now go got it out. And I said, taking deep breaths and I calm myself down

90
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you did reach out. Let me see on your relapse prevention plan, who you have listed for people that you trust you have

91
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Role

92
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And who might say,

93
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you.

94
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But you might not call him because you don't want him to freak out. He's one of your brothers that sort of sort of focuses on things and fixates on him a bit. Now you you also could have my names on here too.

95
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I did.

96
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Reach out to Gwen.

97
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Did it even be honest, because it's you gotta be honest with yourself didn't even occur to you I could reach out to her didn't even occur to you.

98
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:50.910
Jessica G: That's always my first thought every time after something happened to me to tell Glenn, but then I'm like, no, I thought myself.

99
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And is it is it I don't tell me what the side is the the counter thought i wanna i want to talk to win, but what

100
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:09.750
Jessica G: But it's going to be through text message. And, you know, like it just, I don't, I don't know, I don't wanna

101
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to want finish that thought.

102
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.170
I just

103
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.130
Jessica G: I'm like all just wait till Monday. I'll wait till Monday.

104
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a solution. What I don't wanna what

105
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.980
Jessica G: I don't wanna like

106
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.760
Jessica G: Impose or I don't wanna

107
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.340
Jessica G: You know,

108
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:50.940
Jessica G: Like either way. I know it's going to be vague because it's like you really can't get anything close to the text message. Okay, you know, so that's why I tell myself all just wait until Monday.

109
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:57.360
Jessica G: And even write stuff down like okay this is where I'm going to tell it like this incident that happened.

110
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

111
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.510
Jessica G: I was like I needed to win.

112
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's a difference. There's a difference between the moment this thing. You just said, which was I'M GETTING SHITTY pay you can see the power that Ramon has with his money and now you give that power away, but we won't get into that.

113
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt hopeless. Now that has my attention. If any of my clients ever have that sense of hopelessness and helplessness happen.

114
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you guys to know you can reach out now not only vague, you could just send a little emoji. You could just skip words all together.

115
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm because you guys rarely do it I'm gonna what it'll go in, is I'm going to write back. You doing okay. Do you want to schedule a zoom appointment.

116
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, it's true. I will want to meet in here because texting is really crummy at supporting one another, unless we have something set that I can say, and I know for sure it's going to land.

117
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: As you feeling cared about and supported and validated, but I don't have that setup with a lot of people I have it for like one or two people.

118
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But the difference is Jessica in your hopelessness, if you knew

119
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That you could have texted me. What would you have written or what would you have sent as a little emoji.

120
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.650
Jessica G: I probably would have said like

121
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.700
Jessica G: Like

122
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.320
Jessica G: Glenn, can we talk or

123
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.750
Jessica G: I'm having a really, really, really bad moment.

124
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Now I wrote that down. So now when this happens, and it may happen again because you're probably butting up against an edge of probably maybe what making a decision about whether you want to

125
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a different kind of job.

126
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:16.500
Jessica G: Yeah.

127
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.240
Jessica G: Yeah, that's

128
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:25.230
Jessica G: That's exactly what I thought I'll have all this training.

129
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you're probably getting close to that. So you got right up to hopelessness and typically when we reach that edge when it gets that desperate that miserable.

130
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It sparks. Well, what the f if it's going to get that bad, then I might as well go for it. And so that's that's what it looks like. So now I wrote it down.

131
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If this occurs to you again where you want to, you want to meet in zoom and I happen to be free. Remember I set my own limit, you don't have to worry about mine. We're agreeing right now if you're feeling that sense of hopelessness and helplessness.

132
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want it to, to lead to substance use to self injury. I don't want any of that. So, what I want is that you know in your worst despair. You are not alone. You don't have to do any of the kind of

133
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: overthinking and taking care of mom. The way you do with mom, you don't do it have to do that for me, I take care of myself. I will say yes, I can meet with you. Only when I mean it.

134
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not gonna say anything except I'm available at this time. And if I say it. Your job is to believe me.

135
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to give something unless I have it to give if I have. I mean, I either have appointments open or I don't

136
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But sometimes it gets to the point where, just a quick call is possible, sometimes not so much. Other times it is ok but the key is for you to know I can reach out to my therapist. That's why I have her

137
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not taking advantage of, okay, you're not alone. And now we have agreement and I even wrote it down.

138
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If you, if you reach out to me. It might sound like this. Hi, Glenn, it can be, it gets to be there. You don't have to go into detail because doesn't matter you having a big feeling

139
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, when can we talk I'm having a really bad moment. That's it. Or you could say, having a really bad moment or can we talk her

140
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Ha ha ha exclamation. Ah.

141
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, the response for me is probably going to be the same. Hey, are you okay, question mark, and then I'll probably say am I able to meet

142
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: In zoom sometime and then you respond. So you already know how it's going to sound. The problem I have with my site is it sounds so cold. It sounds. You know, it's hard, right, because it's so you're gonna have to remember me.

143
00:19:51.150 --> 00:20:00.870
Jessica G: But that's what I felt like that. First, sorry, I don't mean to cut you off. But that's, that's what I felt like at first, but now that I know.

144
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:09.480
Jessica G: You know otherwise. Now it's. It doesn't sound like cold to me like I know you know it's weird.

145
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Because behind behind the words. Are you okay, is my tone is my face is is my genuine caring for you and your family. Okay. And when I say Do you want to meet and zoom I meaning.

146
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to be careful. I have to be careful about you. I have to be careful about how my words. I have to see your face. I have to see. Is she nodding.

147
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is my intention being received and I can't do that very well through telephone and through texting. So I really need to see you.

148
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But there are some times when it happens that it's so critical. It's so in crisis that even a little voice from me.

149
00:20:49.410 --> 00:21:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be like, Oh, okay. I'm not alone. All right. And, and she oh yeah I can just do my breathing. I am I'm cared for. Everything's gonna be okay. Sometimes just even two minutes of hearing a positive voice can lift us out of our despair.

150
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you don't have to take care of me like you would a mom because she's you know you just the whole family thing around where, you know, you don't have to do that for a therapist.

151
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could just, I could just be the taker.

152
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. So back in. So now we've refined it the text can be. Hey, when can we talk I'm having a really bad moment and then we'll reach back. Now it does leave a margin of error because I'm in this weird Wi Fi spot. You can also call me I'm old school. I will listen to a voicemail.

153
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:42.420
Jessica G: You

154
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Can also call right heart health, you can log into virtual clinic. There's lots of different ways to say, hey, I'm kind of in crisis, having a bad moment. Can you get one to call me back. Something like that. That would be common for them to to hear

155
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's come back up to real time. How is it now. And how did you get, are you able to have your own room and how did you, how did you manage that.

156
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.020
Jessica G: Whoa.

157
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:30.390
Jessica G: What he didn't know that I was gonna say was that or like I told him like you don't know. Maybe I'm like kayden. No, I do want my son to have his own room, whatever the cases, you know, she doesn't know how I was going to react.

158
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.130
Jessica G: But

159
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.360
Jessica G: I just I gave him.

160
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.810
Jessica G: I gave him. And yeah, I did.

161
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.050
Jessica G: And I was like, just put my son stuff in his room and

162
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.280
Jessica G: Right now we only have my bed.

163
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.610
Jessica G: So,

164
00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.210
Jessica G: We put it on the master bedroom and that's where all three of us slept last night.

165
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.600
Jessica G: And then just looking for, like,

166
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What about a

167
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.300
Jessica G: Lizard

168
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What about a bunk bed where you sneak in and you just crawl in the top

169
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.270
Jessica G: Yeah.

170
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.780
Jessica G: You can meet

171
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: safety precautions, where he can't get up there.

172
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.340
Jessica G: Were

173
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking you know what a triangle is

174
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:35.610
Jessica G: Like a bird.

175
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, it pulls out another vegetables out. So there's two two twin beds. So there's a bed here. And then there's a drawer that pulls out where your bed is and

176
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, that's how you want it. This is the bed. I want you buy it and you go to bed and now that's where you're sleeping and he can't fit on there.

177
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you thoughts. I'm just brainstorming.

178
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:11.640
Jessica G: Yeah, yeah. I've actually thought about all of the same I've looked at Bank beds and there's one where it's a queen size bed or full size bed on the bottom and then that's when on the top or just stuff like that.

179
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.990
Jessica G: But for now.

180
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.570
Jessica G: I just gave him.

181
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:27.330
Jessica G: But the way that I brought myself back was right way like everything in this House is mine.

182
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.090
Jessica G: The couch the couches, our mind.

183
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:41.880
Jessica G: The bedroom furniture. Everything is mine. Besides this TV in the living room. Everything else is mine. And so

184
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:43.770
Jessica G: Like

185
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.300
Jessica G: He doesn't like oh, can I, how can I say this right

186
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.320
Jessica G: He's just on the high horse right now.

187
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.630
Jessica G: When really, he's barely even starting to put in

188
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.150
Jessica G: Any kind of work, you know, or any kind of

189
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.130
Jessica G: Effort.

190
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.520
Jessica G: Especially compared to what I've done.

191
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.140
Jessica G: Like we wouldn't have even had any of this. If it wasn't for me.

192
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.030
Jessica G: You know,

193
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:26.850
Jessica G: I brought myself back and like we got here and I sage the house and I prayed and prayed and prayed and

194
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.240
Jessica G: I'm just

195
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:47.490
Jessica G: Hopeful like I caught myself saying things like, Let's not do that here, you know, hey, I put a box for now in the closet, so that way you're not your dirty clothes is the main on the floor, you know,

196
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.420
Jessica G: Let's put stuff where it goes. Let's find a place for it, you know, because that's really what drove me nuts.

197
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.190
Jessica G: As I was just tired of living like that.

198
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.750
Jessica G: And then, and then it's on me because it's not clean

199
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.370
Jessica G: No.

200
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all.

201
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you, yourself, talk

202
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This doesn't sound like you're forever partner in your life. It doesn't sound like he's he's someone that you're in love with

203
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the biggest struggle or battle is within you being right it's

204
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what's your next move. YOU FOUND YOU YOU MADE YOU MADE THIS HAPPEN. You go talk to the, you know, you're the one that made this happen to your in this place because of you, your good ideas, your ability to write, make sure things get follow through. So

205
00:26:53.070 --> 00:27:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are crying and crying and crying. What is this thing he if you woke up tomorrow with one thing different. That would make all the difference in your life, what would it be

206
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.530
Jessica G: Probably

207
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.740
Jessica G: Be doing things on my own.

208
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you do

209
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: First step, we got to have in order to do things on our own.

210
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.350
Jessica G: Probably get a better job.

211
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of know that don't you

212
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

213
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it scary.

214
00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your fear. Tell me about it.

215
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.180
Jessica G: Because that means that I have to work a full time job or or normal schedule.

216
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep telling me what's the fear because

217
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Many people do. Tell me, what's your fear what will happen if you work a full time job in your worst imagination that's causing a ruckus up in that head of yours.

218
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.240
Jessica G: Just

219
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:33.930
Jessica G: Leave having to take my son to daycare having to Leland and learn him getting sick or

220
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:35.670
Jessica G: Hurt.

221
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.620
Jessica G: Or not being taken care of. The way I take her fam.

222
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.210
Jessica G: Are being molested or

223
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know any yeah I got you. I kind of guessed that. But I wanted to hear you say. So, you know, any kids.

224
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Are the kids have gone to daycare and their parents go off to work and nothing bad has happened.

225
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:18.750
Jessica G: Yeah.

226
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it possible that this fear of yours is based on your traumatic childhood that it's based out of your history and less about

227
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: There's plenty of people that do this.

228
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And because we're okay.

229
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If we happy mom.

230
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: A depressed. Mom, an angry mom a sad mom little boys going to pick up on that.

231
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get love and safety from 100 different people. Obviously, you're the most important person. I get that. But little boys.

232
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: They can get love from other people to support from other people. They get socialized. That means they're going to they're going to know how to interact with other people. There's good things that happened with that.

233
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can focus on those good things. And yes, some people might call it rationalization. But what about you.

234
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If you end up losing it hopeless says to me. I mean, what if you got really hopeless. What if you decided to relapse, or worse, what if you decided life wasn't worth living.

235
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Now how great a pit. Mom, are you going to be then like there's a lot at stake your happiness is your sobriety and happiness are central to your son's to the whole system working, it's you.

236
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about that tier

237
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.160
Jessica G: It's just

238
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.230
Jessica G: Like I know my son picks up on it.

239
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

240
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:22.920
Jessica G: I know the dancer. My niece was over the other day and I heard how he was talking to her.

241
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.860
Jessica G: That just made me snap like it made me like

242
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:48.120
Jessica G: Like realize that he sees everything like really realize it. You know, I just look past few days, I've just been like

243
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:57.390
Jessica G: Being more careful not to get angry around him not to yell around him.

244
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.820
Jessica G: Because I don't want him to be like that.

245
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.900
Jessica G: I don't want him to be like, I want you to be happy.

246
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son wants his mom to be happy to.

247
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't here. You're the center of it.

248
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You have got to be okay with you, you'll be more patient will be more playful creative, they'll have more energy.

249
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's going to pick up on that too.

250
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

251
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You have an idea of what the first step would be to actually

252
00:32:54.150 --> 00:33:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: reality testing. So, for example, reality test would be, I'm going to all I'm going to do is just go to to daycares all I'm going to do is set up appointments and to go in and look around and I'm just going to drop in

253
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Not even a schedule anything just going to drop them.

254
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Where the yelling in the waiting room was it clean. I'm just going to right. I'm just gonna jump in.

255
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, they may not let you pass us first buzzer door right we kind of hope that because we want security. Right.

256
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

257
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your first Q, isn't it. Oh, I was able to walk right in. That's a problem. How did I get in here. You don't know me.

258
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So we need a buzzer. We need safety, safety, safety, that's going to help you because you have a lot of fear around safety and what's the vetting process, how to, how are people hire. Do you do background checks.

259
00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And and how are you, if I want a spot check. I want to leave work and I want to come by and see my son.

260
00:33:53.790 --> 00:34:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I've had some you can be big. I had some things happen. And I'm worried about a safety and you know you can play make fun of yourself. I'm one of those

261
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Those moms. You know those moms and they'll be like, oh yeah, a lot of you are like that. Oh, we love these kids, and we do background checks and we checked, blah, blah, blah, blah.

262
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just came up with one step that would address fear. What did you think about even with that idea of just just brainstorming here. But what does it make you think about

263
00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:32.850
Jessica G: Um,

264
00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.360
Jessica G: It made me think of like

265
00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.270
Jessica G: Maybe finding somebody to take care of them.

266
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, come into the home.

267
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.920
Jessica G: Yeah, like hiring somebody

268
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:52.950
Jessica G: But

269
00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:01.710
Jessica G: And all and it made me think of the time that I will do go look at a daycare, but I scheduled

270
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.540
Jessica G: Over the

271
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.220
Jessica G: Office.

272
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just Jessica.

273
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You see how you can play with that but you know where those are like

274
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's about

275
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know this inappropriate touch this molest thing. Jessica, if you register CC. Please don't realize how much your gut, your intuition registers unhealthy people

276
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been around somebody you couldn't quite put words to walk, want to be around them, but they gave you the creeps.

277
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.500
Jessica G: Yeah, definitely.

278
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really, that's your gut saying something's off. I don't have words or a story for it, but I don't want to be here.

279
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got a tune, most of you guys in this program aren't tuned into that you've been denying it for years. Right. And so you use drugs to repress that intuition repressed that gut feeling.

280
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's been there. It's been messaging.

281
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it isn't in the gut. For some people it's this sort of tightness in the chest. For some people it's up in the throat.

282
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But the body tells you, something's up. We just have to turn in and start to trust it.

283
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You walk out and say thank you and that's it. You don't know me an explanation. You don't know, add them an explanation, something's off and you move on.

284
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you'll notice, wait a minute. I have a warm fuzzy feeling here. I feel relaxed. I even want to play. I want to have conversation. Hey, I like this place.

285
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the big hurdle is your son, his safety. I know that if if there's going to be a list of things to do as far as brushing up on a skill or refining something to get you to a job that has a higher paycheck.

286
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, first you're going to need to overcome your fear of something happening to your son.

287
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So when so if someone were to come to your home, right, I forgot. We're not going to daycare. So this idea of having someone come to the home when someone so when people are trustworthy. Right. They can look you in the eye. They also break

288
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A break away someone that you think oh good eye contact means it's a perfect fit. That's not actually true. Someone who only stares at you stare stare stare stare stare and doesn't break as a problem to

289
00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone who doesn't right when you ask them, direct questions they dance around and give vague vague responses. Those are signs, something's off. And so you just maybe you go on the internet, you look at what a really great

290
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, hiring babysitter questions ones that really get it things and you'll say, hey, part of the interview process is I'm going to do a background check, and

291
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to check, am I going to find anything. And then you could just ask them, and then you may not have to pay for it because they'll say, Yeah, I have. Blah, blah, blah. Well, then you just save yourself.

292
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: MONEY BECAUSE THEY TOLD YOU.

293
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.320
Jessica G: To

294
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Drop in anytime say hey listen I'm one of those moms that's, you know, I call myself a helicopter. Mom, I say, hey,

295
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I might going to drop in because it helps relieve me psychologically

296
00:38:49.590 --> 00:39:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I go through waves in certain parts of the day where I have extra worried. So you might see me drop it and don't get yourself offended. This is just about me relaxing into this idea of someone taking care of my little one. And we just tell them we normalize it for him.

297
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you think

298
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.070
Jessica G: That made me feel really calm.

299
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.650
Jessica G: And

300
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.220
Jessica G: When I see myself there like peeking through a window.

301
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So there are places, you know, online, they already are pre background checks, they they spend extra money to go on to like sitter city or something.

302
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And they already paid money to to have their background check, check, so that when you're trying to interview them you can see

303
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see their hours. You can see if they're CPR certified. You can see if they have any specialized training. What age kids. They like to work with their, you know, and if they have a background check.

304
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:15.210
Jessica G: I just me. I was before in the now I would have to get myself into a car until vehicle because

305
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.520
Jessica G: I need something reliable.

306
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay car. Got it.

307
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just curious how much money may not have any since you just moved, but do you have any money tucked away.

308
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.840
Jessica G: I have like a little bit

309
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like $200 how much you got

310
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.940
Jessica G: No like 350

311
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Need a reliable car. So it's not just a car. It is insurance.

312
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we need car insurance to. And do you have a driver's license.

313
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful.

314
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.590
Jessica G: And then done sharing some, the one that's really

315
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.670
Jessica G: Paying insurance for his car.

316
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.000
Jessica G: Not buy toys.

317
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So you already have that money going out. So you're already used to spending on that. So that's already embedded in your, your monthly budget.

318
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.420
Jessica G: In my budget year

319
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.100
Okay.

320
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.850
Jessica G: I'll just switch it over to the other card.

321
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:31.500
Jessica G: As

322
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, OK. So again, but here's the thing. You already analyzed what someone texted you.

323
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.210
Jessica G: Yeah, they're calling me

324
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:43.350
Um,

325
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So you already did this. You already analyzed it and the first step is car, but there's steps before car, meaning there's boy someone's trying to get you

326
00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.200
Jessica G: I hate when he does.

327
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

328
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.380
Jessica G: My brother.

329
00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Text him and say, Hey, I'm in a doctor's appointment.

330
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so where would you go, how would you do, what would you do online. Would you call your brother and ask ask one of them to drive the over to car lot. What would you do and then and then is this more about the coven like what comes before getting a car so you know there's steps beforehand.

331
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:36.540
Jessica G: And getting the down payment together first and then my uncle works for a car dealership.

332
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.880
Jessica G: car dealership.

333
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.440
Jessica G: So right now it's just a matter of

334
00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You sure you want to text him.

335
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost done. Anyway, that's funny.

336
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.110
Oh,

337
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there it is again uncle has a dealership so uncle may also be able to finance. I don't know if that's something you ever do where you put it. You know $350 down and

338
00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: At an interest rate, unfortunately. But you could do that. And then you're on your way. And then you could pay it out right once you've gathered up the money.

339
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's now we're back to

340
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting to the dealership. So for you, what is, what are the steps that are right now and getting over to a dealership. What are five things you'd have to do before you got here.

341
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:53.640
Jessica G: Have

342
00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.140
Jessica G: The money.

343
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:07.920
Jessica G: And if I did get financed, I would have to do it through my mom credit because I'm dig my credits. Very good.

344
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

345
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:11.760
For

346
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.600
Jessica G: Not to

347
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Checked on that you've you've checked on my credit karma.com and seeing what your number is

348
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now can I know like are you catastrophizing is it above 650 or below.

349
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: 656 50

350
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:32.700
Jessica G: And you in between, like, five and 650

351
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you talked with the credit bureaus about what you need to do to bring it up.

352
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:38.790
Jessica G: No.

353
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's something you can do. By the way,

354
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:42.270
Jessica G: Yeah.

355
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Humans over there.

356
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd like. However, what, what's this and. Okay. And do you know what to do to bring it up.

357
00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So sometimes it's one of those things where they're like oh you you have a credit card that has an outstanding debt.

358
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you need to contact Victoria's Secret or something and start making $25 payments on it. Sometimes it's that. And then they can see a month of on time payments and then what starts to go up. Sometimes it's just as simple as that conversation.

359
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.100
Jessica G: Whoa.

360
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes there's bad. Some people steal identities and they have really messed with you and they put credit cards out and there's not like you need to this is fraud.

361
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to file a police report and this is not me, and I need you know this off and I need to have it removed so

362
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The more we're our heads in the sand and we're in denial about it that credit stays low but yeah we need it for all kinds of things having our name on a lease financing a car or an apartment.

363
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Or, you know, sometimes I haven't seen it, too. Too often, but

364
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes employers pretty rare. They'll look at your credit, but

365
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Not very often.

366
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

367
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.220
Well,

368
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:19.650
Jessica G: I know I do. Oh, okay. I had a bill. I had a phone with sprint.

369
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:22.110
Jessica G: And

370
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.920
Jessica G: I know that I old

371
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:35.580
Jessica G: But then they called me and they told me that I have charges that they wrapped up my real up to $2,000 they

372
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:45.570
Jessica G: Were they didn't believe me when I said that my tablet with all my information boss phone right from under me

373
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:54.660
Jessica G: Literally all sitting, then they ran by that and I try to chase after well all my information on that.

374
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.660
Jessica G: And that's why the

375
00:46:59.010 --> 00:46:59.970
Jessica G: Police are more. Yeah.

376
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how I said police report.

377
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: POLICE REPORT.

378
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.060
Jessica G: So I have no drugs and stuff.

379
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:10.410
Jessica G: Like

380
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That. So here's. That's the deal that's part of the picture. I CAN'T. WE CAN'T bypass that.

381
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't behaving in your right mind doing responsible things which the rest right the rest of your community and you would do now, I think.

382
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is something that you report it. And the reason we report is because we're going to have to answer to maybe someone else.

383
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We reported it stolen. So if anyone asks, I reported. It's official. But you were hiding in other parts of your life. And so you were too busy probably making sure you have the next score.

384
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

385
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.650
Jessica G: Then they run to

386
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Favor, yeah.

387
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is going to sting a little bit. Jessica, but

388
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict. Got you.

389
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Got you in debt.

390
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:09.990
Yes.

391
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a fact. It happened right. We can't pretend like it didn't happen. It did. And I don't know what else

392
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But you, Jessica.

393
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Are going to have to deal with it.

394
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that can be a motivator to be like, I'm not going through this again, you're not going to put me through this again right that internal dialogue between you and the addict inside

395
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to put me. You're not gonna let me do this again. I wasn't responsible. I was there was chaos in my life. I'm not going through that again.

396
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I want stability structure consistency, you know, and you can brush that that voice of addiction that wants to tell you to escape again into that world and that life. But the truth of the matter is,

397
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be a little pissed off with the attic for this, but it's left to you. It's in your lap to solve it.

398
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it unjust. Well, an addict has never been on your side to begin with. So sorry, it's the truth.

399
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

400
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

401
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.500
Jessica G: Motivated look at it like that.

402
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

403
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We can use this opportunity to get a little pissed off. But let's directed at the right place, not at you. You're the one that wants to do the next right thing but at the attic and say, you know, I know you're not much of a swear, but my role did the FAQ. Look what you did you turn

404
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I'm going to go pay for this but I ain't doing it again. I'm a bail you out right you talking to yourself certain, you know, a bail you out and get this to read. I'm going to call sprint and I'm going to ask

405
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I I had something going on. I DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE REPORT.

406
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I would love to have it wave, you can always ask for the dream question I'd like to have it way.

407
00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta say no but

408
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe because of Kobe there'll be like fine. We're waiving all that nonsense. Look at my good credit history. Now, I've been making on time payments. Is there any way you could wave this

409
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't file a police report, but it is gone.

410
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll say no. Be nice if they said yes. And then you say, I can't afford to pay it in lump sum. I do all have to deal with this. It was stolen identity but

411
00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like on the record if you could put me to

412
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Your department where I can report that this is an identity theft. You can take a look at these numbers.

413
00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: If they're not, you could cross compare ones that I'm doing. And they're not the same. I don't even know these people. But I wanted on the record that this occurred. And then if they continue to say you need to still pay it, you need to still pay it, you need to still pay it.

414
00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you say, how, what is the minimum payment that I can make a month.

415
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might be 510 dollars might be 25, I don't know, but you'll, you'll be to pay down. And guess what, now when the attic says, hey, free and clear. No one's watching. Let's go get high.

416
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to remember

417
00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Two grand

418
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Two grand to cost me MoFo.

419
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel me

420
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.670
Jessica G: Yeah yeah yeah

421
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Thanks a lot.

422
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not too bad, too.

423
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.870
Jessica G: And a lot of jail time a hit and run

424
00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing good short term high long term consequence.

425
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember if it means that you pay two grand for really good quality therapy and treatment, then that's what you write it off. And that's what you're writing it off. Fine. This is my treatment, so I don't forget.

426
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I better go.

427
00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So are we were good for tomorrow morning for group and then next Monday.

428
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:15.120
Jessica G: This

429
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This this deal we got going. But again, if you write if you are starting to get into this

430
00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Calling sprint getting out the facts. All you're going to do is data gathering just data. I could call my call. I could find out if they have financed for, you know, how much would it be to finance a 510 THOUSAND DOLLAR CAR I'VE GOT 350. What do you got

431
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the minimum credit score and what are some ideas. If you're just you're one through five lists that you have in front of you, you just are on data gathering and then you can say, okay, now I have my information how easy it to transfer insurance.

432
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, you're just getting your, your data gathering list.

433
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.230
Jessica G: Just a few things you know

434
00:52:55.530 --> 00:53:07.740
Jessica G: And I've been thinking about that too, like I like I want to make a goals list. I want to make a list of things that I need to do and like to check them off. You know, I feel like that would help me. So I think that's where I'm going.

435
00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To do it now, today, write it up.

436
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.490
Jessica G: Yeah. After we

437
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't make it more than like like for things. It can be you'll you won't be able to do it. And then you'll you'll poo poo. The list.

438
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't put it on the list and let you lead. Like, literally, if I write it down. I'm going to do it today. These are the tiny step ones that's going to get on the phone with sprint.

439
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Number two, I'm going to call my uncle and it counts. If you called and he was online. That's still counts but circle back and see if you can actually speak with him and ask him about financing with some ideas are

440
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then whatever your number three is enough, the most for but honestly, if you get one done that's great but don't write don't write your, you know, 20 things to just do three or four, the next day.

441
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.150
Jessica G: Okay that's simple enough.

442
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.780
Yep.

443
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's all

444
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It ever takes to get a goal. It's just micro steps. Each day, believe it or not, then all of a sudden you're like what the heck I'm, I'm actually near my goal. I can't believe it, but it takes tiny little steps. They're not these big grand sweeping things they're tiny little steps.

445
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

446
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:25.560
Jessica G: Okay, thank you.

447
00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Have I be good to

448
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:28.620
Okay.
