00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.330
Helena Rouhe: Hello.

2
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.540
Helena Rouhe: Hi. Hi.

3
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.640
Helena Rouhe: Are you doing

4
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.070
Brian Riley: I am doing

5
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.620
Brian Riley: Fine.

6
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.550
Brian Riley: I think I'm generally

7
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.560
Brian Riley: How are you doing are

8
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.730
Helena Rouhe: You buying yourself time

9
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.470
Brian Riley: No, just

10
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.600
Brian Riley: So gifted people

11
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:13.560
Helena Rouhe: Oh, you're fine. I don't expect you to check in on me, but I am fine. Thank you. And that is not insecure neurotic, and emotional. I'm just cruising along

12
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.380
Brian Riley: Okay, yes, I'm

13
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.320
Brian Riley: No, you know,

14
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.890
Brian Riley: I imagine

15
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.120
Brian Riley: Better or worse than many of your others.

16
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.660
Brian Riley: We're all in the same

17
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:47.970
Brian Riley: Ship and I'm definitely trying to remember last time I remember it was very emotional tied in with the

18
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.610
Brian Riley: First pharmacist.

19
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.540
Brian Riley: Identity.

20
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.540
Brian Riley: Thing and

21
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.630
Brian Riley: The more

22
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.560
Brian Riley: The more work. You have to cover our phases of the lesson, given the ship. You know, it's crazy. I'm

23
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.460
Brian Riley: So, you know, the

24
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.780
Brian Riley: Dialogue businesses really crap. The

25
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.120
Brian Riley: money's

26
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:27.780
Brian Riley: Situation and Esther had signed on to

27
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.020
Brian Riley: I don't know. It's been very

28
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.610
Brian Riley: I think it's a combination of things. I know that where I used to be.

29
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.300
Brian Riley: In all in a lot of ways. If this happened and anytime before now.

30
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.500
Brian Riley: It would be a lot more difficult and

31
00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.350
Brian Riley: One of those things is the financial thing that

32
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.740
Brian Riley: I really haven't been

33
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:16.230
Brian Riley: Bothered by like from the time that it happened. I haven't been going really, I've never, I haven't been very upset about the loss of the money and

34
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.430
Brian Riley: In looking at it now because I look at it, it's not

35
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:33.000
Brian Riley: Because I, in any way, enjoy.

36
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.910
Brian Riley: Esther carrying us

37
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.910
Brian Riley: But it's not bothering me.

38
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.740
Brian Riley: Like it did when I first got to California, partly because of the circumstance and that everybody's

39
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.870
Brian Riley: But even like within the household. There's no

40
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.980
Brian Riley: There's no pressure.

41
00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.670
Brian Riley: And I have been able to contribute weekly

42
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.190
Brian Riley: You know, nowhere in there.

43
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.640
Brian Riley: But I make sure to at least

44
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.720
Brian Riley: Take care of things and

45
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.670
Brian Riley: So anyway, she had Esther had

46
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:32.130
Brian Riley: signed on with this thing called post mates and it's a it's another app. And it's a delivery, sir. So you'll get you'll get a notification. Do you notice

47
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.330
Helena Rouhe: No, I mean, there are a lot of these things that are coming up now, which is great.

48
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.520
Brian Riley: Yeah, so it's, uh, I'll get another. Here's an example. I got a notification.

49
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:50.850
Brian Riley: I do, I want to accept the delivery visit to Walmart. So I accepted go to Walmart I parked in this designated trays. Everything is like

50
00:16:51.600 --> 00:17:01.590
Brian Riley: Really lined up for this. Now, I don't know if this is pre pandemic, or what but there's parking lots spaces available your park there.

51
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:14.640
Brian Riley: The people kind of Walmart with the ship and you give them the name and they give you the stuff and then you drive it to the person's house and there's instructions on where to leave it leave it all that stuff and

52
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:28.110
Brian Riley: Now the way it is now. I mean, I'm not even having contact with these people. I'm just leaving it on their porch. I'm putting a line across the signature and I make whatever $11 and

53
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.540
Brian Riley: So,

54
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:39.540
Brian Riley: In the very beginning, the first couple of weeks as her had said.

55
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.120
Brian Riley: That she was starting to apply at like Amazon.

56
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.940
Brian Riley: And and that that bothered me because they're all she does a great job. So

57
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.160
Brian Riley: Then things started to get very serious and like

58
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.450
Brian Riley: Her daughter went to an interview at Safeway.

59
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:15.930
Brian Riley: And actually declined a job when she realized shoot me a cashier, so it seemed that even though there were jobs available, the potential for

60
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.420
Brian Riley: weakening the danger.

61
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.610
Brian Riley: Was very real. So I just dropped the job search all together.

62
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:30.360
Brian Riley: And it was never brought up. It was never mentioned, really, I just thought it was like this understanding

63
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.710
Brian Riley: And I mean I'm pretty in tune to like hints being chopped up. So there was nothing.

64
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.740
Brian Riley: Except like Sunday night.

65
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.050
Brian Riley: I've been trying to force myself like at the data, watch.

66
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:59.040
Brian Riley: So I was sitting there and I was watching a movie and she got back from doing she signed up for it. She does. She's done like three delivered

67
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.570
Brian Riley: So she just she had gotten back from this delivery and I was watching a movie on the couch.

68
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.550
Brian Riley: And

69
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:31.260
Brian Riley: She link to the to the app, which is like, you know, I mean, that's that. Yeah, I had asked for it. But, but, like, a week ago prior and it just made that made me feel shitty that I was, I don't think she intended to say, you know, get off your ass while working

70
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.490
Helena Rouhe: Right.

71
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.360
Brian Riley: But here's the link. So it was resentful at first and

72
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.010
Brian Riley: And then I realized to, like, as I was thinking about it when I started to get resentful.

73
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.440
Brian Riley: I needed this book.

74
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:57.870
Actually

75
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:05.610
Brian Riley: And I was able to really see what I've done over the past year or two years.

76
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:19.620
Brian Riley: And so this break isn't really bothered i mean i i i like it i i'm i'm bothered by the

77
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.170
Brian Riley: The nature of

78
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:31.080
Brian Riley: The uncertainty in the open ended or something, all that. But I don't have an issue with living

79
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.200
Helena Rouhe: Good.

80
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.670
And

81
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.790
Brian Riley: But so I sign on the second thing, and I love it. It's great because it's like

82
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:55.260
Brian Riley: And it's just like rover. So I'm figuring out how the tricks are and I know what to do and you just go and we don't get that many notifications at her house because we're kind of out of

83
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.650
Brian Riley: The hotspots what's considered

84
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:08.160
Brian Riley: Which is downtown by the Walmart, Home Depot legit. So yesterday.

85
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.090
Brian Riley: And today I between my walks. I just parked there.

86
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:23.070
Brian Riley: And the phone goes off and I go and I do these delivery. So I had three yesterday and you can choose when you go online.

87
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:32.700
Brian Riley: And so today, after my walk. I sat down there and I walk in rope, you know, and I had my phone. I went to the MRI.

88
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.190
Brian Riley: And it's so

89
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:47.130
Brian Riley: Because, though I haven't been too bothered by it. I have gone to my mother, a few times for $20, you know, here there.

90
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:56.520
Brian Riley: Because I do have my daily. I like to go to 711 from lunch. I like like my ship in the morning.

91
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.620
Brian Riley: I try to get myself a little present every day.

92
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.930
Brian Riley: For the morning I have this

93
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.840
Brian Riley: I think I showed you the job by job board and it's got a little figurine.

94
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.830
Helena Rouhe: Uh huh. Yeah.

95
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.300
Brian Riley: And

96
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.510
Brian Riley: That's a thing now with

97
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.890
Brian Riley: Collectors is they have these little baggie blind, they're blind bags so

98
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:33.540
Brian Riley: Toys. And each one is like three bucks you go to the dollar store there $1 to find them and I tried to get one for every day. So every morning.

99
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:43.770
Brian Riley: It's great, but every morning I have very open and so and then I take a little guide I go to my

100
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.330
Brian Riley: On my board. I just been doing building a shelf for my battlefields.

101
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.050
Brian Riley: I

102
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.050
Brian Riley: Turned to the classic said read Lord of the Flies

103
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.510
Brian Riley: I got into we talked about real before right you know

104
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.480
Brian Riley: You see that

105
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.930
Helena Rouhe: It's been a while. But yeah.

106
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.120
Brian Riley: I tell you what I think about that movie.

107
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:26.250
Brian Riley: a surprising amount of time. And I realized after watching it again I moments like this. I watched it, because I think about that all the time.

108
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.780
Brian Riley: And I think it's a really good movie to watch in this situation like I recommend to my son.

109
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:45.420
Brian Riley: And there's some other books that I've picked up and I started like actively writing again and my art is getting really good

110
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.720
Brian Riley: Like I could really

111
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.370
Brian Riley: I could really draw like I've been wanting to

112
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.490
Brian Riley: For about a year or so.

113
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:05.100
Brian Riley: Wow. Yeah. So I'm starting to see like results in that you like, I could just like with like will wash and convert and

114
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.420
Brian Riley: So that

115
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:11.610
Brian Riley: Those are all

116
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.540
Brian Riley: And medication wise and begin good

117
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:26.010
Brian Riley: Smoking is not fabulous. I'm not. I don't love the lodge and juice.

118
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:28.380
Helena Rouhe: I don't think

119
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.210
Helena Rouhe: anyone loves the Law Center.

120
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.690
Helena Rouhe: Server, to be honest.

121
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:46.620
Helena Rouhe: I mean it's kind of like the GM you know you're not supposed to just keep chewing it you just to it a little bit. They stick in the back of your mouth and then you to it again when you need it. I mean these things are more user friendly to the world, but they're not

122
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.510
Helena Rouhe: Excited.

123
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.380
Brian Riley: They're strong, very strong.

124
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.280
Mm hmm.

125
00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.690
Brian Riley: Show implicit all just like a lot of time so

126
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.850
Brian Riley: It's work.

127
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.790
Brian Riley: My I have a spawn see

128
00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.670
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, how's that going and

129
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:19.680
Brian Riley: It's good. And it's a trip because it's really making me look at me.

130
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:26.040
Brian Riley: Because I know, I know what I know and like, for example,

131
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:33.480
Brian Riley: And I'm doing things that i i normally wouldn't do in terms of calling somebody will ship because

132
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.350
Brian Riley: I get it, and I know this this

133
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.930
Brian Riley: Sunday we got together for

134
00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.570
Brian Riley: Get together like

135
00:25:47.100 --> 00:26:00.930
Brian Riley: Twice a week to read the book. And so we got together on Sunday and we sent out this bench and he and apparently this was like very rare for him, but he really unload and he's

136
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.100
Brian Riley: tried this.

137
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.400
Brian Riley: Big and we bonded and it was a very strong

138
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.540
Brian Riley: Beating and

139
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.080
Brian Riley: So he's supposed to call me every day.

140
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.410
Brian Riley: And it's a big deal.

141
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:20.340
Mm hmm.

142
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:26.790
Brian Riley: You know, and, and he knows it. And I noticed and we just know it is. And so

143
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.360
Brian Riley: He had done this before, too, and I fucking see it and I know and that's what's so silly as that.

144
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:43.890
Brian Riley: Like, I'm sure you know, when we do shit like and you just know you know and

145
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.770
Brian Riley: So,

146
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.440
Brian Riley: The first time.

147
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.170
Brian Riley: Like when he first started calling, he was calling like nine o'clock.

148
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.690
Brian Riley: Right, and then

149
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.170
Brian Riley: And then one day he didn't call

150
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.550
Brian Riley: Huh. And so the next day I called him up.

151
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:19.020
Brian Riley: And I said, You know, I know what you're doing is, but I always say, if it was me, like, because I know be

152
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.840
Brian Riley: Yeah, right. And

153
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.640
Helena Rouhe: And and that's how you know it anyway. Right. You're just you're waiting

154
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.770
Brian Riley: And that he was just waiting and waiting and waiting until the end of the day.

155
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:44.370
Brian Riley: And building up a resentment throughout the day. And then finally, by the end of the day before it's too late. He gives me a call. So I said, Why are you doing that to yourself, why don't you just get it out of the way. The first thing

156
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.600
Brian Riley: Is you

157
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.090
Brian Riley: Telling me once, by the time you know

158
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.880
Brian Riley: So I said, Now, why don't you just call before noon.

159
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:10.650
Brian Riley: Okay, so he's been doing great. He's been called before noon. And so then Sunday we have this else and so that day that he didn't call he had done finished. Step one. The day before

160
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.240
Hmm.

161
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:22.380
Brian Riley: Right. Yeah. So yeah, so then now Sunday. He has this really strong emotional day and he was like breaking all sorts of down

162
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.840
Brian Riley: And he doesn't. I can call the next day, right. So I'm like, all right, so

163
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:35.640
Brian Riley: He did, actually, I think he even texted like yesterday was that he didn't even call it on that was kind of like

164
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.910
Brian Riley: This is bullshit really because

165
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.700
Brian Riley: Don't deny that.

166
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.140
Brian Riley: You know I'm concerned.

167
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.690
Brian Riley: You know,

168
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.570
Brian Riley: And I'm dying to know what he was going to say.

169
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.940
Brian Riley: So today, it's like quarter to 12 today.

170
00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:04.290
Brian Riley: Like, son of a bitch. He's not gonna he's fucking like a call again. So then and now thinking maybe he's relaxed. Maybe it was such a strong day

171
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:06.900
Brian Riley: That

172
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.670
Brian Riley: And show. It was like five after 12 and he called

173
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:21.660
Brian Riley: Like nothing ever happened. And so I said. I said, Why didn't you call, and he said, Whoa, whoa, whoa.

174
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.390
Brian Riley: And I said, Why did you call it.

175
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:35.910
Brian Riley: Long time, no. But you said, why didn't you go and he said, I don't know why it just

176
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.880
Brian Riley: Last night, and I didn't think about it. I said, so you didn't think about a long day.

177
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:55.140
Brian Riley: And I looked at my phone and I said, Oh man, I haven't called to this is bullshit. And I said, Do you know what I know and I did the whole thing. And like I said,

178
00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.340
Brian Riley: You know, I'm sorry to even have to analyze these phone calls.

179
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.310
Brian Riley: But when it's directly related to program, you have to look at what you're doing.

180
00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.240
And

181
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:16.050
Brian Riley: Basically we bonded a bit on Sunday on Saturday and Sunday and what you're doing now is you push away.

182
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:22.620
Brian Riley: Because that's what we do. So a call me on it, you know, and he's a cool well

183
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:23.760
Brian Riley: That's the thing.

184
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.980
Brian Riley: So,

185
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.540
Brian Riley: You know,

186
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.910
Brian Riley: And it was uncomfortable.

187
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.710
Brian Riley: Yeah, sure.

188
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.660
Helena Rouhe: But it's also uncomfortable for you in the sense that you get to

189
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:45.690
Helena Rouhe: See what it's like on the other side. Right, so you can call it out, but you're the one doing the calling out, but it also keeps you accountable to your point, right, and this

190
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:53.460
Helena Rouhe: Is why it's such an important part of the program to be of service to others because by being of service to others. We're still accountable to ourselves.

191
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.550
Helena Rouhe: You know when you're being congruent.

192
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.550
Helena Rouhe: When you're not being you can hold your sponsors.

193
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.720
Helena Rouhe: more accountable when you're

194
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.960
Helena Rouhe: And it's just a win win so

195
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.680
Good stuff.

196
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:12.240
Brian Riley: Yes, yes, good is really making me change my view to

197
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.370
Brian Riley: Good, because

198
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.870
Helena Rouhe: Sure. So let's look at last week.

199
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.330
Helena Rouhe: Because last week, I thought we were going to meet and you, you realize that

200
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:26.190
Helena Rouhe: So,

201
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.210
Brian Riley: That was

202
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.910
Helena Rouhe: Totally fine. Right.

203
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.450
Brian Riley: It's not

204
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.830
Helena Rouhe: Right. And you were accountable.

205
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.890
Helena Rouhe: I actually made a decision because I was

206
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:54.300
Helena Rouhe: Gonna text you. And then I thought, No, I'm not going to text Brian cuz he and I have been working quite a bit together. I'm gonna let him decide right if you're, you know, I'm going to. I didn't want to to to get yourself upset if I

207
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:59.340
Helena Rouhe: Tested you and you were like, Oh my God, you know, I didn't want it to be that I wanted it to be.

208
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:08.880
Helena Rouhe: That if you were able to remember, then it's fine. And it was you who wanted to meet regularly because of all the things that were going on. So it's like, well, maybe he's okay. Yeah.

209
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:15.600
Helena Rouhe: I'm going to go with he's okay. And he doesn't need to me. And then you checked in with me. So I knew you were okay and then I was like, okay, good. So

210
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:25.620
Helena Rouhe: But for schedule wise, it's good to kind of make sure we're clear. So, in, in, that's part of this whole process. Right. Is this being clear where

211
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:44.850
Helena Rouhe: There's this identity of what we need and then maybe what we think we need and kind of reconciling that orienting ourselves and it's a lot going on. So, so that you know it's not anything I hold any kind of resentment or grudge against you for what happened last week. But it's funny.

212
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.650
Brian Riley: Right, that this is coming up.

213
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:55.440
Helena Rouhe: Now, as far as you and your spawn. See, and kind of the accountability piece and then we had that little whatever it was last week. And so, and

214
00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:02.940
Helena Rouhe: I think it's just kind of an interesting dynamic because you're finding yourself shifting and having to kind of go with this.

215
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:12.030
Helena Rouhe: You know, this is the world. And now there's now you're going to do this other thing. And it's working out you're finding way to make that work looking at how you manage your

216
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:20.820
Helena Rouhe: Own resources and there's a lot of great things that now you're finding with your creativity and I think maybe you're getting a

217
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:21.720
Helena Rouhe: Different sense

218
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:27.510
Helena Rouhe: There definitely would have been a time not that long ago that you wouldn't have been as

219
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.620
Brian Riley: Flexible

220
00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.480
Helena Rouhe: As I'm hearing you be now.

221
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:41.700
Helena Rouhe: You're definitely rolling with the punches, if you will, and you're trying to find new ways to manage the stress and you're, you know, recognizing what's going on in the world and you're not

222
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:52.860
Helena Rouhe: Seemingly to reactive to it. And even when you are reactive to it. You're not then beating yourself up about that forever, you're going, wow, I had a reaction and you're managing that like

223
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:58.860
Helena Rouhe: There's a lot of personal growth that I'm hearing from you and what you shared so far, which is fantastic.

224
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:11.520
Helena Rouhe: So I think when you had originally scheduled wanting to me you were thinking that you needed more support. Now you're finding. Maybe you don't need that much support, but you're finding the support and other ways, perhaps, which is great.

225
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.090
Yeah.

226
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:17.700
Brian Riley: Yeah.

227
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:20.070
Brian Riley: And to

228
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.490
Brian Riley: I mean, to clarify what

229
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.340
Brian Riley: What that was that was

230
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:32.460
Brian Riley: And I really. And that's, I think, but what it was too. It's, I guess I didn't

231
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.300
Brian Riley: Realize that I had

232
00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:42.600
Brian Riley: Because it didn't feel like it was time for session. And that's why I didn't even

233
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.800
Helena Rouhe: Know, I haven't been paying attention that that's to my organizer.

234
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.620
Brian Riley: Exactly so. Yeah, yeah, that

235
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.060
Brian Riley: Was a complete slide of

236
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.380
Helena Rouhe: A little bit of

237
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:53.220
Work.

238
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.590
Helena Rouhe: Well, and so that's something that you can use as you're working with your spawn see

239
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:09.750
Helena Rouhe: Your reconciling with this kind of phenomenon yourself to your point, it didn't feel like you needed a session. So it wasn't on your radar. It was written down somewhere.

240
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:23.340
Helena Rouhe: You could look at that. And at some point, you did, and he was like, Oh, gosh. So then there's, how do you, how do we as human beings reconcile what feels right, because it's really important to pay attention to that. And also what we've committed to

241
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:35.130
Helena Rouhe: So that you are looking at that and saying kind of connected to both things and also seeing when you're too committed right and you're seeing now that you kind of enjoy this break and

242
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:44.550
Helena Rouhe: You know the society and these expectations and all that you're appreciating it's okay to have a less committed schedule or some more flexibility in your schedule so

243
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:56.940
Helena Rouhe: Again, it kind of goes back to this interesting kind of yang, yang of, oh, I should be meeting and doing all these things and then there is what you actually need and reconciling to

244
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.950
Helena Rouhe: Some interesting dynamics going on there.

245
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.300
Brian Riley: Yeah, and I think like as you're talking to.

246
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.520
Brian Riley: I I'm liking that.

247
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.720
Brian Riley: What I'm meeting is

248
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.580
Brian Riley: It's helped

249
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.370
Helena Rouhe: You know,

250
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.640
Brian Riley: Like I'm not

251
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:37.020
Brian Riley: Give them like now that I'm given the chance. Like, I think this is giving everybody

252
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.830
Brian Riley: enough rope to hang up and like

253
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.700
Brian Riley: I haven't dwindled down into

254
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.640
Brian Riley: You know, binge watching

255
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.750
Brian Riley: Filling the time with a bunch of bullshit.

256
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.120
Brian Riley: Good, I'm

257
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.240
Brian Riley: Or ruminating you know like

258
00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:58.920
Brian Riley: Yeah.

259
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.800
Brian Riley: So that's good. I do.

260
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.900
Brian Riley: Know Esther's having

261
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.500
Brian Riley: A hard time

262
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.460
Brian Riley: She, she was a

263
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.240
Brian Riley: We have a

264
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.340
Brian Riley: Couple of sessions.

265
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.980
Brian Riley: And just stuff comes up there that we don't talk about

266
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.200
Brian Riley: And she's saying that she had

267
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:43.380
Brian Riley: sort of been denying and putting off the news and went over the past week or so she's really

268
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.210
Brian Riley: Expose yourself a lot more to a lot of different angles.

269
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.570
Brian Riley: She started to get very frustrated

270
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.750
Brian Riley: And

271
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:02.760
Brian Riley: Like Saturday. She really needed to get out of the house, like we needed to go for a walk in.

272
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.000
Brian Riley: And she made it happen. All that and

273
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:09.750
Brian Riley: I

274
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:12.660
Brian Riley: Just think.

275
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.320
Oh,

276
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:24.660
Brian Riley: But she says

277
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.640
Brian Riley: I think things are changing.

278
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:49.020
Helena Rouhe: I am. I'm also noticing, and I'm kind of reiterating what I've already said, but just in a different way. I'm also noticing that the way you are seeking out support and balance is more about your

279
00:38:52.350 --> 00:39:16.920
Helena Rouhe: Daily life. Your support within a na with Esther with kind of other commitments as opposed to like needing as much therapy support and or group support like it's gone from being a need for a lot of clinical support to more a need of, hey, I need to be a part of my community.

280
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:19.590
Helena Rouhe: Which is great.

281
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.930
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and we're happy to

282
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:35.730
Helena Rouhe: Be here clinically if you need it. We're happy to be here, but I think that you are at a place now where you can adjust and manage the stressors through other more kind of day to day stuff as opposed to needing a clinical

283
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.970
Helena Rouhe: injection of sanity.

284
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:41.490
Brian Riley: Yeah.

285
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:47.190
Helena Rouhe: And. And if you find that you need more clinical support that doesn't mean that everything's gone

286
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.210
Helena Rouhe: Sideways. It just means that I think you're starting to

287
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:58.440
Helena Rouhe: Shift how you're managing your life to where you can manage your life within your life as opposed to meeting all this

288
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.870
Helena Rouhe: Kind of external validation

289
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.690
Helena Rouhe: The port and that have been

290
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:14.130
Helena Rouhe: A shift for you and one that is different for you than what you've experienced before in the past. I think when you've made those

291
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:24.900
Helena Rouhe: Decisions in the past, you weren't quite really ready to make those decisions and then you were kind of jumping the gun and things got a little bit sideways. This seems like it's different.

292
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:34.440
Brian Riley: Yeah. Well, as you talk. What's striking me is it. I think what I used to feel like I needed to do was

293
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.500
Brian Riley: soundboard it a lot.

294
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:38.070
Helena Rouhe: Right.

295
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:38.970
Mm hmm.

296
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.980
Brian Riley: And I know you're still

297
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:46.770
Helena Rouhe: Now you're yeah but now you're doing within your own community, you're, you're seeing

298
00:40:47.910 --> 00:41:01.530
Helena Rouhe: You're seeing the angle of what's going on for you within your own fancy and so your soundboard and kind of your own stuff without it being your stuff, you know, as you're working with your sponsor and you're going, I know you. I see what's going on there because you're ready.

299
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.370
Helena Rouhe: Yeah and that yourself. Right. And the same thing with Esther.

300
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.290
Helena Rouhe: Kind of seeing that without it being about I'm going to tell you how to live your life, you're just kind of recognizing

301
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:16.680
Helena Rouhe: Well, I think she could get out more, but I need to get out more. And that's, that's why I think you could get out more because it's good for me to get out.

302
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:29.100
Helena Rouhe: You know, so, so it doesn't have to be. Hey, you need to do this because I need to do this. You can do what you need to do. And then in a caring loving way make a suggestion that doesn't have to be any kind of agenda.

303
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.780
Brian Riley: Yeah.

304
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.370
Brian Riley: Yeah, it's good.

305
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:45.750
It's good.

306
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.160
Helena Rouhe: So do you coming back to group.

307
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.410
Helena Rouhe: What would the, what is the date you have to

308
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:56.430
Brian Riley: Be there Monday.

309
00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.650
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so it'll be there Monday.

310
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:06.030
Helena Rouhe: OK, and then how often are you doing your couple things with Esther and Shawn at this point.

311
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.150
Brian Riley: How often are you guys me every two weeks.

312
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.710
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so did you meet this week, or your meeting next week.

313
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:25.230
Brian Riley: So a meeting. So I have group next week. I have Sean. Sean The following week, so you want to meet the week after that.

314
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.690
Helena Rouhe: Well, that's kind of what I'm wondering is if you would like to do that or do you want to kind of

315
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.290
Brian Riley: Kick it out.

316
00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:41.790
Helena Rouhe: To like once a month, or do you want to play around with it because you can always like, I'd like it to be 24 hours in advance, but we can set something up, and then you can check in.

317
00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:48.270
Helena Rouhe: With this idea of, does it feel like I need a session because I totally respect that. I just want to have some notice

318
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:49.740
Helena Rouhe: So,

319
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:50.940
Brian Riley: Here. Yeah.

320
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.350
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, no worries. So we can set something up for

321
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:06.570
Helena Rouhe: Looks like either may 5 or may 12 I'm not. I don't know if I follow the, the timing there so may may 28 would be, I'm sorry.

322
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:15.600
Helena Rouhe: April 28 would be next week, and you're going to have group on Monday, so you don't need to come next week to me, then the following

323
00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:22.920
Helena Rouhe: Week is the first week in May and I think you said that you have a session with Sean and after that week.

324
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.960
Brian Riley: Sean. OK.

325
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:30.870
Helena Rouhe: And then, so then the following week would be the 12 may 12 would be

326
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:31.440
Yeah.

327
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:32.790
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

328
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.010
Brian Riley: So I'm gonna put you down.

329
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.810
Helena Rouhe: On the calendar for me 12

330
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.460
Helena Rouhe: And I

331
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.430
Helena Rouhe: Mean like six o'clock is better for you than

332
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.510
530

333
00:43:45.510 --> 00:44:02.100
Helena Rouhe: So that works for me. So I'll put you down from a 12 to six and then on the 11th. Maybe you put on your calendar to review is that, you know, time for a session. Do you feel like you would like to me, in which case we'll keep it on the calendar.

334
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:07.020
Helena Rouhe: And if you feel like I'm actually good. You're at a point where

335
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:17.160
Helena Rouhe: You can just come, you can just come to group and do sessions. If you need to, with Esther. I'm happy to continue to meet with you, but I feel like you're kind of

336
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.420
Helena Rouhe: At a point where we can

337
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:27.030
Helena Rouhe: launch you into the world and do the occasional check in, but I also don't want you to feel like I'm kicking you to the curb. And that, that's it. We're done.

338
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.880
Helena Rouhe: Okay, because I think

339
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:34.320
Helena Rouhe: I would never otherwise. Fantastic. So I want to honor that.

340
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:35.850
Brian Riley: Thank you.

341
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:42.180
Helena Rouhe: You're very welcome. So for now, we'll have it on the 12th and then we'll just see where this all plays out.

342
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.580
Brian Riley: Yeah, so I'm in closing

343
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.550
Brian Riley: Yeah how's it. How are you, how's it going, are you

344
00:44:51.330 --> 00:45:00.120
Helena Rouhe: I am good. Thank you know for me, my life has just become a little bit cleaner and then instead of going off property to do

345
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:10.530
Helena Rouhe: equine therapy sessions which I had a couple of contracts. I'm just staying here taking care of my horses and writing and training and doing bright heart. So, my life is relatively simple.

346
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:12.390
Helena Rouhe: WHICH I LOVE.

347
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.020
Brian Riley: Yeah, maybe you did a big transition right before all this bullshit.

348
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:24.390
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, exactly. So it hasn't been too big of adjustment, other than it's just kind of cleaned up my schedule a little bit. I'm getting a lot more projects done around property which

349
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.960
Brian Riley: Are horses that threat.

350
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:42.600
Helena Rouhe: Horses are not at threat. So it's the only the only shift in schedule when it comes to my horses, because I compete all the competitions have been canceled until further notice. So

351
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.650
Helena Rouhe: That's kind of delayed thing, which is fine. I have a young horse that I'm training and so it's okay to have more time.

352
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.250
Helena Rouhe: So I'm not, you know, these are not problems really

353
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.570
Helena Rouhe: So, but I do feel bad for people who are trying to do very big

354
00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:09.450
Helena Rouhe: Time, things like the Olympics got delayed till next year. And there are some people out there that their lives are really dramatically changed because of this, and I feel bad for them. But, you know, we need to be think so.

355
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:11.790
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

356
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:13.800
Brian Riley: Yeah.

357
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.840
Brian Riley: So George and I have been in close contact or friends.

358
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:19.770
Brian Riley: Oh good, and

359
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:27.060
Helena Rouhe: I'm sorry you guys kind of like physically, you know, meeting up and connecting. Are you just doing

360
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:27.900
Helena Rouhe: This for now and

361
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:32.460
Brian Riley: A few times, we have a few times but mostly it's just we tech we text a lot

362
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.160
Brian Riley: That's awesome. Yeah, it's really good.

363
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.050
Helena Rouhe: That's great. That's good for both of you.

364
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.420
Brian Riley: Yeah, we're, we're very similar. Yeah.

365
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.420
Brian Riley: Yeah, it's good.

366
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.340
Helena Rouhe: That's fantastic.

367
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.250
Helena Rouhe: It's funny how it all plays out, huh.

368
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:57.270
Brian Riley: Yeah yeah cuz he's close enough where it's like, it's not ridiculous to think about, you know, someday doing something

369
00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:58.260
