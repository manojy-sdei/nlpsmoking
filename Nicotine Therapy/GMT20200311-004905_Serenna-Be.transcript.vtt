00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.810
Erika Sporleder: Okay, that's

174
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.220
Serenna Beers: All that it does.

175
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.920
Erika Sporleder: Data sets and missing so much. Yeah.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.040
Erika Sporleder: I called him later. And I said, Did you meet those needs. Yeah, it does. It doesn't face need a bit

180
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.030
Erika Sporleder: But it hurts.

181
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:19.710
Erika Sporleder: Though

182
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.630
Erika Sporleder: Because I chose pretty much chose jobs or work my marriage at the time.

183
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.300
Erika Sporleder: What about it and he loved me so much. Thanks for that.

184
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.200
Erika Sporleder: It's hard for me to accept it. If it's hard for me to live with.

185
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.370
Serenna Beers: So closure meaning for

186
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.110
Erika Sporleder: Give nobody sounds fun.

187
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.840
Erika Sporleder: Yeah, just do so I can move forward. Okay.

188
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:48.030
Erika Sporleder: I'm step I'm feel, you know, like, oh, we can work it out, you know, no it's not gonna happen.

189
00:13:49.110 --> 00:14:00.480
Erika Sporleder: Okay so still stuck in that thought of. It's going to be can try. You know, you know, you still being already. And it's probably because we still have sex together, which we shouldn't do that makes it even worse.

190
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.350
Mm hmm.

191
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.410
Erika Sporleder: So it's just, it's weird.

192
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.500
Erika Sporleder: Yeah, but then they yes I live by myself.

193
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.760
Erika Sporleder: I have a two bedroom condo. It's like 900 square feet. It's because you for me.

194
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:17.910
Erika Sporleder: So it's lonely lonely, because I don't associate with any people because the majority of my friends were dirty. So I pretty much

195
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.570
Erika Sporleder: By myself.

196
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:20.670
Erika Sporleder: My

197
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.710
Erika Sporleder: Own. Yeah.

198
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.200
Serenna Beers: Being alone, rather than being with drug

199
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:39.030
Serenna Beers: Abusers i think is better though you can maybe learn different ways to have fun or different ways to spend your time. What other things do you like to to do as far as like, are there any hobbies.

200
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.820
Serenna Beers: That you like the

201
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:49.920
Erika Sporleder: Class many and I don't have the information I love doing crafts and stuff. But that's money. I mean everything I read, you know, I mean, I can go to the library and bolts and screws.

202
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.930
Erika Sporleder: Everything costs money. And so it's

203
00:14:52.590 --> 00:15:03.240
Erika Sporleder: Like what they have you and I could find myself but you know all involved in something you didn't know you need money to do it, then I just started depressed. I can't get I can't go ahead as ended it down myself. It's a vicious cycle. I live. It's crazy.

204
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:12.300
Serenna Beers: What about, um, let's see, did I miss anything as far as you want to work on closure with your yeah

205
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.650
Serenna Beers: With your D my

206
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.470
Serenna Beers: Yeah force and more on

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:23.040
Erika Sporleder: You know i mean i getting custody of my son. I'm getting 50 you know present it back, just as a lot

208
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.210
Serenna Beers: Okay.

209
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:31.410
Serenna Beers: Well, it's really good. It's really good to have just even if we just start with some short term goals. Right.

210
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.290
Serenna Beers: Yeah. Okay. And then, you know,

211
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.880
Serenna Beers: You will talk to your, your therapist, which I'm not sure who was assigned

212
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.380
Erika Sporleder: I think Mary, Christine.

213
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.880
Serenna Beers: Okay.

214
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:45.870
Erika Sporleder: I don't know.

215
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.620
Serenna Beers: I'm not

216
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.150
Erika Sporleder: Remember that one. Okay.

217
00:15:48.480 --> 00:16:02.340
Serenna Beers: But I do know that you know that she will see this and then she'll learn, you know, all the different things that you said so the divorce custody of your son. And is there anything else before we close

218
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:08.820
Erika Sporleder: No, I do need. I need to refill on my data. I think it's called a child, I am out

219
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.800
Erika Sporleder: lata the today.

220
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:22.740
Serenna Beers: Okay, so what I can do is when we end this call. I'll send a message to the care advocates saying that you had said that you needed a medication that's not my

221
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.420
Serenna Beers: Okay, my area, but I can definitely pass that message on

222
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.050
Erika Sporleder: With able to

223
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.630
Erika Sporleder: Fill it tonight because I haven't taken it. And tonight's

224
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:44.700
Serenna Beers: My recommendation then would be to actually call them because you're probably if you cut out the middleman me and you call them. I'm not sure how that works. If they would send a message to your doc, but I know that they would

225
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.560
Serenna Beers: Do all of that out.

226
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:52.830
Serenna Beers: Um, I believe it would be the Karen navigator

227
00:16:53.970 --> 00:17:08.940
Serenna Beers: I will find out for you. Erica I'm as soon as I I hang up the phone with you. I will let them know that you told me that you were out of that medicine and could somebody reach out and and call you with them.
