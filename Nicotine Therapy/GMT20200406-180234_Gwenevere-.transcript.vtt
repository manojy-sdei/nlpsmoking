00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.280

Gwenevere Abriel: Afternoon is still afternoon over there.

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.630
Bethany Shadid: I've been having issues with the

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.320
Bethany Shadid: Sound not coming on right away. I have to like actually join it. It says it's weird.

6
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, noticing a change to

7
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.390
Bethany Shadid: How are you

8
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, little a little low energy

9
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.860
Yeah.

10
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.490
Bethany Shadid: Not your normal perky so

11
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Although if I didn't announce it probably no one would notice but

12
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean,

13
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.170
Bethany Shadid: I hear that

14
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what about you.

15
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.260
Bethany Shadid: So I am in a lot of pain.

16
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh dear.

17
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.840
Bethany Shadid: Still passing the kidney stone.

18
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.210
Bethany Shadid: Cheese and

19
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:52.410
Bethany Shadid: Glad to talk to you today because I find myself in a bit of a predicament. And I don't know what the policy, it is, but the day I texted you.

20
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.050
Bethany Shadid: About having the kidney stone. I also called in to the

21
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.300
Bethany Shadid: You know,

22
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.630
Bethany Shadid: Virtually yeah and told him.

23
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:28.620
Bethany Shadid: You know, Dr. Rob real knows that I have kidney stones. I'm calling. Can you just please let her know, You know that this is happening, and they were like a bit confused. Oh, so you, you just want us to tell her I said yeah because I'm not sure what to do. And so they're like, okay.

24
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170
Bethany Shadid: I haven't heard anything, this has happened multiple times.

25
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.180
Bethany Shadid: And so I went ahead and just did what I do, but yeah.

26
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

27
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.030
Bethany Shadid: Go ahead.

28
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: There are, I'm going to share my perspective, she will share hers.

29
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When

30
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: When a medication is an as needed. Kind of thing while then we use the medication as needed. If you're on a particular dose.

31
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're in a treatment program right you're in a treatment program this sort of saying, well, let's get you taper down to, to a dose, but then you have these additional medical episodes that are happening.

32
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I this is where it gets really tricky. Okay, so be careful not to confuse it with

33
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I say

34
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How to put this. I think this is something you could relate to

35
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever order a medicine.

36
00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Would a doctor ever order a medicine, if they had never met the patient. They had they'd never looked at an MRI. They never looked at testing.

37
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And made a diagnosis and they'd actually seen a record would they ever just order a medicine for a patient. They had never assessed.

38
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably not, unless it's a family member, right, it'd be some really odd thing to do, just randomly you call the doctor and said, Hey, I have ADHD. Please give me nothing. Yeah, let me have I dance.

39
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I then likely to do that.

40
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.640
Bethany Shadid: If you're established with a doctor.

41
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:45.150
Bethany Shadid: That's not my scenario. Yeah, no, no. But, and they haven't like assessed you for that. Um, it is, it happens, but it's not very common. Yeah.

42
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So that again that's in the doctors lane. That's all the doctors lane, the behavioral part the behavioral health part is smiling in my lane is

43
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How does my client, how do you distinguish

44
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Behaviors of addiction versus

45
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Vacation versus taking the medicine. I was told to take as needed. So there's at least three and there's probably more pieces of it than that. But that's a bit where I might start to come into play in the discussion I don't prescribe um

46
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I cannot know where that is. And this is where this is where the fact that

47
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say you never texted me right because how would my relevance come into play. What difference does it make whether your behavioral health professional knows. Think about it for a second. Why would it matter. And then I know that

48
00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something going on there just play it all the way out. See if you can tease out. Why would matter that your therapist knows that you're having a kidney stone. Why do you think would be important that I know.

49
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.940
Bethany Shadid: I think it's important because to me.

50
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.160
Bethany Shadid: I wanted to be as open and transparent about it.

51
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.490
Bethany Shadid: Because of my

52
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:40.350
Bethany Shadid: History with the medication and, you know, having somebody else to help hold you accountable, you know, for those reasons. I think the other side of it, too, was if you're not getting somewhere through the

53
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:51.180
Bethany Shadid: Regular lane of checking in clinic and not hearing that was the reason is thinking, you know, letting you know as well. Okay.

54
00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's just talk about, I don't want to make any assumptions. So, Bethany. Have you taken medicine outside of what is prescribed on the model.

55
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And for how many days.

56
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.770
Bethany Shadid: Since I text to once

57
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And then so and then. So how much. Yeah.

58
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.470
Bethany Shadid: So, and that's what I wanted to kind of wanted to talk to Dr. Aubrey L about, you know,

59
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.560
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, and I'm come to group, you know, in the morning and talk to her, but

60
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The more it's organized. Now, the easier it will be for you to relay it tomorrow.

61
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.140
Bethany Shadid: I agree.

62
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.530
Bethany Shadid: I'm since Thursday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, like, five days.

63
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've been taking how many milligrams a day.

64
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.310
Eight.

65
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.390
Bethany Shadid: Which is

66
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.220
Bethany Shadid: Two and a half milligrams

67
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

68
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your pain level for those five days.

69
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:16.770
Bethany Shadid: Eight.

70
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: When did

71
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when did it start

72
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.830
Um,

73
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.230
Bethany Shadid: I guess Wednesday night.

74
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.520
Bethany Shadid: Like evening. That's why I didn't text you till Thursday day

75
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.240
Bethany Shadid: So actually I think I've been at eight for six because I took

76
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.080
Bethany Shadid: Wednesday, which is part of my issue.

77
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So after we continue talking. It turns out you had been taking it since Wednesday.

78
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

79
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever

80
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Gone without any pain medication when you've had a kidney stone.

81
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The pain level.

82
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.460
Bethany Shadid: It's like a seven or six

83
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.110
Bethany Shadid: Um, I can, I can function.

84
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.610
Bethany Shadid: But when it gets higher than that.

85
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.540
Bethany Shadid: To keep me out of the emergency room I take more but yeah

86
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's history of pain without any pain.

87
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Relief through an opiate. What was the pain level what number we got

88
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.930
Bethany Shadid: It was sorry the

89
00:09:52.470 --> 00:10:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain level, can you tolerate. Have you tolerated in the past when you either couldn't or didn't take any thing for it.

90
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.240
Bethany Shadid: I've been able to to

91
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.200
Bethany Shadid: Uncomfortably handle seven

92
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing to address if we assume that there is a connection between the mind and the body. If we say that philosophy might have some grounding in psycho physiology. What are you doing,

93
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To address

94
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: your stress level head on. What are you doing, it's proactive to address it. Would you say

95
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.550
Bethany Shadid: I'm staying very hydrated, which helps flush.

96
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:03.570
Bethany Shadid: I take medicine to help open up the urethra and and help it pass more quickly.

97
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:16.560
Bethany Shadid: I walk the gravity helps. Um, but in terms of like comfort or distraction, things like that. I have a

98
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:33.180
Bethany Shadid: litany of things that I do. One of the big ones is getting sucked into like a TV show or something that I can distract myself okay hollering yesterday.

99
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you watch what did you get into over this weekend.

100
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.570
Bethany Shadid: murder mysteries.

101
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.820
Bethany Shadid: Stuff where it's totally not related to anything close to my reality.

102
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.630
Bethany Shadid: Because yes, something that I totally

103
00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:12.630
Bethany Shadid: I and that's part of my TV issue is that I can zoned out so well because i've i've i've used is such a distraction. During these episodes that I can really give or get into something

104
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:14.550
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

105
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So one way to do that. You can benefit from both is is to take advantage of the phone to take advantage of the

106
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see me show you

107
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only the alarm. He say, I'm going to watch a TV our show. That means I can get lost in it.

108
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But not lost to the point that I stop these other things that are going on in my life. That means you can have both.

109
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you can do it with a timer more doing that before. Now you're just I whatever I'm just going to get lost in it and you've gotten where you've come to me and made a complaint about yourself as if you you don't get access to that. But now, if you say, well, I'll set a timer.

110
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't regulate the end date the end time for something which is pretty common. And people identify with challenges with attention.

111
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then the that'd be pretty common. So set a timer that I get a binge for the next two and a half hours and Dang Dang Dang. Look at that. Those who enough hours have passed and the alarm says go for a walk.

112
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and I would also invite you, you probably already have this, but if you don't

113
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: See because what do they call it up on time tomato timer has I polish tomato timer, but you can set it for a certain amount of time. Sometimes time feels like this weird to saying like, you can't really you're not maybe good at guessing how much hasn't

114
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So these are really cool because it gives you a visual on it, you can actually see the line.

115
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Movie and see this tomato moving it gives you this. Okay, I see this is real. It's not this nebulous thing because

116
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe it's just numbers all kind of disorganized everywhere. But this, this can help sort of solidify what time is so I put this to see how good of a kind of like, it's called tomato timer to really simple.

117
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You can change the amount of time that it's set for you can have a few preset ones. Pretty easy to adjust them.

118
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have that. Now I'm going to ask it again. I

119
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Took what you said and I wrote it down. So if the underlying assumption is that our interpersonal relationships are intra personal relationships that are mental health.

120
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Effects the cortisol levels of our body, which may affect the responsive, maybe even your kidneys function. Maybe, maybe not. But let's say it does for the for this conversation. What are you doing to address your mental health.

121
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you can mitigate frequency number intensity of these stones.

122
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.050
Bethany Shadid: Honestly,

123
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.610
Bethany Shadid: My life has improved so much

124
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.380
Bethany Shadid: From where I was that I just continue

125
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.740
Bethany Shadid: I what I'm doing in that respect, the big

126
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:36.600
Bethany Shadid: Thing, the outlier that has been hard to the images stress level and

127
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.420
Bethany Shadid: I would say that I have a plan right but

128
00:15:45.420 --> 00:16:06.930
Bethany Shadid: Not being quite there yet, you know, still having to put up with the work stuff a little bit this past week was great being out of work I was able to, you know, do a lot of things that were enjoyable and stress relieving and stuff, but I think

129
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:18.630
Bethany Shadid: I I had been feeling the pain on and off since my last day of work when my coworker passed away.

130
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.220
Bethany Shadid: Um,

131
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.870
Bethany Shadid: But I thought, you know, because I know I understand that I have pseudo pains.

132
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.740
Bethany Shadid: And so I didn't, I didn't do anything until Wednesday, where it really hit hard

133
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:53.520
Bethany Shadid: And so I think that, you know, this stressful event at work and moving and everything triggered it. But it wasn't fully passing still, you know, Wednesday evening.

134
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.470
Bethany Shadid: Um, but it's it's been

135
00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.150
Bethany Shadid: How would you say

136
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:13.380
Bethany Shadid: With the quarantine to and having to be alone during it, you know.

137
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.940
Bethany Shadid: I've thoroughly enjoyed

138
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.210
Bethany Shadid: It's not great but

139
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:32.820
Bethany Shadid: I think I needed a break for so long that I don't mind having it all to myself. Sorry, I'm just very uncomfortable. Um,

140
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.190
Bethany Shadid: What was the question.

141
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say, let's say I heard you. I think you mind hearing. And again, my moving my office, the passing of my coworker and the continued work stress triggered it. So now what are you saying I i

142
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.630
Bethany Shadid: Well, yeah.

143
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:15.750
Bethany Shadid: I, I guess what, what I'm doing about that is I checked with my friend about the job I applied for

144
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.300
Bethany Shadid: You know, so I have my exit timeline all set up.

145
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.210
Bethany Shadid: And unfortunately they're

146
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:30.180
Bethany Shadid: holding off on doing any hiring right now because their office is closed. Yeah.

147
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.760
Bethany Shadid: And so

148
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.910
Bethany Shadid: I'm

149
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.550
Bethany Shadid: I'm kind of in a holding pattern. Okay.

150
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.910
Bethany Shadid: But ultimately, that's the goal is to get out of the job because it's not

151
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.900
Bethany Shadid: It's not good for my health. This isn't okay

152
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay there. So the job is not good.

153
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is that

154
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.160
Bethany Shadid: It's very true.

155
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.850
Bethany Shadid: get triggered.

156
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:23.130
Bethany Shadid: Almost every day when I'm there, even when I'm not there by the unprofessionalism

157
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.400
Bethany Shadid: You know, being texted at 10 o'clock. The night before changing where I'm going.

158
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.750
Bethany Shadid: Yeah it all of the

159
00:19:43.890 --> 00:20:00.180
Bethany Shadid: It's not okay. And I've gotten to the point where I don't even like talking about the specifics anymore because it's very clear to me that it's, it's just not healthy. And I'm not going to fix.

160
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:20.730
Bethany Shadid: The people there. I'm not going to be able to make them change and trying to do that isn't healthy and only creates more stress and but at the same time, I know that any new job by get could have stress.

161
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.900
Bethany Shadid: Like don't

162
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.070
Bethany Shadid: Think, yeah.

163
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay right there.

164
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the things I'm going to say may

165
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: May be unpleasant. Okay. Now you and I have developed enough rapport that I think you'll be able to hear them without it feeling like an attack, but if it feels like an attack. I want you to tell me if you can

166
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This may seem like an odd question.

167
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Who squeezing your muscles.

168
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:56.010
Bethany Shadid: Me.

169
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: If you stop.

170
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What will happen at work.

171
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.870
Bethany Shadid: I don't know.

172
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe that's it.

173
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We will do what is familiar over

174
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The unknown more times than not even when we know it's unhealthy. And you know what, you're a logical reasonable person you have all this lovely insight and yet you show up with just a text and you squeeze your muscles.

175
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of them are so habituated their long fear, I just got developed before the job. This is just what you do. It's so ingrained so routine.

176
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the

177
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but we can do something about it. We can say

178
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to react this way.

179
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, my first reaction is one of

180
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.990
Tension

181
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But you just said.

182
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It creates

183
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This physical reaction. And you might end up doing it again in the next workplace. And the big thing was, you're about to go into a job.

184
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And we were sort of or I was any way kind of thinking, well, how will you approach this one a little differently. How can this be a classroom for you so that you don't do exactly what you did with this other job before that and you were very concerned will. I will. I do the same thing.

185
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And here we are stones.

186
00:22:52.560 --> 00:23:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So progress and some of the same. So it's both there's progress. You can tangibly because you've come in and you said, I've said things this way done things differently. And you're liking it, you're, you're certainly you've had fewer stones.

187
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That I think is with something very measurable. There's been fewer

188
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.230
Bethany Shadid: Much

189
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So although you say I don't get into the specifics of it.

190
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what's your whole life is it is those specifics. It is that text. So how do we not talk about the text. How do we not talk about how you meet that text.

191
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: How you make whatever is going on the other side. What you think they think of you more important than your health. I think you're doing that all the time.

192
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.120
Bethany Shadid: Right, good guess.

193
00:23:47.400 --> 00:24:00.510
Bethany Shadid: I guess what I mean is the change that's taken place in room recently where I've been much more aware of

194
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:16.440
Bethany Shadid: In the moment how I'm feeling, you know, doing that. Okay, I'm really triggered right now, you know, doing the numbers, taking a breath counting down, things like that.

195
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:28.530
Bethany Shadid: And when I'm out of work, stopping myself from going over those situations, over and over and over and replaying them in my head.

196
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.150
Bethany Shadid: Because I know that it's not healthy.

197
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:47.850
Bethany Shadid: You know, and that it comes from this this where it's come from that change has made such an impact.

198
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:59.310
Bethany Shadid: That I've been able to handle the few times that I've had to deal with my manager while being out of work without it.

199
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.710
Bethany Shadid: triggered me

200
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:10.560
Bethany Shadid: Because I'm not right, anticipating that it's going to be horrible.

201
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.560
Bethany Shadid: And I'm not

202
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:20.520
Bethany Shadid: Reading into it like that text I sent you after I talked to him, I said, It went great.

203
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

204
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:27.930
Bethany Shadid: I was able to put it aside and then conversations I had to have, you know, updating him.

205
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:52.410
Bethany Shadid: That's just what it was just an update it wasn't more than that. It was, you know, and I've really held on to that. And I don't see it as the problem is my job and everything's going to be better with the new one. I see it more as I have more tools.

206
00:25:54.360 --> 00:26:07.110
Bethany Shadid: And my current work situation is a constant barrage of triggers that I think it's time to move on. Not that I'm not going to have them.

207
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.200
Bethany Shadid: I just don't think i think it's

208
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.950
Bethany Shadid: gotten to a place where I don't

209
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:15.210
Bethany Shadid: Know,

210
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:16.830
Bethany Shadid: Who

211
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:25.110
Bethany Shadid: I'm I or any struggle, right, taking care of myself. I don't want to

212
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.390
Have the

213
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Other the analogies, a good one or not. Let's see where it goes. All of a sudden I had this image of Niagara Falls. And I was like,

214
00:26:42.600 --> 00:27:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean boats are still awesome and little motors are still awesome and a raincoat still amazing, those are still awesome tools and umbrellas pretty cool waterproof cameras. Pretty cool. But as we get closer to the actual

215
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Date luge

216
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But how useful, are those even the boat. How useful is that going to be so that's what I hear, when you say that those tools are useful, but at what point do you say why on earth would I go under there.

217
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

218
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would I test it like that.

219
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This would be more like I need a ship and the ship is you can't get a ship and you know there. So it's completely irrational so skills are great raincoat.

220
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Great all really good but setback with just the mist rain splashing that comes from being sort of around that but

221
00:27:54.390 --> 00:28:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Few can survive being right under that kind of intense. So that's what came up for me that was the imagery. I was getting. And when I was teaching you talking about this bra.

222
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But

223
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What I don't get is

224
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The distress that still goes on. That's the part. So we already know it's getting better. But notice how your if we buy into this theory that that I can't take this this stress is triggering

225
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: My health right it's not good for my health. You've said this stress is not good for my health. So we're saying mental health effects physical body stress or kidney stone. So we just dumb it down and we say so. Okay, then.

226
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get that text.

227
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to relocate or this dissonance around the way they would approach someone an employee passing away.

228
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there's still something going on, still, even though these skills are great. I don't know if you're not using them, or if there's more needed. There's still can be stuff going on. So I think it might be worth talking a little bit about some specifics over the last week.

229
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:19.740
Sure.

230
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.960
Bethany Shadid: Well, the last week I haven't been at work and

231
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.910
Bethany Shadid: I've been

232
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:34.860
Bethany Shadid: Um, I got a big chunk out accomplished around my place.

233
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:43.530
Bethany Shadid: Which was really nice. And then the kidney stone hit. So I've been dealing with

234
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.420
Bethany Shadid: Not

235
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:57.510
Bethany Shadid: being disappointed that I can't do it. All right. I can't get it all done in this timeframe that's been been a struggle but

236
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:10.980
Bethany Shadid: Work wise. I've been much more distant from it this week and haven't

237
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.320
Bethany Shadid: Been much better about not

238
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.960
Bethany Shadid: Going over the scenarios in my head that

239
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:46.260
Bethany Shadid: Let's say I what I've definitely noticed is the scenarios that I go over my head always go back to me. Can trying to convince somebody that I'm right.

240
00:30:47.100 --> 00:31:02.700
Bethany Shadid: And they're wrong or that I'm right in this other person's wrong and you know it all goes back to that need to be believed me to be justified need to be

241
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.560
Bethany Shadid: How would you or vindicated or

242
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.400
Bethany Shadid: So I know that that's a deep seated, you know, thing that

243
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.400
Bethany Shadid: Is not going to just go away.

244
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.740
Bethany Shadid: Right, yeah.

245
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:32.340
Bethany Shadid: So specific wise and nothing else has happened since we don't look

246
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we just work with what's here today.

247
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't get it all done.

248
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.170
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

249
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's a big one that it could go anywhere, can't get it all done.

250
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.290
Bethany Shadid: accepting my limitations.

251
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

252
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

253
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Or that it wasn't all for you to do anyway.

254
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.320
Bethany Shadid: Anything.

255
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:38.370
Bethany Shadid: I have very high standards for myself and whenever I don't meet those

256
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.210
Bethany Shadid: Four or I get

257
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.300
Bethany Shadid: I have an idea of what I

258
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:53.940
Bethany Shadid: Think it should be like, and when it doesn't look that way. It's like letting myself down

259
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:56.340
Bethany Shadid: Or

260
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.600
Bethany Shadid: So I do

261
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.440
Bethany Shadid: Struggle with that, you know,

262
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.230
Bethany Shadid: My

263
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:12.480
Bethany Shadid: What my expectation for myself is versus what my

264
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.910
Bethany Shadid: My I'm able to actually

265
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.980
Bethany Shadid: Do

266
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:30.960
Bethany Shadid: Or mentally handle, that's a big part of it. It's not just physical limitations.

267
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.580
Bethany Shadid: But I

268
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.540
Bethany Shadid: I did, I did work on

269
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:55.230
Bethany Shadid: Verbalizing to myself when I know about the things that I did, and

270
00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:01.110
Bethany Shadid: The accomplishments. I did have and and being happy.

271
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:06.090
Bethany Shadid: With the work that I had done because of that. So,

272
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:10.920
Bethany Shadid: The small victories.

273
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:18.870
Bethany Shadid: Like last night I was laying in bed.

274
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.610
Bethany Shadid: Didn't want to get up.

275
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.680
Bethany Shadid: Just hurting so bad.

276
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.760
Bethany Shadid: So exhausted and

277
00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.940
Bethany Shadid: Just have to remind myself over and over. No.

278
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.320
Bethany Shadid: It's okay.

279
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.090
To

280
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.350
Bethany Shadid: We're

281
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:10.440
Bethany Shadid: here okay too tired. It's okay.

282
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's an

283
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.950
Old lazy.

284
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And what if it's just the conditioning maybe from

285
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: From your father that still sits in there as if you'd have to defend why you were laying in bed.

286
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's just that, you know,

287
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.670
Bethany Shadid: It's definitely that

288
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.610
Bethany Shadid: That image came up in my head as I was talking to it.

289
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:51.750
Yeah.

290
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.380
Bethany Shadid: If

291
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.130
Bethany Shadid: You don't like got to a place

292
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.700
Bethany Shadid: Where

293
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.680
Bethany Shadid: I keep the handle. This can be still paid

294
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.510
Bethany Shadid: And I realize that most people

295
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.570
Bethany Shadid: Can't handle this peak.

296
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.330
Bethany Shadid: That

297
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:29.880
Bethany Shadid: Most people go to the hospital to be medicated for this kind of pain.

298
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.090
Bethany Shadid: But

299
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.350
Bethany Shadid: It got to a point where

300
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.030
Bethany Shadid: With this was happening so frequently

301
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:55.680
Bethany Shadid: It was, I think I between dealing with my parents about it blamed me for having them.

302
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:07.350
Bethany Shadid: And the financial strain, going to the hospital, all the time, put me in

303
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.580
Bethany Shadid: It was

304
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.990
Bethany Shadid: That I just have to learn to live with this.

305
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.090
Bethany Shadid: I can't

306
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.630
Bethany Shadid: Let life stop every time.

307
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:44.610
Bethany Shadid: I have a kidney stone episode, like I have to learn to function under this amount of pain just kind of how as a girl would you're going through puberty and you're realizing that people still work and do things and they feel this way. What

308
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:51.630
Bethany Shadid: And so that's what i i had to do. I think

309
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.210
Bethany Shadid: It's this ingrained

310
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:07.560
Bethany Shadid: Of I can't stop. I can't, I can't, I can't let myself.

311
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:22.920
Bethany Shadid: Not keep going or I don't even know exactly what it is that I feel like I

312
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.950
Bethany Shadid: Have to do every time. But it's i've i've done

313
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:35.160
Bethany Shadid: ridiculous things well passing kidney stones.

314
00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:39.690
Bethany Shadid: Because

315
00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:49.590
Bethany Shadid: You know it. Looking back, it's this double standard for anybody else I would be so understanding is

316
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.720
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, give them leeway. But for myself. It's

317
00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.150
Bethany Shadid: Not allowed

318
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.190
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

319
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I think just right there. There's a lot of useful information for you.

320
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You just have to put up with all this pain.

321
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't complain about it.

322
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And

323
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Be prepared to defend your position. If anyone attacks.

324
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

325
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

326
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.660
Bethany Shadid: I honestly

327
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:46.740
Bethany Shadid: Think that contributed to my physical dependency on the medicine so much because I was having them so often.

328
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:54.750
Bethany Shadid: In the beginning, that the only way that I could function was to take the opiates.

329
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:05.520
Bethany Shadid: And you know my tolerance got so high, middle so fast and

330
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.580
Bethany Shadid: I NEVER ABUSED the medication like I didn't take it.

331
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:36.660
Bethany Shadid: Outside, but you know I did over take more than I should. But I needed it because it wasn't just to make the pain go away. It was so that I could continue on. It was so I could work during these episodes. It was so it could function in like horrible marriage. It was so that I could

332
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.540
Bethany Shadid: You know, and

333
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:49.320
Bethany Shadid: Now, at the point where I learning. I've gotten away from

334
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:51.270
Bethany Shadid: You know,

335
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.850
Bethany Shadid: Having to go to the doctor constantly and get more opiates.

336
00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:05.640
Bethany Shadid: You know, to function in my life and changed my lifestyle so that my kidney stones app and less and less.

337
00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:07.380
Bethany Shadid: But

338
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.230
Bethany Shadid: I've had to learn to cope with the pain.

339
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:23.280
Bethany Shadid: And it's like there's still that to continue

340
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.350
Bethany Shadid: Even though.

341
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.330
Bethany Shadid: I don't know, it's, it's very ingrained in me.

342
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How willing are you to be under the knife all the day luge the barrage again how how willing are you to

343
00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Live with your family, as she did as a child and work and be in a marriage that's neglectful chaotic and just okay you've had built. Why not tell me why.

344
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.280
Bethany Shadid: You're heard of it.

345
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:03.780
Bethany Shadid: I don't

346
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.810
Bethany Shadid: Like thinking about where I was.

347
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.400
Bethany Shadid: But I don't ever want to go back, you know,

348
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.690
Bethany Shadid: It's exhausting. It's

349
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.150
Bethany Shadid: But it does that does bring up a good point is I got I got where I was.

350
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.480
Bethany Shadid: Covered very long way.

351
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You have

352
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You take what you learn in here.

353
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So the hard part is

354
00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What more would you like to do so that you don't if there is that connection between stress level which you said there is and your physical health, what

355
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Needs to be done or what less needs to be done.

356
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.700
Bethany Shadid: I think I've modified some big

357
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:41.370
Bethany Shadid: Pieces in my life right like getting out of my parents house getting out of my own gym, things like that.

358
00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.140
Bethany Shadid: That needs to change.

359
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.770
Bethany Shadid: But I need to work on things now that

360
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.110
Bethany Shadid: Add to

361
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.150
Bethany Shadid: Me being healthy, not just

362
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.130
Bethany Shadid: I'm out from under the falls. I need to

363
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:14.700
Bethany Shadid: I don't know, like, the first thing that came to mind is like, you know, yoga or something or, you know, though. I don't know. Okay.

364
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all right. But it's a it's a doing it's

365
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:19.470
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

366
00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.260
Bethany Shadid: Movement. All right.

367
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.320
Bethany Shadid: Church.

368
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, those are big ones church movement. And then there's the

369
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that you and I talked a lot about which has to do with

370
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing.

371
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeking validation

372
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: resisting it

373
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

374
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get really wrapped in in this next job. It could happen mean what not exist in this one, you don't have a dear friend. Well, now you may have a dear friend, so you say all this be great. Well, guess what.

375
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you might be making decisions that are based on this friendship leveraging your ethical and professional responsibilities now having to wait friendship over secret over. We don't know what's going to come

376
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's work.

377
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And

378
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Will it be okay for you yet again to put

379
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Stress

380
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, stress, I get I have to put up with this pain. Pain stress. I just have to put up with it and my body will keep the score and I'll get these stones.

381
00:45:55.110 --> 00:46:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, or are we getting closer to a really a switch going off for you where there's a point. Well not go past. No, you won't let yourself get

382
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, like we're once you'd let it get here. Now, you won't. It just sort of says I can't let it

383
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel those phantom pains or I feel. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. I think I told you I've had stones before so I kind of know what you're talking about. You're like, Oh my gosh, it was that was that one. What was that, you know,

384
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.150
Yeah.

385
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

386
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

387
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you starting to see the relationship between that threshold.

388
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Where

389
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.430
Yeah.

390
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you won't budge from there and you it whether it's your dad. It's your mom. It's a manager. It's, you would say, I cannot afford to let myself get

391
00:46:50.790 --> 00:47:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: above this level. I've seen what happens, and I can't do it. So in a very polite. Nice way and then you just sort of back away from it using skills.

392
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:07.200
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

393
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I just still wonder if you really know where that line is

394
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.040
Bethany Shadid: If you I don't. Hey, can

395
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:19.380
Bethany Shadid: I see exactly what you're talking about. And I know that that's what a lot

396
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:32.400
Bethany Shadid: Um, I think I've been playing with that line the past few weeks, you know, like getting angry when or, you know, not

397
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:38.430
Bethany Shadid: not backing down on different things, you know, but

398
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.620
Bethany Shadid: But, um,

399
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.690
Bethany Shadid: But yeah, I think a lie still have a lot of work.

400
00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:52.080
Bethany Shadid: With with making that one very clear, so that when it does

401
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:54.630
Bethany Shadid: I can

402
00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's, here's what I wonder, remember how I kind of say, well, we had a good clue with the hot core. I haven't heard much about it recently. So I'm wondering if you've lost that atonement.

403
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you forgotten about it.

404
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:22.020
Bethany Shadid: No, I, I've had it just talking about it. Oh, just talking today i guess i i just have it.

405
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.310
Bethany Shadid: pointed it out, but I can

406
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: See you, you do when you're talking with your manager, supervisor. Do you feel that

407
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:44.070
Bethany Shadid: I did prior to the phone call that I was, you know, letting him know. I wasn't going to be there and then

408
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:55.920
Bethany Shadid: When HR called I got really even though there was nothing bad on the phone call it initially just got me all distress.

409
00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.690
Bethany Shadid: And then afterwards, I had to just like

410
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:16.800
Bethany Shadid: Pause And breathe and it was like I don't what you know she was like I was telling myself. She was apologizing to me because she called and told me, I'm really sorry, but you know

411
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:32.430
Bethany Shadid: Under the contract you signed it, it says that you have to maintain the license. She goes, but I know you were letting go of what and and trying to reinstate your New England, and this is just a gap. She's like, so it's just

412
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:42.720
Bethany Shadid: I'm just letting you know. And there's no real repercussions and I'm sorry but you can't work which I already you know knew but

413
00:49:43.410 --> 00:50:04.800
Bethany Shadid: I had gotten you know so like worked up about it right away it goes from zero to 80 or 90 whatever like that. And so it was after the phone call just just bringing myself back down, realizing how triggered. I was

414
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.230
Bethany Shadid: And I'm sorry I didn't think

415
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.610
Bethany Shadid: bringing that up before I'm

416
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:11.940
Just

417
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I was just checking. Just checking in to see if it was being used.

418
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to remember

419
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

420
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's actually

421
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:26.910
Bethany Shadid: In a big, big thing to hold on to. So

422
00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How many minutes does it take after that initial sort of hot experience. How many minutes does it take to regulate down to, oh, I notice

423
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine. Do you know how long it takes.

424
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:56.730
Bethany Shadid: I could say approximately because there were a few times where I thought I was okay and then I read, I noticed it. And I had to go back and do it again and do it again. So

425
00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:14.550
Bethany Shadid: I would say you know it over the course of the next hour. I was. It was coming back up and I had to keep, like, okay, you know, breathe, everything's fine. You know,

426
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:17.610
Bethany Shadid: After that,

427
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So it wouldn't surprise me. It's pretty typical for me to hear that it takes about 45 minutes. Can you believe that takes that long.

428
00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a long time. I don't know. Is it

429
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:41.100
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, yeah, I was surprised by it, but I wasn't able to, because you know it was a scenario that happened outside of like

430
00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:59.520
Bethany Shadid: Being at work. It was just a phone call. Matt for a minute, comfortable environment. Why am I so triggered, you know. And then, okay, you know, and then thinking I'm okay and then realizing that I'm thinking about it again and I'm hot. And I'm like, what is going

431
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:04.950
Bethany Shadid: Like repeatedly. Yeah. That doesn't surprise me at all.

432
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:10.290
Bethany Shadid: But it makes me feel better knowing that I'm not the only person.

433
00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I said I wanted you to hear that are normal.

434
00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and that's way too long. That's too much.

436
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That's too long. It's damaging memory. It's damaging our body. We can have that high level for that long, we should only really we only want it for 10 seconds. That's what we want. Just, can we need it for fight for flight. And then we register. I'm not in any danger.

437
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at my body. Look how how activated, it is look how in threat response. My body is

438
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's this fear HR might say, What right did you go there, like he might have said, what, what was the

439
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:11.040
Bethany Shadid: What's the worst. She said was on suspension.

440
00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:22.440
Bethany Shadid: And I asked her what that meant. And she's like, Well, you know, it's because of the project, blah, blah, blah. And I said, Does that have any like

441
00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:40.740
Bethany Shadid: Consequences like am I not going to get PTO like what it is or is it just like a word like what cuz I was like, at first I was just gonna be like, Okay, and just hang up the phone and then I was like, wait a minute, what is this

442
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:43.350
Bethany Shadid: What is it

443
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.500
Bethany Shadid: On bench in. Yeah.

444
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:49.500
Bethany Shadid: The financial gains. Yeah.

445
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:56.670
Bethany Shadid: So I found that it really was nothing like it in a file, but

446
00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:04.410
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, but still that word suspension, you know you're on suspension like

447
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.540
Bethany Shadid: That I think that's why I kept it kept coming up, you know,

448
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.590
Bethany Shadid: But honestly, like I feel like a

449
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.460
Bethany Shadid: huge majority of my life has been

450
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.760
Bethany Shadid: Under cortisol.

451
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so too. And that's why I don't

452
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Close. It's your normal there's a norm to it and it's been going on too long, it's it's hurting your body. So if you see that this word stress.

453
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It needed, much like you needed some tangible thing around what suspension means what are the financial implications.

454
00:54:49.170 --> 00:55:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This word stress is not this nebulous psychobabble fairy dust. It's cortisol. This is grounded in suspension is, well, I still have my benefits will still get a paycheck stress is the physiological response to perceived danger and threat.

455
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You cannot keep it up at this rate.

456
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you have been

457
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And at what point are you going to say that this relationship that I have with whoever's on the other side of this conversation, father, mother, friend.

458
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they more worth your brain that cortisol down away done

459
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't going to continue to be that way. Are they going to always be more important is their opinion of you always going to be more important in this body of yours. And once again, we're here. And so for me, when I say, Are you feeling that hot core

460
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know whether you screeching halt stop and say,

461
00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Carol hold on just a moment.

462
00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:17.340

463
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that's it.

464
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I see why I'm reacting this way. But you know what, I'll be okay. I'm okay.

465
00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I can ask her questions if I don't understand. I know I'm studying I'm getting my CEOs. Everything's gonna be fine. I already have another job I'm. Come on. Nurse. Forget about it. Everybody wants me. This is like

466
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To be able to get a nurse, right now you are much needed

467
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:46.530
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

468
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey Carol. Sorry, I had to attend to something important. Okay.

469
00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me.

470
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: She can't wait.

471
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:56.910
Bethany Shadid: She can like

472
00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We can always we can all wait until you're ready to engage. Okay. We can all wait

473
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What was so urgent this whole time, or any of those things that, that you made yourself sick. Do you remember what they were all those conversations, all those little this amount of time in this database or is it all just stupid crap now. Oh, that cortisol for what

474
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: In the end, it's all small stuff. Your health is the good stuff. That's the stuff right there. We can all just sit here and twiddle our thumbs. We can be impatient, we can give ourselves cortisol, but you you sit there and you take your sweet time and you feel ready, you feel

475
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Able

476
00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: However you want to feel or straight up.

477
00:57:52.620 --> 00:58:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This is really bad. Are you free in the next five minutes. Think it will free up. Can I call you back, or do you want to touch base and then you

478
00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:10.140
Bethany Shadid: Know, I agree. And it's, it's funny to me how

479
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.460
Bethany Shadid: Tangible it is right now.

480
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:18.090
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

481
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.610
Bethany Shadid: I think

482
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.070
Bethany Shadid: My

483
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.060
Bethany Shadid: unhealthy relationship with cortisol my

484
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.670
Bethany Shadid: By

485
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.120
Bethany Shadid: miliary with that.

486
00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how you talk

487
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.250
Bethany Shadid: Free to post me to some

488
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:45.480
Bethany Shadid: Pretty bad

489
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Ratio is how you talk, I basically have to put up with it. I'm going to put up with the emotional pain and the physical pain that's my lot in life.

490
00:58:56.970 --> 00:59:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the message that you have decided is going to be it for you. And that's depressing.

491
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm saying, No, I'm saying no, there's a whole lot more to it than that. Instead let's catch it in early, early, early phase of this

492
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And say, know that pain is supposed to be an important departure from baseline feelings. That's supposed to be a sharp marker of something's really wrong. But you're having to live with it daily daily daily. No, it's not supposed to be like that.

493
00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain is supposed to say something just happened to life and limb, mind, spirit, something's just happened sharply different from baseline.

494
00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay you sleep with it all the time is just no that's not, I don't think that's what it's for.

495
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:52.170
Bethany Shadid: It's amazing.

496
00:59:52.260 --> 01:00:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, without. See how you've normalized this and rationalize this and this is my lot. And what I'm inviting is something very different. I hope

497
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:03.870
Bethany Shadid: Yeah yeah

498
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've been I'm two minutes late to start this here group at one o'clock he
