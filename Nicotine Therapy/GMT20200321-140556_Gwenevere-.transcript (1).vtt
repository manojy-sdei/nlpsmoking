Wiley just goes by.

3
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk, so be it a kiss. But I think in curios wildly

4
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, good morning to. Yeah.

5
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.500
Ashley Bitakis: I'm sorry, just heard the last two words which you said it was

6
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: The second one.

7
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.040
Ashley Bitakis: In the morning

8
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I get a note of and

9
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, just update me. What happens with our when I send messages or tell me about What phone do you have still one phone right now.

10
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.490
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so we're supposed to meet up with my grandma and because we use her address at times were supposed to meet with her see the kids and

11
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:15.900
Ashley Bitakis: Go do some grocery stores, shopping and she never got back to us. She still hasn't Texas called us talk to us. I'm pretty sure she blocked or cell phone numbers so

12
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.780
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, we haven't heard from her.

13
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were trying to get another cell phone somehow that way is

14
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.660
Ashley Bitakis: Because because they want assistance, you know, we get a free phone and we had, we had one, but for we had it for like two weeks and then it took a shit on us.

15
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:50.010
Ashley Bitakis: So we have to reorder another one in new reorder phone had gone to her address because it would have been the easiest to pick it up there. And yeah, so that was our plan that Saturday to were shopping pickup or mail because they have some of the pieces of mail to you that

16
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.220
Ashley Bitakis: Head on over there. Speaker mail the phone and she just hasn't responded or talk to us.

17
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well that's utterly disappointing.

18
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.980
Ashley Bitakis: How many we anticipated or being a brat. So it's something that's like a shock. It's just annoying.

19
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:22.530
Ashley Bitakis: You know, just to be able to talk to the kids, whenever we want to, but we're not going to make like a huge fuss, like a huge you know fuss over. Otherwise, it's just going to be bad for the kids. So

20
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.170
Ashley Bitakis: I've tried emailing her

21
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.780
Ashley Bitakis: And just keeping up with some emails from Anthony school because you know they're out of school right now. So just to show her, like, hey,

22
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:49.380
Ashley Bitakis: I'm keeping up with what I can for Anthony on this side, you know, here's some homework is teacher had emailed me just a second going to stuff like that is so. She'll. She'll come around and you. She is like manic depressive disorder and stuff like that. So I don't want to set set it off.

23
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.950
Ashley Bitakis: So, um, I had told James today. All of the day is to talk to the children. So we'll just start calling it from other numbers. Okay.

24
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So regarding the phone. The reason I'm asking is because

25
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see. Yesterday, your time about 636 29

26
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I sent a message.

27
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I didn't get anything back until this morning. So that's what's a challenge. I don't know what to do about that. Because what will happen is if I don't hear from you. The night before and

28
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll end up scheduling someone else because they don't think you're going to show up. So what can we do

29
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.790
Ashley Bitakis: Well, you know, early in the day was on standby on Friday. I was like, yeah.

30
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You are

31
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.540
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, I have a family glued to my head and and in so and they had told James the same. And once you're ready for this tournament Italian and

32
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.820
Ashley Bitakis: Him and I both ended up falling asleep. So when you had sent that text I was sound asleep, as well as he was too and

33
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.620
Ashley Bitakis: You know, he hadn't really looked at the phone. I had the phone.

34
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.800
Ashley Bitakis: Until you know planning on for my appointment today, so I do apologize I did receive that message. I just didn't look at the time, so

35
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we had I offered an 11 o'clock on the fly, didn't work out that when I'm less worried about. I'm more worried about the

36
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we did it like this.

37
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't have you guys don't have a lot of structure that structure usually comes from. I'm going to school. I gotta go to a job. I gotta get my kids to school like it's typically and right now. You guys just don't have that. So you're sleeping.

38
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm hoping that you're not using substances, I have to believe you. I hope it's the case. So let me just finish.

39
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking so that my confidence is still high.

40
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you check when your appointment is like the day before. Do you have an awareness of when that is we do wait for the alarm. I'd like, were you aware that we had something set for Saturday.

41
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.160
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, I have rooted down. Remember, I don't know.

42
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I remember we had that thing. But here's my point. I am. Here's my, my question to you is, in the absence of

43
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: you're responding to my confirmation messages. What if you just the day before any of our meetings that you just say I'm going to be in group tomorrow I'm going to be an individual tomorrow at 8am.

44
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

45
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I can relax and I don't have to be

46
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: offering it to anyone else or putting someone on call.

47
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Or completely changing my life right because I've got things going on to where I set it up to make sure that I'm seated.

48
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.220
Ashley Bitakis: Right here.

49
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So Atlanta Saturday.

50
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to do that, like, okay, I got one coming up and maybe what you can do is

51
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Every time you set an alarm for a particular service you do double time you do one, the day before at seven at night or something, whatever, where you you set an alarm that says confirm with Gwen tomorrow's appointment, it'll just say confirm with Glenn tomorrow's appointment.

52
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.190
Ashley Bitakis: And you're ready. Don't in my own in my planner. That way to

53
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Your watch whatever is going to work.

54
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we've got a little plan this way. Nothing gets disrupted now.

55
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing,

56
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So, yeah.

57
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:56.610
Ashley Bitakis: We've kind of been, you know, talking about because the corona corona is a is prevented you know James from going on a couple of interviews. So that's been a huge downer. And then I actually did have an interview with sprouts. I kind of mentioned to you.

58
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:13.290
Ashley Bitakis: So I ended up landing interview, my interview, really, really, really well. I mean, I know I got this position. They actually offered me a different position column that they thought I'd be a fit for. But again, everything's on hold because the corona so

59
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:27.450
Ashley Bitakis: You know, we're kind of thinking we're just kind of talking about earlier yesterday, like a plan B is mom is then or or Angel, you know, and all of this financially, she's really been helping us out. So

60
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:37.500
Ashley Bitakis: He's going to give us more of a call later on today. And just make sure that we're on a good track with the motel finance finance side of things and

61
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:47.550
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, to see if she can extend, you know, any, any help financially with a little bit short term for this month so

62
00:07:49.170 --> 00:08:06.900
Ashley Bitakis: You know, just like food. And then if he could get, you know, a couple of books for Uber for when he does have his interviews, that'd be because none of it. None of the places that he's applying or could apply is walking distance boxes early. I can open my hotel door, and I could see

63
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.020
Ashley Bitakis: Which is which is really quality.

64
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh, that would be so great.

65
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.740
Ashley Bitakis: Perfect, yeah. And

66
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:25.290
Ashley Bitakis: So again, I keep telling James like maybe the coronas a blessing in disguise. You never know who might die off and you can take their position. I know that sounds really cold hearted.

67
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:38.460
Ashley Bitakis: I know, trying to be converted but, at the same time, you know, the door closes and maybe another one's opening for us. So we're just really trying to do only stay positive with each other, you know,

68
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And are there times where it gets very

69
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Conflicted, are you guys fighting to get very intense.

70
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.760
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, at times, not so much here like last week, you know, going, going into today.

71
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:21.420
Ashley Bitakis: It hasn't been too intense with like anger. It's been intense overall with stress and you know expectations of each other where we're going to go from here. If this falls through, are we going to do so. I mean, that's all been high high level of intensity in high stress, but

72
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:29.910
Ashley Bitakis: No, no high intense emotions through anger. You really haven't been communicating

73
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:41.430
Ashley Bitakis: Let me actually not just this last week but communication ways and I have been doing a lot better job of communicating with each other like, especially with over the last like, month, month and a half.

74
00:09:43.530 --> 00:10:01.560
Ashley Bitakis: But we were doing okay we're doing okay and we haven't been fighting this week, going into this this weekend into today. It hasn't been hasn't been, you know, anger or fighting or maybe a little spots here and there, but nothing. That's how to control. Okay.

75
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.510
I'm

76
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Managing to stay off of the path.

77
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.990
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, both of us actually ended up kind of fold and have no finances either so

78
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:24.060
Ashley Bitakis: It's been, it's been a good thing that falls into not having finances. Can you put that in anymore. So I don't have any money anymore. We're broke. We don't, we don't have any have any year

79
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To do what

80
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.500
Ashley Bitakis: To to supply our

81
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.930
Ashley Bitakis: You know, drugs, if we even wanted to you. So, um,

82
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.490
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, that's kind of a blessing. Also, guys, but

83
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:46.230
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, we haven't had the means to buy, buy anything or

84
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.520
House you your

85
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Clarity today. How's your brain.

86
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:01.980
Ashley Bitakis: Okay, I'm pretty groggy, actually, I'm kind of I'm pretty girl you today. Well, you know, I picked up my gap opinion.

87
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:13.290
Ashley Bitakis: So, which has really been helping me sleep and then I've been taking my iPhone been taking two I'm contract with my Suboxone

88
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:26.430
Ashley Bitakis: Only been taking to you, but I've been taking it like early in the morning. So like today I've, I've already taken it today. And usually, usually I hadn't taken it until it closer to like 11 ish

89
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:40.260
Ashley Bitakis: But no, I've been taking early in the morning. That's kind of helped me stay in bed and relax and sleep. Honestly, I've been sleeping, really, really good. I think they have opinions definitely helping also

90
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: During the day, it's making you sleep.

91
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:52.170
Ashley Bitakis: Boy, I'm taking it really early and I haven't had any goals for myself to do anything is like outside the room.

92
00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:06.780
Ashley Bitakis: And everything has kind of closed down and so yeah i I've honestly kind of just set a goal for myself. The last couple days last two days for sure, just the same as sleep, relax, and I have, I have been sleeping. Really good.

93
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.210
Ashley Bitakis: Okay, so

94
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep. If anything, there's too much. It's not that you're missing any and you're noticing you're feeling groggy, so make sure, just make sure you tell the doctor about the gap and

95
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How much you're taking how often what time of day and

96
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Just communicating with her. So let's, let's talk a little bit about

97
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I have to repeat myself if that's fine. I'm not going to be defensive or anything because your brain. That's why I asked if you weren't feeling real sharp my caffeine hasn't even barely kicked in yet so I feel you on that.

98
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And but that's okay. All right, so we'll just go just no problem. If we have to repeat, but I want to talk a little bit about

99
00:12:54.210 --> 00:13:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Some fundamentals. You and I don't quite have the same message around change people, places and things and

100
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you get it intellectually like oh when yeah I didn't change my people, places and things. My mother in law was the problem I needed to move away from her. She's the why I use drugs. Hmm. Hey, if you just

101
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh huh huh, you're going to have to explain that to me more, because I don't see it the same way so

102
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see it. I don't see it.

103
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:48.720
Ashley Bitakis: Um, when one thing I know you and I had discussed what is, you know, our mutual friend username, which was his best friend. You know, he we don't talk to him anymore and we haven't talked to him again. Yeah, like a month. So that's been a really good thing.

104
00:13:49.860 --> 00:14:05.910
Ashley Bitakis: I have another friend of mine. Her name is Ashley as well. Our kids had played together, whatever she's really taking a turn for the worst. Be kind of offered out a helping hand and have her come stay with us because we have an extra bed in our hotel room and

105
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:16.320
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so after she stayed with us, like two nights and ended up getting into an argument with games and come to find out. She just was really kind of like using

106
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:27.150
Ashley Bitakis: Us at that time those couple days now just using us have been using me through our entire friendship. So it's kind of really good you know the truth always comes out a little bit at a time.

107
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But how was she exploiting you and James

108
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.190
Ashley Bitakis: Well, um, so

109
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.490
Ashley Bitakis: A friend when we were saying at the value place, which was a different hotel.

110
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:54.390
Ashley Bitakis: We had a friend who passed away. She was six months pregnant and she had shut up too much, and she died. I mean right in front of me. I was the only one left in the room trained

111
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When

112
00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.240
Ashley Bitakis: This was just like going only two months ago now and

113
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.150
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah. So through that through that Ashley had

114
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:12.360
Ashley Bitakis: Had been telling people like all kinds of different things and pretended like she was her sister and like

115
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:20.610
Ashley Bitakis: She just was acting crazy like just to like, you know, she took money from us. And that's where we ended up, offering her help through this

116
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:32.160
Ashley Bitakis: And it's like she used that as an excuse to just even come in in her room and letters. Let her stay. You know, so she's just she's just a scandal is personal and

117
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:41.430
Ashley Bitakis: She used that whole situation to just get our foot in the door just so she can, you know, take me she can she was like her clothes money.

118
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:48.510
Ashley Bitakis: Like overall she got she got I was like a 160 bucks or like 40 at least. And then she tried to like

119
00:15:49.050 --> 00:16:05.430
Ashley Bitakis: Set up our PayPal account with other people's credit card numbers and we try to like still are. Yeah, like true. So our information for our PayPal just created just crazy shit so so she was using us. I mean, we're not in a position to where

120
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.340
Ashley Bitakis: We really have anything anyway but

121
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.970
Ashley Bitakis: Um, she just tried to like get her bank account numbers.

122
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:25.800
Ashley Bitakis: And, you know, get her hands on any money. We had and any clothes she wouldn't have mine. So it's just stuff like that and she use Ashley pastor friend who passed away was also named Ashley so

123
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:34.800
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so I'm you know i'm actually Wiley user, the bad Ashley's actually Todd and then learning pathways actually does. Sure.

124
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm. Do you remember the original topic of discussion, let me just see how your mind's working right now to remember how we got to this story.

125
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.330
Ashley Bitakis: You believe you asked me innocence will. How is she using this

126
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Changing people, places and things, and you're trying to send me a message you're trying to

127
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:56.910
Ashley Bitakis: Communicate

128
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To these stories. I like him. I like them and i and i it's really hard to not want to talk about dish or for a moment, but

129
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That I think might need a whole session.

130
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's just talk about changing people, places and things you're trying to communicate something to me but

131
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:21.780
Ashley Bitakis: I'm trying to communicate to you though we've gotten rid of, like, not a lot, all of these people that we thought were friends that were friends at all and

132
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me the name and turn it

133
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Up here James's friend's name. One more time, his best friend. That was your primary connect

134
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:28.620
With

135
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.020
Ashley Bitakis: He yeah

136
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now we're talking. Now, do you remember it's okay if you don't, because so much has happened, but do you remember

137
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't I don't tell people what to do that. That's why it's a little difficult. I don't say, hey, you need to do this, you gotta do that I kind of dance around it. I think it's better if you guys come to the conclusions on your own.

138
00:17:53.910 --> 00:18:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you own it, then you know it's yours. You made this decision, and it's not someone else telling you what to do some people it's it's inconvenient because it takes longer, but that's how I roll.

139
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:05.790
So I

140
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't tell people what to do, but I do know that I probably spend some time talking about me.

141
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And how having that continued friendship puts your recovery in jeopardy.

142
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why the discussion of changing people, places and things was probably talked about a few times.

143
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It was yeah and

144
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I see why you brought him up. Now, notice how it didn't matter whatever I brought up, you had to come to this realization on your own.

145
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hope in some way.

146
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The fundamentals of early recovery have some credibility, though, because it's the same topic around having that pipe still in the hotel room. It's the same one as

147
00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: When we talked about he you know months ago. It's the same thing. It's you're holding a reservation. That's where that term comes from a reservation for relapse you're holding it.

148
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did not think it's conscious, but

149
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is.

150
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It that that idea that I can use. Again, it's not that far down on the list. It's like, maybe it went down a little bit, because look what happened to today. Sure, yeah.

151
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It may be a move down and maybe you're thinking about your, your children, and maybe, maybe you sometimes. I hope you do remember you and all of this that maybe you want to reach your potential which we have talked about in the past that you want to be this.

152
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You know this creative spirit that you are you're spontaneous and exuberant you're all these things and it's not getting a chance to express itself right now.

153
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But the fundamentals, the basics right now in your life are protesting.

154
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Your recovery. Everything else is going to fall in line. But first, this has to happen.

155
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, we talked a little bit about why don't I hear from you and see how this is going in. How is

156
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That

157
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Similar to

158
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: He

159
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.810
Ashley Bitakis: Would you say to

160
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.830
Ashley Bitakis: The thought in the back of your head wall.

161
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.000
Ashley Bitakis: Oh, just like a pair of running shoes.

162
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.730
Ashley Bitakis: That I know protein down and

163
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:48.330
Ashley Bitakis: You know tongues hanging out laces ties, like a wall. Maybe I need them again even though they're useless and have an appointment, obviously. So this user, you want to wear. But you're going to keep them anyway, like just want anyone to the idea of

164
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.690
Ashley Bitakis: If, if and when

165
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

166
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:18.630
Ashley Bitakis: And then kind of stupid to say to later I even thought about, well, no, you know, we're not financially, you know, well off. So, you know, we don't have to buy another one. If we were to sum up again, we'll have to buy another one. So that would save us money. I mean I wouldn't let him excuse

167
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. But that's, yeah that's that's that's the attic, making the decision that's being budgeting for addiction that

168
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:34.230
Ashley Bitakis: Out of that little boy wanted to do, just in case you don't have to spend money, you know,

169
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But so I want to press a little harder here. Now I know you're going to do what you're going to do, but I want someone to say it because I don't know if anybody else in your life is saying this stuff.

170
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If that pipe were locked up in a safe.

171
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: In a bank. I know it's ridiculous but just go with the metaphor.

172
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And it would cross town.

173
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have the inconvenience of having to get there to go get it in the amount of time that it would take and the hassle. You might drop and remember this is freaking ridiculous, what am I doing

174
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to spend money on an Uber when I need that over. We need this money for over to go get a job. I will see the kids or pay for data on a phone, but you might stop say thank you and walk away back home.

175
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But when that pipe is three feet away.

176
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You have no time.

177
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To resist an impulse

178
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to be inconvenienced

179
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be really inconvenient in your life to us.

180
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I want it to be inconvenient.

181
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. I'm not a

182
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not a friend to the addict inside I I'm

183
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a friend. I'm your friend I care about you.

184
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But the logic when you go and you listen to this later on when we sort of review this session that your logic was I wanted to make sure that I didn't have to invest more money in a pipe when you have so many other things that

185
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to look back at this and be your jaws going to drop

186
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

187
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.810
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, even just hearing you know it's

188
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.890
Ashley Bitakis: kind of amusing full sour, you know, cuz I know it's not the right thing like

189
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.090
Ashley Bitakis: Make enemies. People like I do have a sense of guilt.

190
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:53.520
Ashley Bitakis: Between mailing

191
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.230
All

192
00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, isn't that kind of what we need.

193
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not shame or guilt. Like, that's true. I am trying to keep it can be. I am keeping it close and maybe the truth is I'm not ready to commit to recovery. Maybe that's it.

194
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.420
And then

195
00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.400
Go ahead.

196
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.510
Ashley Bitakis: And write it for shooting like so it's

197
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.670
Ashley Bitakis: Really good not to be dependent on on smoking heroin.

198
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.950
Ashley Bitakis: You know, something that I am proud of myself work. And that's something that

199
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:41.310
Ashley Bitakis: I can finally breathe and no I don't have it, you know, to say, I used to consider it such a friend, my best friend, you know, TV and just like the other day where was I

200
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:58.920
Ashley Bitakis: Can't remember where it was. And they and they had stopped and I was like, wow, I haven't been here so long that I was at the casino before they close the casinos down and this is not this week, but it was like last week, maybe

201
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:06.840
Ashley Bitakis: And they stopped and I was like, wow, I haven't been a casino without a foil because you smoke but running smoke in the bathroom and I mean

202
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:17.340
Ashley Bitakis: As like I haven't been to casinos over foil and I couldn't tell you how long, so it was like I felt almost naked in a moment, but it felt really good. And, you know,

203
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.360
Ashley Bitakis: Just even I had haven't thought about even smoking, but just to be in that environment. How

204
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:37.650
Ashley Bitakis: Level foil with me. Okay. You know, it wasn't, it wasn't scared like it would have been before. Okay, but now it's like with was mentioned frenemies. It's like treating one thing for the other. It's like

205
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:56.130
Ashley Bitakis: I don't, I don't know why I feel like okay well I gave up my heroine, you know, my best friend. But then it's like, what am I, replacing. You know, I feel like I'm I have been searching for something to replace it with. Oh, so do you hear when good for me. But here I am, you know,

206
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.190
Ashley Bitakis: Smoking. You know, like

207
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Placed it

208
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.610
Ashley Bitakis: And that's why I'm so scared. Just to be

209
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:06.450
Ashley Bitakis: Sober away.

210
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

211
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But that

212
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: When we were starting to work on.

213
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.340
Ashley Bitakis: We were

214
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Just starting we were working on. Who am I, am I worth this we were looking at at identity we were looking at. Am I good enough. And we're starting to do that work. Okay.

215
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had it, you have a slip

216
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:30.990
Here.

217
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And Ashley, you were not changing, and you still have not fully changed people, places and things you are off to a good start. He I don't

218
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.100
Yeah.

219
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.810
Ashley Bitakis: Sorry, I'm missing.

220
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a good start.

221
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.780
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, oh yeah, without definitely it's a good, sir.

222
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:09.360
Ashley Bitakis: You even realize without having somebody consistently in your life. Like, I can't even speak from my

223
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.990
Ashley Bitakis: More for myself with my mom like not having that person consistently in your life.

224
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:24.990
Ashley Bitakis: Does it does feel really good without him. It really does. And you doing us a favor, more than anything.

225
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.230
Ashley Bitakis: Not reaching out to us, you know,

226
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So he's pissed off at you guys. You didn't make a payment. That's what's happening.

227
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.760
Ashley Bitakis: No, nothing like that. I'm not too sure exactly

228
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

229
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.280
Ashley Bitakis: So, Ashley, but it wasn't the

230
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, I don't know how much this is going to fall on deaf ears.

231
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not having money for drugs.

232
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not having transportation, you're not having he come at you with offers

233
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.420
Ashley Bitakis: Well, there was no I just thought it was an injury.

234
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but they're there. They're circumstantial, they're not coming from your conviction. Watch the difference when it's my conviction and it's this

235
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't be as profanity. But I want to. It's step back. He don't don't ever text me, call me I will call the police. If you do. Okay. Well, that, that's my conviction sing backup. Do not contact me again. You do not love me, care about me or my health or my goals are my life.

236
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And realizing with this pipe that's in this home that are your motel.

237
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Stepping on it breaking it crushing it. That's your conviction taking action when you just say passively. Oh, I don't know.

238
00:28:53.460 --> 00:29:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what's going on. It just hasn't reached out to us in a while and oil. I happen to not have money right now. That's why I'm not using

239
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And, well, you know, I don't want to upset, maybe, James. So do you understand the difference between being passive

240
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And being assertive and in your conviction. So that's what I'm looking at. I'm looking at all it would take. And here's my concern all it would take. Is he knocks on the door and says, Here's free because watch doesn't take money and he's right there here feel better.

241
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. You're gonna have to pay

242
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you didn't have the pipe and he didn't. It would be inconvenient. Maybe you would remember

243
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to set me back. I'm going to be depressed when I don't have it, because when you are not on meth. You have completely depleted your dope. I mean reserves and you're going to feel depressed. Yeah.

244
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel that

245
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.240
Ashley Bitakis: Um, I, I

246
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.690
Ashley Bitakis: Mean I feel, I feel down

247
00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.020
Ashley Bitakis: I you know I do have my success so

248
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:01.680
Okay.

249
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.080
Ashley Bitakis: I don't feel hopeless.

250
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But the difference between being assertive and being passive. Do you see what's happening around

251
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.590
Ashley Bitakis: Us and I absolutely can see which

252
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.250
Ashley Bitakis: Is very very very very

253
00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.240
Ashley Bitakis: Very true.

254
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be here this morning that I wanted more than you do.

255
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You think that's possible.

256
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.850
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, I think it's a scary possibility possible. Yeah.

257
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think it has something to do with that question you said to yourself. I wonder why. Why have I just moved from one substance to another. Why am I not okay. I was just being me.

258
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.490
Ashley Bitakis: Do you mind. Do you mind if I am I move our conversation outside

259
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Course go

260
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.460
Ashley Bitakis: I don't think it does he do I

261
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Go. I'm gonna go use the restroom real quick is perfect timing. I'll be right back.

262
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.760
Ashley Bitakis: Drugs, because he can't smoke.

263
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can you

264
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:09.660
Ashley Bitakis: Hear me

265
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.490
Ashley Bitakis: Sorry.

266
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.480
Ashley Bitakis: Can you hear all the traffic coming through loud.

267
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I can't

268
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Though

269
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.190
Ashley Bitakis: Can you hear me clearly here.

270
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:23.940
Yeah.

271
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm

272
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Glad you did that because maybe there's some things you want to share a little bit more candidly

273
00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:39.990
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, from what it's come down to I really feel like it might hurt. There's no way that I can possibly get sober.

274
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.750
Ashley Bitakis: Bigger changes like there's just no way. I don't see how that's a possibility.

275
00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, honey. I know that's hard to say.

276
00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:52.320
Ashley Bitakis: Somebody you know

277
00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:55.590
Ashley Bitakis: You're talking about

278
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.270
Ashley Bitakis: You're talking about

279
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.510
Ashley Bitakis: You know, going to rehab and it's like

280
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:17.700
Ashley Bitakis: That's, you know, that's fine. Like, that's something I'm I'm willing to do another day, you know, somebody's watching over the kids, I'm comfortable with where the kids are. I have the freedom to do that. It's just

281
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:37.350
Ashley Bitakis: It's just a really hurt predicament. And, you know, talking about getting depressed. It's like I don't I don't smoke so often to where I have these aftermath of depression, but I see that in James and it doesn't make sense. It's, you know, like three days after have

282
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:54.630
Ashley Bitakis: A complete illusion. It's like almost geez delusional. I don't understand it. And I'm trying to be patient. And then of course you know I'm not in my right mind necessarily either, but in their right mind enough to see that. It's manic depressive and

283
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.150
Ashley Bitakis: And I, you know,

284
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:06.480
Ashley Bitakis: He won't take any kind of medication like even if I wanted to share my Alexa or Gabba pin or even share my sponsor. He won't take anything

285
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:20.010
Ashley Bitakis: So it's like it's rough it gets really, really, really, really rough and and even if I were, you know, even if I'm staying sober. Then I highly doubt he will. Right.

286
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but, first of all, Ashley notice you took care of yourself. You went

287
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.160
Ashley Bitakis: Outside

288
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You make sure that you had an environment where you could actually talk candidly, that's really important that you did that and yes

289
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.230
Ashley Bitakis: I don't want to blame him and certainly guy.

290
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.990
Ashley Bitakis: I couldn't just you know tournament snow going to happen.

291
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:44.730
Ashley Bitakis: So,

292
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What we had done last time was I, I said, why don't you at least flip your insurance card over call behavioral health and come up with three three or even one

293
00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: New Mexico. I'm going to tell you right now is a difficult place to find residential care. I will tell you it is the only one I know is hoy, but I know there's others it's just they're really hard to find. Did you make that call or sleeping.

294
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:17.340
Ashley Bitakis: Well I, I absolutely thought about making that call. But again, we can go looking at rehab centers to leave to the last couple days.

295
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:23.430
Ashley Bitakis: Wouldn't have been beneficial in the sense of a peaceful environment between him and I

296
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so phrase that

297
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Third person, which

298
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.730
Ashley Bitakis: Is confusing for me.

299
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I

300
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Was afraid.

301
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If I looked up rehabs James and I would fight. Say it a little bit direct

302
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:44.610
Ashley Bitakis: Like that. So, within the last couple of days. If I were to use the phone you cell phone to live in.

303
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:50.100
Ashley Bitakis: rehab facilities. It definitely could have caused a fight between James and I

304
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it.

305
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Now what, where are you near

306
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:03.540
Ashley Bitakis: Well, I'm, I'm in Albuquerque. So I'm in the Northeast heights. Currently, but I'm I'm

307
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.720
Ashley Bitakis: Like, where am I, near like what cities in my near outside of Albuquerque my close to or

308
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's fine. I get it.

309
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm

310
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the zip code there.

311
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.570
Ashley Bitakis: 87123

312
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so there's a part of you who thinks this, this might be in your best interest. The timing might be good. The kids are being taken care of and

313
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you're getting to it might not be your rock bottom, but you're starting to see some motivation to maybe get some intensive care. You weren't getting it. Yeah. Okay, so you might be getting there. Alright, well I'm excited.

314
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.390
Ashley Bitakis: Pretty rock bottom.

315
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.200
Ashley Bitakis: Being know being with me children is

316
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

317
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:56.820
Ashley Bitakis: And then, not knowing I honestly I really think that if I were to be employed.

318
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.790
Ashley Bitakis: I could hold a job, but

319
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:10.740
Ashley Bitakis: That's just wishful thinking. And I honestly don't. I honestly couldn't straight face 110% say I could hold the job even read it.

320
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:20.610
Ashley Bitakis: I wouldn't want to miss out on the opportunity but long term lake or then a couple months. And, you know, if I could.

321
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.060
All right, let's see.

322
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:36.870
Ashley Bitakis: And then to a while you're good at doing some research, like, you know, my mom and her husband have been fighting a lot. So my mom had stayed with us to end, you know, she's cut back on smoking crack

323
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.760
Ashley Bitakis: The most I've ever seen her. But you should see what this too. And then it's just like

324
00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:48.030
Ashley Bitakis: Anytime she's around me. Oh, she wants to do is party party party because if she's around me and then she earned her husband.

325
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.860
Ashley Bitakis: So that's another thing that's kind of really brought me down between that and

326
00:38:53.850 --> 00:39:07.050
Ashley Bitakis: You know actually disturbing is just like if I weren't if I'm not going to be here. Where would I be I couldn't go with my dad. I mean, he's an alcoholic and I broke ties with him a long time ago. Like it couldn't go with my mom because

327
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.490
Ashley Bitakis: She's no good to my own house like

328
00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so, James, his mother, the one that has your kids didn't

329
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.170
Ashley Bitakis: Know my grandmother has

330
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that thought that woman now.

331
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you decide, let's say it goes like this, you get yourself into a residential treatment. Let's say you there for a month or three months or whatever it is, let's say you're there and you have a new perspective on

332
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Your grandmother

333
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You are with your kids and

334
00:39:49.380 --> 00:40:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: She is talking to me. I'm not saying it has to be that way. But let's say you and I are working together, seeing each other. A couple times a week you're working on communication skills on how to manage how to not piss her off.

335
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have a place to live and you're near your kids. James is not there.

336
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your grandmother going to see you are actually committed for the first time, because you're not with him.

337
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see it.

338
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.610
Yeah.

339
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.250
Ashley Bitakis: Something across main to

340
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.690
Ashley Bitakis: It's just, that's what's holding me back from a lot of things.

341
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you're scared it's where am I going to live, how am I going to do this the part you don't know. And this is the part where I can step in

342
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody

343
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Has to have faith that everything's going to be okay.

344
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know that.

345
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What you can't see his help. Absolutely.

346
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:49.290
Ashley Bitakis: I'm already here.

347
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.650
Ashley Bitakis: She couldn't hear because the traffic. I'm sorry.

348
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.920
Ashley Bitakis: She couldn't hear the traffic. I am sorry.

349
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to continue

350
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Another time, what do you want to do, how would you feel safe.

351
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Here. OK, now

352
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.350
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, I actually took his later.

353
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.150
Ashley Bitakis: Okay, okay.

354
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm trying to communicate Ashley is because you're in it. It's normal for you to find it a really cool thing that your mom is smoking less crack

355
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Your perspective on what a healthy environment is is so skewed.

356
00:41:50.070 --> 00:42:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can't see how your whole environment is surrounded by drugs, it's it's surrounded. There is a whole other life out there where you can love yourself and raise your children.

357
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect job a job you enjoy and all that charm and and creative mind that you have people around you will enjoy, but you don't know that right now.

358
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:15.180
Ashley Bitakis: I'm

359
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Not saying you're completely consumed with what if I lose James

360
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he's your everything right now he's security keys.

361
00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Bit of love this little crumb of love that you're willing to accept as nourishment. You don't know what is available to you. You live on scarcity and uncertainty and you don't know in a real time.

362
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Even what health is

363
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. I've been watching, where is it, where is it, I haven't heard anyone who's in your life that is a loving healthy person.

364
00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way to the soul. You don't know a darn person.

365
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this mystery of of Jesus Christ like is that real. Is that a real thing. There are good people. Yes, we

366
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We get selfish sometimes and we save route things. And maybe we get angry, but there are good people that you could be near you just don't know that right now.

367
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And the part that I think I can play is I can have that faith when you don't know it to be true. I know you are capable of working a job.

368
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Staying on antidepressants for a while until you really get solid in your self esteem, your identity, but you've got some healing to do for sure. Okay.

369
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, so what, so you do it. I'm happy to do that with you and then get kids back maybe you go to school, do something that you enjoy right a career.

370
00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But that won't happen unless you get some treatment and you're away from him. I don't think that's just good

371
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:05.340
Okay.

372
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't have to look so far ahead. All you have to do is just look at one thing and that is you had this conversation you sat with the idea of maybe I really do need I'm real close. This might be my bottom

373
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to overanalyze you just do the next right thing and the next right thing will happen. You don't have to take it more than one hour ahead. You just go this hour. This is what I'm going to do. Don't overthink it. So,

374
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say one of your first steps is. I mean, I can make some calls for you and I can see what availability is, is your email secure. Could we communicate via email. Okay, so that won't work. So it's going to be in here.

375
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:48.720
Yeah.

376
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

377
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you do this.

378
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

379
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a couple of little things. I don't know that's going to happen at this late hour, but little things like you could sign a release of information.

380
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You could you and I could be on the phone on the I've done this. I've been on the St. I've been on the phone.

381
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: With for example you, um, how did we, how could we worked up

382
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on the phone with the provider with Medicaid behavioral health and you're hearing zoom

383
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.560
And

384
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I get the information I asked the questions and we sort of move like that.

385
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:38.910
Okay.

386
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. If you absolutely had to take a bus to get somewhere if it was an hour away or something.
