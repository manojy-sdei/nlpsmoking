212
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.550
iPhone: That's kind of

213
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:36.780
Richelle Direny: Where your you know your your thought process because regardless of what your situation and your circumstances. It's something that starts to really assess your life.

214
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:46.860
Richelle Direny: You know, one of the questions I posed this like, you know, we all create this image of our lives or where we should be at this point, our lives. We've created

215
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:57.390
Richelle Direny: In our head. And so now we got to the point where we have to kind of, you know, kind of relinquish kind of let go of that image of what we thought our life would be at this point.

216
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:14.430
Richelle Direny: You know, what is that for you in terms of where did you think your life will be at this point. And if it isn't what you've pictured in your head. How do you find joy and your story, meaning your life like how do you find joy in where you are right now.

231
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:47.910
iPhone: And this is how I do it. You know, and I understand, like, it may not, I give myself enough time see most of my goals are long term goals. So don't try to make last minute goals and short term girls I give myself long term goals.

232
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:58.830
iPhone: Like that means over a period of maybe five to 10 years long term goals where I should be. So actually, my life is probably most likely we're supposed to be right now. Um,
