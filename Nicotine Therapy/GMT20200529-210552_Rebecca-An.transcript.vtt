Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry about that. I was on the phone.

3
00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.760
Ethan: The only problem is, I'm in the middle of this like renaming process.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: renaming

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.830
Ethan: I will just coding and like I started renaming something. And if I don't finish that it's gonna be left in the state that I can't figure it out.

6
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay, we only. We don't need to meet for very long. I just wanted to check in with you and see how you doing, you look a lot better. You can tell you've gotten sleep and stuff.

7
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
Ethan: Oh, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. It's funny, you know, it keeps happening.

Ethan: At like 630 in the morning one and talk to people in Berlin.

11
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.500
Ethan: So I don't know if it keeps happening. But that that's what happened this week.

12
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As funny.

13
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.110
Ethan: I'm today. I had to get up at seven again but I

14
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.210
Ethan: I feel

15
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.810
Ethan: I feel pretty rested.

16
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You had some good sleep. The last couple nights.

17
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.110
Ethan: Well, this past night I didn't sleep long enough.

18
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.740
Ethan: But yeah, the night before. I definitely got some good sleep.

19
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can tell the difference in your presentation.

20
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you are working on your sleep that it's getting better. Yeah.

21
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:51.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, normally your mind. You know, when you talk, you have blank spots. When you're talking to me and you're deceived and, you know, there's just this ashy look that comes over your face when you haven't slept.

22
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that's all gone.

23
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.120
Ethan: Gee, that doesn't sound good.

24
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wish I could. I wish I could go back and show you what I see. You know what I mean. Show.

25
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Show you. Because then you would see it. You know what I mean and realize that physical effects it has on you when you're when you're sleeping minimal or

26
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not at all. I know.

27
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.940
Ethan: Yeah. Well, I wasn't

28
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.410
Ethan: I remember I was tired like I was really tired. Last, last time when I when I saw you definitely

29
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got the last couple months. The last time was battling is

30
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, it's just

31
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not as one time. Oh.

32
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's been, I can tell. I can tell we're not doing good, and when

33
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when you are doing good. And, you know, since you've been on this, this, you know, downhill slope, the slippery slope.

34
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.950
Ethan: Yeah.

35
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you just kind of where it in your presentation. But today, your presentation as a lot better, you know,

36
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cool. I'm

37
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.410
Ethan: Really happy to hear that. I had some

38
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:06.300
Ethan: Something exciting happen I think he was, he yesterday I was dead since I've talked to you the security company.

39
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.700
Ethan: So the sort of second company that I was considering the, the CEO kind of came after me that I tell you about this.

40
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.520
Ethan: Ah, yeah, I'm

41
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:36.450
Ethan: Apparently, what happened is they had a guy who does sort of who's you know in my category. I don't know if he's a senior as I am, but um they had this guy, so they thought they were kind of okay so they were in a huge hurry to hire me. That was kind of the feeling I was getting

42
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.000
Ethan: But then it didn't work out with that guy. So they fired him and now

43
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.420
Ethan: I guess that there are, there is some other

44
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.280
Ethan: People that are options but I seem to be the horse that the CEO is getting behind so he's pushing me. He's like,

45
00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:03.420
Ethan: Get, get us your resume soon. And so I think maybe you know what I mean. I think somebody else might have some someone else that is a possibility but

46
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.900
Ethan: Anyway, it's really, it's a really good feeling.

47
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.210
Ethan: And they're, they're really strong company.

48
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

49
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.610
Yeah.

50
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See

51
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's awesome.

52
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.440
Yeah.

53
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good stuff.

54
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like, you know,

55
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely do the work, start doing the work.

56
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you're going to get your resume send off to them.

57
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.790
Ethan: Yeah, so now i mean i already. That was my goal for the weekend, you know,

58
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.440
Ethan: We made that plan when we talked on Wednesday, but now it's like

59
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.810
Ethan: This is the would it sounds like this would be like a pretty perfect job for me at least the way that I understand it so far.

60
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.830
Ethan: And what this company does is like

61
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:05.640
Ethan: Here, let me try to describe it to you. I was trying to describe it to liliya and for one thing she thought it was a boring way that I

62
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just TRIED IT AND FOR ANOTHER THING SHE BARELY

63
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:20.670
Ethan: Barely on didn't really understand or, um, but, uh, so it when you have a popular website and you're doing, like, you know, thousands of requests per second.

64
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:40.530
Ethan: By the time you get that big every single site has, it has problems where in this massive volume of traffic like requests that that is coming to them. A lot of it is like automated traffic from scammers

65
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.830
Ethan: Okay, so, um,

66
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.020
Ethan: You know, just imagine your BF h.com or, you know,

67
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.850
Ethan: Any site.

68
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.570
Ethan: Facebook and, you know, Google those sites or even like they're really huge so that that's even on a whole nother scale but

69
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.940
Ethan: Yeah, basically every site that's out there is getting constantly attacked by people who are trying to

70
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.700
Ethan: Break in with

71
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:22.860
Ethan: You know, they're trying to get somebody password that they have a database of passwords that they think might be good, but they're not sure, or they want to log on and create 1000 fake dating profiles for some reason.

72
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:36.090
Ethan: People do this and like actually sell the databases of fake profiles to other nation states just crazy thing that happens like it's like spy stuff and it's pretty interesting.

73
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.640
Ethan: Um, so anyway, what this company does, is there the currently the best in the market for being the the

74
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:54.750
Ethan: Intelligent defense that it analyzes the traffic and in real time. It's spots. The, the bots.

75
00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.250
Ethan: And the attackers. It'll. It'll help you like block your site to protect to

76
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.580
Ethan: You know, to protect you. Your whatever it is your bank or your dating site or

77
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.600
Right.

78
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what would you be doing

79
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.170
Ethan: Um,

80
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.890
Ethan: I didn't

81
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.070
Ethan: I haven't heard a suggestion of what the title would be, but I'm

82
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:38.610
Ethan: A mayor. He's the CEO, the CEO. He knows me as like a DevOps director kind of guy at at Zoosk and so

83
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.800
Ethan: What it. I don't know if you've ever heard of DevOps. But it's kind of

84
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:51.270
Ethan: A fairly, you know, last five years ago movement in I'm in web tech

85
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.080
Ethan: Um, so the idea is that

86
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:04.200
Ethan: The, the engineers who are writing the programs are more directly involved with running them in in production.

87
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.510
Ethan: You know, monitoring them and making sure that they stay alive and running and everything.

88
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah.

89
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.510
Ethan: That's why I'm always stressed out. I remember I was explaining to you one time that like I'm kind of

90
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:23.850
Ethan: The leader or the, you know, one of the higher level people who's involved with making sure that stuff keeps keeps working.

91
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.020
Ethan: Yeah, yeah. So it would be, it would be pretty much the same rule.

92
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.630
Ethan: No. So it would be

93
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:43.020
Ethan: I mean, yeah, what am I talking about it'd be it's going to be stressful. It's going to be when there's a big bought attack their customers are some of the big names right

94
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:53.280
Ethan: And they are the people that are responsible for, you know, I don't know, like Starbucks. They don't know what the hell did you and somebody attacks their site and like right

95
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.830
Ethan: So they they spend a lot of money on these products like this company that

96
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.500
Ethan: I mean, interviewing for

97
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.290
Ethan: Cells. So yeah, you're really on the line for like

98
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot

99
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of stuff.

100
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:18.750
Ethan: Yeah, you're, you're, you're, you're not exactly the first line of defense, you're usually there's another layer that sort of

101
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.690
Ethan: In front of

102
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.500
Ethan: This like bought defense stuff. But then, so yeah. You're like the second

103
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:43.230
Ethan: It's like if it was a prison break your the second fence that the guys have to jump over before they like or I know for, I guess, in prison breaks. People are trying to get out. So

104
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

105
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know it is. I've had my stuff stolen before so

106
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.960
Ethan: Oh, you had your identity stolen.

107
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.370
Ethan: Yeah yeah

108
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.830
Ethan: Yeah. What happens is

109
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.750
Ethan: Unbelievably in the early history of the web.

110
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:10.200
Ethan: All the sites when when they built the sites they put people's passwords in plain text in the database.

111
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.110
Ethan: Which you don't have to do, but that that's how they. I don't know why, but that's how they built like all of these sites.

112
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

113
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:25.110
Ethan: And so what happened and then everybody got hacked right one, one at a time like Yahoo got hacked and LinkedIn got hacked and

114
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:41.700
Ethan: Easy target got hacked and and so one of the things that the hackers every time that happens. Um, this huge set of usernames and passwords leaks out onto the dark web millions and millions of them and

115
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:54.720
Ethan: That the hackers, get them and they keep wanting to know like, Oh, are these good are these fresh credentials for for Zoosk and so they'll make a million requests to Zeus to, like, you know, to figure out like

116
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.450
Ethan: Do any of these passwords work.

117
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:03.300
Ethan: Right, right. And so you want to detect those guys and stop them. And it's a crazy. It's a crazy arms race.

118
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:18.930
Ethan: Like their programs get more and more sophisticated randomized so look to look like a real human behavior. And then the detection algorithms get more and more sophisticated to basically anything that has a repeating pattern.

119
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:30.540
Ethan: Kind of, no matter which angle you look at it, you look. Finally, you see it and you're like that. I can't be human. You know, there's like 800 requests that repeat over and over again, kind of exactly the same. Yeah.

120
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.440
Yeah.

121
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:33.930
Ethan: Yep.

122
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.390
Ethan: Wow, that's what the new job is about

123
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's really cool.

124
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.140
Ethan: Or will be about if I get it.

125
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you get to work on your resume this weekend, get it to the company and see where it goes.

126
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:55.140
Ethan: I'm going to get it to the company. And I'm gonna probably interview soon, um,

127
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:06.930
Ethan: But it sounds like it's gonna be all over zoom still like they're not expecting for like everybody to be in the office yet.

128
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:17.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Makes sense. It's everything's kind of gradually coming back to some kind of what that normal looks what normal looks like nobody knows you know

129
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.240
Yeah.

130
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely the the

131
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.100
Ethan: Thing about this. I mean,

132
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.300
Ethan: This is like

133
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:38.730
Ethan: There's two jobs or two companies, there might be more but there's definitely these two companies where I know the people so well that I have this like huge advantage when it comes to like

134
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.880
Ethan: You know, I already kind of joke around with the CEO, you know, and tell them I need a haircut before I

135
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.040
Ethan: Right, so, um,

136
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.650
Ethan: So, yeah.

137
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.230
Ethan: If I don't

138
00:12:53.370 --> 00:13:04.170
Ethan: If one of those doesn't work out, then it's a whole different ballgame. Because like I was like I have I got arrested this year or last year. And that's possible to find out if you do a background check these days.

139
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:14.820
Ethan: Yeah, I'm so like these companies. I don't think they'd look and if they did, I could have, you know, they, I could you know I have a conversation with the

140
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:25.740
Ethan: With whoever the hiring manager is AND PROBABLY, HOPEFULLY explain. I'm in a reasonable way what what it was about.

141
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. What charges. Did, did you, what did you get charged with

142
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.060
Ethan: And that was a worst

143
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.730
Ethan: Situation. It was like a it was a drunken

144
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.700
Ethan: Like

145
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.240
Ethan: Sort of wrestling match with liliya

146
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:46.980
Ethan: That

147
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.870
Ethan: Turned into me trying to

148
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.620
Ethan: Push to get her out of the house.

149
00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:04.170
Ethan: You guys were so drunk and like, you know, so it was basically

150
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.890
Ethan: When we got arrest arrested.

151
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.540
Ethan: So he ended up falling off of the balcony.

152
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:20.850
Ethan: In the office ever and apparently the officers thought that I told them that I pushed her off of this balcony, which I totally didn't do

153
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.370
Ethan: Because she got hurt pretty bad.

154
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:33.570
Ethan: So yeah, we but we actually both got arrested Lily went to the hospital and then to jail.

155
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh wow, and they charged me with domestic violence.

156
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.190
Ethan: They charges both lit with federal domestic violence. Yeah.

157
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

158
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:43.950
Ethan: And then they didn't

159
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.060
Ethan: You know, they gave us a a

160
00:14:51.060 --> 00:15:06.030
Ethan: Protection Order. There's like a mutual protection orders and neither of us could see the other that lasted for five days, except for like liliya was allowed to be in the apartment and it wasn't so I had to like, you know, I stayed at my head or wherever, for

161
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.230
Ethan: For a couple days and then

162
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.030
Ethan: Yeah, then we got back together.

163
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what happened with the charges. They just did they drop them or

164
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:26.040
Ethan: Yeah, like literally the same hour that we were allowed to see each other. They had this

165
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:41.490
Ethan: I don't know. It's like a announcement of what cases they're going to prosecute are ever in the following week at the courthouse and so they just they they close the case, it says insufficient evidence or something like that.

166
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's good.

167
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:50.970
Ethan: But it also said it's the way that these charges work really nasty.

168
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.430
Ethan: The whole thing. We just such a bummer.

169
00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:02.880
Ethan: The way it works. The police like charged with the highest possible thing they can charge you with because they have all these advantages and

170
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.290
Ethan: Procedures right

171
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:14.790
Ethan: So if they charge you with such a high crime, then it gives the DA the option of sort of reconsidering whether they wanted to

172
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:20.280
Ethan: Prosecute again for UP UP TO TWO YEARS. So it's this sort of like thing thats hanging over

173
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:31.800
Ethan: I was talking to the bail bondsman and she said in her 25 years of being in the business. She's never heard seen them do that even once. So it basically doesn't happen but

174
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

175
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:36.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

176
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

177
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.140
Ethan: The trick is to stay sober and not getting wrestling.

178
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.370
Ethan: wrestling matches.

179
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

180
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so.

181
00:16:53.490 --> 00:17:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It seems like if you keep your, your faculties about yet and and don't engage in that baby maybe don't get drunk. How about that right um

182
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then you won't

183
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have a whole lot to work, you know, worry about

184
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what it would seem to me.

185
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so, um,

186
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you can explain and that might not even be on your

187
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.790
Ethan: Record. I mean, nobody has a

188
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.170
Ethan: I've talked to so many people about it and nobody has a straight answer, but

189
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:44.130
Ethan: I think it's basically how expensive of a background check, are they doing me because if they do a really hardcore Pete. You know what kind of investigator.

190
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:50.490
Ethan: You know, like, um, what's the word I'm looking for PR private investigator kind of background.

191
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:59.580
Ethan: Yeah, they have some way of like getting people's arrest records for, you know, they have to go to the courthouse, maybe a little bit

192
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.660
Ethan: Florida's funny like in Florida, your

193
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.800
Ethan: As soon as you get arrested. Your, your mug shot is like public information in the whole state.

194
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:18.390
Ethan: And so really yeah and it's one of the reasons that the Florida man phenomenon happens on the

195
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.500
Ethan: On the web. Have you heard of this.

196
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.260
Ethan: Ah, so funny. Oh my god.

197
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:38.010
Ethan: If you get if you start if you get into it. You're just going to roll over, like just dying laughing. So I think there's some I forget exactly what it is like you search for Florida man, and then your birthday.

198
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.750
Ethan: On the web and you're gonna find newspaper headlines for something ridiculous that happened in Phuket

199
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

200
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:56.100
Ethan: And it always the headline starts with and they're real newspaper, the real you know real newspaper articles about real things that happened in Florida, but they're just like so absurd.

201
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:06.570
Ethan: So there's these like rooms and Reddit and Twitter and stuff where people just post and like endless lists of like these funny article names.

202
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, that's funny.

203
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.220
Ethan: Yeah, one of them, the one that I saw when I did it was like

204
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:19.620
Ethan: Florida man loses leg after jump jumping into Lake with wearing crocs.

205
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.580
Ethan: Something like that.

206
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy.

207
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.660
Ethan: Here, let's try

208
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:29.430
Ethan: Never done this.

209
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.820
Ethan: Florida, let's say,

210
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.370
Ethan: April, so

211
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.180
Ethan: Well this one guy is just someone getting shot and and now he so that's not that

212
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.090
Ethan: Oh, wow. Now they're making a TV show about the Florida man phenomena.

213
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.320
Oh really,

214
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:05.160
Ethan: Okay, here's one Florida MAN ACCUSED OF repeatedly exposing that's not that great.

215
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.820
Ethan: Anyway, check it out.

216
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I will definitely um, how has your self care been

217
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.260
Ethan: I think I get a kind of b plus

218
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:24.960
Ethan: Just

219
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:42.480
Ethan: I'm a night person and have this job where I have to get up at 630 in the morning, three, three days a week. So on some days. I'm like, I'm feeling pretty great. And then other days. I'm a little sleepy. Today the sleepy day. So that's why I was so surprised that you're the you're saying

220
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you look a lot better because the other night when I saw you, you were pretty

221
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:56.550
Ethan: Yeah. That night I might have gotten like two hours and asleep. And then, but today I got four hours or something.

222
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:58.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

223
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:05.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what are you going to do this week to get help you continue to get back on track.

224
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:15.060
Ethan: But one awesome thing is that Monday is a holiday in Germany, so I don't have to get up at seven in the morning on Monday, and today's Friday.

225
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:24.090
Ethan: Friday. So, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, so it's five whole days that I don't have to get up at seven in the morning.

226
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.230
Ethan: So I think the trick. The trick is, if I can just get used to getting I felt like

227
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:28.890
You know,

228
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.590
Ethan: I don't have to get up early and just can't.

229
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:37.830
Ethan: Sleep until two, which is what I tend to like to do if I'm left to my own devices.

230
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:45.240
Ethan: So yeah, if I can get, you know, start to get up at nine o'clock or 930

231
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.430
Ethan: I'll be proud of myself.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are you gonna say

254
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:16.560
Ethan: Um, I was thinking about that when I was going through all that the struggle with the big conversion, because when I come out of the other side, I realized I built this awesome thing. So I was in my offered way. I was like, leading the company.

255
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.400
