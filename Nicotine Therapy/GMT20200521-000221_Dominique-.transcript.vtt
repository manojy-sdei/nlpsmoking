8
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:25.590
Jesse Baca: Okay, sure. All right. It's getting picked up my girlfriend shaking it up so itch, she's busy at work. So I don't have time to message her and asked her, she picked it up or anything, but she she picked it up, though. I just didn't ask it. Well, when we're there anything like that.

12
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
Dominique Pozo: Well, from what I understood john was gonna call the quantity and and as well.

13
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.150
Jesse Baca: Okay.

14
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.160
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so, so how's it going, it sounds like your anxiety had been pretty high. This last week.

15
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.430
Jesse Baca: Yeah, well not last week. Oh, is is pretty pretty high, though. Yeah.

16
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.320
Dominique Pozo: What has something in particular contributed to it be an extra hi

17
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.870
Jesse Baca: Um,

18
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.530
Jesse Baca: I think maybe probation.

19
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.600
Jesse Baca: But, um, it's usually it's pretty high, though most of the time.

20
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.580
Dominique Pozo: Being on probation.

21
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.570
Yeah.

22
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.580
Dominique Pozo: That's, uh huh.

23
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.260
Dominique Pozo: That makes sense. That seems

24
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.890
Dominique Pozo: Like it, it couldn't do some anxiety for sure.

25
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.330
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

26
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.210
Dominique Pozo: So what would you like to address today.

27
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.850
Jesse Baca: I'm

28
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.130
Jesse Baca: Just a way to

29
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.710
Jesse Baca: Maybe a be more organized and be more productive with my time.

30
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.630
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

31
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.400
Dominique Pozo: Let's, um, are you willing to do some drawing it always helps to kind of use other parts of the brain to do these things.

32
00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.800
Jesse Baca: I guess you can be drawing. I don't think I have something I just, oh no, I mean, that's our notebook.

33
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.630
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

34
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.390
Dominique Pozo: So if you could grab that with them a pen and if you have, if you have

35
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.230
Dominique Pozo: Like markers or some sort of color that get those. If not, no worries.

36
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.460
Jesse Baca: Pencils, a little bit of them.

37
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.940
Dominique Pozo: Oh, good, great. Yeah, let's use those.

38
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.150
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

39
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.960
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so put yourself in. So draw circle, please.

40
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.640
Dominique Pozo: And

41
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.260
Dominique Pozo: And really use those colors get get kind of creative with the colors.

42
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.460
All right.

43
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.630
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

44
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.260
Dominique Pozo: Try that circle and then in the center, put

45
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:12.000
Dominique Pozo: Yourself, however, whatever that looks like whatever symbol represents you whatever colors image, whatever.

46
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.250
Jesse Baca: Alright.

47
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.950
Jesse Baca: Was that again.

48
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.240
Dominique Pozo: So, you know, make a big circle that fills up as much of

49
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.300
Dominique Pozo: The page as possible. Make that circle with whatever color you feel move to make it

50
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.320
Jesse Baca: Okay.

51
00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:03.990
Dominique Pozo: Okay, and then put yourself in the center and either, you know, represent yourself with symbols or colors in whatever however you want to represent yourself put you in the center of the circle.

52
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.560
Jesse Baca: Like a drawing of me. Yes.

53
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:22.950
Dominique Pozo: But it doesn't have to be like, you know, two arms, two legs. Here's Jesse, it can be, I don't know if you're feeling like, or I'll just speak for myself today. I'm kind of feeling like a little snail in a shell. So I would do with the snail in the show, whatever represents you

54
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:32.040
Jesse Baca: OK, so the circles. I made is big, the page and jaw whatever my I feel my face motion looks like or whatever. I feel

55
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.080
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you're in the center.

56
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.340
Dominique Pozo: OK. And then, so let's sort of fill that circle with what's most

57
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.300
Dominique Pozo: Important to you.

58
00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:05.910
Dominique Pozo: So what are the things that are most important. And then maybe on the edge of the circle, the things that are kind of important, but they're not like the the core core things that you value.

59
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.230
Jesse Baca: You want

60
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:27.030
Dominique Pozo: So within the circle illustrate, right, however you want to capture the things that are most important to you that are your priorities and most important your life and on the outside of the circle things that you want.

61
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.490
Dominique Pozo: You know, you want to have in your life, but they're not as important as the ones in the circle.

62
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.070
Jesse Baca: Alright job pitches of it.

63
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.780
Dominique Pozo: Or just write them whatever whatever's easiest for you.

64
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.140
Dominique Pozo: But you have, we've got plenty of time and you have the inner you've got this

65
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.600
Dominique Pozo: Of colors too. So go ahead and use those colors.

66
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.040
Jesse Baca: So what's the difference from outside the circle on enough of a circle, man.

67
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.590
Dominique Pozo: inside the circle.

68
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:04.110
Dominique Pozo: Is what's most important to you, the things that you value the most outside the circle is like you want them in your life and you could do without it, and they're not as important

69
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.140
Jesse Baca: And I guess I don't, I can't really think of anything right now, but I guess that's far as I can get.

70
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.010
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so do you want to show me what you've done.

71
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.390
Jesse Baca: Sure. Just. All right.

72
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.840
Dominique Pozo: I can't see.

73
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.820
Jesse Baca: Another

74
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.990
Jesse Baca: Oh, I'm trying to reverse camera by determine

75
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.750
Jesse Baca: If it's even focusing at all.

76
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:15.390
Dominique Pozo: Gosh, it's really hard to see. So, I mean, this is most of this is for you. Really, so why I did this was as you start, you know what, what was your original intention for the session you wanted to

77
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.760
Dominique Pozo: Create something

78
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.110
Jesse Baca: Or I'm trying to create something then

79
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.640
Dominique Pozo: Sorry, a broken up. I can't hear.

80
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:36.870
Jesse Baca: I can

81
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.070
Dominique Pozo: Gosh, it's all broken up. Can you hear me.

82
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:43.620
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

83
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:54.900
Dominique Pozo: I wonder, wonder if we take off our videos now. There you are, I believe, your original intention was to create more

84
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:15.090
Dominique Pozo: I think you are saying, I'm sorry I I lost it. I, I, I wanted you to do this exercise so that we could address what you originally wanted to address, which I believe was it to make a schedule or to have. What did you say the beginning of this session, Jesse. I apologize.

85
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.700
Dominique Pozo: Can. Are you there. Can you hear me.

86
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.250
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you just popped on enough

87
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:56.730
Dominique Pozo: So I had to do this exercise to hopefully help you to get more clarity and clarify what your original intention was. And then I'm gonna just be a little transparent. I did not sleep well last night and I'm exhausted today. So, my mind is not as sharp as it usually is.

88
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:06.390
Dominique Pozo: And I think in the beginning of the session you named wanting to did you say you wanted to create more of a schedule or have a better

89
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.210
Dominique Pozo: Something, what did you

90
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.780
Jesse Baca: Just be more productive. That's my time and just

91
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.930
Jesse Baca: Scheduled better

92
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.430
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so, so from this this drawing that you did with what's most important to you. And then what's more in the periphery.

93
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:33.210
Dominique Pozo: What do you think, how can you imagine that would be helpful in creating a better schedule for yourself. Does that help, does it help to map out what is important to you.

94
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.930
Jesse Baca: Might the exercise, you told me to do is

95
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.970
Jesse Baca: What's important to me.

96
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.360
Jesse Baca: I don't see like

97
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.210
Jesse Baca: Hello.

98
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.190
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm here, I I All I heard was, I don't see, and then you got broken up.

99
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.480
Jesse Baca: What's important to me, what's not important to me. That's what you're trying to show me.

100
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.990
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm just trying to maybe give you some guidance as you create a you know a better schedule to be more productive.

101
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:35.280
Dominique Pozo: Really looking at, okay, what are the most important things. How can I, how can I focus on that. And what would that look like and then those other things that are on the outskirts maybe

102
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:47.640
Dominique Pozo: They get woven into your into your schedule to be productive or not it. This is hopefully to help you kind of sift through the, the, the aspects of your reality.

103
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.860
Jesse Baca: Yeah, plus can be a lot bigger though by just having anxiety just dealing with people.

104
00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:02.760
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. From, from a scale of one to 10 one being not very much 10 being very much. So where's your anxiety in this moment.

105
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.080
Jesse Baca: Nine out of 10

106
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.570
Dominique Pozo: It's nine. Haha. Okay.

107
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.170
Yeah.

108
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:14.070
Dominique Pozo: What um can you identify what what's contributing to the anxiety.

109
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.550
Jesse Baca: Just everything

110
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.920
Jesse Baca: Everything.

111
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.220
Jesse Baca: I guess I was like

112
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.140
Jesse Baca: I'm just not motivated to do anything. I can't do anything at all.

113
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.290
Jesse Baca: And now I feel like someone's going to judge me or something. But I know you're not going to be judging me or anything like that.

114
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.900
Dominique Pozo: I just I just

115
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.710
Jesse Baca: I'm not going to get my quality of life is not really good

116
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.540
Jesse Baca: Have no quality of us.

117
00:16:54.270 --> 00:17:02.880
Dominique Pozo: Let's start from a little maybe pocket of quality. Is there any little thing that you can identify in your life that actually is.

118
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.960
Dominique Pozo: Has some quality and some meaning for you.

119
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:16.950
Jesse Baca: Other than improving this off for the attendee GED classes and barely going to be starting and

120
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.150
Jesse Baca: I don't have anything. Yeah.

121
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.410
Jesse Baca: I'm lacking is not an enjoyable.

122
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.550
Dominique Pozo: So,

123
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.710
Jesse Baca: Go ahead.

124
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.270
Dominique Pozo: No, go ahead. Go ahead.

125
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:50.910
Jesse Baca: I tell my psychiatrist this and my therapist this, but it's just not really getting anywhere we are getting some places, though. But just like medications is just not healthy.

126
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.380
Jesse Baca: But

127
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.050
Jesse Baca: You know,

128
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.750
Dominique Pozo: Nothing shifting

129
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.080
Jesse Baca: Well, it's not shifting

130
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.500
Dominique Pozo: Oh, I'm just reflecting back to you what I'm hearing is that nothing's really shifting. Is that accurate.

131
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.180
Jesse Baca: He sounds about right. Yeah, the terminology. Sounds about right.

132
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.200
Dominique Pozo: Well, what would it look like if it did shift. What would that look like

133
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.270
Jesse Baca: Um,

134
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:29.820
Jesse Baca: mockery have more energy, just like motivated. I'm not motivated, like I want to be motivated

135
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.660
Dominique Pozo: Well, what

136
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:43.260
Dominique Pozo: inside that circle. What, what can you just share with me two or three things that have a lot of meaning to you that you put inside the circle because really I mean that's

137
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.400
Dominique Pozo: What motivates them.

138
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.480
Jesse Baca: Just like I'm

139
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.710
Jesse Baca: Just like I like to learn like a lot about technology and stuff like that.

140
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.320
Jesse Baca: I'm

141
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:12.150
Jesse Baca: Just, I want to learn how to protect production. I love reading about stuff like it sticks to me like whatever I'm interested in, but from just, you know, just reading by my thoughts.

142
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.580
Jesse Baca: And

143
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.200
Jesse Baca: I like plantings. But mine is clapping his youth in

144
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.360
Jesse Baca: Like just planting and just see like I work

145
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.230
Jesse Baca: You know, just, it's not like

146
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.730
Dominique Pozo: Like planting a garden.

147
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.130
Dominique Pozo: planting plants not

148
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:32.760
Dominique Pozo: Gone into that.

149
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.230
Dominique Pozo: Oh, yeah.

150
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.360
Jesse Baca: Yeah, not gardening or nothing, just like time

151
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.670
Jesse Baca: Just plant a tree and everything.

152
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.970
Jesse Baca: Like other plants up and rescue plan.

153
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.670
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. So

154
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:56.580
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds like there's sounds like there's a number of things that kind of have your attention and get you excited, and I'm wondering if that's not enough to motivate you.

155
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.990
Jesse Baca: It is to motivate me I find the GED classes, though.

156
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.560
Jesse Baca: I don't think I don't think I said the right word, not more motivated, but like

157
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:18.480
Jesse Baca: I I've had a good motivation, like, really good. I just I can't concentrate. I can concentrate like you get stuff done, like, you know, like this.

158
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:33.690
Jesse Baca: Obviously, if I'm not like motivated and I'm not doing any I meant for some interesting with that you know you're not humans are not interested in something, you know, I'm of course I'm interested in things that does not have anything to do with being motivated

159
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.270
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so it's not really

160
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.660
Dominique Pozo: It's not motivated sounds like more it's it's more your attention that you can't hold your attention on something.

161
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:43.920
Yeah.

162
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.780
Dominique Pozo: So,

163
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.380
Dominique Pozo: Did she say that you are getting some tests done

164
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.740
Jesse Baca: Yeah, any test on yeah stuff.

165
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.180
Jesse Baca: For like guess like autism or something like that, but

166
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:07.290
Jesse Baca: Like a lot, it's really complicated because I'm getting tested but this real real testing is going to be like it just like a long waiting list for it. Okay. And I don't have the best insurance.

167
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:13.770
Jesse Baca: You know, not all free insurance and insurance and I'm translated into weight and plus just probably already like waiting once for

168
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:25.140
Jesse Baca: Like autism testing and everything like that. The testing. I want to give me getting now it's just to see if or is it worth even getting into testing for autism and it's even worth doing that. No, I mean, I'm

169
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.910
Jesse Baca: I'm pretty sure it's really intensive

170
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.290
Jesse Baca: Happening, you know,

171
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:30.810
Jesse Baca: I don't know if that makes sense.

172
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:39.510
Dominique Pozo: It does. Yep. And I mean, I'm kind of wondering too. If you're having problems focusing if there's some attention deficit going on.

173
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.160
Jesse Baca: I don't know.

174
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:52.410
Dominique Pozo: Because it sounds like sounds like there's motivation and your Spirit wants to do things. But there's something cognitively that's that's in the way or hindering you

175
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.380
Jesse Baca: I've had learning disabilities, when I was younger.

176
00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:05.760
Jesse Baca: Like a lot like in retrospect, like a lot down a lot farther down the timeline, like I've had a speech therapy problems and stuff like that like

177
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.210
Jesse Baca: Speech therapy.

178
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.040
Jesse Baca: Cognitive Therapy. Whatever, I don't know. Well, yeah.

179
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.160
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

180
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:29.010
Dominique Pozo: And are there any areas in your life or with your studies actually you you don't experience a challenge is there.

181
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.730
Jesse Baca: My studies.

182
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:42.240
Dominique Pozo: Yep. And I guess in your life to, like, is there some some area that you do engage in, and you actually don't feel the struggle or the

183
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.870
Dominique Pozo: like something's not enough.

184
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.870
Jesse Baca: Not enough not enough.

185
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:53.250
Jesse Baca: Like

186
00:22:53.490 --> 00:23:06.360
Dominique Pozo: Like you're, you're not able to engage enough with it because it sounds to me that there's a number of things that you enjoy yet you're not able to engage enough to a point that satisfied for you or something like this.

187
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.180
Jesse Baca: Um,

188
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.120
Jesse Baca: I don't know, maybe I just

189
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.960
Jesse Baca: I don't know what you mean, like, I really do want to do this.

190
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.810
Jesse Baca: I really do you want to be successful.

191
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:35.640
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah, I'm just trying to understand. So I so I can, you know, think of things to prompt you to hopefully make some shifts that you don't feel like you're getting nowhere with this.

192
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.190
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

193
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.500
Jesse Baca: I'm

194
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.210
Jesse Baca: I don't know if has anything to do just be having anxiety because I'm already diagnosed with

195
00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:07.080
Jesse Baca: Depression PTSD, which is like anxiety, I think, which is PTSD would be like depression and anxiety. I don't know.

196
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.710
Jesse Baca: Diagnosis of PTSD depression.

197
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:13.350
Jesse Baca: So,

198
00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:19.110
Jesse Baca: I mean, some people are misdiagnosed for years. I don't know.

199
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.000
Dominique Pozo: I don't

200
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:26.460
Jesse Baca: Think I don't think I have. I don't think I'll have ADD. I think doing anything.

201
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:44.580
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Well, it sounds like the anxiety is taking your attention away from whatever's before you because your, your mind's going kind of in a loop around whatever it's saying like, what, what is the loop, maybe right now. You know you named your at nine a bit ago. Are you still at night.

202
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.900
Jesse Baca: What

203
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.780
Dominique Pozo: As far as your level of anxiety. That's what I heard, I heard you say a nine about

204
00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:55.440
Jesse Baca: Yeah yeah

205
00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:57.930
Dominique Pozo: Where are you at in this moment.

206
00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.520
Jesse Baca: Like nine still

207
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.430
Dominique Pozo: You still okay so

208
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:12.570
Jesse Baca: Yeah, it's pretty like I don't know, maybe like eight, nine, like a good yeah it's bad. Yeah.

209
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:24.360
Dominique Pozo: So what's the way if there's like a story or thought that's that is continuing to to roll around in your mind. Can you name that

210
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.060
Jesse Baca: Did a song rolling around in my mind.

211
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.670
Dominique Pozo: Nope, thought not a song I thought

212
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:31.980
Dominique Pozo: What's

213
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:39.120
Jesse Baca: A negative towards myself. Like, why aren't you doing anything with your life and

214
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.620
Jesse Baca: Why I'm like negative things about myself.

215
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.690
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds like they're kind of putting you down or self defeating thoughts.

216
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.040
Jesse Baca: Yeah, putting myself down and I've been told not to be so hard on myself.

217
00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:06.330
Dominique Pozo: I mean, I think I would imagine that would be probably part of the first step is starting to to reprogram your mind because you have this

218
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.730
Dominique Pozo: Have you heard much about like the neural pathways in the brain and how that works.

219
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:22.080
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so, so you're probably familiar than that you have these entrenched pathways that are telling you these negative things and it's it's a very easy road for your thoughts to go down.

220
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:33.720
Dominique Pozo: And really the key to making change is to create new neural pathways and it takes time. It's not going to happen overnight, but it takes time to catch oneself. When you start going down that road of, like, oh,

221
00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:39.120
Dominique Pozo: I should be this should be that I'm not doing this and not do not whatever the story is

222
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:51.750
Dominique Pozo: When you catch yourself doing that. Can you write down maybe three replacement phrases that could put another spin on where you're at. Currently in your life so that you have some

223
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.440
Options.

224
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.970
Jesse Baca: Sure, I got three replacements off.

225
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.200
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

226
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.370
Dominique Pozo: Sure. What are they

227
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.830
Jesse Baca: On you can get through this. You're smart anxiety can't control what you do.

228
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:10.380
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so do you have those written anywhere. And so that you can see them in plain view around your house.

229
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.190
Jesse Baca: Sure, I can do that.

230
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:15.660
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

231
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:26.310
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm going to invite you right now to make three signs that are however big you want them or small but make them so that you can put them up.

232
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:39.540
Dominique Pozo: Because I think this is the beginning of every pattern in your brain or nothing's going to change. You know, if you just keep going through your days and you let those negative thoughts control you, nothing's going to change. It's really going to take

233
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.300
Dominique Pozo: replacing them with something new.

234
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.580
Jesse Baca: Um, alright,

235
00:28:46.200 --> 00:29:02.490
Dominique Pozo: So you have all these colors if you feel inspired to use the colors really make this make this alive. You want it to catch your attention and you want it to be something that your eyes. Keep going to so that you can start to tell yourself a new story.

236
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.900
All right.

237
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.340
Jesse Baca: Drop you later.

238
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:43.740
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

239
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.850
Dominique Pozo: Why, why will you have to read, rather than later.

240
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.380
Jesse Baca: Because it's not good. I know I can draw it way better later.

241
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:02.760
Jesse Baca: Not gonna have junk lodge my room like that and they won't make me feel better.

242
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:09.840
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. So maybe this isn't the time then to take the time to make the signs. What do you think

243
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.000
Jesse Baca: Sounds like a good thing to do. I think that's really, that's really awesome.

244
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.170
Jesse Baca: I don't know why I haven't thought of that. Maybe that's why you have this job.

245
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:28.140
Dominique Pozo: I guess I'm just, I'm I'm my worry is that you won't do it later. And so that's why

246
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.740
Jesse Baca: I want you to do. Oh no, I'm not taking this seriously like

247
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:39.360
Jesse Baca: If, if that's what you think that's fine. I, it sounds like a really good idea.

248
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:53.490
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I'm not. This is nothing personal. I think I just know I'll even speak for myself. I'll have you know these these prompts for my therapist and because I have the time with her. I, I follow through and I do it, and sometimes

249
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.010
Dominique Pozo: She'll prompt me and I won't do it after the

250
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.920
Dominique Pozo: Session. I just get caught up in life and I let like

251
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.780
Jesse Baca: I'll do, I'll do this right now though.

252
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:17.040
Jesse Baca: Well, I'm going to redo this better. And I think it has some blank canvas Kevin says throughout canvas around that are like, way better. They're like, you can like Safari or Crayola acrylic painting. It's not my stuff though, but she says I can use it whenever

253
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:18.330
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

254
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.670
Jesse Baca: It's this stuff right here. They're like just sitting here, not being used at all. That's good texture on it.

255
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.010
Dominique Pozo: Great. Yeah, you can pay

256
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.930
Jesse Baca: I'm just not said I'm going to review it later though if you stay here.

257
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:38.910
Jesse Baca: Gonna look way better later. And it's and I don't have time just to be wasting people's time Mustaine that

258
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:52.470
Jesse Baca: Because if I was doing that and, you know, just like I'm running out of time right now and I need some I need something to do to change my life so I'm not going to be changing my life and then why am I even doing anything.

259
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.160
Jesse Baca: Like it's gonna be good, though.

260
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:26.040
Jesse Baca: Like I'm concerned for myself. Like if I don't do something. Now I'm going to go on a rampage, and like on myself and just just end it.

261
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:27.150
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

262
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.860
Jesse Baca: And I'm really concerned about that.

263
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.370
Dominique Pozo: Oh yeah, to be been having thoughts of have ended.

264
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.540
Jesse Baca: He was in the back of my mind. Don't have time or anything like

265
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.180
Jesse Baca: Make him doing something right now, you know,

266
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.650
Jesse Baca: Doctors like Dr. In the therapist and trying to make

267
00:32:48.870 --> 00:33:02.850
Jesse Baca: I'm like, it's not that is the most famous right there, it's always going to be there unless I make those new like like rewire my brain like this rewire it like like how you said it's just it takes time to do that.

268
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:13.140
Dominique Pozo: It does, but I'm really hearing that you're, you know, you're receptive to the idea of it and that you do want the change. So you're willing to at least give it a go.

269
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.340
Jesse Baca: Oh yeah, it's gonna and I can take I have time

270
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.320
Jesse Baca: And I appreciate it.

271
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:29.130
Jesse Baca: And this is actually a really good idea, though, because I'm going to be looking at it every day. I mean, like, every day that I wake up and it's going to be there.

272
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.970
Jesse Baca: And it's going to be telling my subconscious mind and my conscious mind like if there's, you know, I'm trying. I don't know if that makes sense.

273
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.240
Dominique Pozo: It does. And it's, you know,

274
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:48.090
Dominique Pozo: I just think it speaks to the power of, you know, the power that we have

275
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.010
Dominique Pozo: To make change. It's all

276
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.310
Dominique Pozo: It's all within us. It's just, you know, really.

277
00:33:54.450 --> 00:34:08.100
Dominique Pozo: Committed to it. And there's the saying that our input becomes our output. So if you are looking at these these messages daily that input, it starts to become your output, things are going to change. I really, I really believe it.

278
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.980
Jesse Baca: Amazing to me.

279
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.600
Jesse Baca: Okay, I got you.

280
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.000
Jesse Baca: And the other day I got

281
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.020
Jesse Baca: I'm working

282
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:42.120
Dominique Pozo: Jesse are all broken up. I don't know why I can't hear what you just said. You said something about the other day, but I didn't catch it.

283
00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:53.460
Jesse Baca: The other day. Oh yeah, the other day I was, I knew how to rear camera. No, but just for the

284
00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:01.200
Jesse Baca: English make it like people it's not you know like what they don't make it very, very

285
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.330
Jesse Baca: Very

286
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.820
Jesse Baca: Very

287
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.980
Jesse Baca: Streamlined at all.

288
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.540

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:49.890
Dominique Pozo: There's anyways. It doesn't matter where it's coming from. Something's happening. It's not really flowing. So I think

365
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:59.610
Dominique Pozo: I think let's let's bring the session to a close to just take a few more deep breaths. And I don't know if you heard my last invitation, but it was from this place of

366
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:09.360

367
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.910
Jesse Baca: Heard last of each other.

368
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:28.470

369
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.620
Dominique Pozo: I can't hear you. The

370
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.630
Dominique Pozo: Connection is so poor.
