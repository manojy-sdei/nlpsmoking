Ray Casias: Had a really bad seizure.

17
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.460

Ray Casias: A little bit.

Ray Casias: Over 30 hours cheese. Yeah, and

22
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.010
Ray Casias: I expected to just get my usual two or three hours of sleep.

23
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.890
Ray Casias: And I ended up sleeping. A good seven hours and

24
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.210
Ray Casias: That is this. I haven't done that and so long.

25
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.950

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.060

30
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so let's kind of dive in and see

31
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we got here. Any feedback from the neurologist. Has there been any follow up, they do on their part to get a pre authorization, or whatever it is they need to do.

32
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.210
Ray Casias: They, they called me after Dr. Gabriel called them. They called me right away.

33
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.190
Ray Casias: And supposedly they're working on it.

34
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.160
Ray Casias: I didn't call yesterday and

35
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:58.680
Ray Casias: I didn't hear anything back but I'm gonna give them a call right after this meeting. I plan on calling them earlier. But I know what

36
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.150
Ray Casias: I'm yeah I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna bother the hell out of them.

37
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.450
Ray Casias: Until something gets done.

38
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

39
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

40
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We had begun to

41
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, our focus was very heavily on on that appointment. You know that neurologist. I think that's what us time is all about.

42
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but we were starting to hear some stories you know in your early childhood and

43
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.870
Ray Casias: And I started remembering bottom

44
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you did a

45
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.110
Ray Casias: Lot of stuff. Crazy.

46
00:04:49.140 --> 00:05:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And, well, why don't you pick one that maybe was in a dream or maybe a nightmare. Or maybe you think boy that has a big a big influence on on how I view myself or relationships like

47
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick one to talk about

48
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.460
Ray Casias: part for me to connect that with

49
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What, just tell me what you didn't think about, you don't have to work that hard i can i can help with that part.

50
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So what came up. What were some things you hadn't thought about for a while.

51
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.490
Ray Casias: You know, I always

52
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.300
Ray Casias: Like dad yeah okay well

53
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:08.490
Ray Casias: So after my dad I mentioned briefly that I'm ended up with somebody that was was far worse than my dad.

54
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.630
Ray Casias: He was a younger man and

55
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.850
Ray Casias: He was, he was the devil from serious do either terrible

56
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.240
Ray Casias: Quite a long time. I mean,

57
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.680
Think about that.

58
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.820
Ray Casias: About 10 years

59
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.040
Ray Casias: My dad was

60
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.840
Ray Casias: an alcoholic and asshole.

61
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:30.720
Ray Casias: This guy was just inherently evil. I mean, he he he took the domestic violence to a whole new level. He, he did things. I mean it was just everyday constant

62
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.420
Ray Casias: At one point, and

63
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:46.860
Ray Casias: I have a lot of siblings. But at that time, it was just myself and in

64
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.100
Ray Casias: My youngest sister.

65
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.690
Ray Casias: In the house.

66
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:59.280
Ray Casias: But everybody else was gone. And I remember we just felt so

67
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:10.950
Ray Casias: Terrified. And so, help, but she wasn't a lot braver than I was. She was that I mean she's look she's a little older than I am the shoot, stand up to them and

68
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.760
Ray Casias: Stuff and I always just felt so

69
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.220
Ray Casias: Helpless

70
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.260
Ray Casias: And scared.

71
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:39.060
Ray Casias: You know there were the triggers. We knew when they started raising their voices. I mean, we knew where it was going because it always went there couldn't just be a simple argument. It always it always went there.

72
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.480
Ray Casias: And so just hearing them start raising voices. We didn't know what to do, man.

73
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you.

74
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.310
Ray Casias: He hurt my mom so bad it yeah and then

75
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:19.710
Ray Casias: I did, I did, um, you know, all those years of feeling helpless that what I'm thinking about right now is

76
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.270
Ray Casias: When I turned 15

77
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.000
I

78
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.540
Ray Casias: I was I was

79
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.190
Ray Casias: Big enough and strong enough and i and i

80
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.230
Ray Casias: I decided I was I was never gonna just just watch him.

81
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.240
Ray Casias: Or run away from him and I

82
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.100
Ray Casias: I heard that pretty bad. What else teen years old.

83
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.350
Ray Casias: So much rage so much

84
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.860
Ray Casias: Anger and

85
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.490
Ray Casias: And I find me finally was able to

86
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.200
Ray Casias: Stop him.

87
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:23.370
Ray Casias: Of course, that caused problems tree and woman I and I could not figure that out. I absolutely

88
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.640
Ray Casias: I mean, she didn't want me

89
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.470
Ray Casias: Involved.

90
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.350
Ray Casias: That just boggles my mind. I mean, I was I was

91
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:43.350
Ray Casias: I got out of that I got out of everybody kind of $16 on my own time on 16 because

92
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.250
Ray Casias: I just couldn't understand why.

93
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.020
Ray Casias: Her and I would have problems.

94
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.780
Ray Casias: With me not letting him.

95
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.440
Ray Casias: hurt. Hurt so badly. I mean, she was sick. She, she had cirrhosis.

96
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.780
Ray Casias: She was

97
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.420
Ray Casias: So good to him.

98
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.380
Ray Casias: And I couldn't stand to see it.

99
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.890
Ray Casias: And I finally made it to where I could help her.

100
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.240
Ray Casias: And we just fell out.

101
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.940
Ray Casias: And that to

102
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.530
Ray Casias: Me. Once I got out.

103
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.560
Ray Casias: And always doing good. We we reconciled. It's not like we were

104
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.680
Ray Casias: But I just had this feeling that

105
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:54.660
I

106
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.670
Ray Casias: Didn't understand never gone. No, because he continued.

107
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.660
Ray Casias: On with that. And I mean, my brothers kicked his ass.

108
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.680
Ray Casias: We'd have to go

109
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.150
Ray Casias: I hated I hated to meet my sister there.

110
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.820
Ray Casias: But she would call us and you know our call my brothers when it got really bad. These she didn't know what to do and

111
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:43.830
Ray Casias: I wouldn't go because I knew how my mom felt about it, but my brothers would go kick his ass all the time. You know, you never, never would stop.

112
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.110
Ray Casias: He was so bad.

113
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.870
Ray Casias: This guy that

114
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.940
Ray Casias: You got in a

115
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.580
Ray Casias: Doesn't apply bar fight.

116
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:06.060
Ray Casias: And these people did the best to kill him. I mean, they stabbed him like 20 times they hit him with the hammer

117
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Kidding me.

118
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.930
Ray Casias: No. No kidding. He he he should have been god i mean

119
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.160
Ray Casias: They stabbed him in the chest to where his

120
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:26.280
Ray Casias: His sternum was leaking marrow into body. I mean, he was so bad.

121
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.860
Ray Casias: So bad at his family.

122
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:43.500
Ray Casias: In speaking with the doctors. I mean, it was pretty hopeless and they pretty much said, you know, just, just let him go, he's suffering.

123
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.030
Ray Casias: My mom said no I'm his wife and I have to say so.

124
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:55.170
Ray Casias: She would not let it go and ended up surviving at

125
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:05.160
Ray Casias: Home she nursed back to health to so long did everything for them, and soon as is better started being there again.

126
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.620
Ray Casias: And

127
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:23.340
Ray Casias: We later on we found a journal that my mom kept and it was way worse than any of us even knew about. And she wrote. She wrote things. I mean,

128
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.040
Got

129
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.950
Ray Casias: Too much to think about

130
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's just notice how your stomach's reacting to that right

131
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.390
Ray Casias: Notice that, okay.

132
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.920
So,

133
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a new understanding about sort of

134
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: A new summary about why that happened. Why that pattern happened you still stuck with not understanding

135
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.230
Ray Casias: I understand it better.

136
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.310
Ray Casias: But I don't think

137
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.950
Ray Casias: I don't, I don't understand it well enough, but still don't.

138
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Give you some new information that

139
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: helped explain why that kind of

140
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Tolerance for abuse.

141
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.900
Ray Casias: Because I'm just, just, um, you know, I find that

142
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.780
Ray Casias: I

143
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.500
Ray Casias: Mean I I researched a lot of thing. I know.

144
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.050
Ray Casias: I did.

145
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.310
Ray Casias: Think of. No, I do a lot of

146
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.350
Ray Casias: Thinking

147
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.050
Ray Casias: And

148
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.880
Ray Casias: I will

149
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.860
Ray Casias: Just thinking about things have gained some insight and figure out ways to research.

150
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.340
Ray Casias: And gain more knowledge like

151
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.410
Ray Casias: There's a lot of

152
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.740
Ray Casias: For instance, like

153
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.140
Ray Casias: Remember my mom.

154
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:43.950
Ray Casias: I could say she had cirrhosis and she was sick all the time, but I remember the CP times I started remembering these times where

155
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.060
Ray Casias: She would get up in the middle of the night and

156
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.500
Ray Casias: To start vomiting blood

157
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.850
Ray Casias: And awful, and I never knew what that was. We thought it was something else.

158
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:08.430
Ray Casias: Um, so I just searched some keywords, you know. Dig Dug into it a lot and I

159
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.800
Ray Casias: I was able to figure out that it was it was the

160
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.140
Ray Casias: It was the condition of the cirrhosis, it was worse to be on that time.

161
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.980
Ray Casias: So stuff like that on think of things like that. And then it'll cause me to just look into things.

162
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.100
Ray Casias: Try to try to figure it out.

163
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.420
Ray Casias: Especially a lot of psychological things

164
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.790
Ray Casias: So I've looked into

165
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.890
Ray Casias: Things like that. So it hasn't been anybody really

166
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.240
Ray Casias: Giving me any understanding. It's just me seeking it out.

167
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:01.590
Ray Casias: I just

168
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.660
Ray Casias: Wear

169
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:10.140
Ray Casias: What gets me is the extremity of what she went through.

170
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.630
Ray Casias: At the at the

171
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.170
Ray Casias: And the cost and the cost

172
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.760
Ray Casias: It doesn't. It will never make any sense.

173
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.450
Ray Casias: I just can't get it to balance out at all, or like like even

174
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.080
Ray Casias: I just feel like it was just still dream.

175
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So, what was her story was she worked her parents, similar to your father to this man.

176
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.930
Well,

177
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:02.610
Ray Casias: I don't know a whole lot about any of my grandparents, they were all gone. My, my.

178
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.070
Ray Casias: Things that are just anecdotal and they're not

179
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Your stories.

180
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:25.440
Ray Casias: Not really, not anything that that I can remember anymore.

181
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.190
Ray Casias: I started to

182
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.740
Ray Casias: Reach out to some my siblings have a lot of information.

183
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.220
Ray Casias: Me a little hard.

184
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.720
Ray Casias: I'm strange from my family, pretty much is there.

185
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.560
Ray Casias: Once my mom died. You know, I think struck they're there.

186
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.300
Ray Casias: They're not very good people, you know, they're

187
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.370
Ray Casias: They're conniving gossip, they

188
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.990
Ray Casias: cause trouble for each other word

189
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.240
Ray Casias: Doesn't make any sense tonight just myself from all that

190
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:12.870
Crap.

191
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Just nothing like

192
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.580
Ray Casias: I'm not

193
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:19.950
Ray Casias: Not at all.

194
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.210
Ray Casias: With my brother Marvin is the exception.

195
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.160
Ray Casias: He reminds me and my mom.

196
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:40.230
Ray Casias: Was like her. Um, she was kind and loving, caring, why, and he's everything like that.

197
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.780
Ray Casias: And I feel I have this connection with him.

198
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.720
Ray Casias: And him and I mean he did the same thing before I ever

199
00:20:52.920 --> 00:21:01.260
Ray Casias: Just as myself from everybody. He did, and I, I started to understand why. As I got older.

200
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:07.770
Ray Casias: And I'm

201
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:15.540
Ray Casias: mad. He can I hear things like I speak teeth. There's a nice to

202
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.740
Ray Casias: enjoy talking to and I hear these stories and man I was not wrong.

203
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.610
Ray Casias: To get them myself man there. It seems like they get worse as they get older.

204
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.040
Ray Casias: Like I don't have

205
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:41.850
Ray Casias: I'm not, I don't get get on Facebook or Twitter or anything like that. But my niece will send me anything.

206
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.950
Ray Casias: They're just add a controller that I even have a brother.

207
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.810
Ray Casias: One of my other older brothers.

208
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.940
Ray Casias: Now know he just starts

209
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:08.250
Ray Casias: To start talking shit about me because he doesn't know anything about me and he'll just start spewing. This is nonsense about me. That's so far off.

210
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:18.840
Ray Casias: And so stupid. I don't. I, you know, trying to elicit a response, I guess, but you know i don't i don't buy I don't buy. I won't buy into that.

211
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.840
Ray Casias: But it's so ridiculous.

212
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.230
Ray Casias: So, it sucks that I don't have

213
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:41.160
Ray Casias: Support from my siblings right now when I could really use it. My Marvin is

214
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.760
Ray Casias: doesn't live here. So,

215
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.070
Ray Casias: If he if he did, it would seem to be different for me.

216
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he invited you to come stay with him for a bit.

217
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:05.130
Ray Casias: Uh, yeah, you have and you really, really want me to

218
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.010
Ray Casias: Um, it would just be too complicated for me to do that.

219
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.840
Ray Casias: Right now with my grandbaby

220
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.230
Ray Casias: Yeah, so

221
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.380
Ray Casias: Gosh, I really would love to.

222
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.930
Ray Casias: Know, I might just take a week or something or two.

223
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.720
Ray Casias: Because I think that would be restored. A really work.

224
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I did to

225
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.500
Ray Casias: To be around him.

226
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.520
Ray Casias: No, it's great.

227
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, Stacy in

228
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.350
Ray Casias: Arizona.

229
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.920
Ray Casias: Yeah, so I mean he's just

230
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.130
Ray Casias: He is the best brother that I can imagine you've really done

231
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.490
Ray Casias: Been gone above and beyond for me.

232
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he

233
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: years older. Is he

234
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.550
Ray Casias: Quite good quite a bit at 15 years old and

235
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet he has some stories.

236
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.950
Ray Casias: Oh, man.

237
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandparents, I bet he knows

238
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:32.700
Ray Casias: Oh,

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.480
Ray Casias: Yeah yeah yeah do

240
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to ask them a little bit about what those grant what your maternal grandparents were like

241
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If there was substance use, if there was abuse just sometimes there's a certain story that will follow, even if there's not much

242
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little something that gets passed down

243
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Be curious about that.

244
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.860
Ray Casias: Yeah, I'll send them an email. See what what

245
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:07.860
Oh,

246
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.680
Ray Casias: No, he's real busy. It's got you want to companies.

247
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.760
Ray Casias: To pest control company.

248
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.550
Ray Casias: But I will

Ray Casias: She's busy.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.260
Ray Casias: She's finally doing

257
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.990
Ray Casias: Our

258
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.760
Ray Casias: Job like she's planning.

259
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:17.370
Ray Casias: I'm really happy with the way she's handling himself now. And she's got it, got a grip.

260
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.850
Ray Casias: Know all the

261
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:31.230
Ray Casias: Love lot of the things that I worried that she wouldn't graph to getting really good

262
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:45.330
Ray Casias: Taking care of the baby extremely well just got getting good instincts and she's very responsible with things now.

263
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.370
Ray Casias: Really good out over there.

264
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.100
Ray Casias: She doesn't

265
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.440
Ray Casias: When I can catch her and

266
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.360
Ray Casias: Talk to her.

267
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.090
Ray Casias: I'm real happy with with when she is. She's up

268
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.610
Ray Casias: No.

269
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:25.200
Ray Casias: I'm at a point where a lot of things that I was worried about not worried about anymore. I couldn't

270
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.500
Ray Casias: Have some pieces for that goal.

271
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And the idea of relocating, there was a brief moment.

272
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.270
Ray Casias: Wow.

273
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain.

274
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.810
Yeah.

275
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.690
Ray Casias: Okay. Oh.

276
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:52.800
No problem.

277
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.620
Ray Casias: Okay, I'm sorry.

278
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:18.810
Ray Casias: Okay.

279
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I was just saying that at one point you were, you were considering moving and maybe living near her, and didn't know if you were playing with that idea anymore.

280
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.850
Ray Casias: I am I'm

281
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.060
Ray Casias: My wife's making it really, really hard for me. It's like she doesn't

282
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.740
Ray Casias: Know really pissed her off that I even brought that up.

283
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.260
Ray Casias: But it but it's like

284
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.340
Ray Casias: I don't understand she's

285
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.820
Ray Casias: Like she

286
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:05.880
Ray Casias: Can't make it

287
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.300
Ray Casias: Okay, for me here, but they didn't want me tomorrow and it just doesn't make sense.

288
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what Ray. It sounds exactly like what you just described with your mother.

289
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.490
Ray Casias: Tell me.

290
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't understand. She can't make it good for you, but doesn't want you to go

291
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering well ways, you know, there's this

292
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This particular couples therapy that

293
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's called a mondo relationship therapy.

294
00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And all this work goes into taking know all the positive attributes of our caregivers and all of the negative attributes that we sort of rifle down, I would say, Hmm, I wonder how my current spouse has those, the most important ones in common.

295
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And the odd thing is

296
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's those negative ones.

297
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That end up following us into the next relationship. And you would think that everything in, you would go screaming the opposite direction like this is why why on earth would I pick someone that's just like it. That's not logical.

298
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But that isn't what the psyche does what the psyche does is it brings in someone that resembles that because the longing to heal.

299
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is bigger. We want to heal from that.

300
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: misalignment that Miss attunement that neglect, whatever it was. And so we end up bringing in creating somehow the same story.

301
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's just interesting. It's just noticeable because you said once again almost exactly the same way. I don't understand it. I don't understand it. She won't make it safe won't make it good for me but doesn't want me to go

302
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds just like what you said 20 minutes ago about your mom.

303
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't understand it. And we've read about you trying to understand, I can understand it.

304
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is the moment like, well, what will you do, how will you understand it once and for all and will that understanding bring you healing.

305
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where you get to grow. Maybe she'll grow. Maybe she won't, but this is an opportunity for you to grow.

306
00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What will you because you're not 12 you're not 10 you're not five, you know,

307
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But it can feel just as helpless.

308
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: As if we were real vulnerability from back then.

309
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So, it surprised me that I said that or. That sounds like something you've sat with before.

310
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:36.750
Ray Casias: Yeah.

311
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.260
Ray Casias: No, I've been

312
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.640
Ray Casias: thinking so much about all of this.

313
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.710
Ray Casias: And I, I'm on the verge of

314
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.870
Ray Casias: bickering this out. I think I feel like

315
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:14.700
Ray Casias: Because

316
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.050
Ray Casias: And all

317
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.160
Ray Casias: Realistically, I mean,

318
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.790
Ray Casias: The way my health is

319
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:48.300
Ray Casias: I've got some precious time at me here. I feel like I'm just wasting it trying to make sure

320
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.970
Ray Casias: Other people are okay and I'm not making sure I'm okay.

321
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly what you had

322
00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: scheme to

323
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life was on the line you're, you know, life was at stake, and here you are. And this decision is happening again.

324
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you ended up being just your, your, you and your mom worked it out. There was a an understanding of some kind. Afterwards, when you left

325
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't that the final outcome. There was a mad at you.

326
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll never only okay

327
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.230
Ray Casias: Well, we know we recovered pretty well.

328
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.090
Ray Casias: Once

329
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.950
Ray Casias: I had to

330
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.110
Ray Casias: I had to

331
00:34:52.350 --> 00:35:02.460
Ray Casias: I want to say except because I didn't. I never accepted it, but I had to tolerate the fact that I knew everything was not okay. Even if she told me it

332
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:08.280
Ray Casias: It was exciting new better than that. But I had to

333
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.940
Ray Casias: Tolerate that I could just go

334
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:18.570
Ray Casias: save her from that and still want to be saved from it. She was in it and she

335
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:27.210
Ray Casias: If she, I feel that see and I don't know, I can't, I can't say that.

336
00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.620
Ray Casias: I can't say, well, she could have

337
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.550
Ray Casias: Logically, I know she could have gotten out of it.

338
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.570
But

339
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.820
Ray Casias: I don't know what kept her in it. I can't

340
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.390
Ray Casias: Just assumed to say, well, she could have gotten out of it, you know.

341
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.150
Ray Casias: I know she could have

342
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.120
Ray Casias: For whatever reason, she didn't

343
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:56.670
Ray Casias: And I have to

344
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe take some

345
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.540
Ray Casias: Dissonance that

346
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, take some time. Right. And think about why you're staying

347
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not being taken care of. There's some negative stuff going on for you, but you are struggling with this decision, you know, maybe take it a little perspective to do some reflection about why am I saying, why would I stay

348
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, see, see if you can get some insight from there.

349
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.860
Ray Casias: There's a

350
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.040
Ray Casias: Big like

351
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.070
Ray Casias: Like you said three

352
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.510
Ray Casias: I'll make it

353
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.250
Ray Casias: I'm going to call him a poet is to make it ridiculously

354
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.200
Ray Casias: Simple because he's way more than a poet William Blake.

355
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.500
Ray Casias: Wrote a simple little poem called London, but in this poem, he

356
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.510
Ray Casias: uses the term.

357
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:08.250
Ray Casias: That got me really thinking and I can do it like pyramid on the philosophical

358
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.820
Ray Casias: Implications of this term mind forged medical

359
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.380
Ray Casias: And that's what kind of got me thinking about what I'm, what I'm doing to myself here.

360
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.600
Ray Casias: I've created this

361
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.950
Ray Casias: Seems like I've created this

362
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.770
Ray Casias: NGO

363
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.470
Ray Casias: Need to take care of myself.

364
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So if it's this, so I'll have to go shortly. But if it's that if it's this this theory that I threw out there, then it's

365
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When Will your wife. Take care of one pill, she see your safety.

366
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And will she put aside, whatever her hang ups her story and put you first.

367
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And

368
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.580
Ray Casias: The wind or if

369
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's the dynamic that's where that healing moment is that's what was needed when you are with your mother. She couldn't do it. She didn't do it and here you are again.

370
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.430
Ray Casias: Thank you. Yeah.

371
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:27.090
Oh,

372
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:32.940
Yeah.

373
00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I think everything's gonna be okay. But you might have to write your meeting this moment. Again, you might end up needing to take care of yourself again.

374
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:48.720
Ray Casias: And

375
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It turned out okay you know you're, you're right.

376
00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be the space right in there just sort of sitting with that and

377
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing what comes with it.

378
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's uncomfortable so uncomfortable so confusing makes no sense. It's not logical isn't

379
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The decisions that we make in our family and that defies logic.

380
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But it has to do with attachment, you know, wanting, wanting that that impossible connection with someone that were

381
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: We, you know, Karen. No, they're not capable of it.

382
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it doesn't add up. When you look at just measure people's treatment of you, it doesn't add up logically

383
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right.

384
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah Ileana heavy note.

385
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.430
Ray Casias: You're leaving me on a good note because I still

386
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.040
Ray Casias: Give me something I can, I can

387
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.320
Ray Casias: Tangible to me i can i can get

388
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:16.260
Ray Casias: I can dig into this idea here. So actually made me feel better gives me something.

389
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.150
Ray Casias: Some way that I can.

390
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:26.430
Ray Casias: help myself. I can dig in and start really thinking about this.

391
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you do know what to do. That's the key. You do know what to do.

392
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:36.030
Yeah.

393
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.250
Ray Casias: Thank you very much. Well,

394
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When you want to connect again.

395
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:46.440
Ray Casias: O

396
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.030

397
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. That would put you at

398
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.380

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: At

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: 11am

401
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.280
Ray Casias: No point

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: In February 25 11am and hopefully I will see you in room.

403
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.970

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

Ray Casias: What

410
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.410
Ray Casias: What did I miss. So Monday, are you

411
00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so this is a follow up to the shame versus guilt and this was just a written worksheet, which you can do with us on Friday. Okay. Okay.

412
00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Bye bye.

413
00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

414
00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.100
Amanda Davis: How are you

415
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing well. I saw one logging in and I didn't know I have written down to 15 so I didn't know if we may miss communicate. I didn't mean to come across like I was running late. But I had noted to 15 I hope that's okay.

416
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.420
Amanda Davis: Perfect. Okay.

417
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, we're here now. Right.

418
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.080
Amanda Davis: Yes. Okay, wonderful.

419
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you able to do this assessment with the feeling okay

420
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.710
Amanda Davis: Yeah, I don't feel good today, but I'll do it. Okay. All right.

421
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me just kind of dive right in. I'm a little low energy sand in my day as well, but we'll just persevere. Okay.

422
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.170
Amanda Davis: Okay, thank you.

423
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So just, just a little introduction, just so that you know who I am. Very briefly, I have been practicing here in Florida for about 20 years

424
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, and got my license in New Mexico, just to work with bright heart health. So about two years.

425
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I think what I'll do is maybe ask if you could find a place to talk me sort of stationary so that I don't get dizzy. I'm

426
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:19.710
Amanda Davis: Fine.

427
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take your time. There's no rush.

428
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:30.690
Amanda Davis: That work.

429
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.130
Sure does.

430
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So have been practicing for a while and very drawn to the field of addiction.

431
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Have worked as an AP felony drug court outpatient and as an AP really enjoy working with the population. So it was just a seamless process for me to come here really enjoy working with folks that are kind of struggling with it.

432
00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So just to review. I give people my cell phone number and

433
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What I invite is that we use it as a check in for confirming appointments and then also if you have something sort of significant happening, you need to cancel, then you can text me

434
00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't use it as a therapeutic tool, you won't. You know, if you can reach out and say hey at this all I'm so stressed out or completely overwhelmed.

435
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But I won't be texting sort of therapeutic advice, etc. You'll probably hear me right. Hey, can you meet in, zoom, when's the next time we can meet. OK.

436
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.530
Amanda Davis: OK, let me get your phone number. All then

437
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.510
Amanda Davis: What is it

438
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:49.500
954954 240-240-0884

439
00:44:51.030 --> 00:45:00.090
Amanda Davis: Camera read that back 954-240-0884. Yes. And that's how do I spell your name again.

440
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so you can write

441
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Adding good right when je W. E. N. And then my last name is Aubrey yell, much like Gabriel without the G. So it's a E. R. I. P. L.

442
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to just sort of jump right in here and ask you, um, what were you looking for from by heart health, where you already on Suboxone

443
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.980
Amanda Davis: I know I was. I wasn't already on Suboxone

444
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.420
Amanda Davis: I'm just getting clean

445
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.500
Amanda Davis: Cannot see me.

446
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little fuzzy, but we're okay. I just mostly need to hear you today. Okay, it's really

447
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:48.780
Amanda Davis: Yeah, I, I needed to get clean. I've been clean now since since we started the program. Okay.

448
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And what were you doing prior to that we, I think mentioned one before. Right.

449
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.620
Amanda Davis: Yeah.

450
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So how long did you in

451
00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.400
pain pills.

452
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.080
Amanda Davis: Meth

453
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How long have you been doing the heroin.

454
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:11.880
Amanda Davis: Two years okay but mainly pain pills, what I was doing.

455
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So the first part of today's going to be really focused on getting a history of the opiate use. So maybe you could track back to the first time that you tried it for some people, as an entry and for you. When was that

456
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.570
Amanda Davis: Yeah, the first time I tried pain pills. I had breast cancer.

457
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What year was that

458
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.680
Amanda Davis: 2002 to 2009

459
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And they had you on what medication.

460
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.790
Amanda Davis: oxy cotton.

461
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.640
