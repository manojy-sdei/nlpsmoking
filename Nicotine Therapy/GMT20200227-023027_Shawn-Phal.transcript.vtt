Danny Couser: You know, this is

52
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.930

To live

61
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.800
And so

62
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:13.500
Shawn Phalen: Your anxiety is spiking because you're having to sort this all out and figure out what your next step is, and you're doing it clean.

63
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.780
Danny Couser: You have to remember that there is a solution to every

64
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:34.470
Danny Couser: Still like me to say, cuz like I can leave. I got like two, three hours a day, like a night at most on please like

65
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.500
Danny Couser: Stressing and worrying and wondering

66
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:52.710
Danny Couser: I mean, I've always been like a warrior like I'm always worried like, like since I could remember like when a mom and dad wants you to voice, and I was like five even you know that I had to counseling and all that, then

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.890
Danny Couser: worry, worry about my mom.

68
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:57.240

Danny Couser: And honestly, I feel like

70
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:12.300
Danny Couser: I can almost say it like it was like this pain feeling like times 10 normals just fine. It's just like not being in control, as in like right now. Like, I'm like trying so hard enough to break

71
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.190
Shawn Phalen: It's okay. I mean, honestly, if you break down. It's totally fine.

72
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:23.400
Shawn Phalen: You know, the thing is is that it's actually really healthy to cry, and you probably haven't cried and so much

73
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.080
Danny Couser: You know,

74
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.630
Danny Couser: And you're crying tears of a lot of a lot of stuff you know

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.510
Shawn Phalen: You have to have faith. Okay.

76
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.130
You have to know

77
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.930
Danny Couser: That this will work it out and you will be okay.

78
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:59.460
Danny Couser: Know, so you just sit there, you know, worrying is you're living in the future if you're worrying and you have anxiety, you're freaking out about should hasn't already

79
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.050
Happened and it hasn't happened.

80
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.400
Danny Couser: What's the biggest

81
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.330
Shawn Phalen: What's the biggest fear that you have right now.

82
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.660
Danny Couser: It might sound silly like I don't even know why like

83
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:27.420
Danny Couser: Just like you said, it's like I'm like replace my addiction with her. I don't know. Like, I don't want to lose her for whatever reason, like, I don't know, like, it's like, I mean obviously just added nothing but a list of

84
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:43.440
Danny Couser: Things have just all the negative but I get the same time and don't get me wrong. I mean, obviously a different reason. You know, like, and to say, cuz anyway, it was good. It was like phenomenal. Like, I mean I wouldn't want anything different. In a woman, you know, and

85
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:53.310
Danny Couser: It's like, and it sucks because I got to drive by her exit like off the freeway every day after work, you know, going to convert you know it's just

86
00:17:54.930 --> 00:18:02.970
Danny Couser: Like just even that alone, you know, I mean, I can shift vegan, and it just gets me wondering like, oh, she's probably to somebody else, it already.

87
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:05.460
Danny Couser: I

88
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:12.660
Danny Couser: Just said she looks like she agreed to talk to me the other night, they talk with me the other night or whatever and

89
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.450
Danny Couser: She said she tried call me back. About a week ago and

90
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:31.740
Danny Couser: I didn't answer cuz I'm also do yourself a favor. Let's just turn your phone off good shower and just lay down, watch TV, leave your phone alone do not touch it. Do not text her, did I answered it.

91
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:40.290
Danny Couser: Does give yourself a break from it. Like you're constantly like outside or whatever detective courses her always look electrical and

92
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:48.060
Danny Couser: I mean, I'm not always talking to her, but, you know, so I went ahead and just tried it, because I have no solution to announce anything and

93
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.560
Danny Couser: as I can. So, of course, supposedly, according to

94
00:18:53.190 --> 00:19:04.290
Danny Couser: Nikki. She said she tried calling me because she was going to come and agree to come meet and talk with me, you know, which would have been the first time since all this happened, you know, and it's just like

95
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:13.410
Danny Couser: Sheep. I read her text that I got later on and she never said one thing about coming up to meet and talk with me. So he was playing mind games with me and

96
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:24.150
Danny Couser: Anyway, so I was supposed to meet her at Walnut Creek board and we're going to talk. And then also, and then she just decided now. I don't want to, you know, try to remember like

97
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:33.480
Danny Couser: Like you said, business next to me once upon a time, and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, Are you serious had me go away out of my way. I don't have a car.

98
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:40.770
Danny Couser: Anything to get here and and now you're just gonna just like goes to get like wow ok and

99
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:48.540
Danny Couser: Then, so it's just like I got pissed and looking nicer, like, well, then fine, I'm coming in here and it's like no you're not working, don't kind of

100
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:54.660
Danny Couser: My private don't kind of my house. I should probably cut. I'm like, I don't give a shit. I really like I was just so just

101
00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:07.830
Danny Couser: Just sick and tired of being dicta around and just and I mean as if like, Who gives a shit what I think the other one at all. You know, and it's just whatever is how she feels like playing with. He played here, it would

102
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:20.490
Danny Couser: Be off. Yeah, I don't know, it's just I just showed up over there and I didn't show up over there. I'm sorry. I was just dropped off five 6000 down and she

103
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:27.930
Danny Couser: Should point out of a driveway, and I took a step in towards the street. I was like, waving my hand and she gets

104
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:46.350
Danny Couser: Kind of dark, which is why I kind of put that happens that industry waving my hands get attention and then she had seen me until last ticket. She screamed, like I like all crazy like a visit this character sheet frickin filed an online police report saying I'm stalking her now.

105
00:20:48.240 --> 00:21:00.990
Danny Couser: And it's like, and then she she said she did that on my own BS like you know like have us know puff like you always bluff in the safe such extreme shirt, which always been a button push your mind because it's

106
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:09.180
Danny Couser: Like you don't play around saying that kind of shit. Like, you know, and which is why I didn't think you're serious about wanting to break up this time around, either like

107
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:16.440
Danny Couser: Like yeah you've said and done, this whole charade, how many times, and I'm just, just by everywhere. Two years to be golden, you know, and

108
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.770
Danny Couser: It's just like, now this is like, well, really, isn't she sent me a screenshot of the online police report.

109
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:34.320
Danny Couser: And I'm thinking, she didn't she just act like she's typing it all out. This isn't it and I guarantee shift click the submit button on the bottom. Oh, no. The next message was a screenshot of hers.

110
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.100
Danny Couser: Confirmation and this tracking number of this file and blah, blah, blah, or edited edited it, I'm like,

111
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.500
Danny Couser: I'm like,

112
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:50.610
Danny Couser: Really just did that. And she knows I can. I know thousand percent. I'm not

113
00:21:51.780 --> 00:22:10.740
Danny Couser: Been in iOS those I would not talk to her like bottom like I mean she knows that she's like, I don't know what the hell the game. Isn't that like it's like I don't know my kids like I'm still kind of blown away. I can't even believe it. Like, I'm like, well,

114
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.450
Danny Couser: Here's the thing. Okay. So, since she did, you know,

115
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.250
Shawn Phalen: That's something that you need to pay attention to.

116
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:28.230
Danny Couser: And you need to not contact her because that is, you know, that's pretty serious which she did so.

117
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.540
Danny Couser: Here's my suggestion.

118
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.770
Danny Couser: And my suggestion is that you focus on you.

119
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:45.360
Danny Couser: And you stop focusing on her and what she's done and what she's not saying in what she's saying, because this is a no win situation.

120
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:52.440
And you do not do not want or need the hassle that this

121
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.600
Danny Couser: So,

122
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:04.590
Shawn Phalen: What does that mean to focus on yourself. That means that focus on your sobriety.

123
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.350
Danny Couser: Go to your meetings.

124
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.970
Danny Couser: I mean, it's like not to just, I mean not to like, I don't know, it just like

125
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.640
Danny Couser: I mean, like I said she

126
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:33.540
Danny Couser: Of course, I would have been wanting to get clean but never just felt the need reason or wants to do so. And like I said, when I came to her like no hesitation. The next day I was in the program, you know, and it's like I just feel

127
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.250
Danny Couser: Like obviously I've got some things to achieve should be playing like a job, talking about again and this and that.

128
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:56.820
Danny Couser: And I mean, it's like not to sound cold or rude but sick. I feel like it's so exciting. There's no like no point if I came in like shirt enjoy it, but it's just say, I don't know, like I just I kidding. Alex to except

129
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:11.220
Danny Couser: Say, Well, look, I mean, only you can decide if you want to be clean, like I want to be clean, but I'm just saying, like, it's like a brick wall as far as like, I'm not saying I want to go, you're not at all like I said

130
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:21.750
Danny Couser: Think about it. Don't know craving still even through all this is just like you know it's cured disappointment like 100% through through

131
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.350
Shawn Phalen: This is one person. This is

132
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:25.920
Danny Couser: One.

133
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.770
Danny Couser: person in your life. This is not

134
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.950
Shawn Phalen: Somebody that defines you or defines your sobriety.

135
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.350
Danny Couser: You have to focus on

136
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.240
Danny Couser: And you

137
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:51.990
Shawn Phalen: Have to focus on what you want. This is not a healthy situation that you're in and you need to look at why you're wanting to be in a really

138
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.910
Danny Couser: Destructive unhappy really

139
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.250
Danny Couser: I guess I mean like if he

140
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:10.620
Danny Couser: Does that he just got my head so twisted up like I don't even know. I don't even know answer have to you have to dig deep and go

141
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.920
Shawn Phalen: Why do. Why do you feel you deserve to be treated like

142
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.420
Shawn Phalen: This is going to take some self reflection.

143
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.970
Shawn Phalen: And it's going to take you get and kind of quiet.

144
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.610
This shit out.

145
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:40.770
Shawn Phalen: Because this is not a healthy situation. This isn't good for your sobriety. It's not good for your sanity.

146
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:49.560
Shawn Phalen: Getting clean is about changing your life making positive choices and

147
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.610
Changes.

148
00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:02.100
Shawn Phalen: being around people that lift you up and that are positive and treat you well.

149
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.960
Shawn Phalen: This behavior that

150
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.590
Danny Couser: She feeling is stuff that you've probably dealt with.

151
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.790
In the past,

152
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.630
Shawn Phalen: This is not okay.

153
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.780
Danny Couser: We dealt with in the past.

154
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:27.840
Shawn Phalen: I mean, does this feels familiar to you. Have you been in relationships where you've just been treated like this.

155
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:40.860
Danny Couser: Not early. I was with one girl like this, like right after high school. I mean, I'm 32 now and I mean like I was with her for like a year but I mean whatever like

156
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:50.460
Danny Couser: wasn't really that what they, I don't know, it's just like not even I wouldn't even classify it as like the same thing. I mean, I was young and dumb.

157
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.490
Danny Couser: But I don't know why.

158
00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:12.390
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so this brings me back to my point that I made before is that this is something that you're going through clean and sober. This is all new to you some of this stuff that's going to come your way is going to feel very uncomfortable, you're not going to know what to do.

159
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.850
Danny Couser: It's going to feel like

160
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:28.530
Shawn Phalen: You've never had to deal with this stuff before you have to realize that when you're in early sobriety. You take everything very slow.

161
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.160
Shawn Phalen: It isn't indicated to

162
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.890
Shawn Phalen: It's not, it's not recommended to even be in a relationship and early sobriety.

163
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.870
Danny Couser: For this very reason.

164
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.320
Shawn Phalen: Because you're getting to know yourself clean

165
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.280
And sober.

166
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.760
Shawn Phalen: You have to get to

167
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.170
Shawn Phalen: You have to learn how to live life without using

168
00:27:54.420 --> 00:28:00.360
Shawn Phalen: It's super hard to bring somebody into your life. That's not going to be drama and chaos.

169
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.030
Shawn Phalen: In early sobriety.

170
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:04.770
Danny Couser: Right.

171
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.450
Shawn Phalen: Because when you're using your life turns to chaos.

172
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.290
Shawn Phalen: It's drama.

173
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.040
Danny Couser: Drama.

174
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.400
Shawn Phalen: This is about you.

175
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.240
Shawn Phalen: Figuring out a life that you want.

176
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.410
This takes time.

177
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.820
Shawn Phalen: The best thing you can do for yourself.

178
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.140
Danny Couser: Is focus on

179
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:51.090
Danny Couser: Like, I think that like why like why I want like wanting to, like, you know, whatever. Go back to whatever the hell would even be like, like in as a dancer and think like

180
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:59.880
Danny Couser: Okay, like so. It's a, it's like, you know, we talked and cannibalism bullshit half ass temporary solution to not argue for who knows how long. Like it

181
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.600
Danny Couser: Yeah. Okay. And then what like you know

182
00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:17.550
Danny Couser: This is like, I don't know if this is killed over overall what I'm used to, like, just as far as just as of recently like since I've been clean obviously you've been with her and this is like honestly what with like

183
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:40.860
Danny Couser: Without her or it's like, I really don't have any friends is cut everybody off bc like to play was that were half ass like just dope fiend acquaintances, at best, you know, a. Other than that, all my real true friend is like I just lost contact with like because obvious reasons. Yeah.

184
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.740
Shawn Phalen: That's what I mean. This is like starting all over again.

185
00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.970
Danny Couser: It's about meeting.

186
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.430
Shawn Phalen: People that don't use this is new.

187
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.410
Shawn Phalen: A lot of this stuff is going to feel so new to you. How long were you using for

188
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.120
Danny Couser: Almost 10 years right

189
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.220
Shawn Phalen: So that's 10 years

190
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.810
Shawn Phalen: You're not going to get yourself back overnight.

191
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:16.020
Shawn Phalen: Okay, that's what I mean it's like it's step by step here.

192
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:28.710
Shawn Phalen: And meeting people that don't use and getting used to being around people that don't use learning how to be happy and have fun in sobriety.

193
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:32.910
Shawn Phalen: That takes time.

194
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:48.150
Shawn Phalen: And that's why I say the best thing you can do for yourself is focus on you when you're focusing on her. It's a distraction. It's another way of not having to look at yourself.

195
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.970
Danny Couser: She's such a strong reaction.

196
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.930
Shawn Phalen: So let's think of some things that you can do to focus on

197
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.630
Shawn Phalen: Yourself. Let's talk about that.

198
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.800
Shawn Phalen: Are you are you going into

199
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.920
Shawn Phalen: Any like a na meetings.

200
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:22.170
Now,

201
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.470
Danny Couser: With you guys

202
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.120
Shawn Phalen: Can you

203
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.580
Shawn Phalen: Would you be open to going to meetings.

204
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.370
Danny Couser: This point

205
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:39.240
Danny Couser: Yeah. Or there's nothing but good really comes from it. And I don't know, I've never

206
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:48.270
Danny Couser: To this are working. Like, I literally just go work and then come home shower eat dinner and then do it all over again, you know,

207
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:54.300
Danny Couser: Where you can again working for the city of Dublin. Oh, yeah. Okay.

208
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.150
Shawn Phalen: So,

209
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.130
Shawn Phalen: What about trying to find some meetings that you can go to

210
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:04.830
Danny Couser: Do

211
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.450
Danny Couser: What do you like to do. What did you like to do before.

212
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.160
Shawn Phalen: You got into drugs.

213
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.750
Danny Couser: Before I mean I

214
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:26.880
Danny Couser: BASEBALL. BASEBALL. We can play baseball for 17 years and ruining my told everything is my shoulder.

215
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.060
Danny Couser: You know, North

216
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.510
Danny Couser: Whatever.

217
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:41.400
Danny Couser: Kind of cope with that because I mean after baseball. It's like that girl telling you about it. I was with

218
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:48.240
Danny Couser: After high school. It's just like, yeah, she's cheating on the back to me and

219
00:32:50.130 --> 00:33:07.980
Danny Couser: That was like, I'm not even two weeks after I thought I had a good shoulder surgery and most likely wouldn't be able to teach anymore. And then after that, then I know you're not gonna play baseball no more. We can give you a scholarship is more either

220
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.220
Danny Couser: So it's like I just, I was just kind of like

221
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:24.090
Danny Couser: Three main things and family that defined me, you know, and I didn't know who the hell I was what I was like I just was just blowing in the wind like a grocery bag. You know, and

222
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.730
Danny Couser: And so it's, it's, uh, yeah, it's just like us.

223
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:45.660
Danny Couser: And but everybody really stood out. I always do some baseball like logic chain like some younger kids are like, you know, it's like, I don't really have know any of that at all anymore. I got this. I'm kind of over the whole baseball field.

224
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:55.410
Shawn Phalen: Okay. All right, well then let's let's start this like just step by step here, then you know

225
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.570
Shawn Phalen: A couple of outside meetings that you can go to

226
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.780
Shawn Phalen: All right. And, you know, like I said, Stay focused on you.

227
00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:12.960
Shawn Phalen: Whether that's working out whether that spending.

228
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.370
Danny Couser: No time doing something that you like to do

229
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.520
You have to think of stuff that will work for you.

230
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.920
Shawn Phalen: Church. I don't know if you're religious or spiritual

231
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.880
Danny Couser: Baptized

232
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:48.930
Danny Couser: I guess I mean it's like I bought and that's the thing. Like, I honestly like, I don't know if I I almost feel like I should take the kid back gun ADD medication. I was on as a kid.

233
00:34:51.180 --> 00:35:02.910
Danny Couser: I don't know, like, I mean, is that a common thing here because I got it on my mind is like all over the place and I can change finish a complete anything

234
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:19.500
Danny Couser: I just get so flustered. And I just wanted to stay like, fuck it. And then this is like. And like you said, like it's just, it's what I know, as far as like a distraction is like something and related to her, like, I don't know, like

235
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.760
Danny Couser: What

236
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.590
Shawn Phalen: You can do you have a primary primary care doctor

237
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:31.680
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you can ask them. I'm not sure what they're doing in terms of

238
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:37.380
Shawn Phalen: Prescribing um you know for for that because it's a stimulant.

239
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.580
Shawn Phalen: So you're gonna have to ask. I don't know what's there.

240
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.470
Danny Couser: I don't know.

241
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:57.330
Danny Couser: Well, just, I mean, just with your experience like a common day where a lot of people don't like the third. I guess I do have add like that those issues like kind of surface again or something, so to speak.

242
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:02.310
Shawn Phalen: I think you just have, you know, you have anxiety right now.

243
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:09.300
Danny Couser: Because you're dealing with a lot of stuff in your clean. I think this is very common. When you first get clean

244
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.390
Shawn Phalen: Okay. Good morning. How to just be and live life without using it.

245
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:21.930
Danny Couser: It takes time. You have to be really patient with yourself. And that's why I say to start focusing on yourself.

246
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:27.810
Shawn Phalen: And doing things that you like to do because she's making this is creating a lot of things IoT

247
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:36.960
Danny Couser: Because it's like, I mean like you right now. My heart is is like race like a rabbit. And if I go home, even like getting hot flashes like

248
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.990
Shawn Phalen: I wonder if it's from the Suboxone

249
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:51.870
Danny Couser: I've never had a problem before, though, like it's just been the last week or two weeks or whatever, however long

250
00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:58.350
Danny Couser: Okay.

251
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.620
Shawn Phalen: Tell, who do you tell them about what's going on with you.

252
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:14.370
Danny Couser: What you know I don't follow this anxiety. I don't know, I've never even thought of Big Daddy been an issue with me, like, ever, but I

253
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:21.210
Danny Couser: I mean, I don't know. It could have been. I just thought it was something else. We have not given myself too much credit but like i mean i'm not i'm

254
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:31.230
Danny Couser: Not a weenie when it comes to this dealing with stuff like a lot of people can believe how will I handled the whole you know going through the detoxing part of it. You know, like, and

255
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.480
Danny Couser: Like I just kind of

256
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.690
Danny Couser: Deal with the ship color. It's kind of

257
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.170

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:26.070
bonnie: So um yeah I'm seeking therapy for two reasons. One is I definitely always have issues to be working on. And number two, I'm actually an associate MF t. So I'm finishing my hours.

279
00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:46.410
bonnie: Okay, so I'm hoping to, you know, personal psychotherapy still counts for me. So that's another part. So, um, and I just wanted to double check your, your, your licensed MFA in California. Okay, great. That's the only prerequisite for me.

280
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.580
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so

281
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.990
bonnie: Um, yeah.

282
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:53.700
Shawn Phalen: It's just counting as therapy for school that you need.

283
00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:01.140
bonnie: Not for school just for my hours for the board, but also for personal reasons to

284
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:11.430
Shawn Phalen: You, so I need to check with bright heart that that's okay too for me to be doing because I would actually have to sign off on something for you.

285
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.230
To say that

286
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.030
bonnie: Okay.

287
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:17.760
bonnie: So,

288
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:23.250
Shawn Phalen: Um, so I I would need to clarify with Bray her

289
00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:29.430
Shawn Phalen: That I can do this because it's where were you going to school.

290
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:38.310
bonnie: I'm not going to school. I finished school. So I'm at the end of my hour. So actually, there's nothing to sign, but I don't know if that's still affects things for you or not.

291
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.240
bonnie: It's just all personal accounting

292
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.410
bonnie: At this point, since I am way postmasters,

293
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.430
Shawn Phalen: Okay. So, all right. Is this just for an individual therapy for you.

294
00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.960
bonnie: Yes. Okay. Yes, has nothing to do with what you need.

295
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.180
Shawn Phalen: To graduate, because you've already graduated

296
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.990
bonnie: Correct.

297
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.590
Shawn Phalen: In this has nothing to do with ours for the BBS right

298
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:15.990
bonnie: It does have to do with hours for the BBS so under I'm allowed to count hours of personal psychotherapy.

299
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:22.530
bonnie: toward my overall hours, but it's nothing. I have. It's just my own self reporting on it.

300
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:36.930
bonnie: I if in some odd case which I wouldn't falsify anything. So I don't see any reason, there would be an issue they. I don't know if the board ever audited in terms of asking for a letter of just

301
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:48.060
bonnie: I don't know, I've never encountered this so I don't think that's an issue, but there's nothing to sign off on it's all self reported hours of personal psychotherapy that count toward

302
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.900
bonnie: But if you're not comfortable or I totally understand.

303
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:59.880
bonnie: I can, I can definitely do something else that's fine too. So, I respect that. Let

304
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.270
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so what what brought you to break hurt so

305
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:11.100
bonnie: Anxiety. I definitely have my own issues that I deal with and also want to personal therapy for my own personal reasons.

306
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.220
bonnie: But definitely, I mean I can, I can kind of give you the background.

307
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:26.070
bonnie: Yeah, um, I had a I had family members or while my mom and my mother in law, who passed away from cancer within

308
00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:27.480
bonnie: Well, in

309
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:36.960
bonnie: And back in December. So I've always kind of tended toward sometimes having like you know anxiety about like

310
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:47.460
bonnie: Illness or body stuff or, you know, just, you know, health issues in general and in December. I had a

311
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:57.240
bonnie: I had to have a biopsy for a breast exam. It was my first one. And it was really, really difficult and

312
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:13.740
bonnie: It kind of started back up, anxiety, I kind of thought I had dealt with pretty well, but you know, I feel like overall like I i I've managed anxiety. Well, but it kind of re triggered a kind of a lot of stuff and so

313
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:18.270
bonnie: You know that's something I definitely wanted to work on.

314
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:27.180
bonnie: My relationship to with my husband, we have two little ones, and it's been stressful. I think having kids has been really

315
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:35.370
bonnie: Challenging just in terms of bringing up stuff from my childhood and how my parents related and

316
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:46.350
bonnie: You know, things I want to do differently. And yet, and also, you know, obviously, I have a lot of information in terms of what I should be doing, or things that the way that it should be working and

317
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:55.110
bonnie: I'm having kind of a hard time with that too. I really like I have a lot of guilt kind of come up around mothering and just like feeling like I'm not

318
00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:03.450
bonnie: doing a good enough job or like we're not communicating well or like, you know, so I definitely have a lot of stuff that's kind of coming up right now.

319
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.060
bonnie: So that's kind of the landscape of what brought me and at this particular time.

320
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:12.900
Shawn Phalen: How old are your kids.

321
00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:27.390
bonnie: I have one that's almost four and one that's almost two one is the one will be for in a while they'll both be foreign to and excuse me yeah foreign two in June. Okay. And my oldest son is on the spectrum.

322
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:33.210
bonnie: And he's currently nonverbal. And so that's kind of an added level of

323
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:42.840
bonnie: Definite stress. I mean, he's an awesome kid I've since I've kind of learned a lot. In fact, it's probably an area of specialty I'll kind of hopefully do in my work.

324
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:59.910
bonnie: I've kind of realized that my dad is on the spectrum which I never put together because I didn't know anything about it until my son was diagnosed and then it kind of illuminated a whole lot of issues. I had growing up and like issues with my dad and just kind of

325
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:04.980
bonnie: It just kind of clarified so many things for me on a personal level.

326
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:18.390
bonnie: And he's an awesome little guy. He's really has a wonderful personality and you know he's great. There's nothing, there's nothing too challenging about him other than, you know, it's hard not to worry.

327
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.400
bonnie: I find myself worrying a lot about his future in terms of especially

328
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:37.080
bonnie: Gaining language and it's a I think he also we're finding out he likely also has a proxy, which I don't know if you're familiar with. It's like a motor planning. It's pretty co occurring. I guess in kids with autism.

329
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:45.300
bonnie: But it just means that it's really hard for him and he's trying really hard in speech therapies and full time ABA therapy and

330
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:53.550
bonnie: You know it's but it's hard, like we manage it pretty well, but it's definitely a level of stress, especially

331
00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:03.780
bonnie: You know, I think when we first started out, you know, we were hopeful, he would just kind of attain language, you know, spontaneously and it doesn't look like it looks like it's going to be a very long haul.

332
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:14.430
bonnie: He's getting trained on maybe we're trying to move toward getting him trained on like an electronic device so that he can have software that he can use because it's going to be a gap between

333
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:25.830
bonnie: Hope I MEAN, HOPEFULLY NOT but they're likely will be a gap between what he can do verbally and what he'll be able to do, you know, communicate

334
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:36.030
bonnie: So, you know, I think when we started, I think getting closer to kindergarten has made us a little more definitely is amped up the anxiety in terms of

335
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:43.410
bonnie: You know what that's gonna look like and what kind of classroom. He can be in and just all kinds of things. It's a really

336
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:50.250
bonnie: It's add some extra challenges so that definitely adds thanks

337
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:53.220
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and

338
00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.440
bonnie: Also can put stress on the marriage yeah that's that's a definite stressor.

339
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.780
Shawn Phalen: So,

340
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:12.840
Shawn Phalen: What about, have you looked at schools for him in terms of what services can be provided.

341
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.080
bonnie: Yeah, I mean, you mean like kind of private schools.

342
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.060
Shawn Phalen: You know, I mean, even in the public schools they have

343
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.360
Shawn Phalen: They have services, you know, they

344
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:41.670
bonnie: Yeah yeah yeah we did. We did start an IEP. I mean, I think our challenges like the schools in our digital first. It's kind of complicated because our whole life. I don't know if you're familiar with the Bay Area at all.

345
00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:49.110
bonnie: But like where I work. And we're like, my son is in a program his full time maybe a program right near my work.

346
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:58.560
bonnie: But that's like 30 minutes from where we live. And so it's not in our district. So we're trying. I mean, my husband also he had another stressor.

347
00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:10.260
bonnie: He was, he was home with both of our kids. So he wasn't working. And so now he's trying to find work and so that adds to it to less for me. I mean,

348
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:24.810
bonnie: I don't know. I think it's harder for him. I think it's harder for men in general when they're not working then like I don't. It hasn't been I'm not really stressed about that, per se, but I mean, not that it's easy to be the sole earner but

349
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:32.310
bonnie: You know, but where where that will be important, is we're trying to hopefully move to a school district that is

350
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:44.460
bonnie: Both better and also closer to his ABA program. Because my understanding is based on kind of where he is he'll still be going to ABA after school for many years, probably even through high school.

351
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:55.140
bonnie: So is really important and we want to keep them. Overall, we're happy with the place that he's in. So overall, we would love him to have that consistency.

352
00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:07.020
bonnie: So and but then it gets into transportation, like, so we can't have him in a school in our district, which is so because we'd have to have someone stay home to basically take him from one place to the other.

353
00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:14.490
bonnie: You know school won't provide that because it's not within the same district. So we're trying. I'm going to probably next year. Try to do

354
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:24.840
bonnie: Transfers I'm going to try to apply for transfers to the other district, and if not, you know, hopefully in the next few years, maybe we'll try to move over there.

355
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.530
bonnie: So I'm really just now trying to gather all the resources, I can admit it's so hard to like I don't even know.

356
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:39.870
bonnie: Until we really are at the place of applying. I don't really even know what their programs look like what their I have a feeling, he's

357
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:48.210
bonnie: Probably, they're probably going to recommend special day classes for him. I don't think he'll be in a place. I'm guessing. I don't know. I hope

358
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.330
bonnie: I don't know if I hope I'm wrong. I don't know what's best for him but

359
00:49:52.260 --> 00:50:00.600
bonnie: I have a feeling. Maybe so. And I every district is so different and how they do some half purely artistic classrooms and other ones don't and other ones.

360
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:15.000
bonnie: There's just so many different ways of doing it. So, and I don't even know which one kind of I feel like makes the most sense. Um, so we yeah I'm still I'm still in the information gathering phase around that.

361
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.090
Shawn Phalen: Where, where are you working

362
00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.700
bonnie: I work actually for financial firm.

363
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:25.770
bonnie: And it's a small firm. I've worked for them for a long time.

364
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:33.780
bonnie: So everything I've been doing both that's been that's been stressful. So this year is my last year to get

365
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:45.390
bonnie: You probably you, I know you've probably been licensed a long time. So you probably don't you know know the ins and outs of what's going on right now, but they're changing all the criteria as of December 31 so

366
00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:53.460
bonnie: They're not counting. A lot of things that they used to currently personal psychotherapy couples was double counted up to a certain amount, things like that.

367
00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:59.280
bonnie: They're changing the way that they're the criteria which I started my practice them in 2014

368
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:12.870
bonnie: So I'm already up against it with the six year rule. And then on top of that, I would lose like three or 400 hours off the top, just because of the changes in in the way that they're counting things and it's been so hard, because I've been I started my graduate program.

369
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:27.720
bonnie: I graduated, that in 2016 and I've been doing my practical. I mean, my internships, where I can around that I worked at a community center for a while and then right now I'm in private practice or under someone in private practice.

370
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:42.210
bonnie: But it's been really stressful because I had two kids in between there and I took a year off when I was with my kids or, you know, like, and we're just working so it's been like six years of two jobs to practically full time.

371
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:53.460
bonnie: So it's been rough, it's definitely I'll be glad when my hours, it looks like. I'll meet them this year, but it'll be close. I mean, I'm up against it and

372
00:51:54.060 --> 00:52:08.070
bonnie: Part of me kind of regrets taking some of that time off when I have my kids, but at the same time I was exhausted. I was still breastfeeding. I was still working like there was only so much I could possibly do so well you can file.

373
00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:15.480
Shawn Phalen: An extension, can't you, I mean, even if, if you can get your hours and time guard. They still, they should be

374
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:26.010
bonnie: I've never heard of that. I think what will happen though for me is that it would. I would. I don't know. And I think I'm going to email the BBS just so I know everything like

375
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:36.210
bonnie: Based on the number of clients I have, I should me my hours by December so it shouldn't be a problem. But if for some reason, something comes up, you know, and for some reason.

376
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:52.440
bonnie: Who knows coronavirus there's something happens, you know, could it flip. You know, I think what I don't know is could I be grandfathered in like in terms of can I still go by these the old requirements.

377
00:52:53.190 --> 00:53:06.750
bonnie: It can I get an extension on that or I mean I can definitely still get my hours next year, but I'll fall under the new requirements as my understanding, like I won't be able to count some of the hours. I've been able to count up to this point so

378
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:19.770
bonnie: I'm hopeful. I will get to that place. I'm seeing like, you know, but it's always tough to because like one frustration. I'm having now it's just like this time it's been like this for years now. Just having this like time

379
00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.010
bonnie: Pressure the time clock in the back of my head and

380
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:33.030
bonnie: Like right now I have 12 clients a week I see 12 clients a week but you know people cancel every week it's not consistent. So I'm really averaging like 10. You know what I mean, which

381
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:44.550
bonnie: Is fine, but now I'm realizing, like, yeah, I have to definitely keep my load higher just to average out to what I am sure that I need. But luckily, so far it's been doable.

382
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:51.630
Shawn Phalen: And then also, it's kind of a good idea to go over the required hours.

383
00:53:52.050 --> 00:54:02.940
bonnie: I have heard that. And that's what I'm a little nervous about because like one thing I'm thinking is like I calculated. I'll just barely passed or hit the mark. Maybe like beginning of November.

384
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:12.060
bonnie: But then I was thinking, because I know it takes the board four to six weeks to even like review and count everything up. So if I'm already close to it. I might part of me is like,

385
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:22.410
bonnie: Well, if I think I can be over by maybe like 80 hours or so. By December mid December, like I should just submitted that I'm not gonna. What am I going to do if they tell me mid December.

386
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:29.910
bonnie: I have enough hours. I'll have two weeks. It's not gonna, you know, I'm not sure what that would really do for me.

387
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:38.640
bonnie: So I have heard that that you want over just in case. For some reason you're not counting right or they don't honor some or who knows what.

388
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:55.020
bonnie: And in that situation. I don't know if they would grant new an extension if you like in good faith thought you had the hours like if they would honor the old requirements. I don't know. So I may just ask them, you know, email them and

389
00:54:56.190 --> 00:55:00.630
Yeah, I mean, they have to work with you. You know, like

390
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:09.630
Shawn Phalen: You know something's telling me that you're not going to be affected by the new requirements.

391
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:23.820
bonnie: I would hope so. I don't know. They it's it's it seems like everything I read or heard says if you don't submit your application for your hours by December 31 of this year, you'll have to do it under the new requirements.

392
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:40.110
bonnie: So i don't know i but i don't know you know i don't know if i don't know how. Yeah, I don't know it behind you know if case by case there's more flexibility than they want to announce or, you know, or I don't know. So who's

393
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:45.270
Shawn Phalen: Who's signing off on your hours is somebody in the private practice.

394
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:45.780
Yes.

395
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.160
bonnie: And so are they familiar with any of this stuff because if

396
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.540
Shawn Phalen: They're a clinical supervisor, they should be really on top of all that,

397
00:55:54.810 --> 00:56:01.380
bonnie: Yeah, I mean I think she's I mean she's definitely very familiar with, I don't think she knows about this.

398
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:14.880
bonnie: Kind of crossover period. I'm you know I you know I don't know how much we've talked about it. I mean, she's definitely very familiar with how hours are counted and everything around that but I'm not sure how familiar, she is with like the

399
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:18.930
bonnie: Like this change to the new way. Because really, I mean,

400
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:29.100
bonnie: I guess from her perspective. I mean, the hours are there still counting the same things, the things that they're not counting don't really affect her you know like what they're not counting is personal psychotherapy.

401
00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:41.730
bonnie: And they're just they moved the categories around so everything still counts like notes and supervision and you know client advocacy and I can go go on and on. All those categories still count.

402
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:50.430
bonnie: But like things like couples aren't double counted to a certain point and I had done a lot of couples work in my old situation.

403
00:56:52.080 --> 00:57:00.870
bonnie: And then so, but a lot of things are counting, they're just kind of shuffling around like the minimums and maximums and certain categories and things like that.

404
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:16.290
bonnie: So, um, I think she's very knowledgeable on the categories, but I'm just not sure if she's very knowledgeable on like what changes are going to happen at the end of the year. And do you still need 3000 hours. Yes. Oh, I mean,

405
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:26.370
bonnie: Not, I mean, do you mean, where am I at or total, total right. Yes, correct. Mm hmm. Yes.

406
00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:38.670
bonnie: And I think what they're changing about that. Oh, I guess because they're not counting. Some of these double counting and things like that is they're not changing their changing like the there's a minimum now for like direct face to face.

407
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:48.840
bonnie: I guess because they're taking out some of the double counting on like couples, maybe I know there's, I think they have the minimum of like your face to face hours with clients, I think.

408
00:57:49.170 --> 00:58:00.930
bonnie: Like, right now it's 1500 but I think I have a feeling that's changed, but I'm not really sure on that. It's still 3000 hours, though, total, you know, that will be the same. Okay.

409
00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:03.090
bonnie: That's been stressful.

410
00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:14.250
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so, so then are you going to start to like, Are you planning on still staying. You said you're working for a finance company.

411
00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:22.080
bonnie: Yeah, yeah. For now, um, I mean a key part of that is my insurance, health insurance because it pays for my son's program.

412
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:29.190
bonnie: And just financially until my husband has work. We can't really, we can't really do anything.

413
00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:45.720
bonnie: You know, but my goal would be, I mean, I think I will take time like once hopefully the board accepts my hours. I will take some time, because then I still have to study for the exam. So I probably will start seeing clients, just so I have extra time to focus on the exam.

414
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:53.310
bonnie: And then, you know, I'm thinking. I mean, what I'm thinking of doing is because I do want to work in private practice.

415
00:58:54.240 --> 00:59:10.200
bonnie: So I would maybe consider just trying to slowly build something up maybe on Saturdays and not at least I won't have the pressure to like K too many clients or just more to kind of get my feet wet with, you know, the business aspects of it and just, I know I can take time to get

416
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:18.210
bonnie: You know, I know it's a process, and I'm not even sure where I would set up the off. You know, I might work in a different area.

417
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:22.050
bonnie: Closer to, you know, home.

418
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:34.290
bonnie: So I don't know. I think I may just kind of start from there. And if you know if my husband gets a job than the insurance is a key part of it. I mean, health insurance is a big one.

419
00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:46.140
bonnie: So right now I have really good benefits in that sense. So it really covers a lot for my son, especially because I can't even imagine how much ABA would cost without insurance.

420
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.690
Shawn Phalen: Are you in the city.

421
00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:58.560
bonnie: No, I live in Hercules. It's a very small town like north of Berkeley by, like, I don't know 15 miles. I'm not good with Miles 10 Miles maybe

422
00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:06.810
bonnie: And then I work in Lafayette is the name of the town. It's near Walnut Creek Walnut Creek is where his a VA program is and

423
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:18.750
bonnie: Okay, so that's where we're trying to kind of move out toward that area, but it's definitely more expensive, so I can't, you know, I couldn't do it, just on my salary, so that's why there's kind of a lot of moving pieces that

424
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:28.620
bonnie: Have to do with my husband getting employment for us to be able to make some changes. So yeah, it's tough. There's a lot of moving parts.

425
01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:32.820
Shawn Phalen: Is he okay. Is your husband looking for work now.

426
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:34.980
bonnie: Yes. Okay.

427
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.290
Okay, so

428
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:45.660
Let me just, let me just double check.

429
01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.690
Shawn Phalen: But right hurt.

430
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.890
bonnie: Yeah, sure.

431
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:58.710
bonnie: Go ahead. Oh yeah cuz what I was gonna say is, because I've seen on the application where I have to put it. So basically I just have to

432
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:11.220
bonnie: You know, tell them the numbers of number of hours. I've had in personal psychotherapy and I've already done. I actually don't have an many more hours before I hit my max anyway because I did a lot of therapy.

433
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:14.670
bonnie: In 2015 16

434
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:24.690
bonnie: I had been in therapy, a long time before that. So I have been continuing therapy. So most of my hours will come from that period, but

435
01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:36.630
bonnie: So basically, there's nothing to sign but you know I I totally understand. And I know you know i don't know what happens if I was ever audited if they would ask for, like,

436
01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:41.490
bonnie: A confirmation of the number of sessions I have between X date and X date.

437
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.770
bonnie: Or just like some sort of verification that I was in therapy. I don't, I don't know if they even do that. I don't know. Confidentiality wise if they do that or what I, that would be

438
01:01:53.430 --> 01:02:03.450
bonnie: Yeah, I wouldn't lie about it. So it's not a concern to me, but I can understand if you're if it's an agency you know if there's certain restrictions. I totally respect that.

439
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.480
bonnie: It would just be good to know.

440
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.340
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I know.

441
01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.270
Shawn Phalen: Let me just

442
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:17.250
Shawn Phalen: Like I said, let me just check. I mean, I never problems it, but I need to check with them just because I have to.

443
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.500
bonnie: Of course, totally. I totally understand. No, I totally understand.

444
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.990
Shawn Phalen: So why don't we do this, why don't we

445
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:39.750
bonnie: Like how how often really wanting to meet. I mean, I was hoping for an hour a week. But I realized, you know, I know you do. I don't know if you see someone before this spot if that would be possible or

446
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.410
bonnie: If not, it's okay to

447
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.410
Shawn Phalen: Are you doing groups.

448
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:55.440
bonnie: I'm not, I did look into it. I kind of talked to a bunch of I tried to ask about a bunch of groups that I found on Psychology Today, but

449
01:02:55.890 --> 01:03:10.530
bonnie: They were none of them were taking it seemed like they didn't have enough people to actually make a group so they weren't running any like any of the groups that were out there, there weren't current or taking people so I wasn't able to find a group. I looked into that as well.

450
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.580
bonnie: Oh, you mean groups through bright heart or groups in general.

451
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:16.470
Shawn Phalen: Right hurt.

452
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:23.010
bonnie: No, I was interested in that as well because he originally I started with Rebecca Evans.

453
01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:31.170
bonnie: But I didn't realize she wasn't an empty because like I told them specifically I wanted an MSP but I know they don't totally understand all this stuff. And I don't think

454
01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:42.960
bonnie: So they said she's a therapist. So I assume she was an empty. And then I realized she wasn't so I that's why I wanted to switch and they mentioned you're an empty. So then I said, Okay.

455
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:53.250
bonnie: But what was I gonna say about that. Oh, so I had last talked to her about groups and she said she seemed to indicate because I was, she was trying to figure out what kind of group, I would

456
01:03:53.580 --> 01:04:07.440
bonnie: You know she didn't think there were any groups just kind of like for anxiety, she was saying a lot of them were like substance abuse related. So she did couldn't think of a good fit, really, that was going on, but I was I'm open to that as well. I mean,

457
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:10.080
Okay.

458
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:13.860
Shawn Phalen: All right, what about, can you can you meet

459
01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:19.650
March 9 at eight o'clock.

460
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:30.090
bonnie: Oh. Um, yeah, let me see. March when is where are we in March. Oh, OK. That's a Monday. Let me think. So it's eight o'clock.

461
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.700
bonnie: Wednesday. Okay.

462
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:43.230
Shawn Phalen: Um, let's see, it's Wednesday for better. I can do, I have a seven o'clock on March 11

463
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:44.310
Mm hmm.

464
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:50.910
bonnie: Well, let's definitely say that. Do you happen to have a 630 before that. Okay.

465
01:04:51.930 --> 01:05:05.460
bonnie: Because the only thing I actually see clients on Monday nights, but my last client dropped out wars is shifting out. Well, I don't know if they're gonna win. That's going to happen. So it's going to say, I could bring my computer. My office is obviously

466
01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:16.800
bonnie: soundproof and all that good stuff. So I could bring my computer and do a session at eight o'clock, eight that is actually my last spot was eight o'clock, and I do have someone transitioning out of that spot.

467
01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:24.930
bonnie: But I just don't know when that will be and I think I haven't confirmed on the ninth, but it might be possible.

468
01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.750
Shawn Phalen: Can you do Wednesday at 630

469
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.900
bonnie: I can. Mm hmm. Let's do that.

470
01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:38.970
bonnie: Yeah, that would be great. Do for two sessions or or just

471
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.130
bonnie: Yeah, like so, an hour.

472
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:45.810
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, an hour. Yeah.

473
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:51.030
bonnie: That would be perfect, actually for me that that time spot is so perfect for me. You have no idea.

474
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.170
bonnie: Because I'm back from work. And that's a really good time for me.

475
01:05:55.590 --> 01:06:10.200
Shawn Phalen: Okay, perfect. Okay. All right. So then, hopefully, I'll have an answer. I never from them just, you know, just run it by them and then we'll just plan on the 11th at eight o'clock.

476
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.750
bonnie: Okay. Oh, you mean 630

477
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.700
Shawn Phalen: Sorry.

478
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:17.460
bonnie: Oh, that's okay. I just want to make sure, no worries.

479
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.920
bonnie: That sounds totally great.

480
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:25.800
bonnie: No worries. And then, yeah, if you do find out something in between.

481
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:42.150
bonnie: That it's not going to work. Or, you know, if you could let me know. That'd be so awesome, or just have someone, let me know, because then I'll try to find something else. And that would be, but I would love to see you. That would be great. Okay, sounds great. Okay. Okay. All right.

482
01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:44.040
Shawn Phalen: All right. Well, I'm glad we got to meet and
