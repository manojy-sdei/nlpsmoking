00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:48.000
Tommy’s iPhone: No, I had constipation problems when I was on pain pills does a little bit. But yeah, not, not much to wear it bothers me.

108
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.720
Okay.

109
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So any problems with skin psoriasis, eczema, anything like that.

110
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.340
Tommy’s iPhone: Right. Yeah. Little bit dangerous in my beard.

111
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.840
Tommy’s iPhone: I watched it with head and shoulders and then care of it. Yeah, that's what I would recommend to that should help.

112
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.980
Um,

113
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.170
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Have you ever been. Did you ever overdose and have to get an AR can

114
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:21.960
Tommy’s iPhone: A long time ago I did overdose online Narcos and so miss that I was getting prescribed when I was like 2021

115
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.560
Tommy’s iPhone: They, they did pop my stomach with that charcoal stuff.

116
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.890
Tommy’s iPhone: I don't know. I don't know what marketing is

117
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.820
Tommy’s iPhone: OK, but they did put my stomach and all that.

118
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.670
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. Do you have sonar camp or excuse me Narcan is

119
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:54.390
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's a, it's a nose spray that when somebody overdoses and in Ohio. You can just walk into any pharmacy and get them in because the drug problem is so bad in Ohio. So say, for instance, you were

120
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.270
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know Adam McDonald's and you saw somebody

121
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.950
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Down, you know,

122
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:12.060
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That was a drug addict, you know, they've got a needle sticking out of their arm you saw somebody down in the parking lot. You could take the Narc can and just score to enter knows just like you would like afren or any other type of those 40

123
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:25.440
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And what it does is it blocks the way the opioids are binding into yourself so you know when you take a opioid like Norco it goes into yourselves and gives you that

124
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.780
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Feeling that you like so what Narcan does

125
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.570
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Is it pulls makes it breaks that bond.

126
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.540
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So it's a way to save

127
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:48.090
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's a way to save a life. So there is a little nor can in Suboxone but it's just a teeny tiny dose. It's not the overdose reversal dose. It's a teeny tiny does. It's what cuts the high from the northeast.

128
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.720
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That's what this. Okay, so, um,

129
00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:00.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I would recommend and you don't have to obviously do this today because of everything going on. I would recommend that you

130
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Do get

131
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Narc can to keep in your house, just in case you know i don't know you're in an area, you might save somebody's life one day I know things happen.

132
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.840
Jill Beavers-Kirby: People accidentally overdose. So like I said you can walk into any

133
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.340
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Pharmacy in Ohio and

134
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.230
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You don't need a prescription, you can just go to the pharmacist and say, I would like seminar can and they will give you one.

135
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.330

Jill Beavers-Kirby: A therapist in there. Her name is Serena and then other people in Ohio.

148
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:34.230
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Who are also in your situation and Serena that therapist kind of oversees everything and everybody talking. But as I'm sure you can imagine.

149
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.910
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The conversation. The past few weeks has been on how are we surviving isolation and staying at home and

150
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:53.940
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, how are we managing that. So, um, so, yeah, you'll come into a room, just like this, you'll see me Serena and the other people in the room, we just add you're in a private place that you know

151
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.350
Tommy’s iPhone: People around you can't hear.

152
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.310
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What the other people are saying and the group, you know, we don't want everybody

153
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.010
Tommy’s iPhone: Or anybody to hear that conversation that's no problem.

154
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.270
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So that's the way we do group. You can obviously do

155
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.100
