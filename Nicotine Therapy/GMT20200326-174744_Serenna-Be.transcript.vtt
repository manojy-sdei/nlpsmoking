Serenna Beers: So what are you thinking as far as like, well, let me let me, let me just ask you and and maybe you already know this.

91
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:09.090
Serenna Beers: Doctor, but what about what brought you to bright to bright heart health, what brought you to to us and why and why now.

Okay. Mm hmm.

95
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:40.140
Serenna Beers: How long have you been addicted to substances like where did it. Where did it start when about what age were

96
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.980
Serenna Beers: Our first first exposed to it.

97
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:52.560
Galaxy A20: I was exposed to. I was 18 years old. I'm 49 years old. I've been doing this for

98
00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:02.610
Galaxy A20: Over 30 years. Okay. Yes. So that's probably why it's taken a little longer for me to get where

99
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.790
Galaxy A20: You know, that's the only thing I could see. Yeah.

100
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:22.650
Serenna Beers: Can you share with me what you use maybe mostly and then at what point in your life. I mean, I know you said that you have a about a 30 year time span, but

101
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:31.800
Serenna Beers: When do you think it. It was the absolute worst. Is it just recently, or maybe, was it a few years ago that you said wow I I really need help.

102
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.890
Galaxy A20: Well, well, I need to help before this was some years ago.

103
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.150
Galaxy A20: Can I get

104
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.430
Galaxy A20: Dad gave me some methadone.

105
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:54.180
Galaxy A20: But when I get to this place or L here, they wouldn't even let them transform up my program over here. So that made me get back on the drug.

106
00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:14.520
Galaxy A20: I wasn't doing drugs and I was doing good out there, right, you know, and soon as I got here because my husband had to come out here because he was locked up in and his parole out here. So, you know, but he, my husband. I got to know

107
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.300
Galaxy A20: Know how to do. Yeah.

108
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.880
Serenna Beers: Do you have any chronic pain that you deal with

109
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.980
Galaxy A20: The only thing I got a weak stomach. That's all that is

110
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:44.190
Serenna Beers: Okay. Yes. And do you think, I mean, would you, if you had to guess for yourself, would you contribute that to the years that you've used substances and it's kind of just made maybe tore your stomach up

111
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:51.030
Serenna Beers: Or is it something that's generated when you were little, or maybe in your 20s or what do you think

112
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.120
Galaxy A20: So, no, I'm not the show.

113
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:00.840
Galaxy A20: Not

114
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:11.760
Serenna Beers: Okay, that's all right and and you know these questions I'm honestly going to try to keep it as light as I can because world is so heavy as it is.

115
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.870
Serenna Beers: Maybe I'll throw a face in every question or so to make you smile.

116
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:28.770
Serenna Beers: But these are just stuff that we need to to know because honestly, I mean, without knowing a little bit about you, it's difficult for me and for the doc to say how is it that we're going to best

117
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:42.570
Serenna Beers: Help you. And because it's a team effort. You know, it's just, it's really great to hear from you what your perspective is on how you think that you came to be at this point in your life where

118
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:52.770
Serenna Beers: Basically addiction, has one all of these years and now you want to take your life back and and and that's what what we want to help you do. Okay.

119
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.670
Galaxy A20: And that's the you're working with.

120
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.770
Galaxy A20: And I'm so I'm, I'm proud of it. Yeah. Yeah. Good.

121
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:21.390

Galaxy A20: So we can do this together. No.

242
00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:02.190
Serenna Beers: I just want to go back a little ways because what I really liked is when you talked about your kids and everything when you were

243
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:19.470
Serenna Beers: Sharing about how this has been really hard for you. It sounded to me like this time versus other times you really want to do this for you. And it has to be that that way for him to. I mean, you know, you have to want to do it for yourself.

244
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.760
Serenna Beers: In order

245
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:33.510
Serenna Beers: To sustain it. Because to want to do it for someone else. You know it's you always end up going back because it really needs to be you ultimately that makes that choice.

246
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.730
Galaxy A20: Right.

247
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:40.740

248
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:42.120
Galaxy A20: Right.

249
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:48.810
Serenna Beers: There's a piece of that that I like to share with folks that I added that I think makes sense. You can make a thirsty though.

250
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:56.550
Serenna Beers: So you can make him thirsty by him to seeing what you're doing and that you are getting joy out of this and you are making something

251
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:08.040
Serenna Beers: Better than it was. And maybe he'll see that light and he'll want it. You know what I mean, lead by example. So maybe you just do you and he'll come alongside because he's saying, wow.

252
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.400
Serenna Beers: Some reason. She sure is smiling a lot

326
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.540
Serenna Beers: Are you there. Okay.

327
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.190
Serenna Beers: Yes. Ah.

328
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.490
Serenna Beers: I just want to give her a hug. God

329
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.900
Serenna Beers: It was hard to hold back tears.

330
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.330
Serenna Beers: I'm a big baby.

331
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.030
Steve Holtsford: He looks so much better though.

332
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.720
Steve Holtsford: Oh,

333
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.260
Serenna Beers: My gosh. It's heartbreaking her story. Oh my.

334
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.820
Serenna Beers: Gosh, I mean know

335
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.580
Serenna Beers: These are the kinds. I know you're not supposed to like, I know you can't wish them to do well. But of course, I mean,

336
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.970
Serenna Beers: As a therapist, and I would imagine as a doctor. I mean, that's, you're in this field, because you want to help.

337
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:33.810
Serenna Beers: Right.

338
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:42.120
Serenna Beers: So when you see somebody just really struggling and then you see them look different. And you see that there's hope. Oh my gosh, that's like a light, you know,

339
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:43.740
Steve Holtsford: Absolutely.

340
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:58.290
Steve Holtsford: Now, so I'm I'm hopeful, you know, she she's been on method on a few times but i and i think i think she's always done okay on it. But, you know, there's just so much instability that that she just

341
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:06.720
Steve Holtsford: You know, go into the clinic every day. It's just tough. It's tough for those methadone people when they're unstable. Yeah, so I

342
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:23.250
Steve Holtsford: I think this is going to be perfect. And if we can, if we can get her where she actually has her phone and responds to us and engages with us, I think, I think she'll we can turn things around and and hopefully get her husband on board to

343
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:38.700
Serenna Beers: That would be. Yeah, definitely. And I will make sure that I put a star by her name, and that you know I'm checking on her and the first time that she doesn't show I know to make an attempt myself to call

344
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:43.560
Serenna Beers: I have my cell phone number, but I can always block it.

345
00:31:44.640 --> 00:32:04.560
Serenna Beers: But yeah, because she's so vulnerable right right now. And she's at that place where she's, she's really wants to do well. So we keep her on that side of it, versus wanting to to not do well. So yeah. Awesome. Well, thank you for meeting me on here and it's nice to put a name with a face.

346
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:09.720
Steve Holtsford: Yeah. Likewise, I'm looking forward to this, this, I think this is going to be a nice little

347
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:16.230
Steve Holtsford: You know, I'm a full time ER doc and do and do addiction on the side and and

348
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:24.840
Steve Holtsford: So this is going to be, I foresee this being great in terms of my schedule, you know, flexibility and so forth. I'm

349
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.470
Serenna Beers: Great.

350
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:39.990
Steve Holtsford: And then I think it's going to be key. I'm in the West suburbs of Chicago. But, you know, we've got areas throughout the state that really have no you know the color Matt deserts. There's, there are no buprenorphine providers and

351
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.430
Serenna Beers: Oh, wow.

352
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.030
Steve Holtsford: So we need to get to Southern Illinois Central Illinois.

353
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.170
Serenna Beers: I mean, it's

354
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.450
Serenna Beers: It can be a matter of life and death.

355
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:57.000
Serenna Beers: You know and I probably six, seven years ago, I was one of those clinicians that was like, well, if they're on medication, then they're not sober and it took

356
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.850
Serenna Beers: Me. It took me a few lessons and

357
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.250
Serenna Beers: But, but I finally about five years ago I came around

358
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:09.420
Serenna Beers: Like, and I understand it more. Now once I became educated

359
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.000
Steve Holtsford: And all that stuff so awesome.

360
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:13.470
Steve Holtsford: Exactly Harvard

361
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.210

Serenna Beers: saves lives. So, yes.

363
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.940
Steve Holtsford: Abstinence is very difficult.

364
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:26.490
Serenna Beers: Yes. All right. We have a wonderful day a healthy. Alright.

365
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.180
