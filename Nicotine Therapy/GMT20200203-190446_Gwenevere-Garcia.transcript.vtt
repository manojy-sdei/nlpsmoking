Jessica G: And I was like, okay, but then he went to sleep and didn't plug it

8
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

9
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.100
Jessica G: We were just so cold.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.240
Jessica G: And I was out I was knocked out.

11
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, it's interesting you say that, are you taking a medicine is knocking you out.

12
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.410
Jessica G: Yeah, I'm taking half of the

13
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.950
Jessica G: Half of the

14
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.560
Jessica G: Quantity. Yeah.

15
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So now you're not waking up as groggy

16
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.640
Jessica G: I hope no

17
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.540
Jessica G: No, not really. I wake up.

18
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.220
Jessica G: Okay, I get up.

19
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Your you're on a phone. So you're one of my clients, where I use the two sort of water bottles. Is that right,

20
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.470
Jessica G: Yeah. Oh, so I had an idea about that.

21
00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:01.500
Jessica G: Um, I can probably on my TV upstairs. We have an Xbox connected to it. And so, um, I can go on YouTube.

22
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.650
Jessica G: And then. Oh, but you have to watch my eyes time

23
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so do you have like Apple TV, where you can share the

24
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Screen with um

25
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me. Here's what I'm asking. Do you

26
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you put the video up on the Xbox where you're watching me up there.

27
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

28
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Then no okay let's keep talking. I got it.

29
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in it, you're trying to solve the problem. And I get it.

30
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.040
Okay.

31
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm kind of crunching because I had like two more bites left and

32
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.640
Jessica G: I figured, well, it's OK. OK.

33
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.270
So now.

34
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

35
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's fine. You could do that.

36
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be

37
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: There's still a little bit of adjustment that would be needed. How about we do this, why don't you set up that on another day, whereas today. We won't take because we already getting a late start

38
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We won't take up all that time doing that, but you can practice it in the future, like, Okay, I'm gonna and I can show you what the

39
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What the YouTube is the those blue lights I can show them to you. And you can already have it and you can throw it up there on YouTube, you can watch it.

40
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The only differences is, I would say, okay,

41
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica, it has to be at this speed.

42
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Because sometimes I'm wanting it to be slower and other times I wanted to be faster. So it will be a little bit of direction there.

43
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.120
Jessica G: Okay.

44
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's also, if it's a big screen like this, you know, like, like a TV. If it's 55 inches if you're right here next to it. If you're making your eyes work too hard. You'd have to be

45
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Back, you know, I mean you have to be back on the bed or something kind of far back.

46
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's even though you know it seems like, Oh, that'll be really easy. See how there's still steps that might get in the way. Whereas when I'm in control of the tempo, the speed right in here when I kind of decide that

47
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It could move a little faster. So, but I don't I don't dislike your idea. I think it's a good one.

48
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just hear a little bit about what did you notice about you.

49
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you had sent me a text earlier.

50
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And really remember thinking, boy, this is a pretty pretty positive checks.

51
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how this week has been for you.

52
00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:00.810
Jessica G: Um, it's been it's been pretty good. I'm sober enough. I feel like I feel like I'm still breathing out. I feel

53
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.730
Jessica G: Weird like the lower the dose gets the clear my mind is getting it's not

54
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.200
Jessica G: I'm not gonna say it any easier. I just know

55
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.880
Jessica G: I figured out how to work with it, you know.

56
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So on one hand, you're saying it's not easier and you're learning how to work with it and what let's take these pieces apart. We have my head is starting to clear up

57
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So my dad. Are you saying that you're feeling sharper like you can find words easier. You're pulling up memories and thoughts and answers faster.

58
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.780
Jessica G: Yeah, I feel like

59
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.370
Jessica G: Okay.

60
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you mean by clear up

61
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.800
Jessica G: Yeah, okay.

62
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then you said also

63
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's still hard like tell me what what that's about. I mean,

64
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.160
Jessica G: I'm like, as far as the withdrawal symptoms are going

65
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.580
Jessica G: They're very mild very, very mild but

66
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.980
Jessica G: I start freaking out. I started like

67
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.580
Jessica G: Getting I'm

68
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.390
Jessica G: Kinda like panic attacks and stuff and

69
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.940
Jessica G: So,

70
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.340
Jessica G: I don't start filling the withdrawal symptoms until

71
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:43.620
Jessica G: Later on, like a once it's bedtime. Once I've already cleaned and cooked and once everything's done

72
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:55.290
Jessica G: Then that's when or like while I'm still like cleaning up after dinner, that's when I start filling the withdrawal symptoms. So that's when I go upstairs.

73
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.330
Jessica G: I take half of the Clonidine, and then I

74
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Down the stairs baby's coming down the stairs.

75
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.510
Jessica G: Oh my gosh.

76
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.450
Jessica G: Okay, sorry about that. You scared.

77
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, well, I figured I'd tell you in case he

78
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Fell or something, you know,

79
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.550
Jessica G: Yeah yeah

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.530
Jessica G: Yeah.

Jessica G: Okay. Luckily, it hasn't happened yet. Netflix.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what's your what I'm hearing you say is when the day starts to wane.

83
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No, let's get, let's get into it. Let's get precise you're feeling what

84
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you feeling about, what, eight o'clock at night. What are you feeling

85
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.260
Tired.

86
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.460
Jessica G: I'm starting to feel tired. I'm starting to feel. Um, but I sorry

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:49.710
Jessica G: I'm like my body gets tired, everything starts to I'm having so much pain.

89
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.650
Jessica G: I feel like I'm

90
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.720
Jessica G: Maybe I'm carrying around too much weight or something.

91
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's where's the pain.

92
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.150
Jessica G: Like in my joy.

93
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.870
Jessica G: And my joints in my

94
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.170
Jessica G: In my like my muscle my back.

95
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And is this familiar pain or is this feel new

96
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.310
Jessica G: Know it's it's familiar pain.

97
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.910
Jessica G: How old is familiar pain.

98
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.070
Jessica G: Well, after I stopped you being

99
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.410
Jessica G: Like, about a year after um

100
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.400
Jessica G: That's when the pain started

101
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:16.110
Jessica G: Yeah. After that, from the pink started on my muscles and stuff my joints started hurting and

102
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.490
Jessica G: I figured it was because of all the drugs. I had done, you know, they took a toll on my body.

103
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you come back to the screen. I want to show you

104
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: This concept of hyper

105
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Cheese. Yeah.

106
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a word you're familiar with.

107
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.440
Jessica G: No. Okay.

108
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you come back all I'll show it to you.

109
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk a little bit about this opioid induced hyper LG is. Yeah.

110
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's an enhanced pain response, which means let's say you have an injury and or you had an extended period of opioid use

111
00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Person becomes more sensitive to the pain as a result of taking medication, it's called opioid induced hyper Oh geez. Yeah.

112
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Due to the increase in opioid usage. Oh, he is becoming more of a concern. So something that typically would cause pain will often feel painful.

113
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To someone with hyper Oh geez. Yeah, it's something. So in other words, some small thing that let's say would happen to me. I might be mildly disrupted by it, but you're going to feel it, you know, 10 times more 20 times more you're going to be more acutely

114
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting a signal. It doesn't mean there is actually an injury. It's just that the signaling is happening.

115
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a hyper hyper sensitivity. Okay, these are things they're generally painful. These will feel significantly more painful for you with this condition.

116
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's and then come down here. I'll show you down here, talks about the key symptom of it is feeling increased sensitivity to pain without a new injury.

117
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it's a worsening of another condition. So,

118
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep reading. All right, so these are the main symptoms and increasing the intensity of pain that you feel over time.

119
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: A spread of the pain to another location, other than the initial site. So it might have maybe you had an injury, years ago and it was in me.

120
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you're having this increased pain in a lot of different places. And it also has an increased pain sensitivity to every stimuli. So everything just becomes more and more painful.

121
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

122
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're muted. So I can't hear you. Whether your, your

123
00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.360
Jessica G: What's your yeah sorry cartoons and everything. I didn't

124
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: After this you can hit upstairs and turn it off. But let's just get through this part as you're listening to this, what wasn't making you think about

125
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:20.190
Jessica G: I don't know. I guess I have questions like, if it's like, so what does that mean, does that mean that it's something I'm imagining or

126
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you're not imagining it.

127
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.370
Jessica G: Okay.

128
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not in your head. It just means that

129
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see. So it says I'm nosy of sectors are a type of receptor on your nerves that respond to pain signals hyper cheesy occurs when these receptors become more sensitive

130
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body releases many compounds when part of your tissue is damage. Some of these compounds can enhance the responsiveness of the gnosis sectors. This leads to the development of hyper Jesus

131
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people experience hybrid geezer following a surgical procedure. This is due to trauma to tissue or nerves present in the surgical site.

132
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see. I'm assuming your concern is will it last forever. And, you know, assuming that's part of what you want to know about.

133
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.130
Jessica G: I guess. Yeah, or no cuz I

134
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.760
Jessica G: I kind of feel. I feel like this is something that's gonna

135
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.190
Jessica G: Always be there.

136
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.500
Jessica G: Unless I lose weight.

137
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So why is that you think that has to do with weight. Tell me about that.

138
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.360
Jessica G: Because I'm overweight.

139
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.920
Jessica G: I feel like I'm

140
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:56.010
Jessica G: And I feel like I'm carrying I just say I'm like self diagnosing but I feel like I'm paying too much weight going up and down the stairs and then going up and down the stairs with my baby and just there's too much weight on my lane.

141
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:57.870
And

142
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what normal weight is for you how this feels different. Tell me about that.

143
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.310
Jessica G: Well, um, according to my

144
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.430
Jessica G: I think the last time I checked it. Somebody, somebody

145
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.470
Jessica G: I don't remember what my BMI is Uh huh.

146
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:32.250
Jessica G: But I'm somebody like that's my height and he is like supposed to be like between

147
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.600
Jessica G: 120 and

148
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:43.740
Jessica G: Like 130 or something like that. I remember I know the I know the the

149
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.610
Jessica G: The number was like, way lower than what I am now.

150
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and did this start um says

151
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: A year after I stopped using did you start eating more and moving less

152
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened.

153
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.490
Jessica G: Um,

154
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.180
Jessica G: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I thought I left her outside

155
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.820
Jessica G: I was like, what, um,

156
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.600
Jessica G: So what happened.

157
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.170
Jessica G: I know I started eating more and then

158
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:28.110
Jessica G: I had like a, I think it's just been like a lot of things I had a freak accident with the epidural.

159
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:39.810
Jessica G: Um, during labor I gained almost went up to 200 pounds. During my pregnancy. Okay.

160
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.140
Jessica G: Just a combination of things now.

161
00:18:49.200 --> 00:19:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you something this weight gain, it did it seem like it made no sense because you hadn't started eating that much more like it makes no sense to you.

162
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or does it make sense because you were kind of like eating you know 4000 calories a day or something like what was going on. Do you think

163
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.220
Jessica G: It makes sense.

164
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It does. Okay.

165
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:15.000
Jessica G: Mm hmm. Okay, I'm a parent. I was eating a lot. I wasn't eating healthy

166
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.330
Okay.

167
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.730
Jessica G: To say

168
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Not exercising, right. So we do want to spend a little bit of time around that, because part of what I'm seeing a lot of success in and what research is saying is if you incorporate

169
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: moderate exercise, you know, you don't, you're not going to be a marathon runner. Right. We're not asking for that. But if you can incorporate some movement, maybe 2030 minutes a day.

170
00:19:45.690 --> 00:20:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: People are feeling better. I mean, now your brain is clearing up. Wouldn't it be kind of nice to start a really start to feel better physically. Um, so have you been already brainstorming something you would like to do

171
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.150
Jessica G: Oh yeah, I've already put it in in in motion.

172
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:12.510
Jessica G: What is I went out and shut up, then there be an iOS, the vegan part of it.

173
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.080
Jessica G: I went and got fresh through

174
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.090
Jessica G: nonfat Greek yogurt. Like, I'm just trying to eat healthier.

175
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.160
Jessica G: Not trying to eat.

176
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:31.590
Jessica G: After a certain time probably like after eight o'clock seven o'clock.

177
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:47.490
Jessica G: I turned out to eat. I'm the one thing though is like. Okay, so before I moved into this apartment. I wasn't doing any exercise at all. I wasn't doing nothing. I mean, while I was going to school. I was running back and forth and doing all that but

178
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.120
Jessica G: Like once I moved into this apartment. I literally go up and down those stairs.

179
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.130
Jessica G: Like

180
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.760
Jessica G: Like a good

181
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:09.060
Jessica G: 50 times a day. Wow, up and down the stairs. I've been on the third one. And every time I go up.

182
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:24.450
Jessica G: I try to kind of like, you know, like tight in my muscles and everything. I kind of make it an exercise. I've always done that. And then when I come down. It's like our hurts.

183
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.870
Jessica G: My knees or hurts my, like, you know, my ankles just

184
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.010
Jessica G: I'm like, I have it in my head or radio

185
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.880
Jessica G: Is the plan set in motion.

186
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me what it is. And I can put it on your treatment plan to and you and I can peek at it every month.

187
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.450
Jessica G: We can look at it, you can

188
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So in your own words.

189
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.600
Jessica G: What is it that you want it.

190
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To and I'll write it down.

191
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.300
Jessica G: What's your goal. I want to get healthier and healthier. Okay.

192
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's see how we define that when we were just talking here when we say

193
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I will, and just take something you were doing before, and we can take a few things. So for example, I will eat fruits and vegetables twice a day.

194
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Five days a week, or you might say, I'll eat if you're doing a calorie thing you might pick a calorie approach or you might say, I will

195
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you said, I won't eat after you know 678 or nine, you know, whatever the timing is

196
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a week so that you can sort of say, look, I'm already doing it. This is great. We can get behind this, and we can reinforce the success

197
00:22:53.220 --> 00:23:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the word healthy is an interesting one. Everybody's definition of it is different. Some people will say about me, you don't eat healthy.

198
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Next person is going to say, oh my gosh you eat so healthy. How do you do it, it varies with everybody.

199
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So I really want to understand what it will feel like for you. I already heard, I'm eating fruit. I heard vegan yogurt. I heard something about not eating late at night after eight o'clock. Um, but let's be specific.

200
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to do, let's look at it on a daily basis. What will you be doing more of every day.

201
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.890
Jessica G: Like once a day.

202
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.950
Jessica G: I just feel like I'm too busy.

203
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.040
Jessica G: Like I'm too busy like I'm too.

204
00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.490
Jessica G: I'm always doing something

205
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.230
Jessica G: Like, even when I eat.

206
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.940
Jessica G: I've been trying to make it a point to sit down and eat with my son.

207
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:23.070
Jessica G: But sometimes. He just eats before me or either I'm Christina, I have to serve him and stuff so I even eat standing up, like, Well, I'm working, you know,

208
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:24.720
Jessica G: And

209
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.540
Jessica G: I guess in my mind.

210
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:44.520
Jessica G: In my mind, I feel like I'm not hungry. Like, my mind's like you normally not hungry. And then that's how I end up eating late at night because I'm like Jesus. Like, I'm hungry.

211
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, can I talk to you a little I'm not a nutritionist, but this the little bit that I've learned about

212
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Eating and things like that is

213
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: If the body isn't being fed what it's doing is it's saying, oh, she's not feeding us. We're going to hold on to our fat storage, we need to hold on to it.

214
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not feeding it, it may seem crazy. I know, but it's it's it's living off of a scarcity system. If instead you made yourself eat as many as four tiny so meals.

215
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it won't, it doesn't it doesn't help you emotionally. A lot of people will eat emotionally like they'll eat salty fat sugary foods.

216
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but if you wanted to, if you if you wanted to experiment with it, certainly you could schedule an appointment with a nutritionist I'm I know we have one in bright heart I have yet to be able to get her to meet with my clients, but certainly you could pursue a more professional approach.

217
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you base it on what you want to see is a healthier approach. The body does want small meals. It wants these little things, because if we think about what food is supposed to be. It's supposed to be fuel.

218
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's we like right the taste of those sweet, salty fatty foods.

219
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And we get this little dopa mean little bit of adult mean rush. Yeah, we get that release and it reinforces that you're not going to starve to death. So biologically, we want that. But if you said, I'm not going to eat emotionally. I'm going to eat healthy, then think of food is fuel.

220
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of right you've got dark colored berries, like a Blackberry or a blueberry or raspberry kale, which is a really dark colored food, they tend to be antioxidants.

221
00:26:50.820 --> 00:27:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: He said, Well, you know, maybe you'll talk to your primary care physician or maybe you can talk with the doctor about some information that she might have on you know particular vitamins that are good.

222
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: For someone who's going through this this tapering process, you know, that might be useful information that might meet the category of healthier. But even as I'm saying see food as fuel instead of a friend like an emotional friend. Um, what comes up for you.

223
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.520
Jessica G: Um,

224
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:34.110
Jessica G: I feel like it's like kind of the way I'm dosing myself every single day.

225
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.340
Jessica G: With the buprenorphine.

226
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.780
Jessica G: I can look at it the same way with food, like I'm

227
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.600
Jessica G: Smelling No. Yes.

228
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.160
Jessica G: That's right.

229
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a very different approach. But you know what will happen.

230
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be won't be as hungry.

231
00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you might be hungrier because the body's going to start to, um, it'll say, Oh, I'm getting I'm getting fuel, but I need a little more and you can start to use the reservoir that you have stored in your fat cells. Now, that's my understanding of it. I could be wrong.

232
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.900
Jessica G: I'm not a nutritionist.

233
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Way outside my scope.

234
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.750
Jessica G: But that's my understanding.

235
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, you know, you may know that through people that are like bodybuilders only like five times a day they'll have these tiny little meals with meat and whatever, and they eat all day long.

236
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but their fuel.

237
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they don't want the body to burn muscle. They just want it to be pulling pulling from the fat storage and using the actual food as fuel.

238
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So that something has to take its place. So I want you to think about 6789 o'clock at night.

239
00:28:54.570 --> 00:29:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You have now clean, which means that's a distraction. You've kept your mind busy. That's a great technique for people that are trying not to relapse. It's a great one. Staying busy. Um, but then the work is done and you are left with you and the quiet.

240
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think we need to get some ritual in 6789 where's the real window for you. Where is the real vulnerability. Let's say you were to eat.

241
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: At six o'clock at night and you couldn't eat after seven and that was it. And now you're left with, what, eight o'clock, nine o'clock 10 o'clock when you go to bed.

242
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:45.120
Jessica G: I usually end up in there like around 1030 1045 after a baby, the baby and changing everything

243
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have basically between

244
00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say eight 910 about three and a half hours.

245
00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you actually enjoy doing that we feel nourishing to the soul that we are he's climbing up the stairs that good said okay

246
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.080
Jessica G: Yeah, who does not going up.

247
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:07.920
Yeah.

248
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.070
Jessica G: I don't like it but

249
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what can you do, what's something that would actually bring you some pleasure, some joy. It could be a YouTube video on some exercise.

250
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be reading something, it could be making something could be starting to get yourself more involved in a project and activity. What could you do what some thoughts.

251
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.600
Jessica G: Sorry, reading the Bible.

252
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now between eight and 10 how much time would that take

253
00:30:51.480 --> 00:31:01.440
Jessica G: Well, it depends. Like, because then I'm supposed I was already supposed to do it, but it's a whole story and I just didn't end up doing it. Um, but, um,

254
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.950
Jessica G: I've been like it's been in the back of my mind. So I feel like a chapter a day because they have, they gave us this paper.

255
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.600
Jessica G: That you read so much a day. I think that it's like 10 minutes

256
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so client will increase reading the Bible. That's one chapter a day approximately 10 minutes. How many days a week.

257
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.390
Jessica G: Seven.

258
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to do it every day.

259
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: How many are you already doing it.

260
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:41.220
Jessica G: I'm only reading the daily devotional on the app on our churches. Okay.

261
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're not reading the one chapter at all.

262
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we take it a little slower. Why don't we have, what if we just did it for five days a week, so that we could get behind the progress of it, instead of all or nothing like nothing, and all of a sudden

263
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. What if we did a little smaller. So we can. I can give you a yay, yay, you did great.

264
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How about we which. What do you want to do what's in the mill of seven for you.

265
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:11.670
Jessica G: Like by

266
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, fine.

267
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, from zero to five days a week and you have 30 days to pull this off. Okay.

268
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And now, guess what is that Bible right out where you need it to be. Is it hidden right now, or is it out.

269
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.700
Jessica G: So beautiful. It's on my bookshelf.

270
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can share that in group or an individual therapy if you want to and say, hey, I've been reading or hey, I haven't. I keep forgetting our distract myself or whatever. So let's, what about this idea of eating healthy

271
00:32:52.440 --> 00:33:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like things to be measurable so that we can. You can say yes, this is what I was doing. And this is what I'm doing now, what would you like to do more of what will we be increasing. See if we can make it really specific

272
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.830
Jessica G: What I would like to do, Mara.

273
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:11.670
Yep.

274
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.150
Jessica G: Taking time for myself.

275
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.870
Jessica G: I would like to take more time for myself.

276
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. That's what we would call here as self care now in that time that you are taking it for yourself. Is there anything you already envision that you would be doing

277
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.790
Jessica G: washing my face.

278
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:58.470
Jessica G: My creams and stuff on my hair out, putting oil in it and putting it up in a been

279
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.530
Jessica G: Painting my toenail.

280
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:14.580
Jessica G: Even

281
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I was gonna say what's going to get in the way of the time needed right

282
00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:25.710
Jessica G: To do this, um,

283
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.830
Jessica G: Well, I usually try to ask my friends to watch the baby.

284
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.030
Jessica G: But it doesn't work out too good.

285
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, why does it break down. Why does it not work too good.

286
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.690
Jessica G: Because he doesn't do it.

287
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Did you know that we

288
00:34:54.930 --> 00:35:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: We started with this. And then there was a return to he'll help with the diapers. There was some progress. Did, did some backsliding happen with his help.

289
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:17.760
Jessica G: Oh, no, no. He still does all that he still, you know, grabs the baby. But now I'm having issues with hey look, I'm trying to I need time for myself like

290
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.100
Jessica G: Me please look out for him.

291
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.170
Jessica G: He does he do it he just sits on the phone.

292
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.970
Jessica G: And the baby ends up upstairs crying banging on the door. So I have to let them in the restroom and

293
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:37.080
Jessica G: You start getting into everything and

294
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is it that worked. And I have some vague recollection that it was his mother that gave them a little talk into

295
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.840
Jessica G: The something how my grandma. Yeah.

296
00:35:50.220 --> 00:36:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is interesting because this one might be a little harder for him to understand. So I wonder if it's a matter of do you think that he could hear

297
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine what his life would be if when he came home from work. He had no downtime. There was no time to watch TV. There was no time to kind of play a game on the phone or video game. There's no downtime, because that's basically what you're going through.

298
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to be on duty watching out for him. I mean, before you finish breakfast, all of a sudden it's like lunch. Again, it's very time consuming.

299
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I know he doesn't get that. But he might register it with the fact that he doesn't want to go take care of him. It actually takes a lot of energy.

300
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of you need time to refuel

301
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, picturing him if he could picture what you know. Can you sort of imagine, sweetheart, that you know you how you want to decompress you want to come home from work. I need that too.

302
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And being specific can, can I have that between let's say eight and nine o'clock and just start there and see if you can at least and and it means

303
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you've got to keep direct eye contact on him. He can't crawl away can down the stairs. In fact, will walk up the stairs and you go play with him. You can drive with him, Go Go do your thing or US boy bonding here.

304
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But I need the mental relief of being able to just focus on myself because the vigilance of having to constantly be worrying about a safety worrying about his well being. All that all day long. It takes a lot of energy. And I like to relax into this quiet self care routine.

305
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like you do when you come home because doesn't he come home and want to decompress

306
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.100
Jessica G: Yeah, we all

307
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We all need it.

308
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you think's going to happen if you try to have that conversation with him.

309
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to play with how you might say it and see how it sounds and practice it with me. What would you say

310
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.930
Jessica G: I would probably

311
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.850
Jessica G: Talk to him.

312
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.560
Jessica G: Like in my serious boys.

313
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.380
Jessica G: Like when he knows that I'm not joking, like I'm being serious.

314
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:42.630
Jessica G: And tell him.

315
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.090
Jessica G: I need his help.

316
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.540
Jessica G: I need his help with the baby like I'm on my feet all day long.

317
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:04.680
Jessica G: But then once I start saying that like she automatically shuts off like oh why work all day long. You know, so he just

318
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.620
Jessica G: stopped listening. I feel like

319
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is the tricky part. Jessica, if I was there, I would be able to sort of guide you and navigate and what's going on.

320
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But unfortunately, right, it's just you having to hold on to the fact that this is something you've identified that you need to work on. And it's worth it, did he throw some matching

321
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.450
You

322
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're worth what you're asking for. I just wonder if you back down.

323
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if you'd let go of that because he's saying he's working and you have this underlying belief that you're being lazy or something because you've touched on something in a past session.

324
00:39:53.460 --> 00:40:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: About that and i don't agree with you. You're not lazy being a mother is incredibly being a parent is incredibly time consuming difficulties, a lot of concentration. It's a lot of work. And in fact, if you were to say, Hey sweetheart. How about you work.

325
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: No more. And you'd be a stay at home dad wants you to picture how much energy that would take notice how just babysitting takes a lot of energy. Hey sweetheart. Just imagine that imagine, are you drawn to it and you would want to do that.

326
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It takes a lot of work. And my guess is he rather be at work.

327
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:30.900
Jessica G: Yo,

328
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.350
Jessica G: He wouldn't even be having to him because he wouldn't lift a finger.

329
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so there would be, it would be done poorly.

330
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:44.280
Okay.

331
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.400
Jessica G: Yeah, he's like,

332
00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.750
Jessica G: Just refuses to do any housework.

333
00:40:52.890 --> 00:41:04.380
Jessica G: She uses to clean up after themselves and I find myself like telling them, please like you got to help me out dude like pick up after yourself. I'm not your mom like I

334
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.780
Jessica G: It's hard. I've been having

335
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.860
Jessica G: The way he was raised.

336
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:16.080
Jessica G: And the way he watched his mom with her with his dad is like

337
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:22.620
Jessica G: When he got out of work. They're better they're better be a plate with one food on the table.

338
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:27.540
Jessica G: And the house better between, you know,

339
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.680
Yeah.

340
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not his mom, you're not. And he's

341
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.270
Jessica G: You know,

342
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: He's taking the modeling of

343
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: his upbringing and

344
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If this isn't something that you want to do, then it's, you know, maybe it's time to have a little conversation about that.

345
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So as I mentioned, to other people. I'm more than happy to to work with couples and I do, if there is a big subject that

346
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:02.220
Jessica G: People want to talk with their, their partner about I can meet with

347
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple in

348
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you ever do get to that.

349
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.150
Jessica G: Point we want to have a

350
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.350
long conversation.

351
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.330
Jessica G: To kind of give you guys

352
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.040
Jessica G: Skills about how to accomplish that.

353
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Happened to do it.

354
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:15.660
Jessica G: Purely

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.740
Jessica G: That would it be cool.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, just let me know when. Okay. And one thing and then I'm going to have to jump out to a group

362
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.130
Jessica G: And you

363
