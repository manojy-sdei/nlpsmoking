20
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.820
Nicole Bacon: And

21
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.360
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, when I feel the cleaning coming. I have to just go with it or else

22
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I will be there for a while.

23
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:12.630
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah. It comes in spurts so I cleaned all the dishes like it looks pretty good, because I have a client coming over later.

24
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.320
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, to do her dreads so

25
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How long does that take curious.

26
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.250
Nicole Bacon: Whoa. Last time it took four hours misty

27
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You were comfy shoes and the whole deal. Make sure you're taking care of your legs and

28
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:39.630
Nicole Bacon: Yes, it's mostly my hands and I were those copper bracelets those really help. Oh, that's smart. Yeah.

29
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.270
Nicole Bacon: And but before that have to go check in this you may feel today.

30
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let me just say yes to this.

31
00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Say yes. Yes, I'll do it. You've done it. Yes, yes. I like your yes yes yes yes yes

32
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes.

33
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so what is your P O interested and he wants you to have a job doesn't need

34
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.040
Nicole Bacon: A job being a program and

35
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.290
Nicole Bacon: I'm

36
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:31.440
Nicole Bacon: I'm gonna bring up the guidebook that he gave me because it's very limited. And I guess if you're not in the system.

37
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:46.080
Nicole Bacon: You would know that you need permission to travel or to do anything but under that area just says, Let us know if you're going out of the country. So I feel like they need to update that

38
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.240
Nicole Bacon: Something make it more in depth because

39
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.990
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

40
00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I hear you. That's a really important piece. I worked in felony drug court for 14 years. So for me, it's very familiar. Like, you gotta if you did the crime. Here, you do the time here. Like, that's the mentality. So for me, it's like the bus.

41
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Route, but a judge or someone can give consent. Let's say treatment says, yay, and probation officer says, yay, justice, yay, everybody's on the same page. Then, off you go. It just takes some logistics and some some permissions, but

42
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder

43
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder what happened with that.

44
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.280
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, but for you know people that are new in the system. They. There's a lot of stuff that I have to just

45
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:56.730
Nicole Bacon: Be like, Okay, I guess I understand that because my mom's asking like, Well, what if we wanted to take a little road trip together mean new my mom wants to bond with me. And I'm like, I don't know. Mom, I have to ask him, you know. Yeah.

46
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you would. And, and I think the key pieces.

47
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If you think about it, like, unfortunately, like I'm a kid again. This is a, this is a firm parent. I gotta ask

48
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's messed up. But that's the way it is.

49
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.180
Nicole Bacon: Right.

50
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:32.640
Nicole Bacon: I just wish they would put it in the handbook because I referred to it because I didn't know you know and my probation officers, kind of like I'll text them. And sometimes, so get back to me sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it's a week later.

51
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think.

52
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Things like clean drug screens compliance.

53
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Working. They just, they just want just hit the mark hit the mark. Let me say yes. Make saying yes easy for him as the cadence.

54
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.630
Right.

55
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.120
Nicole Bacon: Saying, Okay.

56
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So more and more information and maybe you've got some suggestions about how to make it.

57
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: More concrete in the manual

58
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.820
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

59
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not a career criminal. So you're like, I don't know.

60
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.400
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I

61
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.980
Nicole Bacon: I get real frustrated when things aren't clear, you know, and

62
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.820
Nicole Bacon: Mike was like okay

63
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're seeing him later today.

64
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.960
Nicole Bacon: Yeah hour after we're done with our appointment. Okay.

65
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Prior to cleaning. How has the mood been

66
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.340
Nicole Bacon: Better good

67
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.560
Nicole Bacon: I was kind of being lazy. The last couple days and

68
00:06:47.340 --> 00:07:06.180
Nicole Bacon: And now reaching out to people and I reached out to a couple people realized one of my friends is moving right in this area because right now this townhome here in Albuquerque. If I don't find a roommate within a month. I'm going to have to move back to my parents house.

69
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.040
Nicole Bacon: All right.

70
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's confusing because they I thought they didn't want you to have a roommate.

71
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So I that's a conundrum. I don't guess I don't quite get it.

72
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.920
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, my mom's a conundrum.

73
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:38.700
Nicole Bacon: I put it up on Airbnb, and it was fine when I wasn't here and I was in Santa Fe and they could have a whole house when I put it up again. My mom's like, I don't really want you to have strangers in there.

74
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:50.490
Nicole Bacon: I'm like, okay, and if she goes back and forth. It's strange. I think she just really wants me to be right there, but

75
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.030
But

76
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What I don't know if you said, I don't understand how I'm going to pay for this. If I don't get a roommate, like, Did that get said

77
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.480
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes, because my dad's losing out on money right now.

78
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.150
Nicole Bacon: What did you haven't paid rent.

79
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: She say when you said I need a roommate, so I can cover this rent.

80
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:20.610
Nicole Bacon: Um, I've been bringing it up to her, but they finally gave me like an ultimatum like a time limit.

81
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I gotta get clear. Did you tell your mom, I need a roommate so that I can cover my rent.

82
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.240
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

83
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And she said, what

84
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:40.260
Nicole Bacon: She says, a couple of different things. She says within a month, I need to find a roommate.

85
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So she's down with it.

86
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, fine. So now comes in, she's not really worried about roommate is she worried about something else.

87
00:08:50.610 --> 00:09:09.720
Nicole Bacon: I think she is because I put it up on Facebook, just to see if there's any, like, people that I know. And she's like, who's this, who's this and this, that replied how my mom, you know, I have the ability to not reply to certain people, you know,

88
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so right. What's your actual fear.

89
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.760
Nicole Bacon: Could control and

90
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.380
Nicole Bacon: Drag a lot

91
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that. That's her her personality style a character trait. What she afraid will happen.

92
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:38.520
Nicole Bacon: Drugs, I don't know, not having a scary person living here.

93
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not sure

94
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.040
Nicole Bacon: Being safe.

95
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you ask her what are you afraid of

96
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.820
Nicole Bacon: Fear Itself.

97
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.860
Nicole Bacon: Where are you, where do you think of every possible dangerous situation.

98
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But in this communication.

99
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's the tricky bit is

100
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking, What are you afraid of

101
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So typically you fill in big based on past behavior. This is probably, probably a but I can tell by you are kind of throwing different things at me. What it says is, you didn't ask her.

102
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.040
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I guess I didn't

103
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.170
Nicole Bacon: Know, I didn't

104
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.470
Nicole Bacon: What not specifically was she afraid of

105
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that at the heart of it.

106
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:49.440
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I guess we just, there's an issue right there with living situation and my mom.

107
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:50.850
Nicole Bacon: Like

108
00:10:52.050 --> 00:11:03.960
Nicole Bacon: That there is an issue there that's that needs to be talked about and cleared up a little bit because she's been wishy washy with me about living situation and

109
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.800
Nicole Bacon: And what she promised me

110
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you do you share any part of wishy washy that things sort of stay wishy washy.

111
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.560
Nicole Bacon: I don't want it to stay wishy washy, but it

112
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.280
Nicole Bacon: Over the last couple years it's been

113
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:41.190
Nicole Bacon: Her opinion on what she wants for me has shifted around

114
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.030
Nicole Bacon: A lot as far as living situation.

115
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that you're talking really vague. Are you aware that it's really general

116
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.310
Nicole Bacon: Sorry.

117
00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:12.570
Nicole Bacon: You have to be sorry hands. I do that okay I guess what it is, is, um, well, when I moved back from Portland. She promised that I could move into her rental house around the corner and that didn't happen because she

118
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:34.890
Nicole Bacon: A month later, it was my 30th birthday party, and I got pretty toasted, and she asked me if I was messed up. And I said, Yes. And she used that excuse for me to not move into that house. And it's been kind of like this weird thing with me and her cuz she's never gone back on her word

119
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.130
Nicole Bacon: I see this pattern of

120
00:12:39.660 --> 00:13:04.680
Nicole Bacon: Like with my grandma She has her sons living with her since until they're in their 50s. So it's like she wants me my dad's more wanting me to have my own space and take care of myself, my mom still like, oh. Come here, baby bird. I want to see you right there and you know okay so

121
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about this. She's never broken her word. What is, what was that there was a just a piece of fragment of a statement there was that

122
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:17.100
Nicole Bacon: A anything that she has proposed.

123
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:30.630
Nicole Bacon: She doesn't really say we, I promise. But that she has proposed, she has followed through on and this one thing she did not

124
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:41.250
Nicole Bacon: And I feel like it led to a lot of more drug use, because I didn't have my own space when I thought I was going to

125
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:57.600
Nicole Bacon: So yeah, so as far as here. I did that Airbnb. And then she's like, wait, take that off. I don't want you to have strangers in your house, but I'm going to have a stranger in my house as a roommate, so I'm confused as well.

126
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's look at wishy washy I need

127
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.890
Nicole Bacon: A color. I need to call her right now.

128
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:21.300
Nicole Bacon: Cuz my dad says one thing he's very clear on it. My mom is kind of

129
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.960
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, strange about it.

130
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So just let's do a here and now. Noticing let's let's pay attention to what's coming up in the present.

131
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So turn inward, let's say, Take this opportunity. So I know it's not, you know, in some ways, I have been

132
00:14:46.320 --> 00:15:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: A safe person to be present with your own truth so see if that's happening again. See if you can go in to yourself. Use that part of the brain. It's got a name called the insula. It's pretty cool specific part of the brain that can pay attention to the body and how it's doing

133
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.780
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, my stomach's going offering now.

134
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

135
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Tight hey yeah we're talking about something in her personal with Mother stomach makes sense, it would get tight.

136
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a typical place for interpersonal

137
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Confusion disconnect dissonance.

138
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There's mixed message, there's confusion. There's so that makes sense that that would be what's changing

139
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.310
Nicole Bacon: Every time. No.

140
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:51.030
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I did. I mean, that makes sense with the stomach tight with confusion, but I didn't register.

141
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, are you confused. Maybe it's not true freedom.

142
00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:18.570
Nicole Bacon: I'm confused with my mom because she she goes, this whole living situation has been back and forth. One thing to the other. She wants me to to be stable and be able to take care of myself and pay rent, but then part of her wants me to be under her household forever until employee.

143
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

144
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So, are you okay with doing some work around that.

145
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

146
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: If it were me

147
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And she were here.

148
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what do you think that I would do.

149
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To undo the confusion. Right. Probably gather information. I don't know that I have all my information right

150
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: When I just sort of

151
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Not do anything about it.

152
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And just sort of

153
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.600
Nicole Bacon: Know, let it sit.

154
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.940
Nicole Bacon: Let it ride. No.

155
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:17.370
Nicole Bacon: I've tried to clear up the confusion. A couple times and hasn't really gone anywhere.

156
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

157
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.080
Yeah.

158
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wonder, how might I do it.

159
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What I do

160
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.570
Nicole Bacon: I'm a mom.

161
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.420
Nicole Bacon: You know,

162
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:51.750
Nicole Bacon: What I understand that do in debt are tiny is I need to find a roommate within 30 days or else I moved back into your guys's home. Is that correct, and

163
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.030
Nicole Bacon: Do you have limitations on that.

164
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:03.600
Nicole Bacon: Do you want to be totally in the process or

165
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, I read it up.

166
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

167
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.540
Nicole Bacon: So do you have 30 kind of did that.

168
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's perfect. It's perfect. You just let me in. Right. You did, you did great. So, um, do you have limitations.

169
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would not phrase it quite like that. Okay, I already know what I think are the sticky points I would ask an informed question of, do you have an expectation that I

170
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Come up with this money without getting a roommate.

171
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I would ask that form question.

172
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Limitation is big. That's a real that's a general topic limitation.

173
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't know what you meant. I don't think this person I was talking to would know what that meant, either. So I would ask a very specific question and for which has basically all the information needed in the question.

174
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So they can actually just give me a yes or no. It's got everything they need. There's no fault, like they say yes or no. You can have money if she carried on with some lecture about roommate.

175
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, maybe they did it. I would do the thing which is

176
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you afraid of about me getting a roommate, I see you are monitoring the stuff going on Facebook. What are you afraid of

177
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: As remember the stuff we've talked about, which is you do. Whoops. Someone just texted you.

178
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.870
Nicole Bacon: And I have you plugged in, and it says low power, what

179
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, maybe it's not quite plugged in.

180
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see you.

181
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh, yeah.

182
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the past we have touched on this notion and you've picked up on it and you've, I think, been actually paying close attention to works I'm drifting out I'm starting to seek outside validation approval.

183
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To be okay. I've been looking outside myself. Okay, that's habitual and you've caught yourself think you have some refreshed consciousness about them.

184
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to to pull that off. What I've invited is you don't do any of the analysis for people don't analyze

185
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.460
Nicole Bacon: You can take

186
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and take what they say at face value. This is one of those opportunities you already have this lifetime of history.

187
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Of sort of, you can kind of predict what she's thinking. I mean, you're you. You can come to a logical conclusion but you can't afford to do it, Nicole.

188
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And afford to do it anymore because this is there, you're doing things differently to see if you can have different outcomes. That's the whole point of it. Right, we're going to bring a CF up and doing this because it's adapted why just doing it because I've just been doing it.

189
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens. Let's see if we have if we do it a little differently.

190
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your, what are your concerns.

191
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what's your fear if I on my own selected for me because I cannot afford this right now I don't have sort of this steady income coming in. I really want to stay in this place. What's your fear.

192
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.070
Nicole Bacon: Rain.

193
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that sound clear

194
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.760
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

195
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:40.470
Nicole Bacon: Versus

196
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any limitations.

197
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:56.370
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, oh yeah, oh, but see going I kind of already did the thing that I am used to as being a

198
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.210
Nicole Bacon: People pleasing daughter.

199
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:20.880
Nicole Bacon: And I already was like, Oh, I'm gonna write up something on Craigslist and I'll send it to you guys before I put it out there and you can be part of the process. And I already. That's automatic for me. Yeah. And I really need to step out of that because I'm an adult and their

200
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.640
Nicole Bacon: Perspectives and traces for me has not been working

201
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's okay. All you do is you just notice it because a relationship is not that one person is prescribing you will stay child for other forever.

202
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You will be baby. You'll never really grow up, you will never have interdependence, you will remain dependent, they're not the only contributing factor in that

203
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You buy in by taking the money and the gifts to, you know, that part right it's hard to swallow it sucks, but it's probably a little bit. True.

204
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.410
Nicole Bacon: Oh, it's definitely true definitely true.

205
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can hold that crew. You can hold all kinds of stuff.

206
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you can also hold on to that.

207
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And not label yourself bad week even better because you're not. It's just, this is where you're at, you both had

208
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This meta communication. This will be the agreement you in some ways continued to along the pattern of I know what I need to do. I'll placate I'll play small so that you continue to be a benefactor, maybe, I don't know if that's the real game, but if it is

209
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to depart from it a little bit just to test and see if you have the ego strength if they have the ego strength. You can depart, a little bit at a time. And so maybe that's what you're up to, is just a little bit, maybe not all at once. But we just get to China.

210
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: individuation finally right that's what it is. It's individuation and it got delayed. That's all.

211
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:03.450
Just delayed.

212
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no prescription that it has to be here, here, here, and here.

213
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Without trauma, you know, typically that kind of it starts with are catching an attitude about 12 right we're like,

214
00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Like my own opinion. I want to wear what I want to wear a book and then it just pops up a little bit more. And we get to stay out later we get to have more independence, we get to

215
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to the mall. We get to travel alone on the bus. We get to do some things on our own. But if that gets stalled up the messages. My family can't trust me, maybe I can't trust myself.

216
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets stalled up I'm treated like a child commonly seen as this vulnerable creature than maybe they're right.

217
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It can get confusing.

218
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

219
00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why it's okay. That's why right now. So, okay, that's also naming it own it not shaming it but just let's. This is what we got is this is what we got. This is what we're trying to work on and we'll do just a little bit because that's appropriate. We don't just up, you're an adult by

220
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:23.070
Nicole Bacon: And, well, that's kind of, I mean, I was really like that and

221
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:48.150
Nicole Bacon: I went through a breakup and my moms like if you move back. She told me about 20 times if you move back I can move into her rental house, I'd be mine and I came back and that didn't happen. And I felt like I let go of all that I let go of being an adult and kind of reverting back and

222
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:50.910
Nicole Bacon: Painful

223
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, so

224
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this is a hard spot right here and quality. You know why.

225
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me try, let me change my question.

226
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What message does that send your mother what you did.

227
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.110
Nicole Bacon: Well message.

228
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:23.340
Nicole Bacon: Um, that she was going to be the hero and caretaker. I don't know.

229
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then, don't rush it just, I just asked you a really hard question.

230
00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm not supposed to know right away.

231
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.420
Nicole Bacon: Can you ask it again.

232
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: First, let's make sure you're okay.

233
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get back to okay because something's coming up.

234
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's practice the skills of clear communication and see if we can we can do sort of interpersonal work and see if you can

235
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.880
Nicole Bacon: Tell me.

236
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you.

237
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

238
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.730
Nicole Bacon: heart wrenching

239
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes feelings don't have their labels connected

240
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, too. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay.

241
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To take take your little pause and put them off, you can feel those glasses and why don't you describe what you see, let's use some of that that grounding in the five senses. Why don't we do that.

242
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.510
Nicole Bacon: RO Le Pew.

243
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Can keep your eyes closed.

244
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel feel the glasses. Is it snows, tell me what you feel with your, with your fingers.

245
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.410
Nicole Bacon: Us.

246
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.810
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and bumpy on the top part

247
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.370
Nicole Bacon: And then those pads are like

248
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.560
Nicole Bacon: Wonky

249
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.590
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm. And

250
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.940
Nicole Bacon: That ends of the year.

251
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.420
Nicole Bacon: That goes around my ears or lunch done by little kitty teeth.

252
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's once you're done with that sense I want you to turn the sense of hearing your eyes close. What do you hear

253
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.270
Nicole Bacon: You hear the

254
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.880
Nicole Bacon: The heater going

255
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Here your sniffles

256
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.890
Nicole Bacon: Yes. Okay.

257
00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything outside of the home that you hear out there.

258
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.170
Nicole Bacon: Um, my cat walking around and

259
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:06.990
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

260
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.400
Nicole Bacon: The fridge making noises

261
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.350
Nicole Bacon: Nice.

262
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:16.020
What do you smell.

263
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.700
Nicole Bacon: I smell.

264
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.220
Nicole Bacon: I can smell it, because it's my noses stuffed up

265
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring that your fabric to your

266
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:29.100
Nicole Bacon: Nose.

267
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: From your sweater.

268
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What you got in there.

269
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.790
Nicole Bacon: Smells like

270
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.190
Nicole Bacon: Trey

271
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.310
And now.

272
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your eyes and look in the camera and tell me what you see, just not what it is not labels, but just data coming from your eyes just data.

273
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Gold

274
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.840
Nicole Bacon: bold letters smooth.

275
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.940
Nicole Bacon: Green.

276
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.800

Nicole Bacon: Fingers

Nicole Bacon: Red and yellow and blue, white,

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.820
Nicole Bacon: Veins going through

283
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.180
Nicole Bacon: And shiny.

284
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:33.900
Nicole Bacon: Smooth

285
00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: scan your body. See, are you doing

286
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to a nice light breath. Just remind the body that you are safe.

287
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That that body send a message up to the brain that whatever perceived distress was going on this body knows better

288
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.020
Nicole Bacon: You're safe.

289
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, in contradiction to that thought right that happen bodies. Okay. You gotta send that we've got to get that message up in contradiction to that automatic thought okay

290
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Something important just happen to you.

291
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have a name that feeling doesn't have a name.

292
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.940
Nicole Bacon: It's like four together.

293
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

294
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But the stomach was messaging in creating nasza

295
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:40.650
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, that's pretty powerful because it's like this stomach cramps, but usually doesn't get to the najah

296
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's stay. Let's stay on the outside of that.

297
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I'm outside enough

298
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I said

299
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not uncommon for people and parents to

300
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Not know how to communicate well themselves and they send mixed messages.

301
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you said, she may say grow up, but she shows you stay small stay meeting me

302
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.350
Nicole Bacon: If

303
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.690
Nicole Bacon: Right. Mm hmm.

304
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: As a consumer of that mixed message. And if it's true that it's been there a while, um,

305
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How do we know which one to respond to

306
00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

307
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.720
Nicole Bacon: Guess I have the choice to respond.

308
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.170
Nicole Bacon: Which way I want to

309
00:32:54.180 --> 00:33:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do, but that's a tricky. It's tricky. So notice how earlier today. You said I really like it when things are clear. I'm on my man to say definitively

310
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.470
Yes.

311
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There's probably a longing for that clarity. Just keep it direct just tell me

312
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you want. This is, this is what's going to happen if it doesn't just keep it did and you didn't hate when I did that behavior contract. I was expecting justice unraveling right because it's so like probation sounding. It's like, what is so bossy.

313
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't

314
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It was right there in front of you.

315
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Laid out this. Is this what's expected of me. It's clear.

316
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

317
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:56.040
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I like clear because if it's not clear, I get the stomach feelings I get all these weird uncomfortable sensations in my body.

318
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So your, your stomach is a good barometer of income currency.

319
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.840
It's a good. It's a good

320
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Space in there you know it, it will register dissonance that pop received mixed message conflicting information is coming out me it will register it. And notice how you didn't understand what was going on your limbic system said something. There's a perceived threat that just happened.

321
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And cried.

322
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And hoof right flood, but you couldn't name it.

323
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body is there for you. It registers something's off Clinton important is happening. And those are

324
00:34:52.110 --> 00:35:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Older right adaptations. The one where you can analyze it and label it. They're further along and development that stuff you're describing

325
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We're born with those we we have our startle response and we have our emotional reaction way before we've got language and the ability to analyze and think through. Okay.

326
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not going anywhere. That's going to be there for you.

327
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Forever, your ability to register threat, but it isn't the only thing happening, the only challenge with like the amygdala, for example, is that it only does that one thing. It's just, danger, danger.

328
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Danger.

329
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Danger Danger. Oh, we're not in

330
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Danger, danger, danger, danger, danger. Oh, not in danger.

331
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all right.

332
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Amber like I'm more than that.

333
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm like, I've got these other parts of my brain.

334
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's true, but it may not be the whole truth and the tricky bit is to say

335
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Something important happening.

336
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's registering something, just doesn't mean that other things aren't happening. All you need is that all of the parts of the brain are communicating with each other.

337
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you get too much too fast, it cuts off access to the thinker, this guy up here. The Thinker, the one that can go dude. Really, I'm going to get all upset about this.

338
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.760
Nicole Bacon: Man, because he could have faith, like my mom. Yeah, that's. Yeah, exactly.

339
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not using your finger and most people will say, that's who I am, when I'm thinking that's why am I am conscious. I'm not me. I'm not. I'm out of me. I'm not me. I'm not thinking a lot of people relate to the self as the thinker part of the brain. It's who I am.

340
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So rewind a little bit

341
00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: When you run across conflicting information you have a messenger from your stomach that registers it now you have a choice there to ignore it.

342
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is possibly what you may have been doing in the past. But this time, you can say something important happening.

343
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you do around mixed messages. So we're trying to stay superficial so you don't have to go to mom if you don't want to, you can pick someone else that sent you a mixed message and it registered in that stomach me trying to kind of pull up a memory of that.

344
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.580
Nicole Bacon: All day long.

345
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.190
Nicole Bacon: All day long. Wow.

346
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.650
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

347
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So that role play that I was doing so easily. Right. Well, this is what I would tell your mom right I make it look so easy because my style is not turning

348
00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

349
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: A there's no skin in the game for me. She saw my mom.

350
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no love on the line.

351
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just not going to be taken anything for me. She doesn't have anything of mine, so it's easy for me to do it right. Easy for you.

352
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If you ask a direct question from someone doesn't have to be your mom, but I got it do summer my

353
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.470
Brains just completely obsessed with it right now. What the what.

354
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:33.930
Okay I can't help it.

355
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

356
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you picturing maybe do you want us to keep talking about mom or we can pick, pick another another person.

357
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.200
Nicole Bacon: No, that's okay.

358
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:59.730
Nicole Bacon: Okay, I'm I'm I'm maybe thinking that I do get more clarity, when it's me, my mom and my dad all talking about a specific topic.

359
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.850
Nicole Bacon: With him yeah he helped

360
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.200
Nicole Bacon: Me understand my mom because

361
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:14.040
Nicole Bacon: She'll say one thing and the look on her face is the opposite. You know, it's

362
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. That's really cool that you can see that. Did you know that you have a right to check that out.

363
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.080
Nicole Bacon: With You mean like ask about

364
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So mom, I hear you saying

365
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I can borrow the car for a week and go up in the mountains, but your face like because I'm learning. This is how you're out is this

366
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm learning that

367
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we're sort of wired for connection and our face actually

368
00:39:52.770 --> 00:40:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be telling another story and I your face, you're not looking at me. So I'm concerned that maybe you have some ambivalence about it.

369
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it what you don't really want it looks in contradiction to what you're saying and I feel confused because

370
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so used to listening to your facial expression versus what you're saying over these years, I, I've just I've done that. But I want to know if I should rely on what you're saying, or this perception. I have how you're feeling about it. I don't know which one to listen to, I don't know.

371
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You wholeheartedly. It's okay if I take the car for a week because I i doubt my own perceptions. When I start to second guess your face versus what you're saying and

372
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that i know i do that i do that i second guess it and it's been contributing to my crazy making so I'm going a little nutter butter over here and so would it be okay if I just asked you how you feel about

373
00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.240
Letting me take the car.

374
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it now. I did that really long really long it. A lot of it, but

375
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: you're relying on an external

376
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Person you're down to do that.

377
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do it.

378
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.010
Yeah.

379
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.060
Nicole Bacon: It's been confusing because I mean all my life. She

380
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:40.890
Nicole Bacon: I'm like, Mom, are you listening. Are you listening. I'm trying to tell you something important. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, she's not listening like her eyes are glazed over

381
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:53.940
Nicole Bacon: And I tried to, like, you know, touch your arm and be like, Mom, I'm trying to tell you something important. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like just kind of I see this associates.

382
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: She just associates.

383
00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:20.430
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes. Like the other day she was asking if her head was doing this thing because that will happen when we're watching TV, sometimes. And over the years. It's flared up and I'm like, Mom, do you know you're doing this. She's like, No, and I know she just associates a lot

384
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:28.440
Nicole Bacon: So it's hard to know. And she's in her body and with she's actually under listening to me.

385
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's the place to start. Why would we continue talking to someone, if they're not there.

386
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:40.590
Nicole Bacon: Would you

387
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to be held accountable if you weren't even there.

388
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:44.760
Right.

389
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't like I was kind of it. I was just coping. I was in survival mode for whatever reason. That's my threat response went to freeze.

390
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I was immobilized in fear and I don't know what you just said.

391
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just Did you just get here cuz. How you doing,

392
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I am I'm out of it. I'm like, we live to a redo because I was just freaking out just now.

393
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:26.010
Nicole Bacon: Great. She won't do that though she won't say that she didn't hear or didn't what she does do this thing where she was like, what, haha. I'm like, Mom, you you've heard me. I know you heard anything

394
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.670
Nicole Bacon: Oh no, it's this thing. It's this

395
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:39.510
Nicole Bacon: The tension thing like I know she hears me sometimes, but sometimes she doesn't. And she's a strange one.

396
00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:41.430
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

397
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there's, there's a lot to unpack

398
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:55.320
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I just want to, I guess, ask her direct simple questions when I'm confused by her behavior.

399
00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's the next step and this, this may sound like it's just all by itself. And I'm not trying to oversimplify it because there's going to be you and all the history associated with it.

400
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You just accept the answer you accept any if the answer is, she spaced out and doesn't respond to you. You have a mother that's unavailable to you. You're pretending like that's not real.

401
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I imagine you would not like that.

402
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To be so invalidated right is to not be seen that you are not present that you are an association state.

403
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not available.

404
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, Mom will come back later. This doesn't seem like a good time. I'll ask my question later and walk away.

405
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen to your system to your family system. If you met content with your intuitive response. This is the nano manipulation mom getting grind and get her to be something. Nope. She's not available.

406
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been doing it this other way accommodating adapting accommodating adapting to that, but different way is to really see things for what they are. She's not available, and I don't have a lot of family stories. So I, I hope I'm not too off the mark here.

407
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can say it.

408
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You seem like you've kind of got some stuff on your mind. I'll come back and ask my questions later and walk away.

409
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What would change right in your family system if you did that.

410
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think would happen

411
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.630
Nicole Bacon: You just changed the better better things

412
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.790
Nicole Bacon: One thing that I have implemented recently is

413
00:45:49.590 --> 00:46:02.430
Nicole Bacon: Instead of sometimes I just know and I'll walk away. And I'm like, Okay, I'll ask her later. I'll just think about in my head, but some lately I've been leaning in because

414
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:16.890
Nicole Bacon: She'll have some like anger in her voice, but it's not really directed at either me or my dad or the animals, but she's frustrated. For some reason, and

415
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:30.990
Nicole Bacon: I went to her because usually, she's talking through rooms and stuff. And I've asked the family to please be in the same room to talk to each other because we can't hear each other but I

416
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:37.200
Nicole Bacon: More. I was like, Mom, is everything okay like what

417
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:53.490
Nicole Bacon: I hear your frustration. What is really going on. And it was her worrying about something about me and it's usually worry, it's worrying and i i that that worked because

418
00:46:54.570 --> 00:47:04.530
Nicole Bacon: Being in that energy is uncomfortable. And if I can defuse it in a healthy quick way that's, that's nice.

419
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that.

420
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do have. Okay, good. So you've got that skilled in the leaning and that's fantastic. And that would be in the get curious don't analyze it. Find out directly you can check out your assumptions. That's great. And that one worked

421
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one skill getting various the other ones sometimes is walking away.

422
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's because here. If it, if the consequence is, I'm going to have to go crazy, then that's not an option.

423
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:39.420
Yeah.

424
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not an option. She's not going to make you nuts, she doesn't get that right.

425
00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.280
You need to walk away.

426
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's just

427
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll come back another time.

428
00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a boundary setting right that's self preservation that's I got upset not hammer at it not fight at it not associate not go use but

429
00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: See the limitation for what it is you are able to register a really great moment she was capable of more and she gave more. I'm glad that happened. I'm glad that happened.

430
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:22.590
Hope you're

431
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.020

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So take a minute. Take your time. I have to open a note. Anyway, find a place to set this phone.

449
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:52.260
Adam: Okay, well, it's just hard because I

450
00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Can go on books and then right in front of you and you can kind of have it kind of in front

451
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like on books or propped up on a coffee table in front of you. Maybe you're on the couch.

452
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:07.620
Yeah.

453
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time. Look around your room and see if there's something you can bring up

454
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:22.440
Adam: Yeah, just because I had to have it on the charger this but today we're I think that should be good right thing. I see. Okay. So, all right.

455
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me open up a note here.

456
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have a lot going on and we have a finite amount of time.

457
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:32.190
So,

458
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.910
Adam: Is it is. So the reason

459
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:44.430
Adam: The last week was hard to that I missed everything was cuz

460
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.280
Adam: Hey, my boys.

461
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.340
Adam: Oh, you know, they were with their mother and she had that new guys in there.

462
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:55.530
Adam: Well,

463
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:03.390
Adam: That guy touched my boy. Oh.

464
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: She's out

465
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay see why EFT involved now right

466
00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:23.760
Adam: Yes. And now this UFC is involved, and they took my boys from her. And it's not like court ordered. I don't have like full custody of them. It's just they believe that

467
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:32.280
Adam: They will, they're not safe there with her right now. And so they came over here to my mom's and

468
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:42.330
Adam: And they look in a scene, everything was fine. So they put them with me now. So they're not, they're allowed to see her. Still, but they're not allowed to go to her how

469
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it have to be supervised

470
00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:59.040
Adam: Um, no, see, that's, that's the thing I'm, I'm just confused with is because like the other day on, I think it was last week, something, it was like when I miss my appointment, you know,

471
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:12.240
Adam: Individually individual was. It was a man and they had them. It was for they were interviewing my kids with like they detect it was watching and stuff. It was like a safe house thing or something.

472
00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:23.640
Adam: Safe. So, um, um, yeah. So I was over there. They and then after they did the stuff with my kids I had them.

473
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:29.130
Adam: Talk to the to the detective in the CFD lady and

474
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:31.290
Adam: They were just

475
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:50.070
Adam: Telling me that I don't have to be supervised, I guess, date, but they don't even want her they want it really on the FaceTime, like, I can't. There's no legal stuff saying like, if she comes over here and wants to take her kids. I can't really stop her because she has

476
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:55.380
Adam: She has custody, though. Might as well right now but

477
00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:11.790
Adam: I'm so it's like nothing really League was saying that she can't take them. But if she want if that's the rules are like if she does do that, then that's just gonna mess her up more in with you. I have d. And yeah, so

478
00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe she'll be motivated. Maybe she bought so

479
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:25.620
Adam: So I burn. Yeah. So anyways, right now I'm just, it's just hard because I'm I am just taking care of. I just have both of my boys now full time. You know what I mean. So I just

480
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:35.070
Adam: Even just trying to do everything. I'm trying to get what I'm trying to get all their paperwork their social security their birth certificate

481
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:45.960
Adam: Because she don't want to give me her that because she believes she's gonna get them back for whatever. But right now I'm going to try to the they want me to

482
00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:58.230
Adam: Go and file for custody and do all that the well that's the detective one in me to new and to go do get a restraining order on her because she had

483
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:13.680
Adam: She had come to my mom. She's been just showing up at my mom's house and other days she thought I guess I wasn't here. I was at work, because I i've been I got like a job, but it's like two days, and it's just like for inventory. So it's not really like dog job but

484
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. Wait, there's a lot to cover. So just just breathe.

485
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: In through the nose.

486
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

487
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to get all of what you need. We're going to get every bit of information. Okay.

488
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.460
Adam: We're gonna get

489
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna get it done. We gotta, you have a lot going on. So what's important is that we kind of get organized

519
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:57.870
Adam: Is helping me take my son to school because I didn't have no way to take him to school because his school is kind of far from from where I'm at right now. So his grandma comes and picks them up and takes him to school and then I my mom or me picks him up after school at three

520
01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, just wanting to know are you are already up in the early hour to get your son out of the house. Yes. No.

554
01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.850
Adam: They're fine. I guess they just

555
01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:33.660
Adam: Know not nothing urgent me now because she is on my side really now so there. They've been helping me they're going to help me like

556
01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:44.160
Adam: Jerry said that there's places like for cars like that donate cars and stuff. So I just need a car so I could. I don't have to deal with her family at all. So I could take him to school.

557
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:45.390
And okay

558
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so do you know what to do to pursue an application for that car.

559
01:05:52.710 --> 01:06:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been is does that feel like that's one of those really top priorities, like when you analyze all of the competing priorities that are coming at you because that can feel overwhelming for people. Does it seem like if you have to put energy into something, it would be that car.

560
01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.990
Adam: I'm kind of one of the top three because

561
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what are the other two.

562
01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.890
Adam: Their, their records their birth certificate their social and so

563
01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, it tell me why that surgeon

564
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:33.840
Adam: Because I need to get them on to my case through like food stamps and I need to see when I have that I could switch from schools.

565
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:46.800
Adam: Because there's a school that my brother goes to right across the street. Now, my older son could go to and like right now it's just hard to like she hasn't told me anything like they said it's long term, but when

566
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.940
Adam: My baby mom comes involved. She's saying that she's getting them back and all this stuff. So like

567
01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:59.340
Adam: I don't know if she was. She waved us telling her, like, if they're telling her, will you need to

568
01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay here. Stay here. Stay you're

569
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.440
Looking

570
01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's harder to stay on topic when you right you're looking away so see if he can kind of hang out with me here. So,

571
01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: See why FD their job if we say stay from the outside is to see who the safest best parent is when she say that's kind of the job.

572
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have a perpetrator in the house. That's a no duh. So you're the safest option there, but they're also going to be looking at. Is there food in the fridge.

573
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there running water is there electricity. Is this a stable residence and they're also going to be kind of looking at the Father. So when you mentioned the car something kind of wrong true. I was like, Oh, I bet he needs that car to consistently have an income.

574
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: He could look like an even better parent

575
01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: If he had that car. Now I could be wrong. I can't tell because I don't obviously I'm missing a lot a lot of details, but it's got to be hard to make a decision about where to put the energy

576
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the, have you looked at, let's say you had a choice of sort of filling out this paperwork and pursuing application for car versus

577
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Like all that's involved in filling out an application to get them on the food stamps with you right on your case, as you put it, I'm car stamps. What do you think it can you be putting energy into both or just one really demand your attention more

578
01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:44.070
Adam: Well, I guess the one cuz I just really trend with the last couple days, getting their, their socials and

579
01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:51.570
Adam: Stuff like that. Like I had just came that's I just barely got back to the house, like right now at one o'clock, so I had texted you. But

580
01:08:52.110 --> 01:09:08.580
Adam: I was in. It was hard because my mom is the one taking me and she works. So she's been getting off early. But every time I go somewhere to try to get their conversative kid or will x i need their social first. And when I go try to do that.

581
01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:26.700
Adam: There's always just something like because they told me I needed their shot record. So I had went to their doctor I got their shot record today. I went to Social Security office in they told me that they can't do it with their shot record that I need like their Medicaid card.

582
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:37.470
Adam: And other in their birth certificate or whatever. Okay, so that's, yeah. So I'm pretty really appealing to my main focus on to their

583
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.100
Adam: To getting this done. Okay.

584
01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I hear you, is this causing more tension with your mother.

585
01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:46.740
Adam: Yeah.

586
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's walk it back to that car again.

587
01:09:51.750 --> 01:10:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had your own car. You'd be able to go do those things, not be disrupting the consistent residence with mom could be making more money.

588
01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You could access all of these different locations, they're fine at the school are is, is it really rough with with food right now. Is that, is that really a thing where there's really truly not enough food. I mean, that might be a real thing. I don't know.

589
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:19.860
Adam: No, no, cuz I get my food stamps and then my mom.

590
01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:27.900
Adam: She always makes sure there's there's always food in the house. It's not like green dying for food or anything, but um

591
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:29.610
Adam: It's just

592
01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like the car like you need a car.

593
01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:42.570
Adam: Yeah. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's what the detective told me that I just saw right now. I actually have to just work on getting my driver production because

594
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:57.960
Adam: I only have an ID right now my driver's license. I could get like it's not suspended or anything. I just need to go down to the MVD or whatever and buy one. It was like 3025 $30 or something. Yeah.

595
01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot of money.

596
01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot of money. If you don't have 25 $30 so

597
01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:04.230
Adam: Yeah, exactly. So, um, but

598
01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:12.150
Adam: And then I don't get paid to like Wednesday and it's not gonna be like a big old checker and thing I'm only working two days so

599
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:18.510
Adam: I'm but either way. I'm going to use whatever I get on Wednesday to go get my driver's license because

600
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:31.260
Adam: That's what a detective into it, lady. They just told me to work on. If I want a car to just work on getting my driver's license to show them that I my driver's license in the then from there, they could help me.

601
01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Which day are you getting paid and going down there.

602
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:37.710
Adam: Wednesday next Wednesday. Okay, so you go

603
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll go Wednesday. Now what I don't know if you have competing demands, if you're the type of Father, that if your kid says give me this. This will help me feel happy.

604
01:11:50.190 --> 01:12:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And there goes that $35 but I don't know is if you'll do that and off goes that money that you needed for your license. I don't know you well enough to know how you're going to make sure that you get that license. There's a lot kind of connected to that licenses in there.

605
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.300
Adam: Yeah yeah

606
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything that would get in the way of you getting down there on Wednesday. Think it through, see if there's just, you can kind of predict what might get in the way.

607
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.820
Adam: Just, it gets me not.

608
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:37.110
Adam: Having somebody to watch the kids or something. But right now, but my mom. My mom has been helping me a lot, and I just know it's stressful stressful for her because there's just

609
01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:49.170
Adam: All happened. Everybody just popped into her house, for I was here and now she has worked with her grandkids here, and I know it's just, just for for her to

610
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So, look at me. Have you told her I imagine this is stressful for you got all these people in your house.

611
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to have more income, be able to be a very stable father for my children. I think the priority is getting this license. Mom, can you cover me between blankety, blank on Wednesday. Have you had that conversation.

612
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:19.680
Adam: We have not about not about Wednesday about watching the kids or anything, but

613
01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.850
Adam: We talked about having

614
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:30.510
Adam: About stress fullness and stuff about all that in

615
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't talk to her. What might happen on Wednesday.

616
01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:42.870
Adam: She's not gonna know and I'm trying to do because, well, because I'm gonna have to use your car. I'm gonna use her car to do it because you have to

617
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:50.010
Adam: All actually nevermind. No, I don't. I thought, that's when you first get a car, you have to do the test drive and all that stuff, but

618
01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:00.390
Adam: All I have to do is go down there will see anything is with getting my license. I need to get my glasses first actually because they make you do that I test or whatever.

619
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm going to add that. Okay. So how much is an eye test.

620
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.700
Adam: So that

621
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:12.930
Adam: I just been too busy. I need to call. I'm pretty sure I could get it for free because I have Medicaid or whatever.

622
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:24.810
Adam: So that's, that's another thing I had to put on top of the list is calling to make appointment to get my glasses and

623
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:36.270
Adam: Because I don't think I'm going to be able to even get my driver's license without my glasses because they make you look inside this little thing and

624
01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get it, I get it. Adam Why haven't you gotten already. Think about it. Life has gotten in the way you've had Medicaid for a while stuff has gotten in the way it will continue to get in the way. I want you to

625
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Really name it. What has gotten in the way of you getting your glasses. See if you can own what really got in the way.

626
01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:56.220
Adam: Nothing I do

627
01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there is, what is it, there's something

628
01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:08.070
Adam: Just me not doing a real deal. It's just me not calling places to make appointment.

629
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But look how earlier you had forgotten about the glasses you thought that the first step. Had to do with the DMV. Is it that you're not writing your to do list down

630
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:22.800
Adam: Yeah, probably.

631
01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A piece of paper.

632
01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it.

633
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got so much going on. How can you possibly remember everything

634
01:15:54.180 --> 01:16:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: On the back of your I'm assuming on the back of your Medicaid card, you probably have a reference there. Do you know really where to go to get that appointment.

635
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.900
Adam: Know that I just gonna have to look up different

636
01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:19.170
Adam: Spaces, because I have like in the past couple months ago I was, I did try but not hard enough, because I just call it like two places and

637
01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:30.270
Adam: They had told me that I had had to pay to for the eye exam and then the glasses are free, that the Medicare covers for the glasses, but are not paid for the eye exam.

638
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:41.340
Adam: I know before I just don't remember the place I went to what I had went before. And there are spaces that the Medicaid covers the eye exam and

639
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:48.240
Adam: And the glasses so I know there's a place here somewhere. I just need to call them. Okay.

640
01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've got

641
01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A plan and you have

642
01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Time today.

643
01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice just as well. Right. So, just as I said it.

644
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What came up for you. What was the thought as soon as I said you could make those calls that one call or three or four to get it scheduled what came up just now.

645
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:34.830
Adam: That I do have time after this session because I don't get my son till three. Okay. And I'm not really doing anything from to whoa, this is going to be over at two, so I have that little hour right quick to to do in

646
01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So notice as we were talking about IT MORE INFORMATION. STARTED TO GET uncovered. If you really look at what was getting away. I wonder why I didn't get my driver's license. It wasn't just one thing. There was a bit of stuff that needed a head of head of that.

647
01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the glasses.

648
01:17:55.590 --> 01:18:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You had forgotten about that. So why don't you do a list of things on the left will say, there'll be a shortlist over on the left side, you might say today. And then on the right is the long term list.

649
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Today it's schedule eye exam. Now, there's a lot of steps involved in that. You got to get the card flip it over, call a bunch of people got to get on that phone and say, hey, I need locations that are near here that are

650
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Covered if possible 100% under Medicaid and let me have those names and numbers and then you call them and maybe you'll get someone that's not friendly, maybe this person is busy and they're booked and then you call another place, and then another place. Okay.

651
01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to want to walk.

652
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Off that flood. Get off that phone with at least three names and numbers of eye exam places that are covered. You don't want to just get one want to have options when you leave the phone. They may say, Oh, I'm going to email you the whole list.

653
01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But that might take a long time. And since you only have a little bit of time, you might say, that would be great to have that later on in the day. But I, I only have this hour in order to get this appointment, could I possibly just over the phone have three names and numbers.

654
01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:16.920
Adam: Yeah, okay.

655
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:20.010
Adam: All right. Yeah. It's nice.

656
01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're putting into motion right this plan that you have

657
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What else can you get done today that would feel like you're putting in motion, taking care of you keeping your protecting sobriety and making sure that you're taking care of your kids. You're respecting your mother, right, because you're in her home. What else do you need to do today.

658
01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:58.560
Adam: Somewhere to cause the birth certificate, please. What to make sure to find out exactly where it is. And to make sure you can. I think it's just like $10 I need, so I need like $20 for that too.

659
01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so write that down. So you want to

660
01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The percentage of your place is a little confusing. For example, someone loses their birth certificate, they kind of know which hospital and maybe they have to go to that hospital to get a copy of it.

661
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is it that you are thinking you would go

662
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.580
Adam: Well, they had told me is some

663
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.910
Adam: I have it in my, in my other phone but it's, um,

664
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:38.550
Adam: It's someplace that's by a buyer college down here and Drake right next to it. I forget, I forget exactly what it's called but it's in my phone, but they told me to.

665
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:51.300
Adam: Call their will to go there. They told me to go there and but now that I've been trying for the last two days like my mom and get off early. And she'd been taking me to places but

666
01:20:52.020 --> 01:21:13.080
Adam: I can ever nothing ends up happening like I can never get anything done really. So what I want to do first before my mom does get up early again and takes me is make sure I call all these places before I go and make sure I have all the right paperwork and go, yeah.

667
01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's smart. Be prepared so make sure I call

668
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To be prepared.

669
01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

670
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.330
Art

671
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing I need you are so, so notice that your mom's involved in this.

672
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see if there's something even before you right thinking about that.

673

678
01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What is what's your long term. These are not things you're going to do today. These are things you're going to do over the year

686
01:22:53.100 --> 01:23:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Something else may come up that might be a goal and there might be a few steps that end up emerging that you'll need to do before that. So that's okay. So, write it down. You want it, you said you want to change the school.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, get my own place. Love it. Yeah.

696
01:23:56.850 --> 01:23:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now once you transfer children to a new school

697
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: may not want to do it a second time. If you change location. So maybe having that in your mind know where will I live if I'm going to move my children from one school to the next. It might be nice to not move them again. Once you move having that in your mind.

698
01:24:17.130 --> 01:24:17.520
Adam: Yeah.

699
01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what else I want you to think about that. She broke the window now. Now, what does it make you think about

700
01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:29.010
Adam: What

701
01:24:30.150 --> 01:24:30.690
Adam: No.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so write that down.

704
01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking about maybe the best interest of the kids. What do you think

705
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:53.250
Adam: Is just I guess going

706
01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:56.160
Adam: Going down to the court and

707
01:24:57.450 --> 01:25:01.590
Adam: And seeing about the custody thing to see if

708
01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:06.750
Adam: She has to, if we could get something where

709
01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:13.050
Adam: She is scheduled today's to see them like certain days or supervisor or something.

710
01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, write, write down what you want. You want to have court ordered

711
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Custody sort of the parenting plan court ordered so that everyone's on the same page right to have that stated, legally, who has custody. You want it to go through the courts, so that you have some leverage

712
01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:35.970
Adam: And

713
01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:44.760
Adam: Happening because she keeps on mentioning because I still have that case again to the domestic violence thing and

714
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:49.050
Adam: That's when my mom was mad at me because she

715
01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:58.710
Adam: Because I was just scared that she still has that over me and like I said I could be going to jail if she shows up in all this, though. So that's why

716
01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:15.060
Adam: I was hesitant to get like a restraining order and to like really fight against to really, but they don't even matter to me anymore. Whatever happens with that court thing happens. But right now, which is about my kids in may consider

717
01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:18.930
Adam: Yeah, yeah, some

718
01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Restraining order, then we have history of there's a restraining order against this person you have see why lefties report, and then you have pursuing your goal of wanting to have a more clear parenting plan and custody.

719
01:26:37.770 --> 01:26:40.470
Adam: Really clarified through the courts and it

720
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be easier if you have transportation your own place your own car and a steady income. Would you agree, yeah. Okay, so you can see why that list and starting to develop that it's going to help

721
01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that long term goal and you've been talking about this particular goal for some time playing with it, deciding what do I do, I'm scared. I don't know what's going to happen to me and okay but something you had an intuition. Adam, that something might happen and you were right.

722
01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there was something she she she's not making good parenting decisions. She put her children at risk. So now, children and you haven't mentioned this, but children that are touched in appropriately.

723
01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: There's professionals that know how to mitigate the harm of what that does, psychologically, so the sooner you can get professional help for your, your kids.

724
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:52.170
Adam: The better actually right now at 430 my older son has a counseling thing with them with USD that take them to

725
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, fantastic.

726
01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The sooner the better. Hopefully it's a good one, Adam.

727
01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your gut. Not everyone

728
01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everyone is the best that they can be not everyone's that great clinician not everyone's the best

729
01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That your family deserves. Pay attention to your gut, your gut was right about what was going on over it at her house. If you think that this particular provider or whoever is off. Something's not right. Pay attention to it. Okay, it matters.

730
01:28:30.630 --> 01:28:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: They need you to protect them. They probably had some register along the way that something was off and they couldn't say anything could do anything about it. So we as adults need to

731
01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Model, the ability to pay attention to our intuition or gut feeling about so and so I'm can't even say what it is. Okay, so you're going to do that. Pay attention to this provider. Just because someone has power and authority.

732
01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that that doesn't mean that they're going to be good care givers. That doesn't mean they're going to do the right thing. So pay attention.

733
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.450
Adam: All right, yeah.

734
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want your kids to be hurt again.

735
01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:14.790
Adam: Yeah, I know.

736
01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:16.740
Adam: The main thing.

737
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Counselors in advertisement Lee will make children talk, long before it's appropriate.

738
01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:28.110
Adam: Yeah.

739
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can still be healing from something without having to retell the story. The re traumatized. So just, you can be asking the clinician. So what's your, what's your treatment approach in and how to support my son. You can ask

740
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:43.860
Adam: Yeah.

741
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a right to ask and understand

742
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because little ones are confused about it. And so you may want to understand and then of course you could look it up. You could research, is this the best thing for such and such and such.

743
01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And more than welcome to talk to me about it, but at least you're empowered. Don't assume just because people have these credentials that you don't have any rights to ask them questions and find out what their what their plot with the treatment plan is okay.

744
01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:10.650
Adam: Yeah.

745
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, good. All right. So are you feeling a little bit more organized on what to do next.

746
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:19.860
Adam: Yeah a lot

747
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.120
Adam: But

748
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because what was coming at you, was just all these loose ends, but the reality is you know what you have, you have this love for your kids.

749
01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you knew all along. Something wasn't wasn't quite right and you wanted to have them and it looks like it's going to happen.

750
01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already got them in treatment to get some support through this and we just need to get you right in this sort of, I'm in my mature accountable. No more excuses adult role and Adam I know it's scary.

754
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:12.240
Adam: And in this is

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:24.600
