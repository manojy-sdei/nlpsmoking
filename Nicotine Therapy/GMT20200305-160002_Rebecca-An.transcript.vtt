00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.000
Jessica Freeman: I'm busy.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.220
Jessica Freeman: I haven't saved. Oh, like

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.030
Jessica Freeman: It's just been this persistent feeling of loneliness. I went to a conference like our real estate.

13
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.940
Jessica Freeman: Conference, but you know, I'm new to this industry. I'm new to this town. I don't know anybody

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:10.890
Jessica Freeman: And you know there were lots of people from my office there, but I don't, I don't really know them either. You know, I'm brand new at this place and it felt like the high school cafeteria, like where am I sit, how am I, you know, it's just

15
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:32.610
Jessica Freeman: You know I'm always bitching because I never have an opportunity to go anywhere. Immediately, buddy. So I, you know, took the initiative. No, I made my I made sure I look nice. I was there early, you know, I tried to interact with people and it I just felt stupid and lonely so

16
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's going to take a while to get

17
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: acclimated into a new place with new people understand their style of doing things. And, you know, let them get to know you a little bit. It does take time. How long have you been how long ago to do move here.

18
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.270
Jessica Freeman: I got here on Christmas Eve.

19
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's gonna take a little bit of time.

20
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.710
Jessica Freeman: I know but

21
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just

22
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:15.930
Jessica Freeman: I'm really glad to be able to go back to Indianapolis. This weekend and get some love. We're leaving tomorrow morning and got my suitcase out. Got the laundry done. And I don't just have to like prepare myself for the trip you know I gotta prepare people to take care of my son, which that's

23
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of

24
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.380
Jessica Freeman: A big deal and my dog and they both, you know, they only love me like they only want me so it's going to be referenced everybody

25
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but they'll acclimate to and the more the more that you're getting out in your, you know, getting to know people in the area. The more that you are

26
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:47.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Starting to socialize, they'll get used to it to you have to remember to that not only are they dealing with their uncomfortable ability, but also yours too. They feel it.

27
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

28
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.860
Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's everything's gonna be okay. It just takes time.

30
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.420
Jessica Freeman: I know, I know.

31
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.590
Jessica Freeman: I know, I know, but

32
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.810
Jessica Freeman: It just sucks right now.

33
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.740
I know

34
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know it probably took me about

35
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Four or five, six months to get acclimated when I moved to it took a while.

36
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:24.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you have your own routine. You have your own group of people. You have your own life going on and then you totally uproot moved to a new place, and it just takes time.

37
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.750
Yeah.

38
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.410
Jessica Freeman: I just, you know, I'm when I was planning this move. I thought surely you know it would happen quicker.

39
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.480
Jessica Freeman: I set an expectation we know how dangerous. Those are

40
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:49.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah definitely no expectations to any outcomes at all because it's always how it's supposed to be not how we want it to be.

41
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

42
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.900
Jessica Freeman: Yeah. Also, you know, I don't know if I'm ever gonna have the

43
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.060
Jessica Freeman: Like the

44
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:09.330
Jessica Freeman: The full time go get them attitude that I would need and commitment to be a realtor

45
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.950
Jessica Freeman: On

46
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:20.250
Jessica Freeman: The resilience. You need to be in sales. I'm not sure that have that. And I went to this conference, and I learned a lot.

47
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:34.590
Jessica Freeman: And you know I'm learning. I'm watching all these people around me that are realtors like this is what I said I wanted to do. So I'm learning all about it and I don't know if that's really what I want to do. But one of the breakout sessions was

48
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:45.300
Jessica Freeman: It was about like branding and marketing and I did some of that at my last job, and I loved it and I got real excited and real passionate about that.

49
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:56.700
Jessica Freeman: I don't think I'm real passionate or excited about selling houses. And I don't think that I have, you know, 80 hours a week to commit to a career like that.

50
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:06.630
Jessica Freeman: And emotionally like that. You got to be all in that was actually the theme of the conferences ALL IN. I DON'T HAVE ALL IN FOR THAT I got all in for my kid.

51
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.820
Jessica Freeman: And I got all in for, you know,

52
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.830
Jessica Freeman: dabbling in some other things.

53
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.440
Jessica Freeman: Wish I could just work for myself.

54
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What would you do

55
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.080
Jessica Freeman: Web development and like social media marketing.

56
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe look into.

57
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.550
Jessica Freeman: I'm not qualified, I'd have to go back to school.

58
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What would that take

59
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:49.890
Jessica Freeman: Well, I just started the process like in the past week to get my student loans out of default and the main motivation for that was so they can keep my 50 $600 tax refund.

60
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.640
You

61
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.920
Jessica Freeman: But

62
00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:03.600
Jessica Freeman: You know, of course. Okay, so three months from now, my student loans will be our default. And then I would have to, like, you know, apply for more not big on on that.

63
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.240
Jessica Freeman: But I don't know. I mean, I guess if I were going to be in business for myself the credentials wouldn't so much matter as the work product.

64
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.970
Jessica Freeman: And there's a place called. It's a website called Code Academy

65
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.580
Jessica Freeman: Which I've done before, but

66
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:32.460
Jessica Freeman: I don't know. I would really need the time to be able to commit to putting together a portfolio and like a good work product. And that's what I don't have right now is the time.

67
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:41.370
Jessica Freeman: Or the, you know, because I'm working all day and you know my brain is like full even five hours and there for five hours a day and

68
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.870
Jessica Freeman: I

69
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:55.590
Jessica Freeman: And then my son. And, you know, and I'm not the kind of I don't I don't I try not to make excuses anymore because I did that for so much of my life and I you know I have a hard time accepting other people's excuses. Now because

70
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:09.810
Jessica Freeman: I'm a reformed excuse maker, but I don't know, I just, I know myself and I know what I have, as far as like resources inner resources and

71
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.320
Jessica Freeman: And I think I would need to not work to be able to learn

72
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

73
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.730
Jessica Freeman: What I need to learn to be able to work for myself.

74
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.450
Right.

75
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right so finding

76
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe just exploring the options and seeing what it would take. And, you know, looking at the amount of money you would make if you did do it versus not doing it.

77
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:46.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there's all those what ifs or questions, you know, around, around that piece to, you know, you might find that that financially, it might be worth it for you to

78
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, be able to live off financially for a little bit and just devote to school or you might find that it's not you know feasible.

79
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You won't know till you gather all the facts.

80
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:08.550
Jessica Freeman: And with like web development and online stuff. I don't, I can do that from anywhere, and I still have actually I know people all over the country.

81
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:17.910
Jessica Freeman: So I do feel like my sphere of influence could could get me some some decent clientele.

82
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:27.210
Jessica Freeman: But yeah, it's something I would have to talk to my mom and Bob about because I'm so like my finances are

83
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:36.480
Jessica Freeman: Very attached to them right now. They do like Bob is the one that did my taxes so he knows what my refund is going to be

84
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:49.170
Jessica Freeman: And I think that they feel a lot more comfortable with the situation, knowing that I'm going to get that amount of money to be a cushion and to also, you know, keep up with with what I owe them.

85
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.320
Jessica Freeman: So they might be open to it.

86
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.460
Mm hmm.

87
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Won't know till you try

88
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:03.810
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, well, my spending the next three days together, same hotel room, same rental car.

89
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.230
I mean,

90
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.440
Jessica Freeman: I'm just, you know, preparing for

91
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.110
Jessica Freeman: Like, I know there's it she's sick, too, which is the worst. I just talked to her this morning.

92
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:22.470
Jessica Freeman: Actually, it's kind of pissed me off the last night. I'm going to bed and I get a text message from Bob's daughter in law Kelly.

93
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:31.740
Jessica Freeman: nice girl, but she had, like, I'm an Earthship from her since Christmas, and I've, you know, been here in Albuquerque. This whole time and I'm internship, whatever. So she sends me this text, and she's like,

94
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:42.540
Jessica Freeman: Oh, I just really wanted to, you know, see if you have any tips or instructions on how to take care of key in on Saturday. And I'm like,

95
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.950
Jessica Freeman: I didn't even know that Keon was going to your house.

96
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.730
Jessica Freeman: So I texted my mom and I said, Have you made any other plans for my son, while I'm gone. And I don't know about.

97
00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:08.640
Jessica Freeman: And she's sick. She's like our way to the doctor and she feels like hell. And I'm like, Mom, we're flying and like 23 hours. This is not good timing. So she's going to be cranky skating in our own world. Not going to feel good.

98
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.110
Jessica Freeman: Which

99
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.920
Jessica Freeman: Like it wasn't bad enough if she was just normal

100
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.280
Jessica Freeman: Am I making any sense.

101
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.690
Jessica Freeman: Uh huh. Okay.

102
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so.

103
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think you got to focus, you know, on the prize and that is spending time with your son and being able to have some peace and at the same time, you know, have empathy for your mom if she's not feeling good.

104
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.560
Jessica Freeman: Oh,

105
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:54.150
Jessica Freeman: I mean, it's just that she's and I don't know how much we've talked about my mom, but she has no emotional regulation skills. She projects her emotions, whatever she's going through. She projects it around her.

106
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.500
Jessica Freeman: Just she can get real nasty.

107
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When

108
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.900
Jessica Freeman: I didn't even do anything or, you know,

109
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:07.110
Jessica Freeman: The person that she's talking to and projecting on didn't do a damn thing. And she's just nasty because that's how she feels

110
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.560
Jessica Freeman: Mean, which kind of wears on me.

111
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.490
Sure.

112
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you've been dealing with it. Your whole life.

113
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have

114
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:27.270
Jessica Freeman: But I didn't really recognize what she was doing because I was doing it to for so long. And now I know how to not be that way. And it's, it's just exhausting.

115
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:36.750
Jessica Freeman: And I am going to worry about key and the whole time that I'm gone, I'm going to worry about my dog because he's old and he doesn't respond to anybody but me.

116
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:50.940
Jessica Freeman: I'm going to worry pull time and then I'm also going to be worrying about like dynamics Brendan, am I paying him enough attention because I've made plans with my friends like I plan to see my friends while I'm there because I need it.

117
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.580
Jessica Freeman: We mean so I don't want to like

118
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:11.310
Jessica Freeman: Short change Brendan, because this whole trip is like, it's about him. And I told her, I'm coming to see you. It's all about you being there for you, supporting you, with your robotic stuff and with your birthday celebrating you. That's the purpose of this trip and it is

119
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.200
Jessica Freeman: But personally, you know, on a side level like I miss

120
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.580
Jessica Freeman: My friends, I need to see them. I need some love right now.

121
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:32.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, remember that self care is really important and being able to get that time, you know, with your friends and your support system is just as important. It has to be

122
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.000
Jessica Freeman: I'm going to pick up my two year token on Saturday.

123
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Night.

124
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.080
Jessica Freeman: And then some friends are going to be there to support me

125
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sounds like it's gonna be fun.

126
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:43.740
Yeah.

127
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:57.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. Yeah, don't, don't be stuck in the Guild part of it all. I mean, you give your son, you know, 100% when you're with him and you give your sobriety and your friends and your support system 100% when you're with them, you know,

128
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It will make you hopefully feel better.

129
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And a lot stronger to come back and face.

130
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where you're at over here, you know,

131
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:15.990
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, that's definitely what I'm hoping for. And it's just

132
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:33.990
Jessica Freeman: I'm just, you know, adding mom being sick and all of that. It's just, that's an that's a source of worry that I didn't have before that. Now, I do. So I was emotionally preparing myself mentally preparing myself to be really tolerant.

133
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.050
Jessica Freeman: Patient and

134
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.290
Jessica Freeman: Not take it personally. You know, just meet her where she is.

135
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:43.980
Yeah.

136
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:53.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so she's going to be spending time with you with your son, but she's not going to be spending time with you and your with your friends.

137
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Correct. Right.

138
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, which will give you some time, you know,

139
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.420
Yeah.

140
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you guys live together to on top of it all. So you guys need that time. No.

141
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.500
Jessica Freeman: I live with my mom I live with my little boy and my dog in a house.

142
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.850
Jessica Freeman: Or she actually Bob and I guess now they own it together.

143
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, no.

144
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.500
Jessica Freeman: My mom and I could never live together. Yeah.

145
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get that. Very much so.

146
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not just got it.

147
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:27.420
Jessica Freeman: And

148
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:34.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was gonna say you just gotta focus on you know why you're there and you know really hone in on that piece.

149
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stay out of guilt. Stay out of, you know, the what ifs. Stay out of all of it and just take one step at a time. While you're there as freedom and as something that's sorely needed right now.

150
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

151
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely your, you know, your baby's going to be fine.

152
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's gonna be tough.

153
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But he's going to be fine. It's not like you leaving for a week or a month you're leaving four hours.

154
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.210
Jessica Freeman: Well,

155
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:19.710
Jessica Freeman: For a few days like we're leaving first thing tomorrow morning, and we'll get back late on Sunday. And then he'll go right back to school on Monday. So we won't have any real time together. It's, you know, he needs that

156
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you'll get all week and he'll get next weekend and he'll get from from you. Getting back forward right

157
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.190
Yeah.

158
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have to remember that, too.

159
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.870
Jessica Freeman: So usually if I was going to leave my kid was somebody when I was going out of town. It would be my mom.

160
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.060
Jessica Freeman: Or his paternal grandmother in Michigan, I trust her.

161
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.150
Jessica Freeman: I just don't know how it's going to go with Bob, I just don't know how it's good. Go.

162
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.620
Jessica Freeman: I guess I have no control over that you

163
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, and you might be surprised, and it might go. Awesome.

164
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:06.120
Jessica Freeman: Like don't like the fact that they're making plans for him that I don't know about. I don't like that.

165
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:16.770
Jessica Freeman: And I'm sure that will my mom and I will discuss it later today. She's picking him up from school today and I'm working till four so she'll be here when I get home.

166
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.100
Jessica Freeman: And we'll talk about it, but I am I don't like that.

167
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.370
Jessica Freeman: I don't like that when anybody does that

168
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.240
Like

169
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:36.180
Jessica Freeman: In order for me to prepare you to deal with him. I need to know what kind of situations, you're going to be going into

170
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.150
Jessica Freeman: You know, go into the sensory gym.

171
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:44.520
Jessica Freeman: I can give you a list of instructions on that. Okay. If you're gonna, you know, be at home.

172
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:57.120
Jessica Freeman: I definitely have a good list of instructions for that. Are you going to go to the grocery store instructions for the urine mean bio Park, whatever, just tell me where you plan on taking him so that I can prepare you

173
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.350
Jessica Freeman: And that'll make me feel better because then he'll get what he needs.

174
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:01.890
Yeah.

175
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes perfect sense.

176
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:16.860
Jessica Freeman: It feels disrespectful or no, but I'm not going to take it personally. I'm just telling you. That's how I feel. And when I speak with mom and Bob later I will express

177
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:25.170
Jessica Freeman: Politely just as I did to you, you know, like this is why I want to know. So that so that key and we'll get everything he needs.

178
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you have the right to know. Yeah.

179
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.770
Jessica Freeman: I don't like still like that don't make plans for my kid. Well, I'm gone. I don't know about. Yeah.

180
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:44.670
Jessica Freeman: If it was a typical kid that's one thing, whatever, you know, typical kids are going to do typical things and typical people can handle it. Um, but, you know,

181
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.320
Jessica Freeman: He's not

182
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.280
Jessica Freeman: He's very severely autistic and he has a lot of needs.

183
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Makes sense.

184
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:58.920
Jessica Freeman: And they kind of fell down on the job. The other day, man. They watched him for like an hour and a half, so that I could go to a meeting.

185
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:18.630
Jessica Freeman: Hour and a half later, I get home and he's got like dried crusted poop all over his whole bottom area and they haven't paid attention to this and he gets really bad rashes, you know, it's not okay. And I had to take them directly and put them in the tub and meditate, hour and a half, okay.

186
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:27.600
Jessica Freeman: makes me nervous. I'm going to worry about him the whole time I'm sure he'll be alive. He'll be alive.

187
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.030
Jessica Freeman: And well, but

188
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:42.870
Jessica Freeman: He's the one that suffers and he can't tell. He can't say no, Grandpa, Bob, I need you to do this or this is how I'm feeling or I'm you know this hurts, he, he can't. He can't communicate

189
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:43.890
Right.

190
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which makes it tougher. How old is he again.

191
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Five. Yeah, yeah, whatever.

192
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:51.900
Yeah.

193
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.890
Jessica Freeman: Cognitively apparently he's less than two years old, his recent testing.

194
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.540
Jessica Freeman: Said that, but I also don't feel like they got the real key and

195
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean,

196
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.340
Jessica Freeman: I think you need to spend some real time with them to really get a handle on who he is and what he can and can't do,

197
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.890
Jessica Freeman: Right, but it is what it is.

198
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.540
Jessica Freeman: I wasn't very happy with that assessment.

199
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:25.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't blame you. I wouldn't be either at all because you do know I'm better than anybody else, you know,

200
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:26.970
Yeah.

201
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:29.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

202
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that you're probably right. You know, they see him one time have you know do all these tests on them. And the person that you see is something completely different.

203
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:49.920
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it also I'm like reading about what they did to prompt him. And I'm like, well, that's not the way to get him to do anything, you know,

204
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.230
Jessica Freeman: I'm the way to get them to cover is yours and run away from you. That's, that's what he'll do

205
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:56.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

206
00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:06.120
Jessica Freeman: You know I'm mom. It is. It just is what it is like, I can't do anything about it, but it's good because he'll get all the services that he needs. I'm

207
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:16.080
Jessica Freeman: Still don't have an IEP meeting setup. They just, I started this process in January and it's March. Now it's really frustrating.

208
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.910
Jessica Freeman: Wow. Yeah.

209
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And he still doesn't have an IEP.

210
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:33.660
Jessica Freeman: He has an old, outdated IEP from 2017 and then he's undergone all these evaluations and I've had all the like the post evaluation meetings like we went over his MIT.

211
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:44.040
Jessica Freeman: And we're supposed to have an IEP meeting so he'll have a new updated IP so he can get his new update and services, you know, three years later.

212
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.990
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, so

213
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:53.610
Jessica Freeman: I don't even. I think you might be getting an hour of services. A week right now and he needs a lot more than that.

214
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.330
Yeah.

215
00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much so. Any appointment set yet or

216
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:10.020
Jessica Freeman: I emailed the team because I know we're supposed to hear back. I didn't hear back. So I emailed the team and I initiated it and

217
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:17.730
Jessica Freeman: There's been a little bit on the email chain like Georgia O'Keeffe school somehow got involved and I was like he doesn't

218
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:32.220
Jessica Freeman: I don't think you need to be involved because he goes to coral charter and he's getting tested through APS at the special education complex and then the IEP meeting is it didn't Chavez Elementary. So I'm not sure where that's coming from anyway. It's a cluster. It's a cluster.

219
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.020
Jessica Freeman: And I'm the one that has to like follow up because I don't have quite enough going on in my life.

220
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.770
Right.

221
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

222
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, which is frustrating.

223
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.020
Jessica Freeman: I am I'm frustrated

224
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.020
Jessica Freeman: I'm frustrated and I'm lonely.

225
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What are you gonna do about the lonely part

226
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.860
Indianapolis.

227
00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.290
Jessica Freeman: It's going to help

228
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It what it is going to help

229
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you get back

230
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:03.990
Jessica Freeman: When I get back.

231
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:15.570
Jessica Freeman: Hopefully my cup will be full and I can go a little while longer before I start feeling like this again.

232
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:26.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What. How have things been going since you've been going to meetings. Have you made friends have you acclimated into the community. So, you know,

233
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:39.300
Jessica Freeman: Well, early on I made one friend who we never actually hung out but she asked me to give a lead at her home group. So I did that. And I haven't heard from her sense so

234
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:46.500
Jessica Freeman: I did make a friend at work. But then she's moving to Oklahoma. So that's great.

235
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.120
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I think that's about it.

236
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:52.050
Yeah.

237
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, give yourself a little more time.

238
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you putting yourself out there.

239
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be approachable whenever you go to meetings or

240
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or do you stay guarded

241
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:19.230
Jessica Freeman: I would say 70% guarded 30% open. It depends on you know how much time. Can I spend, you know, can I get there early and talk to people.

242
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:28.320
Jessica Freeman: I don't know, I haven't met my demographic. I'm not seeing my peer group in terms

243
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:48.510
Jessica Freeman: And that was something even the women's meetings like back in Indianapolis. I had this women's meaning that I would go to and have like 50 or 60 women. Everybody knew each other. Everybody was super supportive and that meeting fed me every Saturday morning, and here I can't, I can't find

244
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.690
Jessica Freeman: You know my playground buddies.

245
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:52.440
Yeah.

246
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.650
Jessica Freeman: I haven't found them yet.

247
00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:57.270
Jessica Freeman: So,

248
00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yet

249
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:09.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just keep that it will happen. Just keep that yet in your mind. Don't be, you know, stay open to it and you know

250
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:18.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely the people that you will surround yourself with in New Mexico is going to be different than where you came from.

251
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.820
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I know.

252
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.000
Jessica Freeman: I have to like it.

253
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:35.700
Jessica Freeman: You know, I'll stay the course. Like, I'm sure good things will happen. Like I have faith, okay God brought me here. He wants me here. There's a reason. Don't know what it is.

254
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.020
Jessica Freeman: But I know that I have to do the work you know

255
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:40.980
Yeah.

256
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:59.760
Jessica Freeman: So I talked to my sponsor last night, and we're going to get together when I get back. And she's really cool like I try not to be friends with sponsors ease and sponsors but then there's a relationship that grows. And that's, that's good. It's going well with my Albuquerque sponsor.

257
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.460
Jessica Freeman: But I wouldn't like call her to go hang out or anything.

258
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.420
Mm hmm.

259
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:15.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's nobody that you've met and in the server community that you would want to go have coffee with or

260
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.280
Jessica Freeman: Not yet. No.

261
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.290
Jessica Freeman: And there's, I mean a bunch of blue hairs and then

262
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.190
Jessica Freeman: You know, it's more culturally diverse here.

263
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

264
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.740
Jessica Freeman: I'm just not. I'm not comfortable and I'm sure a lot of it is me and I just need to get over it, but

265
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.210
Jessica Freeman: I don't know.

266
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:50.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's probably a piece of it. You know, I think you're looking for something that you've already got in Indianapolis and you want it to be the same because

267
00:25:51.270 --> 00:26:00.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what that gives you. You know how good you feel when after you're done with that, but when you come to a new state you come to a new culture.

268
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You come to, you know, new people, they're not going to be the same. They're going to be different.

269
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.070
Jessica Freeman: I'm good with different

270
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

271
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.200
Jessica Freeman: I'm just not good with nothing.

272
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me what are blue hairs.

273
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.250
Jessica Freeman: All people

274
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:15.120
Oh,

275
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:27.870
Jessica Freeman: I guess we could call him. What's the word right now. Oh Boomer yeah boomers.

276
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right. Gotcha. Maybe you just need to expand your

277
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Expand what meetings, you go to

278
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.050
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, look.

279
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.240
Jessica Freeman: Trying to go to like women's meetings and I keep running into the same issue with women's meetings.

280
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.290
Jessica Freeman: Like everybody's pretty old.

281
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:57.840
Jessica Freeman: But then, I don't know, do they even have a young people's group in Albuquerque. I don't know, but I'm 40 years old, but I don't necessarily feel

282
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.850
Jessica Freeman: Attracted to the young people screw, Peter. Where are my people were

283
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.250
Jessica Freeman: People like me who are moms and

284
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:18.360
Jessica Freeman: You know, work and struggle and you know that cup of coffee is a big deal like where are those people I need those people. So yeah, I mean branch out to different meetings and

285
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:24.450
Jessica Freeman: I mean, I've tried that I have. But maybe you need to double down on my efforts.

286
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and maybe think outside the box a little bit, maybe, you know, I'm looking into support groups with

287
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For parents of kids with autism.

288
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:46.860
Jessica Freeman: And while I'm I'm involved in some Facebook groups. And every now and again, they'll have an event. So I'm definitely keeping my eye open for like a mom's night out.

289
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good.

290
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good.

291
00:27:53.100 --> 00:28:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm trying to think of other kinds. There's i know i i pulled up online. The other day emotion. There's something called emotion meeting.

292
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which I've never heard of, but it's about dealing with, you know, your emotions and it's a support group to just like a na

293
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which I was kind of blown away and new type of meeting that I've never heard of before.

294
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:31.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it definitely sounded interesting, because we all struggle with emotion regulation and with the emotions and you know how to get through the tough ones and all of that stuff.

295
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:38.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would definitely research it and see what's all in your area and what your options are, you know,

296
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.050
Jessica Freeman: I will do that.

297
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.580
Jessica Freeman: And definitely

298
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:54.360
Jessica Freeman: We're down the women for recovery thing haven't had a chance to look into it honestly that I will be on a plane for many, many hours tomorrow and

299
00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:02.520
Jessica Freeman: Then the affirmations. So I ended up ordering this little

300
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:13.740
Jessica Freeman: It's like 50 self affirmation cards and you know I went through and I looked at a lot of different products and I thought this one was pretty cool. And then it would be good for me.

301
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.570
Jessica Freeman: Mm hmm. It'll be here on Saturday, which means I will get it Sunday night.

302
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:19.410
And I know

303
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.530
Jessica Freeman: So yeah, I am trying to like implement the stuff that we talked about.

304
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:33.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. It's important you know that you do. What about any kind of

305
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:46.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you do for relaxation, such as do you meditate. Do you listen to TED talk, do you, what do you do for for that type of stuff. Well,

306
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:54.450
Jessica Freeman: I have a radio show from Indianapolis, but I've been addicted to for years and I listened to them pretty much every day and I listened to the podcast.

307
00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:05.610
Jessica Freeman: And then I also subscribe to like the podcast network which is podcasts of different variety, like I just finished one on

308
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:20.940
Jessica Freeman: Espionage, and there's one for like female criminals crimes of passion dictators, you know, just kind of going over the history of those people and then like their demise, or whatever.

309
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.630
Jessica Freeman: Yeah.

310
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:26.790
Jessica Freeman: So I enjoy that. And I listen I listen to podcasts quite a bit. I mean, every day really

311
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:27.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

312
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:43.950
Jessica Freeman: And I do watch TV. I had sometimes all the true crime gets a little heavy. So I took. I have a break from from that for a couple weeks and I watched once upon a time. I don't know if you've seen that

313
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

314
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:55.980
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's a cute show but you know just stupid fairy tale shed and happily ever afters and just kind of enjoyed a break from all the heavy

315
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:56.340
Yeah.

316
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.490
Jessica Freeman: But that's over now. And so now I'm back into what I watched Narcos Mexico.

317
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.610
Jessica Freeman: What are watching right now. I watched the trials of Gabriel Fernandez

318
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.950
Jessica Freeman: Really light readings are like watching

319
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.700
Jessica Freeman: Stuff, but

320
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:19.860
Jessica Freeman: I don't know.

321
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's your interest, though.

322
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.600
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, I do. I mean I it's it's it's interesting, but I also like

323
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.430
Jessica Freeman: Lighter stuff.

324
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:39.570
Jessica Freeman: It's just my feet is always suggesting new shows. And I'm like, ooh, that's really interesting. You know, it's horrible and devastating.

325
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:46.680
Jessica Freeman: And graphic. Oh my god. Okay, so I hate shows like

326
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:57.060
Jessica Freeman: Like Real Housewives. And like the Bachelorette. And I don't want, I haven't watched haven't had cable TV's since 2007 and I don't miss

327
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.330
Jessica Freeman: It.

328
00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.800
Jessica Freeman: Like I'm in Netflix.

329
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:06.150
Jessica Freeman: You know prime Hulu Disney plus Apple TV. Plus, like, you name it. I've got the streaming service.

330
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:12.180
Jessica Freeman: So that's my bag, rather than cable and so I don't watch that Bachelorette shit. I just don't

331
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:18.180
Jessica Freeman: And I have it for years. But Netflix, just put one up. Love is blind, have you seen it.

332
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I saw the preview of it, but I haven't

333
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:34.620
Jessica Freeman: Okay. It is not my cup of tea, like this is never a show that I would choose to sit down and like spend, you know, 45 minutes per episode of my life on but I'm watching it.

334
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:45.900
Jessica Freeman: I don't know why I just, I heard about it on my radio program. I was like, Okay, I'm gonna watch it. So I had this dream last night, me and my vivid fucking dreams.

335
00:32:48.150 --> 00:33:00.330
Jessica Freeman: Like I was one of the participants in the show and I had like three dudes that were in love with me and wanted to propose me and it was like so far from reality so stupid. Not my style at all. I have to stop watching it.

336
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

337
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.060
Jessica Freeman: That's my dream.

338
00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because it connects with the loneliness part

339
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you're lonely right now.

340
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that really kind of affects that

341
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, one thing that we as humans want is to feel and be loved.

342
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:27.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and when we don't have that. And we're struggling with loneliness. It makes sense that your subconscious has attached itself to

343
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:40.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that type of show because who wouldn't want to be you know adored by three by three men, you know, makes perfect sense. Really, and it's okay because it attaches to that inner need

344
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.610
Jessica Freeman: Nothing. Oh, and I'm like yelling at the TV.

345
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.550
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, this is never gonna work.

346
00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:49.770
Jessica Freeman: You don't know each other like

347
00:33:49.830 --> 00:34:00.810
Jessica Freeman: You didn't ask the questions to get to know each other. You guys are just like flirting and, you know, now it's gotten to the sexual point and it's like you're all idiots. None of these relationships are going to work.

348
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:10.710
Jessica Freeman: And then I'm then it then it puts me down. The, the, you know, the rabbit hole on well I'm 40 years old, like

349
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.210
Jessica Freeman: It's probably over for me.

350
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:30.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know that there there have been people that have found love in their 50s in their 60s. And you know what I mean, right now I think you've been taking time for you. You just moved to a new state.

351
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You are trying to get acclimated acclimated into a new community trying to build. I mean, you have a lot on your plate right now, you know,

352
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there's that that guard that's up to

353
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:59.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So once you get comfortable and you get acclimated in in your new surroundings and you're building your sober support it will come at the right time, I fully believe that it will come at the right time right now. It's just not the right time.

354
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.080
Jessica Freeman: Definitely not the right time.

355
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:01.800
You know,

356
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What would you do with it. If a man walked in your life right now.

357
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.920
Jessica Freeman: I don't know i i feel like i would

358
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.930
Jessica Freeman: Push them right out.

359
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:13.710
Yeah.

360
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

361
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've got a lot

362
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.790
Jessica Freeman: Yep. I think that's exactly what I would do. And I don't want to do that. No.

363
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.580
Jessica Freeman: But that's, that's what I would do.

364
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so the reality of it is, is that yes, you're lonely and you're dealing with the loneliness. But right now is is is not an awkward, you know, a good time for you to

365
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Engage in in a relationship or, you know, that type of stuff. When you get more settled and you get to a point where you're comfortable your guard goes down.

366
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:55.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People feel that. And that's when you that's when somebody will walk into your life that you've just got to give yourself time, you know,

367
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.850
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, you're right.

368
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:06.180
Jessica Freeman: That makes sense. I've actually been toying with the idea of like online dating, but you just asked me that question and yeah

369
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.730
Jessica Freeman: I don't need to date right now.

370
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:10.770
Yeah.

371
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.620
Jessica Freeman: I really am miss the drama of dating. I really, really don't

372
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:26.250
Jessica Freeman: So I'm good with it. And honestly, the loneliness is more about like just people not love per se, just like relationships friendships.

373
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:39.690
Jessica Freeman: People that care about me somebody that knows me, anybody here that we just like have taken the time to get to know who I am and vice versa. Like, that's what I want.

374
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.360
Jessica Freeman: I don't need no boyfriend.

375
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need domain.

376
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.190
Jessica Freeman: It's true.

377
00:36:49.740 --> 00:37:05.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to take it easy. And remember, through your trip, you know, over the weekend breed. When you feel you know that you're getting frustrated with being how things are going with your mom just step back and breathe, you know, give yourself that that time.

378
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to do it. You know, you're going to have a field weekend.

379
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:24.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it's going to be exciting. And it's going to be fun and you're, you know, you're going to touch on happiness that you haven't felt for a little while and just live in that moment, man. Just enjoy it, you know, love on your friends.

380
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.160
Jessica Freeman: You know,

381
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Turn love on your son love on yourself.

382
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:47.100
Jessica Freeman: You know, I have been on like the brink of tears and I hate crying like every day. I'm finding one or two moments where I'm like, almost about to cry. And sometimes it's over dumb shit like a TV commercial or, you know,

383
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.680
Jessica Freeman: Just don't dump something dumb, but

384
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:55.080
Jessica Freeman: Just, I find myself right at the brink of tears like multiple times a day.

385
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you know you're in, you're out of your comfort zone. You're out of you know what you know you are far away from the people that you know support you.

386
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:26.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know what, you know, and you're trying to get acclimated and a whole news environment whole new system, trying to figure people out and I know from moving. I moved from Oregon to California. People are different in California versus who I was with an Oregon. You know what I

387
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:26.490
Jessica Freeman: Mean

388
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:27.180
Oh, yeah.

389
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like yeah

390
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:39.300
Jessica Freeman: Great, though. I mean, like, it seems like everybody's really, you know, laid back and easy to talk to. Very friendly polite and then the tailgating

391
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.680
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, there's some serious tailgating in the city. I don't get it.

392
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.490
Jessica Freeman: Like, we're not going to get there any faster with you on my ass. There's like 70 cars in front of me.

393
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.280
Jessica Freeman: To getting dangerous.

394
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.980
Jessica Freeman: But anyway.

395
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:03.690
Jessica Freeman: Yeah seem really nice here, there is the cultural difference though. I mean, I'm skinny Midwestern WHITE BITCH. That's me.

396
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:10.980
Jessica Freeman: I don't know that much about Native American and Latino cultures. I don't believe in English.

397
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.350
Jessica Freeman: It's, I don't know, it's just a lot different.

398
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:33.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is a lot different. And the more that you, the longer that you're there, the more you'll get acclimated, the more you'll understand Learn to learn about these other cultures. You know what I mean, and be able to partake in whatever. One thing that I know about

399
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About Latino and Hispanic cultures is that they are. They have big huge families.

400
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:46.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And their Picnics are out of this world, because it's just huge. And a lot of people

401
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:59.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But once you find, you know that that system and you acclimate into it. You'll fit right in. You will just gotta give yourself a little bit more time.

402
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:02.790
You know,

403
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.750
Jessica Freeman: But in the meantime, indie

404
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.760
Jessica Freeman: Be so excited to go back to Indianapolis.

405
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because you you're recognizing all the good that you did have there. You know what I mean.

406
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.880
Jessica Freeman: And I did take the time

407
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:38.220
Jessica Freeman: Before I left to like recognize what I had there and make the choice to walk away from it knowing what that would mean because in the last three, four or five years. That's when I've learned how to be a you know worker among workers, you know, one of many

408
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.800
Jessica Freeman: For a good friend.

409
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:52.770
Jessica Freeman: You know, sister, all that. So I know, I know what I had there and I don't ever want to take it for granted. So I'm just going to go

410
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.810
Jessica Freeman: Love the love.

411
00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and that's going to help you feel better to, you know, yeah.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:18.300

416
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:52.500

441
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.800
Jessica Freeman: I don't know how many teenage sons are thinking about their mom's birthday. First thing in the morning, but that

442
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:57.900
Jessica Freeman: meant a lot to me. And then my little, little boy climbed in bed with me. So before my feet even hit the floor on my 40th birthday. I was up in the clouds.

443
00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.070

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.820
Jessica Freeman: I can do it. I don't know how, but I will

451
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.730
Jessica Freeman: Why am I thinking about this so late.

452
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you've been thinking about 100 other things.

453
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In order

454
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.580

456
00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:04.710

459
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:32.850
Jessica Freeman: And it's just been insane like checking my mail every day and I'm getting like email message. I mean, I've had eight pieces of mail in one day, just from like the Medicaid office.

460
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.650
Jessica Freeman: And wow shifted. I need to do. So it's been overwhelming.

461
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I guess that isn't that is a lot

462
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:54.480
Jessica Freeman: And I still don't have it. Like there's still there's still something I'm a couple things. I'm waiting on and I hope they get here in the mail weekend so that I can turn them in on Monday and let that be done.

463
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.430
Jessica Freeman: Yeah, it's been an ordeal.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy.

465
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a lot of work.

466
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:02.880
Jessica Freeman: It is

467
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:05.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The great

468
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: part about it is that you're able to do it.

469
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:08.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I mean,

470
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:09.810
Really

471
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.720
Jessica Freeman: It could be for my life.

472
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.520

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am able to do it right now. And that, you know, kind of switches that that heavy negative thought to to, you know what I mean.

478
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah paradigm switching it
