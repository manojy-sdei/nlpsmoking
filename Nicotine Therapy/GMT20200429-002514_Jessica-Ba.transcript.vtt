00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How are you

2
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.860
Mike: Good, good. We're supposed to notify you Mary was I called her cuz I was in the virtual clinic for

3
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.570
Mike: I don't know. It seemed like forever. It must have been about almost 29

4
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.170
Mike: And it was getting close to six. I was like, oh my god, I said, I call them the cell phone and spoke to marry at the

5
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.660
Mike: Right heart how and she was. I was like, can you please let us know that I'm here, I'm just stuck in the virtual

6
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Clinic and no one, no one

7
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:35.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Told me Mike and I have logged off my computer. And I thought, no show. So yeah, that that's frustrating.

8
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:46.260
Mike: Yeah, and I mean I talked to her twice about the the concern. I was like, we've had issues before we end up getting there, and time. I said,

9
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.110
Mike: Please, you have to let her know that

10
00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:07.950
Mike: And so I was like I clicked. I was like, You know what, okay, if I was Jessica and I was not shown up on her meeting room yet what would she do, I was like, she's gonna she can email me. So I ran. I had my tablet actually

11
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.140
Mike: The vehicle know

12
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.150
Mike: Brought the computer everything with me as I went, because I was stealing your meeting room waiting to see

13
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:26.040
Mike: I got past the virtual client. Finally, and I was in your meeting room but I went and grabbed my tablet and pulled up my email and I saw that you had emailed so I was like, oh, maybe this will be the

14
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Best yeah yeah but

15
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.990
Mike: We talked to her.

16
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.370
Mike: Twice about

17
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.190
Mike: Making sure that you knew what was going on.

18
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.870
Mike: Yeah, it's a little upsetting fading to notify you

19
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, wait a little longer because I had shut down my computer so

20
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm problems is shut down.

21
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then like now have to restart it. But

22
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.530
Mike: No.

23
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.390
Mike: No, my goodness, how are you today.

24
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm doing good. How about yourself.

25
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.650
Mike: Not bad. I think I just

26
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.990
Mike: Don't know I've been

27
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.340
Mike: Feeling a bit of anxiety, um,

28
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:27.360
Mike: I did get the Seroquel picked up today, so I'm looking forward to taking yet and seeing how much that helps with the insomnia that I've been dealing with. I'm hoping that that kind of gets me a little more back into regular routine sleep.

29
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I've been sweating.

30
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.380
A bit

31
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.850
Mike: Like

32
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:47.610
Mike: My back of my neck and my forehead area I'm in feeling like a little bit like the anxiety, like in my chest, you know, type of look failing like kind of like being squeezed um

33
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.410
Mike: I am

34
00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:02.100
Mike: Then really dealing. I think a lot with like a lot of emotions like oh my god it's been, I've been all emotional not an emotional guy, you know, and

35
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.030
Mike: It's been like a flood of emotions. It seems as a real recently, last

36
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:30.180
Mike: Within this last, you know, few days, I would say, more so than before. Um, I feel, I feel like like cuz I mean there's just been so many things that have transpired.

37
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:48.150
Mike: Um, throughout the years of my addiction and now I'm like facing a lot of those again, is what I'm kind of feel like it's happening I'm

38
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.430
Mike: Like the

39
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.020
Mike: The, a lot of those thoughts and feelings have been really reoccurring

40
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:24.210
Mike: A lot more. In fact, some of the people who have passed away that I was really close to during the time that I was under the influence. Um, I've been having dreams about them when I do go to sleep. And I think that might be even part of why I wake up at times.

41
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:44.250
Mike: Because they feel really vivid and then there are people that have passed. Um, and I hadn't dream about them at all the entire time that I was taking medication and or

42
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.590
Mike: Other substance.

43
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.950
Mike: And so now I'm like

44
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.250
Mike: I don't know if my subconscious mind is what doing that or what it is, but yeah.

45
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.760
That's

46
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.220
Mike: What I've been kind of feeling and going with a little bit lately.

47
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He said, these were friends that also had pass addiction his

48
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.770
Mike: Family. Family members that have passed away.

49
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:30.600
Mike: Well, I was under the influence ended and addictive. Um, I was I was taking pills for the majority of the time, and some of the people. My grandparents, for example, I lost both of them. And I also lost my mother about

50
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:43.110
Mike: Nearly two years ago. And so I had been, I've been on on drugs for, you know, six years, you know, straight

51
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.960
Mike: I'm daily. You know what I mean. And so

52
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.080
Mike: Some of the emotions and or the feelings that I

53
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:13.650
Mike: Didn't process, maybe, you know, because I was under like the veil of being under influence. You know, I don't know if that's why I'm you know having you know these people kind of in my dreams and in my thoughts. A lot

54
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.660
Mike: You know,

55
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.790
Mike: It's, yeah.

56
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What happens in those dreams.

57
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.010
Mike: I'm with some of them are like real vivid. Um, and, like,

58
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:41.010
Mike: Nothing like real like event for, for the most part that I could really recall. Um, but just seeing them like in my dream like it's

59
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:51.690
Mike: It's like, like I know like I hadn't seen him in a long time. You know, like, I feel that in my dream and I'm so it

60
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.680
Mike: It makes me like aware even though I'm asleep.

61
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.870
Mike: You know, and it'll wake me up.

62
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.140
Mike: Because it's not like I mean, before this.

63
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:22.920
Mike: The only time like I'd experienced anything kind of similar was like there was a time like I would try to quit on my own. Before I started with the group and I dealt with a lot of vivid dreams, but they were like, they were like crazy.

64
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.030
Mike: Dreams. They were like,

65
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:42.000
Mike: There was like crazy stuff going on. And they were like, either. There was violence in, um, I'm like I'm or like, you know, spirituality, like there was like like negative spirit when it kind of felt like um it was

66
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:51.000
Mike: It was like more of that but not like people that I had lost during being, you know,

67
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.740
Mike: And then so

68
00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:11.730
Mike: To like be dealing with that now just, you know, I don't know why you know I am. You know, I'm all, I've been able to kind of assume it's just that I didn't really process. Some of these or agree. Some of these people as I normally would have maybe

69
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some of the remorse that you were

70
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.480
Mike: Yeah, yeah. Yes, definitely. Yeah, that's another perfect

71
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.990
Mike: Analogy of what I feel. Yeah, definitely.

72
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:33.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, I, I'm not sure if you were in that group, but I did talk about trauma and how there is a compulsion to come to repeat and so

73
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.610
Mike: We get the triangle.

74
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, that was the drama triangle.

75
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.690
Mike: Of the Brahma. COM. Yes.

76
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:46.950
Mike: Yeah I caught you know the the trauma people that have dealt with trauma, they have this compulsion to repeat

77
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:55.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so on. If you think about it, domestic violence. Some people will leave one domestic violent relationship and go to the next one.

78
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:12.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And because that compulsion to repeat is them hoping that if they go into 11 situation, they'll be able to exert mastery offerings and you'll come up with a new solution. So giving them a sense of control and so please be

79
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.430
Mike: Off hamster store. Yeah. Yeah. Because it doesn't happen.

80
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:35.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, but that's why even even pets. They have been abused. They'll still go back to the piece of owner, because it's a known place for them, whether it's safe or not. And so that compulsion to compete. So repeat an unsafe environment.

81
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just because it's something that is understood something that's known for

82
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:54.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so I'm wondering with the streams. The compulsion to repeat is because in the train. There's hoping that they'll be some type of resolution to the remorse that you

83
00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:06.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And your subconscious is moving up the streams and these people that you're hoping that you would be able to exert some some resolution to whatever conflict or

84
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What ending that she

85
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.730
Mike: Right, yeah. What is Felicia, because that's what I feel more most of

86
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.570
Mike: You know,

87
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.200
Mike: Is that you know there were a lot of times

88
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:40.530
Mike: And things that were missed. You know what I mean, because I was more focused on getting my drugs and doing my drugs. Then I was well they were you know sick and like close near dad and

89
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.240
Mike: You know, I feel like I should have been there.

90
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:51.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: More. Yeah. Yeah. So the dreams is almost like you. Again, going back into the script into the movie at the same time open for different in

91
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That your subconscious. That's really dealing with the brown horse and some of the guilt from the past.

92
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:05.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's what it sounds like to me and and the way the best way to work through that is doing what you're doing right now to

93
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:21.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Discuss it and figure out, okay, what are the breaks in those relationships that I would hope to have in store. And where are my currently because since they have already passed away. There really is nothing that she can do you can

94
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, write your narrative for your present message.

95
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.270
Mike: Right, so I don't really

96
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:40.950
Mike: Have a way of alleviating that remorse. You know, so it kind of is it building

97
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.910
Mike: In that sense of if it looks like you know

98
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.800
Mike: Like the last, like, three. Let's say the last like three days have been

99
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.810
Mike: Pretty hard, you know, for for that fact.

100
00:12:58.890 --> 00:12:59.580
Mike: And

101
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.280
Mike: There's been a lot of

102
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.130
Mike: A lot of my

103
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.500
Mike: Addictive mind but it's been really active

104
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.780
Mike: In the last few days, um, it, it's

105
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:23.580
Mike: You know it's done everything to rationalize you know why it would be okay to use

106
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.780
Mike: And on that I would

107
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:34.230
Mike: Not feel those feelings. If I use and I wouldn't think about those things. If I use

108
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.810
Mike: Those were

109
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:56.040
Mike: Probably the main thing is that my mind kept on trying to rationalize come to myself to give myself an excuse you know to go ahead and years and so um it was something I was like, Well, I'm glad we have a meeting this that

110
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.970
Mike: You worked out to be able to see you during the week.

111
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.900
And later.

112
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:02.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This

113
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.290
Mike: With their hands kind of going on.

114
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.910
Mike: You know definitely helps to have a little bit of support, you know,

115
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:18.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like you said, because the dreams. It's hard for you to find any resolution to it because you can't really think of

116
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:27.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's no way to repair it and I'm doing a lot of guilt and shame here. I find that you really connect with the different sides of the

117
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:40.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mind versus the sober mind. So what if your dreams represented, you know, the shame side of the remorseful side of you, what would the opposite side represent for you.

118
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Versus helpful.

119
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.930
Mike: Yeah, yeah. Hope.

120
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.600
Mike: I get to see. I hope would probably be the

121
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.420
Mike: Answer to that.

122
00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:08.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And sell it through a Marshal side is playing attorneys very did that and then you wake up, what would the hopeful side see to the remorseful side.

123
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.460
Mike: That

124
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.620
Mike: You know, I can

125
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:24.510
Mike: Do things, you know, like, pray for them, spiritually, that they, you know, understood that know how much I cared about them, you know, and

126
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:34.380
Mike: That you know i was i wish that you know there was, you know, more time and you know I could have done things different that

127
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.090
Mike: Wish that things were different. Yeah.

128
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.490
Mike: Yeah, and a lot of ways.

129
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.510
Yeah.

130
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the wholesale side to send a

131
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: An assurance to the remorseful side that

132
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:58.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Knife is now working on his sobriety Mike is not working on all of the things that kept him from being available and present for you during that time.

133
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:10.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those are the affirmations that you would use to describe what the remorseful side is trying to bring up

134
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:22.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was that remorse brains. The shame and the guilt know that shame and guilt is highly attached to be addicted.

135
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:23.970
Mike: So,

136
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.400
Mike: I'm really getting a dog. So

137
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:44.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. So we need to activate the syllable brain and the hopeful side more often. And so you have this stream the wake up. Wake up as quickly as you can out of it doesn't allow you don't allow that are more society to just allow you to stay in that sleep, wake up.

138
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.760
Mike: Like wanting to

139
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.250
Mike: Like, find out, like, where do you go

140
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

141
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That is just remorse that keeps you in the longer you stay in it, the harder it is to get out of it.

142
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:06.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think about it like, you know, it's just this large pool and has so many depths of wire.

143
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:26.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, the further you go in the deeper you go in the harder it is for you to get to the surface. It takes a little longer for you to get to the surface. So, the quicker you get up from that dream and recounts the Alright one more side. This is what the hopeful side of me says

144
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:44.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And continue to say those affirmation so that remorseful side doesn't have much opportunity to the surface. Because now there's hopeful thoughts. That's activating there's more build spots that's being activated vs remorse.

145
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:54.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it makes sense why you would be really struggling with the addicted brain right now because that's, that's where this addicted brain is now resting in the subconscious.

146
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.400
Yeah.

147
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:11.700
Mike: Yeah, I feel like a deal with it quite a bit in my when I do happen to fall asleep, you know, whether I'm asleep for, you know, three hours or, you know,

148
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.530
Mike: An hour, you know, I feel like I there's a battle that's

149
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going on there in

150
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:24.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My head. Yeah. So Mike, let's come up with maybe an affirmative statement that you could say.

151
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:40.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Before you go to bed so that you can send a message to the remorseful five that it can't get activated during asleep. What would that affirmative statement be before you go to bed that you can repeat before you honestly

152
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:57.690
Mike: I'm working on my recovery, so that way I don't have any of those, you know, situations happen ever again. You know, or that I don't you know

153
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.490
Mike: Take the, you know, time or person for granted.

154
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:09.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then, what could you say it.

155
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:17.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: remorseful side still pleasing a drain and now you've woken up from that dream. What would you say to activate the hopeful something

156
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would you say the same thing, or would you say something different.

157
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.950
Mike: I would probably be a bit lap down from the first

158
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.750
Mike: Comment not working.

159
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.770
Mike: You know if realistically, I think so. I

160
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.650
Mike: Think I would probably have to say something else.

161
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.580
Mike: You know, maybe something else. A little more firm.

162
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.510
Mike: I'm not sure. Like you know what it is. I could say that.

163
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:57.960
You know,

164
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.100
Mike: Immediately alleviate that on

165
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.690
Mike: That feeling, you know,

166
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.440
Mike: What yeah

167
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.150
Mike: We definitely want to walk off with something

168
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:09.840
Yeah.

169
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:21.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I agree. You know, so you save you save a lot of Satan before you go to bed room or side still find a way to visit during this

170
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there's that disappointment, but that disappointment is been taking you to that.

171
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you wake up you acknowledge it.

172
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:48.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, because the acknowledgement says, I see you, but I have to separate it. I'm aware of this. So you could say something as I see them are more side trying to visit however hopefulness now resides in my present and the future.

173
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.670
Mike: I think that's really good.

174
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.400
Mike: We will try there.

175
00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:07.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Will be opportunities. I'm just Google a list of affirmative powerful statements and you know place within within your vision and

176
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Put it on your phone. Put just those reminders.

177
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:26.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it's very clear that the reminders as play the day by day is the addictive side and you're constantly have to reinforce the sober brain, the sober brain, the hopeful side, the President

178
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:47.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's exhausting. It's exhausting. So what is not trying to figure out what word. You could use. What if you can just look at a quick glance and see the affirmation right and be remind you know and having that visual as well as that vocal representation of sobriety and helpfulness

179
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.120
Mike: And

180
00:21:51.780 --> 00:22:01.890
Mike: Being a lot better way to do it. Instead of, you know, be able to see something, you know, visually, I think might be more helpful.

181
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.480
Mike: Be that, you know, a lot of the stuff that

182
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:19.620
Mike: I'm dealing with it like in dream and or visual, you know, for the most part, one of the heightened senses and feel like, so maybe visually might be more hope.

183
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.630
Mike: You know, yeah.

184
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.640
Mike: Boy Yeah.

185
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:38.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah occupy all the senses that you can if you can even imagine what would hopefulness it's like they had a taste of it if it looked like something. What would that represent for you.

186
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:52.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know smell any sense is that you can attach to sobriety into the hopefulness will help to Nelson new messages to the brain and rewiring the brain.

187
00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:06.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That. Okay, now we've sent the census through the the elements, right, and now it's being able to say, all right, we're not going to activate. We're not going to activate the middle of with the fight, flight, or freeze.

188
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:12.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We all want you to freeze in the streets are just remorse and while lowering

189
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:21.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The new signal now has the goal. It has to stay say there's a normal lower road of the brain and the higher realm.

190
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:33.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the higher road. It takes a little longer for the wiring to happen because there's more work that needs to be done, so it's easier for us to default to the law role, which is what I described with

191
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:52.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That the llamas gets the senses and then it sends a message to the amygdala. Hey, what do you think this is a threat, and then the mega says yep fight, flight, or freeze and then it just sends the response to stress hormones in the journal or in your case, Wyoming, and the shame, guilt,

192
00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:02.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Higher road takes a little longer because instead of going through that the Llamas with a census, it'll send it to the middle of it. Then from there says, hey,

193
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:16.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's reroute to the hippocampus back and help us to process this categorize what this is and that categorization process looks like, okay, is this Murray more speaking or is this hopefulness speaking

194
00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And hippocampus will separate that.

195
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:33.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then give it a new outlook through the prefrontal cortex, which then helps with the rewiring and the more that you say hey higher road of my brain. I need you to activate now.

196
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:45.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now the brain can continue to categorize a separate for you. Oh, Mike. This is remorse trying to visit again. Last time I remember you use these hopeful statements. Let's try that again.

197
00:24:46.800 --> 00:25:01.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that rewiring that constant rewiring of hopelessness over a point in time. The Mykola won't even get activated, because it'll say, Oh, I remember last time, the higher role of the brain took this out and it filtered it out.

198
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:09.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then what happens all the time is, those dreams don't occur as often because there's no longer anything to feed.

199
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:11.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The remorse.

200
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.650
Mike: Right, okay.

201
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.570
Mike: So you're not feeding it

202
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.570
Mike: Naturally do

203
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.220
Mike: Yeah, you get in

204
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.890
Mike: Before you start to tender a direct your train of thought.

205
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.510
Mike: So right

206
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:28.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

207
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:41.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you put into context what we talked about with the black or white thinking right and remorse will probably want you to feel as though you were never there for your family. You were always an addict.

208
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it was absolute right

209
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But like I said in the room. Let's challenge those thoughts because there are no absolutes and like

210
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There was a time where you were there for your family, maybe not the best version that you want it to be.

211
00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But there were times he

212
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.290
Mike: worked as a

213
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.280
Mike: Fascinating tonight. Yeah. Maybe I should been or whatever.

214
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:06.750
Yeah.

215
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.770
Mike: I definitely, I know that I was going to be

216
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:11.130
Mike: There but

217
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.170
Mike: At the absolute but

218
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.030
Mike: I just know that I could have done so much more over

219
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

220
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.810
Mike: You know endorphin more present

221
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mom.

222
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.300
Mike: Had more presidents in mind.

223
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:25.980
Mike: On those things.

224
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:40.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But there's so much more you can do now, even though it's not what those relationships, but without hope openness represents is that I can make my past our present even that

225
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.540
Mike: definitely helpful. I appreciate some tools to

226
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:58.470
Mike: To work on that with the struggle at the recent definitely will.

227
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.170
Mike: Be applying those things to try to combat this

228
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:18.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. What it yourself can look like before you go to bed. Do you just kind of like the stimulation going around and kind of just fall asleep and then wake up like all fell asleep or is there like a set routine for you.

229
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.870
Mike: You're using it's pretty routine.

230
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.420
Mike: You know, I'll

231
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.650
Mike: Put on some TV for a little while and kind of just like wind down

232
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.490
Mike: Trying to wind down mentally and

233
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.380
Mike: Get more

234
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.550
Mike: Out of whatever program, it is and I'm watching you.

235
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:51.060
Mike: Do that and what actually is taking place within my life, even just for the day.

236
00:27:54.390 --> 00:28:03.900
Mike: And then I will typically, you know, start getting kind of tired and, you know, turn off the TV and go to bed. Usually that's all

237
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.980
Mike: Occurring

238
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:11.250
Mike: You know, while back when I was working. It was occurring on a total regular

239
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:11.970
Mike: Basis.

240
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:33.360
Mike: daily routine me, whereas like now that we've been off work on a lot of and unused energy that I'm a customer burning off is still flowing in my, in my body in so it's

241
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:43.350
Mike: A bit harder to go to bed at those more more times and it throws my regular routine like totally out of whack, like

242
00:28:43.890 --> 00:29:02.430
Mike: It feels like it's totally out of whack. I mean, there's been times where it's like, you know, if I stay up watching TV, you know, for a while, then you know sometimes I'll, I'll even get up and eat something at times or, you know, or get a craving for

243
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:16.950
Mike: You know, doing something, you know, it's probably a craving for us, but it's manifesting in other forms like, you know, smoking a cigarette or

244
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.550
Mike: Partying or

245
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.820
Mike: You know, maybe getting on on the Internet.

246
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.480
You know,

247
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

248
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.780
Mike: It's definitely manifesting in other forms, even though you know initially and

249
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:48.870
Mike: Probably at times, you know, between it's you know the answer in what my addicted line shows the views.

250
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.490
Mike: And and

251
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.810
Mike: problem will go away. But I know that that's

252
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.770
Mike: Not what I want. And it's not the

253
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.180
Mike: That's not the right way to fix the problem.

254
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.110
Mike: At all.

255
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:09.450
Mike: It just compounds and actually and makes it worse. So

256
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:17.190
Mike: That's good. I, I tell myself a lot when I start to feel like a lot of integrated mean

257
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You still have the time I

258
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:34.530
Mike: I do I don't actually have it here. I'm hoping to get it here in the next within the next week or so. I think it, everything is kind of

259
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:47.490
Mike: You know, shut down out here. And so where I have it. I am not been able to get to, um, and so I don't have it here with me as a moment but

260
00:30:48.480 --> 00:31:12.480
Mike: I'm looking to hopefully have that hero hopefully everything works right I'll be able to get it back at the end of the month because there'll be a little bit more leniency to do some things. But I mean, really, a lot of that is all kind of going to be dictated by how this virus goes

261
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it

262
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.280
Mike: Can use to spread heavily

263
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:35.910
Mike: It's most likely that they are going to get further pushed out and restrictions are going to probably be extended, you know, and so I would like to have it right now. I think you have a via health

264
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:45.090
Mike: Or and I just remember, like, how much it was showing the endorphins that go off.

265
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:45.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In my

266
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.170
Mike: Music thing versus doing anything else. And I'm like,

267
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.010
Mike: That was like

268
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:50.850
Mike: The biggest

269
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.660
Mike: Impact, or for for those that

270
00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:01.710
Mike: And Mike, you did something I enjoy. I know I do. I always have, you know,

271
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.640
Mike: So yeah, I'm missing my guitar.

272
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:14.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The interim you can do like a YouTube and like my instrumental just the guitar.

273
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:25.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And maybe listen to those melodies before you drift off to sleep or white noise or some type of soothing sounds. I'm

274
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:37.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because maybe just the lighting from the TV and what you're watching may not be as common for you. And so we're getting affirmations and my message of the routine, a little bit too.

275
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:45.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And those things that are fulfilling and soothing to you play that. So that's the last time you hear before you fall asleep, as well.

276
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:51.750
Mike: Try that.

277
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:52.470
Mike: Oh, yeah.

278
00:32:54.510 --> 00:33:05.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: YouTube has everything. Someone said that, you know, my friends have this nice picture and I really thought like she went to a cabin in the woods in the middle of pandemic.

279
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:23.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And she had just Googled fireplace on and then she'd like streamed it to her TV. And so it looked like she was like sitting in front of a fireplace, but really all it was was a YouTube streaming for fireplace. I think really how just a channel of just
