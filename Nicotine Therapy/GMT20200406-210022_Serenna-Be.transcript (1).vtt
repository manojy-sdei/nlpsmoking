Serenna Beers: Oh,

Serenna Beers: I am so that breaks my heart that's gosh

86
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:42.480
Serenna Beers: So tell me your story with it. I mean, like how long, when you say that I've been an addict for a long, long time. What is that, what does that mean specifically. And what I'm trying to do is create a timeline. So when you started to use substances.

87
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.620
Serenna Beers: Basically when you were first exposed to how it had progressed and then at what point was it the worst.

88
00:09:49.860 --> 00:10:01.260
iPhone: Okay. Um, so I started using when I was 14. It was just marijuana first for those first few years.

89
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:08.160
iPhone: When I was like a freshman, sophomore in high school and then I got into

90
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.590
iPhone: When I first tried cocaine that was

91
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:26.490
iPhone: Basically, where my I feel like that addict in my body that was asleep kind of woke up, um,

92
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:41.760
iPhone: That's when I became I didn't become a full blown addict right away but I started to spend all my money on cocaine. And at first it was

93
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:54.930
iPhone: I used a lot of it with people, but didn't tell them that I was using cocaine. So I kept it a secret because I went to a high school that was pretty

94
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:12.660
iPhone: I don't know what the word is. But it was it was a private high school I people didn't do my serve and drink and smoke weed. So I started just to use cocaine basically alone for a while.

95
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.500
iPhone: And

96
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:28.170
iPhone: It moved on to ecstasy I when I first tried to ecstasy. I wasn't on antidepressants. Then, and I feel like a

97
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.300
iPhone: Cause

98
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.910
iPhone: Temporary

99
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:40.740
iPhone: It was a temporary antidepressant and it was a very good antidepressant.

100
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:53.880
iPhone: In the sense that I think it stimulated all those neurotransmitters. You know that depression, kind of, you know, just it

101
00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:06.900
iPhone: I was happy for almost not the first time, but I was truly seeing clearly and feeling, you know that everything was all right for the first time in a while.

102
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:27.480
iPhone: And I basically got addicted to ecstasy, which is tech, you know, people say is impossible, but I was using it every other day I'd use it and then spend the next day recovering use it recovering I would use it more

103
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.470
iPhone: You know, ecstasy and marijuana

104
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.170
iPhone: Accuracy and cocaine.

105
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.050
iPhone: It wasn't until

106
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:49.020
iPhone: I got into college when i was i was 18 back in 2012

107
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.070
iPhone: That

108
00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:12.750
iPhone: I start, you know, I started drink, but it was really when I discovered benzo that everything went south. That was what I became fully addicted to like in the sense, those both physically and mentally they did.

109
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:27.840
iPhone: Insert off with an event. And then this was also my doctor prescribed to and it was an event and then Xanax and then I started to get Sam max listed Lee.

110
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:40.050
iPhone: I was taking up to 12 milligrams of Xanax a day. And that's, that's a lot.

111
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:55.500
iPhone: And I was really scared when I ran when I, you know, if I was going around and whatnot. I was a Xanax dealer down in UCSB

112
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:17.640
iPhone: So I had thousands upon thousands of pills. I would just take them like candy I would forget that I take them and take more I could barely go to class. I was just waiting until class was over to get right back home and pop some pills.

113
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.730
iPhone: And I, you know, by the end of the year.

114
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:38.190
iPhone: I knew I had a problem. I was really scared I you know I told my mom and I went to a really nice rehab center in

115
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.760
iPhone: Arizona and

116
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:54.900
iPhone: That was one of like I've been to a lot of rehabs that's that was a really nice one and

117
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:13.920
iPhone: You know, I did good there. But when I got home, I immediately started using again. I didn't take sobriety that seriously. Like, oh, I'm too young to be sober. Like, I'll just, I'll just, you know, please. My parents like I going to

118
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:25.800
iPhone: You know, rehab and it's important to tell you like my parents split up when I was 12 or 13. It was a really messy divorce.

119
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:37.110
iPhone: And that's, that's where I got in the habit of isolating in my room and just getting high and

120
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:47.340
iPhone: Yeah, the one constitute was marijuana but that's not what cause at the end. Cause that was like a

121
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.960
iPhone: Guess who the trigger in itself to do harder drugs. Okay.

122
00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.440
iPhone: And then

123
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.780
iPhone: When I got

124
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:13.110
iPhone: I went to, you know, I went to Arizona. I went to a sober program in Hawaii. And then I came back and I

125
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:27.150
iPhone: Didn't go back to school for like a year and was using a ton in that time trying out a bunch of different drugs as when I started to do math was 19 or 20

126
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.630
iPhone: And

127
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.240
iPhone: When I was 21

128
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:53.100
iPhone: I will be. I was living in SLE in San Francisco. And then my accident happened when I was 22 so three years ago.

129
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.220
iPhone: And then since then I've been in and out SLO ease and rehabs

130
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.660
iPhone: So I'd say that my poison is probably Xanax

131
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.480
iPhone: It doesn't cause the euphoria that I used to feel from

132
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:39.390
iPhone: Like ecstasy and math and Coke, but it does its job to num num me out and sleep. I love that feeling, Ella waking up from from a Xanax induce sleep and like, you know, my body is all tingly. And it's just

133
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:50.940
iPhone: It's that sleep that I and I changed and now that I'm in recovery. I'm on know like an anti psychotic and so other stuff that allows me to sleep.

134
00:17:51.720 --> 00:18:06.480
iPhone: And I'm I don't get the same feeling but sleeping well I've been in Insomniac my whole life sleeping well for me is like a euphoric experience itself.

135
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.580
iPhone: So I was chasing that

136
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:27.240
iPhone: That sleep for a lot of years and I think that I thought that Xanax food and stuff Benz's would pause causes me to, I think it really

137
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:51.810
iPhone: After a while, I know that it messes with your sleep. Mm hmm. Maybe helps it first, but it, it blocks certain stages of sleep from happening. And I would wake up eventually and just feel like not refresh at all and then do more Xanax and it was just a continuous loop.

138
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.000
iPhone: And now that I'm not doing any drugs.

139
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:20.610
iPhone: I think the most. The best thing is you know my relationship with my mom, she got sick with cancer, about five, six years ago and I've been using. I can't imagine like what she's been going through. But now that I'm sober, I have the ability to, you know, have that insight.

140
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.110
iPhone: And

141
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.350
iPhone: Yeah, I'm living an sob right now.

142
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:42.720
iPhone: Um, there's, you know, there's probably several places I've been to that I haven't mentioned, but I'm kind of shared with you the whole progression of

143
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.940
iPhone: How it started and

144
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.530
iPhone: Where I am now.

145
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.910
Serenna Beers: Do you struggle with chronic pain as a result of your traumatic brain in brain injury.

146
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.100
iPhone: Yeah, I do. Okay.

147
00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:06.150
Serenna Beers: All right and and the the precipitating event basically be event that created the chronic pain was from your traumatic brain injury.

148
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.320

iPhone: Goals.

242
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.240
iPhone: To

243
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.580
iPhone: I want to understand more about why my triggers are so

244
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.350
iPhone: They're you know they're super very

245
00:30:54.750 --> 00:31:03.240
iPhone: powerful and strong like a I can smell the drug, I can almost feel the drug. When I think about it.

246
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.900
iPhone: I'd like to know more about that and what I can do to

247
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.030
iPhone: quell that

248
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.920
Pain.

249
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.600
Serenna Beers: OK, I just, I had a random thought

250
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:34.620
Serenna Beers: Cuz we can actually, you know, perhaps, that could be one of the topics of the group that we do, or I can teach in a different session.

251
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.570
Serenna Beers: Relapse

252
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:52.770
Serenna Beers: Is one of my specialties as well. I did a lot of training. Training behind triggers cravings and thoughts because there is a lot to it and it actually makes sense. So that's something that's very doable. What else

253
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.630
iPhone: Is kind of similar but

254
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.920
iPhone: You know, maybe this you know some of the psychology around addiction.

255
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.300
Serenna Beers: Okay, some almost like the disease con concept.

256
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:27.300
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay. Those are really good ones. Okay. Give me one. One more.

257
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.070
Serenna Beers: I'm so gonna say, cuz you said that you struggle with any type of

258
00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:14.280
Serenna Beers: Conflict conference confrontation is it that you struggle with being assertive with would you identify as more kind of like passive, but when you get really pissed off. And it's kind of like passive aggressive or I mean, would you say that you need a healthier communication style.

259
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.660
iPhone: Sure, but

260
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.560
iPhone: Yeah, I was just gonna say

261
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:44.040
iPhone: Is almost impossible to have that with and within this House, but not within with other people, it's, it's a

262
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.460
iPhone: You know, other people are

263
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.750
iPhone: It's just not normal. What, what goes on and what what you know there's really nothing to

264
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.140
iPhone: To do about that.

265
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:07.410
iPhone: Other than you literally have to like bowed down that this guy, or you can gel. The house so

266
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:23.100
iPhone: You know, it's, it's very frustrating. I guess how how you can turn your anger into something positive and productive and turning it into like a

267
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:32.910
iPhone: Like a trigger to to want to get fucked up like to wanna know.

268
00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:48.060
Serenna Beers: Okay, so maybe conflict resolution when it's beyond your control which, you know, which is where you're at right right now because it's not like you shouldn't have to bow to bow down but

269
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:57.900
Serenna Beers: Or I don't like to say but but the gates what you just said. So I always say and how to turn your anger into something that is

270
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:11.130
Serenna Beers: Is healthier because if a situation is out of your control. But you have to be in this situation, then you need to find a way to accept right

271
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.300
iPhone: Mm hmm.

272
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:20.520
Serenna Beers: So how do you do that without one losing your mind to becoming triggered and saying, effort and picking up and

273
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:26.010
Serenna Beers: going and going to substances which then you go backwards, right.

274
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:36.780
Serenna Beers: So just really channeling that anger and flipping it almost opposite to emotion action that's kind of what I hear you saying yeah

275
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:52.620
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay. Well, those are all three really good good goals and and i think that that we can really work on those in the weeks to come. So I have a lot a lot of hope for that.

276
00:35:53.820 --> 00:36:05.130
Serenna Beers: So how does Mondays. At this time, sound at four o'clock. Is this a pretty good time, or is there a different time that works better.
