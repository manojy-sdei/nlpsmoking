00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.750
Kelsey Mcginty: It'd be worth or $13 club.

39
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.590
Natalie Austin: I know, yeah, it's

40
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.200
Natalie Austin: It's worth here.

41
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:52.770
Kelsey Mcginty: But it's still okay that's still not awful. I mean, when I got my license. It was $3 and 85 cents a gallon. I remember because I filled my dad filled the car up that he gave me

42
00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.660
Kelsey Mcginty: For my birthday. When I was 16 and it was agreed it was it was a little Ford Escort and it costs like $40 to fill it up.

43
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.210
Kelsey Mcginty: They know

44
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.940
Natalie Austin: A big difference. I know.

45
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.920
Kelsey Mcginty: Right.

46
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.920

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.440
Natalie Austin: Kelsey Okay.

49
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.940
Natalie Austin: Um, do you say McGinty, is that how you say that

50
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.750
Yeah.

51
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.650
Natalie Austin: Okay sep tember 20th 1995

52
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.990
Natalie Austin: Correct. Okay.

53
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.560
Natalie Austin: Perfect. Okay.

54
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.790
Natalie Austin: Um, so are you new to Suboxone

55
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:58.710
Kelsey Mcginty: No. Um, so I've been buying Suboxone on the streets. Ever since I lost my insurance, like, a year and a half ago, you know, and to be completely 100% honest It's cheaper to buy it on the streets and it is

56
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.490
Kelsey Mcginty: A and then pay for your prescription drugs out there and it's unfortunate. The unfortunate thing about it, you know, but I just finally got insurance couple days ago and

57
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.800
Kelsey Mcginty: So,

58
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.180
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, I want to do things the right way. It's just, you know, I'm I don't want to go back to using heroin. So it was, you know,

59
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:28.920
Kelsey Mcginty: There was really no option there because you can I you know I can't afford $200 a week or every other week plus another hundred 50 for prescription. You know, it's just ludicrous.

60
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.180
Natalie Austin: Yeah, it is.

61
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.990
Natalie Austin: I will tell me about your story, like how how you got into opioids and heroin.

62
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.010
Natalie Austin: Um,

63
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.440
Natalie Austin: Well, how old were you when you started

64
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.780
Natalie Austin: I live. Yeah.

65
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.220
Kelsey Mcginty: 18 and it was just like, I mean, I did I show. I grew up showing horses and stuff.

66
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.150
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah it Arabs and, you know,

67
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.790
Natalie Austin: There is a beautiful

68
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.140
Kelsey Mcginty: old guy just passed away a couple years ago he was old retired and living is heavy life.

69
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:16.440
Kelsey Mcginty: Just eating grass, you know, but um so I shouldn't worse is pretty much like my whole high school and everything. And like I was, you know, like a good kid. I don't really do watch like

70
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.850
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, I'd hang out with friends I smoke weed like once in a while, you know, and it was just like, one of the things one night. It was like

71
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:34.980
Kelsey Mcginty: Went out with a freshman here. You want to get a little bit of weed smoke some weed. I'm like, Okay, whatever. So, you know, couldn't find we she messaged like one of our friends older brothers and

72
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.300
Kelsey Mcginty: He was like, yeah, I can get some weed and like you know we didn't know you know we were 18 at the time. We have no idea like

73
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:54.270
Kelsey Mcginty: That he was just dope feeding us you know he wanted to get heroin, you know, and he didn't. He knew he couldn't even get we to begin with. So that, you know, it turns out, like we go there we get there and, you know, get it.

74
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:07.560
Kelsey Mcginty: Is and then he's like, oh, they didn't have any weed, but they have this and this is like doing Percocet, so why not. And I'm just like, Okay, whatever. I spent $80 on it. So, but it was actually heroin.

75
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:19.680
Kelsey Mcginty: So, I mean, after that, I mean it was just, it was fantastic. But, you know, shortly thereafter, you learn that everything else that comes with it is not fantastic

76
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.020
Natalie Austin: Very good. Wow. Oh, how old are you, 24 all you're smart.

77
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.900
Natalie Austin: You're smart for 24 year old.

78
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.300
Natalie Austin: Lot wisdom comes with age, but not you. Awesome.

79
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.950
Kelsey Mcginty: That's gonna be how to live a long life and a couple years you know 20 years

80
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.550
Natalie Austin: Yeah, well, did you just you smoked it done, or did you snort it or how do you

81
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.660
Kelsey Mcginty: Guys know that

82
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.560
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, and

83
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:55.410
Kelsey Mcginty: I started it for like probably about, I don't know, like three or four months and then that's why I'm then

84
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.250
Kelsey Mcginty: That's when I decided to shoot it or whatever with

85
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:09.780
Kelsey Mcginty: That same friends older brother, because he was like, well, here this is just an easier way to do it, but he really just wanted to do it all for himself and just give me a tiny little bit

86
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:19.590
Kelsey Mcginty: And I, I mean, now I can sit back and look back on it, know exactly what he was doing, because you know it's like all

87
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.120
Natalie Austin: You hook, though I don't know what what angle. Did he have to get you hooked on it.

88
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:36.180
Kelsey Mcginty: I have no idea. I mean, probably just because he knew I was another person that just the misery loves company, you can find another person that you know can come up with some money every once in a while and you know

89
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:56.760
Kelsey Mcginty: Feeds is and you know I did. I remember the day that I woke up and I was texting my friend and I said, I feel like shit. Today, like I have the flu and she texted me back. Welcome to the wonderful world of being dog stick and it was just like one of those like I was

90
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.560
When I

91
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:09.330
Kelsey Mcginty: Was like moments of just not like an aha moment but like a moment of Holy shit, like, all right, like I smack in the face from reality. Like you just realized like,

92
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.320
Kelsey Mcginty: Okay, this is what it is, what the hell.

93
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.080
Natalie Austin: Oh,

94
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:34.050
Kelsey Mcginty: That's when I knew I mean, from that moment. It was like, oh wow I'm not sick with the flu like she's like yeah you're dope sick. I said was like it was just because I didn't, you know, I, I wasn't doing it that much like every couple days. But, you know, still at the point

95
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.490
Kelsey Mcginty: I guess your body still because dependent on it eventually

96
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.940
Natalie Austin: She started. She's not like every other day or so from then on.

97
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:52.050
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, man. I mean, then it came went to every single day. You know, as much as I could get to, you know,

98
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.270
Kelsey Mcginty: Much as I couldn't get

99
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.290
Kelsey Mcginty: In. I mean, it was, it was Ross, I

100
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.240
Kelsey Mcginty: I cuz then I like stopped you know

101
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.400
Kelsey Mcginty: Doing it is like a social thing. You know, I just like

102
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:19.440
Kelsey Mcginty: Became a recluse, and just would just go, go get my drugs and go home and watch movies in my bed and just be high and not do anything else in my life.

103
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.570
Natalie Austin: Do you stop selling horses.

104
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:28.500
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, I mean I would ride them every so often, but I was just too worried about getting drugs, the

105
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:38.310
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, I still. I mean, I still have a board in my old guy until he passed away aboard in a minute at a barn, but I didn't go see him every day. Like I was

106
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.170
But my

107
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:54.900
Kelsey Mcginty: I'm into horses. The horses now oh my actually just bought a horse, and I've been helping her with her. And I mean, unfortunately. Now I'm just young and

108
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:07.500
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, I live on my own. So unfortunately horses are just one of those things that you can't really afford when you're a young 24 year old kid that doesn't make very much money.

109
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.440
Natalie Austin: You all someday, though you oh

110
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.520

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.430

128
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:18.060

129
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.350
Natalie Austin: Like

130
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:32.700

133
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.750
Natalie Austin: Yeah, horrible.

134
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.820
Natalie Austin: Sounds good, asking if you take them off to go pee pee outside at all.

135
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.900
Kelsey Mcginty: Um, I mean I when it's warm out during the summer.

136
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:53.340
Natalie Austin: Um,

137
00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:02.850
Kelsey Mcginty: They're out like I have like a pen built for them and stuff. They're out like three quarters of the day they just sleep inside, though, because like

138
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:12.390
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, in Ohio. Here we have like hawks and, you know, even though I live in a city still hawks and dogs and stuff that could come in and get them.

139
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:21.690
Kelsey Mcginty: So I would feel heartbroken if I left them outside. One night, Nikki mountain. There were just a little touch of blood and feathers leftover

140
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.100
Oh,

141
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.990
Natalie Austin: You got when you got on when they were babies. So how long, how long you had them.

142
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.370
Kelsey Mcginty: A year.

143
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.300
Kelsey Mcginty: Okay. Yeah, the one my bags, um,

144
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:45.030
Kelsey Mcginty: The other one. Yeah, I know I should sell them. I don't, I'm not a fan of duck eggs. I think they're just too rich, but I've heard tons of people say like how great they are and how great they are for baking.

145
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.560
Natalie Austin: Yeah for baking definitely

146
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.810
Kelsey Mcginty: How healthy, they are for you and they're huge. I mean, they're really

147
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.310
Natalie Austin: Good sell them.

148
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.960
Kelsey Mcginty: I know I think

149
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.310
Kelsey Mcginty: About it. I mean,

150
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.180
Natalie Austin: Going on.

151
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.540
Natalie Austin: Yeah, I'm not saying these people sell them for

152
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.230
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, I mean I just throw them away. So you know I wouldn't

153
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.670
Natalie Austin: I don't do that.

154
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:17.580
Kelsey Mcginty: And they're so from there what I mean like the x, we get in the store, you know, the reason we have to keep them refrigerators, because they're already like four or five months old by the time we get them, you know,

155
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.120
Kelsey Mcginty: I know

156
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:26.220
Kelsey Mcginty: It's like you don't even have to refrigerate them for. Same thing with like fresh chicken eggs you technically don't have to refrigerate them for a while.

157
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.510
I know

158
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.340
Kelsey Mcginty: I'm all about, like, you know, raising your own

159
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:40.050
Kelsey Mcginty: You know road food and, you know, being able to know what you eat and put in your body and stuff.

160
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.870
Natalie Austin: Yeah. Amen.

161
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.510
Natalie Austin: How many eggs. Today I'm Les

162
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.430
Kelsey Mcginty: Know, does the one layer day

163
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.950
Natalie Austin: One day yeah that's like a chicken does

164
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.270
Natalie Austin: Yeah, I

165
00:13:51.330 --> 00:14:01.470
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, I heard like some in like a 5 million duck groups on Facebook and I've heard that, um, you know, that's actually really good for such a young dog.

166
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:10.110
Kelsey Mcginty: Breed that the one doc. That leaves eggs. It's a like the breed supposed to be.

167
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.910
Kelsey Mcginty: Specifically for good egg laying

168
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.740
Natalie Austin: Oh really,

169
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.380
Kelsey Mcginty: And I had no idea. I just picked them out of the sale, then

170
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:27.060
Natalie Austin: I know that's cool, though. So nice surprise. Were you shocked. The first time you, lady, she laid an egg.

171
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.890
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah. Well, I was like,

172
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.860
Kelsey Mcginty: I was like, proud, though, like so.

173
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.310
Kelsey Mcginty: That's maybe you know she's all grown up.

174
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.660
Natalie Austin: She's now a mommy. Yeah.

175
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.300
Kelsey Mcginty: Even though they'll never hash.

176
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.800
Natalie Austin: That's what I tell her, because she has

177
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:52.290
Kelsey Mcginty: Right now, and I'm like all right to park. You can sit on. I said, you know that they're never going to hatch.

178
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.410
Natalie Austin: Item

179
00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:08.850
Kelsey Mcginty: Can you promise to hear you. Yeah, you're because it talks aren't very good like mothers like his chickens are so because they just kind of like neglect them or won't sit on, or they

180
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.430
Kelsey Mcginty: Just don't really care. So a lot of duck eggs have to be incubated that you can

181
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:21.450
Kelsey Mcginty: Try to catch him out naturally. But it's not the survival rate is not very high.

182
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.830
Okay.

183
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.750
Natalie Austin: That's interesting.

184
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.280
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

185
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:34.440
Natalie Austin: So, at age 18 like 19 think is that when you when you started doing the IV.

186
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.290
Natalie Austin: Here.

187
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:52.470
Kelsey Mcginty: I had just turned 18 and to those was a 2013. Yeah, it was. I was probably 19 by them, because it was what to those 14

188
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.220
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, because there's 2014

189
00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.690
Natalie Austin: Now you're 24 so how long, how long were you using

190
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:11.160
Kelsey Mcginty: Up until 2008 2018 so I went into detox the week of Christmas.

191
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.580
Kelsey Mcginty: 2000, those are

192
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.880
Natalie Austin: Eating eating.

193
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:28.380
Kelsey Mcginty: Yes, that was those 2017 right there at the end. And then I got this second I got out the day after New Year's. So it was then 2018

194
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.910
Kelsey Mcginty: So then, and then I had insurance. And so then I was going to Suboxone Dr.

195
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:38.580
Kelsey Mcginty: Carolyn science.

196
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.520
Natalie Austin: Today, so are you on Suboxone in the rehab center.

197
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.800
Kelsey Mcginty: They did a taper.

198
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.110
Natalie Austin: That's awesome. Good. Okay.

199
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.340
Kelsey Mcginty: Well, I'm sorry.

200
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.420
Natalie Austin: I'm glad they did that. That way you're not, you know, throw on the street, you know,

201
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.410
Right.

202
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.180
Natalie Austin: Okay.

203
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.900
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, so it was. I mean it was just like a

204
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:17.310
Kelsey Mcginty: Quick, you know, it's like fibers. Well, I was there. There are 25th. Oh, is there 10 days because usually they only keep you five but I had to go in because I was out of County and out of

205
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:29.970
Kelsey Mcginty: Out of County and I didn't have. I didn't have insurance, they sent me out for insurance there, but I was out of County, so I had to go in with pencils in my system so that they would keep me

206
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:38.310
Kelsey Mcginty: Understand that whole thing. But I guess that's the thing, because if you have no insurance and stuff. They'll just kick you out just for heroin.

207
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.710
Natalie Austin: Interesting.

208
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:50.400
Kelsey Mcginty: I know it's I try and I'm like, Are you guys like serious. So then my mom gave me half of a Xanax that my step dad had

209
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:58.500
Kelsey Mcginty: Because he's you know prescribed it. And so this is the only way that the old you stay. And I said, this is crazy. I have to take drugs to get into rehab like

210
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.990
Natalie Austin: That doesn't make any sense. I know.

211
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:10.470
Natalie Austin: Well, you know, there's, I think Ben's that's either three or six day taper like to detox so

212
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.720
Natalie Austin: I bought you some more days, I guess, I don't know.

213
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.570
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, I think that's what it was, um,

214
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:22.110
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, they're like be there for like two two or three days without it without doing anything think or something.

215
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.670
Kelsey Mcginty: I don't know, I just read Stephen King book, the whole time and

216
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:33.090
Kelsey Mcginty: Slept I don't really remember that 10 days in my life and I try not to.

217
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.040
Natalie Austin: I know you don't want to

218
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.720
Natalie Austin: Work on

219
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.650
Kelsey Mcginty: Our mind. So I think like it definitely like

220
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.940
Kelsey Mcginty: Makes us forget like you know

221
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.660
Kelsey Mcginty: What's crazy is like

222
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:55.410
Kelsey Mcginty: When I had my daughter. I don't remember like the pain of childbirth. I don't remember.

223
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.790
Natalie Austin: Right, exactly.

224
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.510
You know,

225
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.360
It's crazy.

226
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.240
Kelsey Mcginty: I don't know. It's like like

227
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.710
Kelsey Mcginty: It's just

228
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.990
Kelsey Mcginty: It's wonderful, but it's just the phenomenon that

229
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.230
Natalie Austin: It's a good thing.

230
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.880
Kelsey Mcginty: Right, right.

231
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.240
Natalie Austin: Or the population would be nothing

232
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.820
Kelsey Mcginty: Why, yo. I know.

233
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.990
Natalie Austin: Women would not be repopulating they remember that pain, you know,

234
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.000
Natalie Austin: Once you have your daughter.

235
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.630
Kelsey Mcginty: Um 2000 and

236
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:42.090
Kelsey Mcginty: Was it oh my god her birthday was yesterday 2006

237
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.220
Natalie Austin: Okay.

238
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.520
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, so I was on CW text during that

239
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.540
Kelsey Mcginty: I did use a little bit during my pregnancy.

240
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.320
Kelsey Mcginty: I had a hard time staying on the side effects.

241
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:11.700
Kelsey Mcginty: Just because I didn't go through a detox. At that point, so like I went from, you know, shooting grams of heroin every single day to try to take us and I wouldn't stay. I wouldn't let myself stay. Second off, to be able to

242
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.760
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, completely

243
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.790
Kelsey Mcginty: And hear myself to Suboxone or sub you tax program.

244
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.840
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, and unfortunately, you know, that's what it took me to go to detox and completely

245
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.230
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, be able to get off of it to

246
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:39.480
Kelsey Mcginty: Be on Suboxone because if you would have asked me if I was a supporter of Suboxone three years ago, I would say, hell no, it didn't work for me.

247
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:47.130
Kelsey Mcginty: But it's because I, I would never, you know, I thought it was one of those things. And because I think they kind of they portray it as like

248
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:58.680
Kelsey Mcginty: Oh, well, you can detox yourself at home with this about you know Suboxone you can just walk into a doctor's office one day and from shooting heroin and then be on Suboxone and

249
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.880
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, you think to yourself, like, okay, wow, this is great, you know, I'm going to be able to walk in and not be sick, ever, ever, ever.

250
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:14.850
Kelsey Mcginty: Because of this wonderful miracle drug names boxing because that's not kind of like how they don't want to say advertise it as but that's kind of like

251
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:24.960
Kelsey Mcginty: What it's made out to be a while because, you know, this is great treatment that people can get for themselves at home without having to, you know, go away aware and

252
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:37.860
Kelsey Mcginty: And blah, blah, blah. But now, after I I let it work for me. I mean, if I haven't had a thought about using heroin in two years since, you know, since I

253
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.590
Kelsey Mcginty: Completely just put it down.

254
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:42.810
Natalie Austin: For you.

255
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:55.050
Kelsey Mcginty: Know my worst day like where I couldn't get a sub for a day or didn't have a sub because I couldn't, you know, find them on the streets, I would just go to sleep and wait until the next day to be able to find one.

256
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:05.730
Natalie Austin: So whenever you find out you're pregnant, you, um, do you go to a clinic them to get the sub sub attacks or how did you get it, then

257
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:12.720
Kelsey Mcginty: I went to the Center for Integrative health. There's back down a lot of doctors weren't like

258
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:20.340
Kelsey Mcginty: Something was being pregnant. I don't know if they weren't allowed or that only certain Doc, I don't know, but now

259
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:28.500
Kelsey Mcginty: But only there was only one doctor in the complete area to be able to, first of all, I'm

260
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.590
Kelsey Mcginty: pregnant ladies.

261
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.850
Kelsey Mcginty: And he was completely awful, and he told me his

262
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.320
Kelsey Mcginty: son died.

263
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.060
Kelsey Mcginty: And

264
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:45.930
Kelsey Mcginty: The entire world. I would walk out of each of my book appointments just ball tears and hope.

265
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:56.640
Kelsey Mcginty: YOU. BYE. Why walked out of the office because I was so sick of being just be little just told how much of a piece of shit. I was

266
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.170
You know,

267
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:07.770
Natalie Austin: Thanks.

268
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.750
Natalie Austin: That's awful. He treated you like that. I'm sorry.

269
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.710
Natalie Austin: Crazy just makes us look bad.

270
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.780
Kelsey Mcginty: Now that you know

271
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.530
Kelsey Mcginty: But he kind of did put like a bad taste in my mouth.

272
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.260
Kelsey Mcginty: I think

273
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.520
Kelsey Mcginty: Like doctors and stuff really changed like as far as

274
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.570
Your question.

275
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.240
Kelsey Mcginty: Everything and like

276
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.010
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, nurses, especially

277
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.420
Kelsey Mcginty: nurses were awful near the hospital.

278
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.760
Kelsey Mcginty: They were all office me

279
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.440
Kelsey Mcginty: Feel like I was just

280
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.120
Natalie Austin: That's not right.

281
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:11.280
Natalie Austin: Okay.

282
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:17.940
Natalie Austin: Um,

283
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.120
Natalie Austin: All that's changed now.

284
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.400
Natalie Austin: Just, you know, but yeah, people don't

285
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.030
Natalie Austin: They're not it's more understood now.

286
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.810
Natalie Austin: Yeah, I think, back then. No one knew what Suboxone was and

287
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.680
Natalie Austin: You know, and it's all about education, you know,

288
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.370
Kelsey Mcginty: Through the

289
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:40.440
Natalie Austin: Hated about it. So there's not a stigma. Now, at least not as much

290
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:41.550
Kelsey Mcginty: Right.

291
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:42.810

294
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.010
Natalie Austin: Eight months, whatever. And then after, after you had her you went back to ivy.

295
00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.230
Natalie Austin: Yeah. Again, yeah. Okay.

296
00:24:59.460 --> 00:24:59.700

Natalie Austin: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

301
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.130
Kelsey Mcginty: Almost two and a half. So, like, two and what for four months to inform

302
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.140
Natalie Austin: Yeah. Yep. Okay, perfect.

303
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:23.730
Natalie Austin: And what I'm see you're on the savvy, you're on the Suboxone eight slash to the tablets or the

304
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:33.330
Kelsey Mcginty: Just honestly whatever I can find to be completely honest. I mean, I mean, eight milligrams, I take two eight milligrams one in the morning, one at night.

305
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:44.820
Kelsey Mcginty: But whatever I mean whatever I can find as far as if it's tablets, though, whatever. I mean, you know, the white tablets. The yellow tablets that films.

306
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.220
Kelsey Mcginty: I mean just kind of

307
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.560
Kelsey Mcginty: Honest, whatever, it's just

308
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.140
Natalie Austin: Fine. Okay.

309
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.480
Natalie Austin: Um, so yeah. What do you want the rehab program. If I put you on the

310
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.410
Natalie Austin: Suboxone not the Savvy text, is that correct

311
00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.550
Kelsey Mcginty: Correct, yeah.

312
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:03.510
Yeah.

313
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.280
Natalie Austin: Because we usually only use Suboxone or sub you text when you're pregnant.

314
00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.050
Kelsey Mcginty: Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Kelsey Mcginty: Her dad didn't use or anything. You know, he had no idea that I was

319
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.500

320
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:56.190
Kelsey Mcginty: And then we went to court and did shared custody.

321

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.220
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah, yeah. And he

352
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:24.330
Kelsey Mcginty: It might be like it might show on there because he went like went through a period of time where his license for prescribing he didn't renew it so he had to send me to the lady across the street or across the hall, I should say.

353
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.340
Kelsey Mcginty: Until he could prescribe Suboxone again but

354
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.620
Kelsey Mcginty: Oh no, that was Susan are Arsenault or whatever. I don't know. I'm sure you probably see that

355
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.560
Kelsey Mcginty: But then I went back to him.

356
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.130
Natalie Austin: It doesn't show up. That's weird.

357
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.480
Kelsey Mcginty: Oh, that's weird.

358
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.310
Natalie Austin: And it says your last prescription wasn't

359
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:46.260
Natalie Austin: Rely

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.340
Natalie Austin: On Thursday, right,

361
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.360
Yeah.

362
00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.810
Natalie Austin: So you've been going off the street for a year and a half.

363
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.730
Natalie Austin: Almost what

364
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.740
Kelsey Mcginty: I just got insurance.

365
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.590
Kelsey Mcginty: I've been fighting with Medicaid now for

366
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:00.900
Kelsey Mcginty: Forever.

367
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.160
Natalie Austin: How did you lose it.

368
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:08.040
Kelsey Mcginty: Because I got an inheritance from my father when he passed away in 2016

369
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.650
Kelsey Mcginty: And you know, I mean,

370
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:22.800
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, we don't have to pay inheritance tax now so like, why should I just don't understand why they should go off of it. I mean, it was 20 $20,000 and, you know,

371
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:32.370
Kelsey Mcginty: That's not a lot of money nowadays I bought a house in the car and you know like I don't have money to pay every single month $500 a month for insurance.

372
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.320
Natalie Austin: I know

373
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.150
Natalie Austin: Yeah, there's a lot of money.

374
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.640
Natalie Austin: That's not even like a year salary.

375
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.230
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, very

376
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:43.980
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

377
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:53.640
Kelsey Mcginty: I mean, it was a lot of money. Yeah, you know, grateful for it, but like, you know, to be able to pay for private insurance every single month. Like, people don't understand

378
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:54.990
Natalie Austin: It is a lot

379
00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:02.610
Kelsey Mcginty: Yes, if your job a lot you know people that have jobs that provide it for them are should be so very grateful.

380
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.000
Kelsey Mcginty: No, no, because it

381
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.920
Natalie Austin: Relies on it is a van to pay for

382
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:23.490
Kelsey Mcginty: Right, and especially like if you're working like if you're living on minimum wage, you cannot afford rent or mortgage and you know insurance car insurance cell phone utilities, you cannot not on $9 an hour.

383
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.990
Natalie Austin: I pay I pay almost 13 1300

384
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:36.240
Natalie Austin: Almost 1400 dollars a month just for health insurance and the deductible is five grand. So I came in us. It

385
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.140
Natalie Austin: gets ridiculous. Yeah. I'm like, why am I paying this much money. But yeah, it's ridiculous.

386
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.210
Natalie Austin: Right. You're right.

387
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:51.810
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah. So yeah, I've been fighting with them now. So finally I guess it's been a long enough time.

388
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:53.790
Kelsey Mcginty: That I

389
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.490
Kelsey Mcginty: I was able to file again.

390
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:10.680
Kelsey Mcginty: How to get this document and that document and every single document in the world. And, you know, called JFS 5 million times and be on hold until I finally I got it. So I'm thankful

391
00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:12.270
Natalie Austin: Good.

392
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:19.590
Natalie Austin: So there, you're on on Suboxone four milligram four slash one to four milligram film.

393
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:20.610
Kelsey Mcginty: Yeah.

394
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.570
Natalie Austin: Twice a day game.

395
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:37.050
Kelsey Mcginty: Today we just kept trying to like decrease me and I kept trying to tell him and explain to them that like it's not it's not working for me, sir, and he just was not understanding it, because I think he was being pressured because he was in trouble for

396
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.250
Natalie Austin: Yeah, probably.

397
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:45.750
Kelsey Mcginty: Whatever, but like he just didn't want to hear it. And he was just like cut you down one week and not even like try to like

398
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.950
Kelsey Mcginty: You know, like he didn't have a plan, you know, and like

399
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.380
Natalie Austin: As we still practicing

400
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.720
Kelsey Mcginty: I have no idea to be

401
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.480
Natalie Austin: He sounds gonna say

402
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:01.710
Right.

403
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.700
Kelsey Mcginty: Mostly like pain management stuff. So like

404
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.140
Natalie Austin: Okay, yeah.

405
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:21.270
Kelsey Mcginty: But like I didn't. Honestly, like I would go from, you know, visit to visit, not knowing if I would have a prescription next week or not, you know, because

406
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:32.100
Kelsey Mcginty: Sometimes he just was like, Oh, well, today you're going to go down to two milligrams or something you know something ridiculous or today. I lost my license again so

407
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.260
Natalie Austin: Again, tell them

408
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.970
Kelsey Mcginty: You get a prescription today.

409
00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:43.530
Kelsey Mcginty: Like I'm out buddy, you don't understand that this stuff has it physically dependent on this stuff as well.

410
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.660
Natalie Austin: They still took your money, though, to go there.

411
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.460
Natalie Austin: It's crazy.

412
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.970
Natalie Austin: Um, so do you want to go back. You want to go back to that same to send them the Suboxone for sloshed one twice a day.

413
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.460
Natalie Austin: Sure. Okay.

414
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.470
Natalie Austin: And we have your pharmacy. Right.

415
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.160
Yeah okay, I want to take a look here.

416
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.710
Natalie Austin: Have to go to another screen here, I can do it there. Yes, actually.

417
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:21.270
Natalie Austin: Screen.

418
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:23.670
Natalie Austin: I know that

419
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:33.450
Kelsey Mcginty: Now, if the cuz I was running into a problem with the pharmacies not carrying that

420
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:46.680
Kelsey Mcginty: Okay, so it would be like, because since I guess the four milligrams strips are like weird or so i don't i don't understand it. But I would literally had a drive to join evil in

421
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:59.460
Kelsey Mcginty: It. I think it was over in like by Youngstown, they get to be able to even just get half of my script filled because none of them even had any like like

422
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.650
Kelsey Mcginty: Even just that partial script around here.

423
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.920
Kelsey Mcginty: Because it isn't something they said they keep stocked

424
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:10.020
Kelsey Mcginty: Okay, I don't know if maybe you could call the pharmacies are some

425
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.260

Natalie Austin: If there's a problem.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.680
Natalie Austin: We could just, I could order the AIDS and you can just cut it in half.

428
00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:27.390
Natalie Austin: Either credit tablet or cut. Cut the strips or chop the tech the tablet either one.

429
