7
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And iPad is like

8
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that sound like

9
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.760
It's

10
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

11
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get a note open for us.

12
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Get oriented here.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Stones.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Bodies back to feeling okay

15
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.730
Or no

16
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Not there.

17
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
Bethany Shadid: Probably tell you that currently I am trying really hard to calm down.

18
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.650
Bethany Shadid: I had a really tough week. Yeah.

19
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.820
Bethany Shadid: I'm considering quitting. Yeah, okay, well,

20
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's go, let's go with that.

21
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.150
Bethany Shadid: And so because. Today is Monday.

22
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.070
Bethany Shadid: The things that I wait to do till Monday when like it's normal business hours and I can get ahold of people

23
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.760
Bethany Shadid: I it's overwhelming.

24
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.680
Bethany Shadid: With the thought of having to go back to work the next day too.

25
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.840
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, and so

26
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.340
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, my stress level is probably at a good 7080

27
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.210
Okay.

28
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so it's high. Alright, so now what is it that you want to be feeling when we're done working today. What is it that you want to be thinking, what is it that you want to be feeling let's let's get there.

29
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.160
Bethany Shadid: I want to be.

30
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.440
Bethany Shadid: Feeling confidence.

31
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.080
Bethany Shadid: In myself.

32
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.920
Bethany Shadid: So that I can

33
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: get stuff done.

34
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.460
Yeah.

35
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.310
Bethany Shadid: And stop getting pushed around or letting it you know

36
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.620
Bethany Shadid: Let things. Sure. Okay. All right.

37
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now the predominant thought that you're having is why, which is the one that wipes you out as soon as you even get close to this thought about yourself. What is it,

38
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.890
Bethany Shadid: Thought about myself.

39
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.450
Bethany Shadid: Well, my

40
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.000
Bethany Shadid: The job that I do has come into criticism every day this week.

41
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.370
Bethany Shadid: By

42
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.240
Bethany Shadid: Somebody below me and that person has my manager.

43
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.090
Bethany Shadid: I'm

44
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.840
Bethany Shadid: Jumping every time they think something I have done is wrong. And it's exhausting.

45
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I can completely understand that is an uncomfortable work environment that's completely. And do you, do you have any perspective, if you come back even an inch or a foot.

46
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that this is a broken system. This system doesn't work. That should not be happening.

47
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.240
Bethany Shadid: Oh,

48
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.100
Bethany Shadid: Hundred percent confidence.

49
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and yet.

50
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.200
Bethany Shadid: When

51
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It really comes down to it, who's actually being punished.

52
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you getting punished.

53
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.870
Bethany Shadid: You're

54
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:17.820
Bethany Shadid: Currently, yes. You know how me. We talked about, okay, let's be let's come back to reality. Is this a perceived threat, you know, or no, this is a very real threat now.

55
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me, why did you put get put on notice. Is there a written something, something, something. What makes you say that

56
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.350
Bethany Shadid: Well, I had

57
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.830
Bethany Shadid: Called out a day last week for my kidney stone.

58
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.490
Bethany Shadid: Mm hmm. I probably should have called off another day. But, um, you know, I didn't

59
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.590
Bethany Shadid: And

60
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:59.460
Bethany Shadid: I was okay. I just wasn't 100% and found out that even though I messaged my boss, the day that I called out and said that I would really appreciate it.

61
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.100
Bethany Shadid: If we could postpone the RN meeting that I've been asking to have since November.

62
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.050
November.

63
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.600
Bethany Shadid: Until I got back

64
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:24.510
Bethany Shadid: I heard no response. And when I got back Wednesday, I got a lovely email. Of all the things they covered in the RM meeting which

65
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.860
Bethany Shadid: I don't know how they can do that with only one are in, but okay.

66
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:48.540
Bethany Shadid: But that's how things have been done later on, it's, it's very much management is not in my clinic, they're down at the other clinic. They don't see what's going on in mind, but they are managing things from afar. Does that make sense. Like there.

67
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.750
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, and

68
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.750
Bethany Shadid: So,

69
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:12.450
Bethany Shadid: The meeting notes, pretty much Melanie and the MA Vanessa decided a whole bunch of things. And my friend Stacy that I worked with happened to be there because there was

70
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:27.420
Bethany Shadid: She was in the meeting right afterwards and her my the supervisors, say, okay, well, looks good. I'll write down everything if Bethany has any questions, she can just ask me about it.

71
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.270
Bethany Shadid: So there was really no

72
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:45.840
Bethany Shadid: No. No. Nobody needed and or wanted my input on anything, even though it's been something I've really wanted for a long time and I really bottle things up to bring into that forum.

73
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.480
Bethany Shadid: So,

74
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.500
After that,

75
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.790
Bethany Shadid: Um,

76
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.390
Bethany Shadid: My manager told me the next day.

77
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.400
Bethany Shadid: That

78
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.270
Bethany Shadid: We're getting this cardiac group.

79
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.590
Bethany Shadid: In addition, and that my job role is really going to change.

80
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:24.690
Bethany Shadid: Their he will need me to transition in there and I'm going to start working there every Thursday.

81
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.530
Bethany Shadid: And put doesn't give me a defined, you know, like he's very bad about

82
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.900
Bethany Shadid: jumping the gun and

83
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.880
Bethany Shadid: Trying to switch things up. But then he doesn't make it clear what your job rollers and I'm tired of the back and forth.

84
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.860
Bethany Shadid: Um,

85
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:56.760
Bethany Shadid: And so basically after that the medical assistant. Oh, and then I found out

86
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.390
Bethany Shadid: Or was was told.

87
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.980
Bethany Shadid: That my medical assistant was being taken away.

88
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.690
Bethany Shadid: And she was going to work with the doctor because they had a hole to fill

89
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:21.720
Bethany Shadid: So now I don't have no okay and the other me that works with Melanie was going to be taking over this little part of

90
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.820
Bethany Shadid: Stuff, which this happened before. And she had a meltdown and I had to take it over again so

91
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.600
Bethany Shadid: All of that to say that ever since that happened she has been

92
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:51.240
Bethany Shadid: Trying. So basically, how do I even say this, she by taking this over, she can dictate my schedule.

93
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

94
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.630
Yeah.

95
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.850
Bethany Shadid: Meaning that

96
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.290
Bethany Shadid: She can schedule appointments for me.

97
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.870
Bethany Shadid: And

98
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.250
Bethany Shadid: So I was just getting a barrage of

99
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:20.580
Bethany Shadid: Questions and schedule changes. And then finally, the, the worst part was on Friday.

100
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:33.540
Bethany Shadid: I was dealing with a very critical situation and I get a call from my manager out. Uh huh. I answered the phone. I'm like, hello. He's like,

101
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.350
Bethany Shadid: What's going on. He's like, I'm

102
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.400
Bethany Shadid: Your Vanessa. Can't get ahold of you.

103
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.530
Bethany Shadid: And I was like, What are you talking about, I've been communicating with her all morning.

104
00:10:47.490 --> 00:11:03.450
Bethany Shadid: He said, Well, she she just called me and told me that she hasn't been able to get ahold of you. She has an urgent situation, you need to be available. You need to make yourself available. This is a requirements, blah, blah, blah. I got chewed out by him basically saying that

105
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.480
Bethany Shadid: It's a recurrent theme that I'm the one that's not communicating

106
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:28.410
Bethany Shadid: Even though I've been communicating with this person, all morning by our instant message and work just so happened that I had to deal with a critical situation. And so he sent me a message saying that she had an urgent situation I needed to call for

107
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:48.300
Bethany Shadid: Probably a little over an hour elapsed before I get this call from my manager telling me that I need to respond quicker. And it turns out that it wasn't an urgent situation, but I had to sit on the phone with this girl and

108
00:11:51.090 --> 00:12:02.490
Bethany Shadid: And and deal with what she wanted and or needed in that moment, you know, take and we had a staff meeting later that evening.

109
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.810
Bethany Shadid: And there was a

110
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.220
Bethany Shadid: Woman there from human resources.

111
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:30.180
Bethany Shadid: She, she was going over some survey that was done before. I was there and talking about things that human resources could do to help with this that me other. And so I thought, okay, well, maybe this is good. Maybe me know she can help.

112
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:39.120
Bethany Shadid: And then my manager took over the rest of the staff meeting and

113
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:52.740
Bethany Shadid: blindsided me with a lot of information and changes that are happening that I was not aware of it all. So it's very clear to me that I'm very absolute

114
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:20.550
Bethany Shadid: And I can't, I feel honestly truly is. If this is what he wants me to focus on if he's going to call me because I have to be available in a couple every second, as in the words of this medical assistant. I need you to get, I need you to respond to me or the standard is under an hour.

115
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.300
Bethany Shadid: And I'm supposed to be.

116
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:39.300
Bethany Shadid: Helping start this new unit or whatever my job roles not defined. I was really stressed out all week and I'm trying my best to

117
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.820
Bethany Shadid: You know, get back into a good headspace and

118
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.620
Bethany Shadid: Um, but the hard thing was is I had three employees, tell me.

119
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.000
Bethany Shadid: You know that if it

120
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:19.740
Bethany Shadid: That they're considering leaving to because of this or that. If I go, they are going to go. And so it was a lot of extra weight pressure. And when I I asked my manager to talk

121
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:41.850
Bethany Shadid: About the issues. He said, Well, what's going on. I said, Well, to be honest, I was really offended that even though I asked to have this meeting since November, that it wasn't postponed, and it went ahead without me. And he was like, well, that's only because you were out

122
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:54.270
Bethany Shadid: What is Steven mean you know so I said, but there's there's really important things that I needed to bring up in that meeting. And I've been waiting and asking for for a long time.

123
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you say to that.

124
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:02.520
Bethany Shadid: He said, Okay, well, do me a favor and shoot me an email.

125
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:09.810
Bethany Shadid: Just me some bullet points of what you needed to talk about. Okay, so I was like okay

126
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.150
Bethany Shadid: I never got there. Okay.

127
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:31.380
Bethany Shadid: Every day I would be like, Okay, I'm gonna, I'm going to send an email to them and send them an email, you know, granted, I only worked three days last week. But in that short amount of time a lot was happening and

128
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.520
Bethany Shadid: I wasn't the only one so stressed out.

129
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:43.800
Bethany Shadid: I had one coworker told me that she was having chest pain because of it all and

130
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:54.240
Bethany Shadid: That's how I feel, too, like that. That keeps that tension that hurt re just pounding um

131
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.630
Bethany Shadid: You know i i got

132
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:05.610
Bethany Shadid: Very much was able to say to myself, You know what, this isn't worth it.

133
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.620
Bethany Shadid: That's right. This is not worth it.

134
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:16.260
Bethany Shadid: And started considering alternatives plans.

135
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:26.490
Bethany Shadid: My friend said, Boy, you should take that you should ask to just get moved over to the cardiac area, but I said

136
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.660
Bethany Shadid: He's still the manager. So what

137
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:40.530
Bethany Shadid: You know, I don't want to just because really what it is, is it's almost like he's transitioning me over to this other area.

138
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:54.180
Bethany Shadid: So he can fill a slot and not have to deal with the other stuff going on between me and Melanie and this Ma, you just gonna remove me and stick me over here. Yeah, so not have to deal with it.

139
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.810
Bethany Shadid: So,

140
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one. What do you want

141
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want

142
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.170
Bethany Shadid: To be

143
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:14.730
Bethany Shadid: Treated as an equal respected is equal have my my clinical expertise, respected, and if that can't happen. I'm gone.

144
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:24.990
Bethany Shadid: Okay, I really like it's devastating because I put so much into this but it's making me sick.

145
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.500
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, it really is.

146
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can see that and

147
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.040
Yeah.

148
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

149
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.420
Bethany Shadid: So the

150
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.620
First

151
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:51.600
Bethany Shadid: Go ahead. I know the church. It was great. I needed it. Yeah, I did things that I was supposed to do. I looked up yoga, stuff like that. But it's Monday, and I think that's why I'm in this

152
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I gotcha.

153
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.420
Bethany Shadid: So,

154
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's both. And what I'm seeing is this tenacious.

155
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: In its simplest terms, and we've been here before. But you're only going to know this line when when you've lived it.

156
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.390
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

157
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: If you respect it yourself, Bethany, you'd walk in.

158
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And be unpoliced

159
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You aren't there yet.

160
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not there. This I

161
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you know how much I care about you hope you feel it deeply

162
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's with just the most generous of spirit and heart that I say my worst fear is

163
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to go find the same setting again because you're there.

164
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't see

165
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That you give away your power so fast.

166
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: There is an alternative

167
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Universe.

168
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not sensitive

169
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To these people's opinions. It is back to back, one after another. Oh my gosh, you guys didn't right it's oh my gosh, you guys had this meeting, but I had so much I had so much. I wanted to share it. I thought this was my gig, um,

170
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how do I get this. How do I do this then. When's the next one.

171
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet you have a chain reaction of emotional intensity that waves through you. That makes none of that possible.

172
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: How they do this and you were offended.

173
00:19:52.860 --> 00:20:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Out here. Right. And that's what's the privilege of being the therapist is we can see all this stuff. We're not feeling it so it's easier for us to see it to me, get you out of this intense house. You go into this job.

174
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: They're like, Oh my gosh, you're going to be great for this job, you have all these skills. This is going to be a we need You so badly.

175
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I can see that out here and you are exactly that. You're amazing. And in fact, they want to rush you in. They want to get you in as quickly as they can.

176
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But what exists there that you couldn't see in the interview is a toxic work environment is a lot of dysfunction people spend 810 hours a day at work all their crap. All that baggage from families, not unlike yours are getting played out at work.

177
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Fact,

178
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a fact.

179
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about you.

180
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: This nonsense existed before you

181
00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He has it will carry on in his Kookiness watch when you leave you are long gone, it will continue to be cookie.

182
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:02.700
Bethany Shadid: You didn't

183
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Cause it had nothing to do with you now. How come I can say that, but you are hurting so badly is nothing to do with you.

184
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:36.240
Bethany Shadid: Well, I think I've gotten a lot better at detaching myself, my friend actually asked me straight up. Yeah, she said about this alternative position right the cardiac position. She's like, I think you should do it. She's like, ask yourself in all yeah what's holding you back.

185
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:45.450
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, she's like, I want to know. She goes, because this isn't good for you. It's not good for your health. You're not going to change anybody

186
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:51.480
Bethany Shadid: You know you wouldn't deal with these people that make your life miserable and Dutta Dutta duh.

187
00:21:52.620 --> 00:22:02.520
Bethany Shadid: And other than having the same manager, what I what I it ultimately came down to is

188
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.810
Bethany Shadid: Feeling like I'm

189
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:27.150
Bethany Shadid: Walking away from something I've invested everything into because I like you said, I put all this into it, even if I've gotten better at not caring if Melanie doesn't like me for so and so doesn't like me. I still

190
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.710
Bethany Shadid: It's, it's

191
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.470
Bethany Shadid: I'm trying to think of the right

192
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:47.310
Bethany Shadid: Because it it's not been able to completely detach know right that's very obvious. Yeah.

193
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I suspect it's the same mechanism of wanting the acknowledgement for that energy put in. Now you may not like that. Right, but

194
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: To see change to see that see your value outside of yourself. But the real gift. The real gift of detachment is you can invest in love deeply all of that puts your heart and soul into something, then you just lift your hands and you're like a

195
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Leader just lift your hands.

196
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not your job to change them truly it's not

197
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about you going and enjoying who you are recognizing sooner and earlier. Look at me playing out this same storyline. I'm doing it again.

198
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm taking on other people's negative opinion of me as fact. And it's waking me out. It's doing it again, again, again,

199
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What's happening again.

200
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already on it. Yeah, you're already about to quit anyway.

201
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.200
Bethany Shadid: Well, knowing this about myself.

202
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.480
Bethany Shadid: I met like you know that place where

203
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.580
Bethany Shadid: I like quitting has become an option right because I don't

204
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.380
Bethany Shadid: Have you say

205
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.300
Bethany Shadid: It was like, I take a stand, almost and

206
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.470
Bethany Shadid: And so

207
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.130
Bethany Shadid: Steam almost feels like

208
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.380
Bethany Shadid: Not

209
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:54.720
Bethany Shadid: Being there for myself. But I also know another job isn't just going to be perfect. I'm going to deal with the same things. Again, I haven't completely given up on the idea that this I could find it.

210
00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.810
Bethany Shadid: Be okay you know, finding an okay place here but

211
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Take like I know but take the analogy of over here, this hand right you see this hand wanting so badly for your mother to finally see you to get you that see all your sacrifice. Just be acknowledged and validated.

212
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks out here right as an external witness the same as the workplace. And what did you need to do you need to leave you needed to leave on

213
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She will never see you. This is a psychological phenomenon. She has emerged of, you know, object. She cannot differentiate you from her period where she doesn't know how to manage her own emotions. She cannot see the distinction between you two. That's not going anywhere.

214
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You had to leave people do have to leave.

215
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You are not weak. You did not fail.

216
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You did not fail.

217
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: If what you did is you decided I'm worth not getting kidney stones.

218
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And and proving to the world that I can tolerate this level of misery that that I'm this is what toughness looks like or I need to make my stand here, right. This could be the one where you you speak your truth.

219
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do that, but I've we've been trying that approach we've been doing that one. How about you, you, you. Be present you be assertive, you've been doing that and it's it's

220
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You aren't doing it. You're a little bit. You told me

221
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: If you would, did it my right, this sort of pure and clean way where you said, the alternative is they can me or I walked off the job of broccoli. I've already come to that. But, and no uncertain terms, am I going to compromise any minute.

222
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Of my time here and it will every single second be about. Well, that might be true for you. But that's not my truth. So let's get back on topic if you had that chutzpah that confidence inside. Okay. You could tolerate that environment, but you're not there, it's hurting you.

223
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean you're not gonna, you're not going to get get get get get an environment. What do you know about rest.

224
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Test for healing to happen. Am I right, don't we do all our healing when we're resting over sleeping. You need it, you move out of this intense after intense, then you're in this marriage. This attic, now you're back at the house, your fire fire fire. Now you're in a job with the fire.

225
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What's wrong with rust and the truth. You do know you're still going to have the friction of having to face the discomfort of validating yourself, you're still going to be faced with. If you still working without let's say

226
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still going to feel it, but it'll be less frequent it'll it won't be this bombardment.

227
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You get a chance to put a little bit slower than get some success under your belt. You've already seen it.

228
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.080
Bethany Shadid: I yeah I'm glad you

229
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.860
Bethany Shadid: How should I say I'm with you on that. I don't. I know I

230
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:36.030
Bethany Shadid: It's all you know all or nothing for me. Sometimes in my head. Yeah, but

231
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:48.240
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I mean I think it's what feels right. You know, I mean, my last day of work. I couldn't even sleep.

232
00:28:48.660 --> 00:29:14.370
Bethany Shadid: Oh, to go to bed to come to work because it was so, like, you know, we've been talking about distress, like, yeah, that's fear or that fight or flight like laying in bed and not being able to sleep because of the, you know, sound of your heart just perfectly

233
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we do today a little differently. Why don't we have, let's do a different exercise we think

234
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We think coming at this with the Socratic

235
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We've been coming at it with Kanya behavioral we've been coming at it by, you know, increasing the the body awareness and you've done so many things that have gotten you ready for this other work.

236
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of other work.

237
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.630
Bethany Shadid: Okay. Oh.

238
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Intellectually, you already have it.

239
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You already got it.

240
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you have this additional hot, you know, knowing your body when it gets hot. Something's happening. That's

241
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.720
Bethany Shadid: Very cool. Yeah, yeah.

242
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. Here we go.

243
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get the setup. Right. And it may not happen today because I really still need to take care of you. Make sure we do the the preparation part. Okay, right now I want you to picture.

244
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: These three figures. The first figure is real or imagined.

245
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:20.940
Bethany Shadid: Your protective figure

246
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know who comes up, what comes up again. This can be real or imagined when you picture and later on we're going to be using using this into the work we're going to do what comes up for a protective figure

247
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:43.920
Bethany Shadid: It's

248
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:46.110
Some

249
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.980
Bethany Shadid: A few friends came to mind.

250
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We have their names.

251
00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.640
Bethany Shadid: Monique Monique, Katie. Katie

252
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.840
Bethany Shadid: They're very

253
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.060
Bethany Shadid: Tough people

254
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:07.530
Ah,

255
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.850
Bethany Shadid: They always

256
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Tough friends Monique and Katie who look out for me.

257
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.450
That's beautiful.

258
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.400
That's beautiful.

259
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

260
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.690
Just be present with them.

261
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's real. These are real people. Okay, that have your best interests in mind that register.

262
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Threat danger and put forward the sense of safety. Okay.

263
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything else to this protective figure that comes to mind or

264
00:31:59.340 --> 00:31:59.790
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

265
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:00.510
What

266
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.290
Bethany Shadid: They both have a good sense of humor.

267
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.960
Bethany Shadid: We're very thankful

268
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.390
Bethany Shadid: And

269
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.420
Bethany Shadid: You know, like how we do reality.

270
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.950
Bethany Shadid: They never do it.

271
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.310
Bethany Shadid: Right, you want to hear.

272
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.580
Bethany Shadid: It, you know, they're, they

273
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:36.240
Bethany Shadid: They, they would be, they would, they would get me to a place where we could laugh about stuff, you know, it was like

274
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:42.420
Bethany Shadid: This person did this really awful thing, you know, but by the end, we were like,

275
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:45.840
Bethany Shadid: An over it.

276
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.370
Beautiful.

277
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we've got this protective figure tough friends Monique and Katie who look out for you and have a good sense of humor that can give you a reality check and get you to a place where you can laugh.

278
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a real strong imagery there at the sound you can kind of picture them sense of humor. Now move to another fear. We're going to do three. The other one is a nurturing figure real or imagined what comes up.

279
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.830
Bethany Shadid: The first thing that came up is

280
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:37.590
Bethany Shadid: For this woman named Becky Wilson. Okay, I think I've told you about for before but she's like a second mom.

281
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.530
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, she's friends with my mom. I grew up with her and her boys, but

282
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.890
Bethany Shadid: I call her my second molar

283
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. Second, Mama, and anything

284
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To nurturing figure

285
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.000
Bethany Shadid: She's just so

286
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.240
Bethany Shadid: Sweet and thoughtful about what's going on and

287
00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:18.360
Bethany Shadid: I I've been able to connect with her on a spiritual level that I don't, I'm not able to with a lot of people

288
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:21.840
Bethany Shadid: And

289
00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.730
Bethany Shadid: I had a dream about her. When I was little, that she was an angel.

290
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:37.020
Bethany Shadid: And when I woke up I was convinced that she really was an angel.

291
00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.710
Bethany Shadid: And for the longest time

292
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.540
Bethany Shadid: I thought

293
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.980
Bethany Shadid: I had to keep it secret or she would go away.

294
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.890
Bethany Shadid: So I, I always had this like imagery of her being Joel

295
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:59.460
Bethany Shadid: And then one way that grew up. I told her about it. So yeah.

296
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.500
Bethany Shadid: Beautiful.

297
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Becky Wilson as a second mama sort of this spiritual connection and really the imagery of of seeing her as an angel. That's great.

298
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about a wise figure

299
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.760
real or imagined.

300
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.230
Bethany Shadid: I would say it's

301
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.770
Bethany Shadid: So let's do it. Yeah.

302
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.600
Bethany Shadid: God, that's beautiful.

303
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little work with this and you're

304
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I CAD. So I'm thinking we should be able to do it.

305
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway,

306
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to share my screen with you and it's going to be slow and try to get kind of close enough that your eyes.

307
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.310
Bethany Shadid: Can move. Yeah.

308
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.370
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. Oh.

309
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.750
Sorry.

310
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get a little bit closer into this imagery. Okay.

311
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's have a little bit more experienced at it, make sure it's right in front of you so that you're getting left and right movement. It's right in front of me. Right.

312
00:36:51.660 --> 00:37:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what I want you to do is is bring up that imagery and really get a feel for the presence of the wisdom of God and Becky Wilson is this angel.

313
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense of your two friends protecting

314
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And have them interact with each other as a team, trying to get as much visualization with your eyes closed, if you can, and then later I'll have you open and really see them interacting connecting

315
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This project protection.

316
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurture ends.

317
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.020

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: As a team.

319
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All in service as a resource to you.

320
00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Happened to be lived reality. So they're not fictitious. These are real. These are things that you actually know have kicked around to be true.

321
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And let it be present all the quality

322
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Of safety.

323
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing that wants your growth and development.

324
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And wisdom.

325
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you get that very clear in your mind open your eyes. And I'm going to start this stimulation here.

326
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it in your imagination and your presence really see your present with them and body surrounded

327
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it move through that core

328
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Body of yours.

329
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it saturate

330
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Each other. Let's breathe in Nice, inhale into that belly and then

331
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go.

332
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, it seemed like this presence is more solidified more accessible.

333
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.110
Bethany Shadid: It's getting there.

334
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them up again.

335
00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:56.790
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

336
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you need to do to make them even more present

337
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:10.620
Bethany Shadid: I think I had to. I had to figure out logistics, but I did now.

338
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.080
Bethany Shadid: So, yeah.

339
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This team. You can label it if you want to have something comes up, Becky, your two friends and God

340
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Truly integrating the logistics that you just created having them.

341
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: A team available.

342
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe then nice inhale into the belly.

343
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Of body know that you're safe and have a nice healthy exhale breathing out the mouth and

344
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just letting it go

345
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to talk a little bit for just a brief moment and then we're going to go back

346
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to pull up this this fret, whether it's the past or maybe it's a current trigger or maybe it's a worry about the future. We can work in any of those three areas. She did pull one up. That's distressing at about maybe maybe 60 or 70 be something that is upsetting, but

347
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Not so activating that you can't think straight

348
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me know what you got it in your mind's eye.

349
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be what we're talking about. It might be on that topic. You'd be talking with someone, or making a decision. I don't know what came up

350
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:22.320
Bethany Shadid: somebody's asking me to put my god into Word.

351
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. Hold on to that and what distress level is that as you think about that.

352
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.700
Bethany Shadid: It's a 60 to 70 depending on what it is. Okay.

353
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the emotion attached to this image.

354
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.890
Bethany Shadid: Frustration, because

355
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.910
Bethany Shadid: Of the dyslexia. It's basically like asking

356
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to plan it

357
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You just, yeah, that's your truth. Okay.

358
00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And because of this dyslexia you attribute. Right. It's this frustration and you can picture somebody asking you, right.

359
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And is this al asking you to put it in writing or is it a future request.

360
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.200
Bethany Shadid: Currently it's okay.

361
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that in this is this is going to these by laterals will be a little

362
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: While I haven't decided yet. So here we go. We've got this this image pull up that WORST piece.

363
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The worst image of that event.

364
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing this emotion is frustrating.

365
00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to tell me what do you believe about yourself as you think these things and

366
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the belief about you.

367
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.500
Bethany Shadid: That I'm completely capable

368
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.800
Bethany Shadid: Of making or or speaking my truth.

369
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:01.350
Bethany Shadid: And

370
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the negative thought about you.

371
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:12.570
Well,

372
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.370
Bethany Shadid: Actually, I think what I just realized is it's like

373
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:22.980
Bethany Shadid: I

374
00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:34.410
Bethany Shadid: You know, how is telling you the 100 is is making me physically have to like be somewhere.

375
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.620
Bethany Shadid: How do I work I'm

376
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:59.220
Bethany Shadid: Like physically being forced. That was the first thing that I thought of when I imagined. Our shutting me down telling me to jot some bullet points down of my concerns was

377
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.840
Shut down

378
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.200
Bethany Shadid: Was no it was like

379
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:11.430
Bethany Shadid: When I said frustration that idea of limiting

380
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:21.870
Bethany Shadid: Or forcing the conversation to be done in the way that he prefers. Yeah. Does that make sense so

381
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.680
All that

382
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.410
Bethany Shadid: Way. Yeah.

383
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Being forced

384
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To change what you feel capable of doing into something something else from a verbal

385
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know explanation into right into writing put in any all put it in bullet points.

386
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your belief about yourself. What do you believe about you.

387
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.690
Bethany Shadid: That I can communicate my means.

388
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.170
Bethany Shadid: I just need. I need time. Okay.

389
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is that this is a different scale from one to seven. How true is it absolutely true at the seven I can communicate my needs.

390
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And one is no not really.

391
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:18.390
Five.

392
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.130
Okay.

393
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.530
Bethany Shadid: Pregnant in the middle.

394
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.900
Bethany Shadid: I know that my emotions get in the way. Sometimes

395
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: All different so just just that Quick quick quick share

396
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Have once you to pull up

397
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: To pull up that worst image in your mind where the desensitization part of the MTR comes in. Okay.

398
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.680
She did pull up

399
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst part of that event.

400
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.770
Bethany Shadid: So the one that we're just talking about you.

401
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one you were you just had, which is, I'm assuming it's the put into a bullet points.

402
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.660
Bethany Shadid: Right. Right. Okay.

403
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:07.920
Bethany Shadid: God in your work.

404
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.120
Working memory.

405
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just want to check

406
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any negative thought about yourself when you hold that image in your mind.

407
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.280
Bethany Shadid: The only thing I can think is being

408
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.400
Bethany Shadid: upset that I let him get away with that.

409
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:43.410
Bethany Shadid: That I didn't

410
00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:53.880
Bethany Shadid: speak my truth in that moment and and and explain that. That's not the method I prefer to

411
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there it is. Now what do you, what do you believe about yourself that you did not

412
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Speak up.

413
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:06.780
Bethany Shadid: But I'm not assertive.

414
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And how true is that from this one's different from one to 10 How true is that I'm not assertive.

415
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.980
Bethany Shadid: Pro bring me

416
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're going to do that one first. So, this this cycle is going to be a little faster.

417
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to pull up the worst image of that event, you're going to hold the thought in your head. I'm not assertive. Okay.

418
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.930
Okay.

419
00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to slow this down. I mean, I actually need to speed it up, make sure I'm going the right direction, you should do it. Okay.

420
00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You hold the image worst part of that event might want to include that body, you may have missed that, too. As soon as you realize you did it. Okay, I'm not a sort of

421
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a little faster.

422
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and I'm not sharing. I'm sitting here, staring at myself.

423
00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:18.780
Bethany Shadid: Like

424
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, where's her face though it's not she being shared. That doesn't help anybody

425
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold it in your mind's eye, this is how it gets worked as a habit and working memory got that image.

426
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got this negative cognition. I'm not assertive.

427
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe again. Nice. Inhale.

428
00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

Bethany Shadid: I noticed, the more I thought about it, and held it in my mind.

436
00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:52.380

Gwenevere Abriel: What's the thought what's coming up.

451
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.890
Bethany Shadid: Um, I think, an awareness of

452
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:41.250
Bethany Shadid: How my need to

453
00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:47.460
Bethany Shadid: To please others or to be liked.

454
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:50.820
Bethany Shadid: gets in my way of being assertive.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to go with that pull up that image worst part of that picture.

456
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.590

Gwenevere Abriel: What do you find

462
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.430
Bethany Shadid: What came up was that

463
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:07.680
Bethany Shadid: I'm I'm wanting to please can be liked, but

464
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.980
Bethany Shadid: It's, it's impossible.

465
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.350
Bethany Shadid: It's, um,

466
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that.

467
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Up that image, pull it up, bring it up Yaki that negative piece worst part of that memory fragment. This is impossible.

468
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: In a nice inhale feel to come into your nose and your lungs and down into the bottom

469
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that long. Yeah.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.110
Bethany Shadid: Thinking about it.

472
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:36.570
Bethany Shadid: We know it's impossible to do that, even though I tried to, I was thinking of all the different

473
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:41.820
Bethany Shadid: Ways, or all all the things I was taking on

474
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:46.110
Bethany Shadid: You know and and how it really isn't feasible.

475
00:55:50.250 --> 00:56:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do one more piece I'm going to slow this down a little bit. And while I'm said resetting this, I want you to be thinking about your team and immerse yourself in whatever comfortable perfect way, you can

476
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.020
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Is present with you.

479
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: All that is the quality of protection.

480
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurture ence wisdom and hold those figures in your mind.

481
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: integrate them logistically

482
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: With you near you, embodied in you. However, you need to so that that quality is very present

483
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to pull up that WORST piece of being told.

484
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Like she put that into some bullet points.

485
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together.

486
00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, letting it go

487
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing.

488
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:45.540
Bethany Shadid: New ideas.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:02.670
Bethany Shadid: When you get when I get so anxious and stressed.

491
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:12.360
Bethany Shadid: ideas for how to deal with it are pretty small or

492
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Limited. Uh huh.

493
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.850
Bethany Shadid: And visualizing

494
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:21.150
Bethany Shadid: My, my people.

495
00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: People with

496
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:24.330
Me.

497
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.290
Bethany Shadid: It was like the protection

498
00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.130
Bethany Shadid: But the wisdom.

499
00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.590
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, it

500
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.710
Bethany Shadid: Didn't seem so

501
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:46.770
Bethany Shadid: Limited

502
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your stress level right now. What's your suds

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do one more.

Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll bring them up close. Okay, so really get into get into that imagery. I have new options I have more comfort.

Gwenevere Abriel: I have options I have comfort with your people.

509
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, pull up that negative piece.

510
01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Much you've got it. Let's take a look at this dot here.

511
01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through the nose.

512
01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How's the body, how's the mind. How we doing

Bethany Shadid: Doing good.

514
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.470
Bethany Shadid: I think I solidified the imagery, a little bit more

515
01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about the body. What's happening for you right now.

516
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:18.090
Bethany Shadid: Oh, it's a million times better.

517
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:26.910
Bethany Shadid: Just muscles not being tight heart rate being slow, slow down. I'm not hot.

518
01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.090
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

519
01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Wherever you decide to go in your mind, between now and tomorrow or whatever you want to do.

520
01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Just have that those people near you have them with you when you're deciding know is, is this a thought. You want to go it alone, or do you want to have these guys with you.

521
01:01:55.470 --> 01:02:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: really strongly encourage you to have them with you as you making these decisions, do I really want to spend this time questioning whether I leave this job, stay. Do I want to question what I did. That's where you want to put your energy, you're going to do it anyway, which you do anyway.

522
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then bring them your

523
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do it alone, bring them with you have them be present, because in this relaxed body.

524
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know your your brains going to work a lot better, faster, stronger.

525
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.250
There, there were

526
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Options when your sympathetic nervous system is activated.

527
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:41.370
Bethany Shadid: Right.

528
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

529
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.350
Bethany Shadid: True. Yeah, I don't even think about that.

530
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Science right there.

531
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:55.830
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, anyway, I'm, I'm talking to somebody in insurance about my

532
01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:07.500
Bethany Shadid: Billing and stuff, because I know I haven't been able to come as much. It's getting really expensive. So hopefully I'll be able to sort that out soon.

533
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:11.250
Bethany Shadid: But I'm planning on coming to group in the morning.

534
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, great. This topic is a good one.

535
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:16.830
Okay, and

536
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything charged that you need to put either in a container or maybe send on a distancing metaphor, whether it's kind of putting it on a little leaf as it's moving down the river and you're on the side, bang.

537
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: With

538
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:45.660
Bethany Shadid: A gun met before that imagery with another therapist before I'm not that I can think of. Well, my like should I quit my job or not or

539
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:47.430
Bethany Shadid: You know,

540
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about this, Bethany, and then I'll bring it to a close. If you went ahead.

541
01:03:55.230 --> 01:04:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe leave that here as we as we end our session and and say, well, if I went ahead and the decision of whether to or not to what trips and on down.

542
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead, what you're left with is the confidence that might come the peace the comfort when you're with your people. Maybe you don't have to make a decision right now maybe being there tomorrow will just feel different. Maybe there's no decision decision.

543
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it'll be made.

544
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that will be the choice, but maybe not. Maybe you'll experience tomorrow differently with your people present

545
01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:42.900
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I never thought about

546
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.270
Bethany Shadid: But it's true.

547
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.970
Maybe you don't need one.

548
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.790
Bethany Shadid: Cuz that you do my job.

549
01:04:54.690 --> 01:05:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, good put you can put it in the jar or send it down the river, put it in a car train on train tracks and have it. Get some distance

550
01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is everything you need to meet whatever happens made all today is just be present with your people, whenever your to do lists. Just go to your to do list, but make sure you include these guys with you. Make sure they're there with you.

551
01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:23.730
