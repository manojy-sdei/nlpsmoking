19
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.950
Lindsay Short: I think it was untreated depression. I had a pretty extensive history of

20
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.680
Lindsay Short: Depression hospitalizations things mostly a long time ago, but

21
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.350
Lindsay Short: And no, not in the last few years. I mean, I've been on any every medication under the sun. At some point, but

26
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.110
davi pakter: How long has the depression been going on.

27
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.940
Lindsay Short: Since I was 21

28
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.520
davi pakter: Okay years

29
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.950
davi pakter: It's something that happened at that time.

30
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.080
Lindsay Short: Oh, it was I've been through this and therapy lot and it was like

31
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.800
Lindsay Short: That's time in my life when things went to shit.

32
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.020
davi pakter: Okay.

33
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.540

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.230

35
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.370
Lindsay Short: Um, yeah, to kind of serious

36
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.040
davi pakter: Two times they were serious.

37
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.630
Lindsay Short: I mean obviously

38
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.070
Lindsay Short: Like

39
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.060
Lindsay Short: Okay, I am overdosed once and then I am

40
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.650
Lindsay Short: And this is all a very, very long time ago.

41
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.110
davi pakter: Okay, so let's talk about

42
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.600
Lindsay Short: mid 20s, at the latest.

43
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.370
davi pakter: Okay, so you had to

44
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.860
davi pakter: At least two

45
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.590
davi pakter: Yeah, suicide attempts.

46
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.350
davi pakter: in your 20s and then

47
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.360
davi pakter: Once you've been on many different antidepressants.

48
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.350
Lindsay Short: In a precedence and a psychotic mood stabilizers, you name it.

49
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.240
Lindsay Short: Okay, but there's been a big break in between these, like, I went to a couple of rehab facilities.

50
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.330
Lindsay Short: My parents didn't really know what to do with me so

51
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:37.770
Lindsay Short: Finally, I got my stuff together. And, you know, went back to school and I've been okay are relatively okay there hasn't been any like real depression or acting out and

52
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.020
Lindsay Short: Over a decade so

53
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.680
davi pakter: So when you say you went to rehab was that for opioids as well.

54
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.030
No.

55
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.740
Lindsay Short: That was kind of like I was in the hospital after

56
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.610
Lindsay Short: One of those suicide attempts, and

57
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.710
Lindsay Short: Like I said, my parents didn't know, there wasn't an inpatient place for me to put me

58
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.860
Lindsay Short: So I was drinking and smoking weed, but not anything I really had a problem.

59
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.250
davi pakter: Okay, so they put you in rehab for alcohol.

60
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.390
Lindsay Short: Alcohol. Yeah.

61
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.950
davi pakter: Uh huh. Okay.

62
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.830
davi pakter: So you said you were doing OK until when

63
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.200
Lindsay Short: I am I have been doing okay. For the most part, believe it or not.

64
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.620
Lindsay Short: I mean nothing like back then I just get

65
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.200
Lindsay Short: I've managed to isolate myself pretty good so I think that's a good big part of it.

66
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.840
davi pakter: So how did you start using heroin. You said you're doing okay and then, you know, how did it start

67
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:58.020
Lindsay Short: I just decided one day to go on Craigslist and well no, it wasn't like that. Actually, I was using math first. And that was just helped my, you know, at work and function better and I had been Adderall, for many years, and that was helpful, but

68
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.260
davi pakter: So how did you transition from matter. All the math.

69
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.650
Lindsay Short: Because I wasn't getting a prescription for it, and it was too expensive to buy on the streets.

70
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.060
davi pakter: No. So it wasn't prescribed to you. You were just taking it from you're buying it from

71
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:24.120
Lindsay Short: Know I it was for scripting for a long time. But then I moved and I lost my I didn't get a new doctor or something and didn't want to go through all that again, sorry.

72
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.890
Lindsay Short: And that's I tried to get off of that many times to and

73
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.150
Lindsay Short: easier just to go and get some cheap drugs on the street.

74
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.940
Lindsay Short: And once I started out, I figured like what's the point of stopping there. Yes.

75
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.640
davi pakter: Okay, so you you are on Adderall for years and then when did you move

76
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.840
davi pakter: SAID YOU SAID YOU MOVED IN LAST YEAR. Dr.

77
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.360
Lindsay Short: Yeah, that's happened more than once. But the one I think it was about probably

78
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.150
Lindsay Short: Five years ago.

79
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.270
davi pakter: Okay, so that would have been in 2015

80
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.640
Lindsay Short: Yeah, maybe. Maybe a little bit less because I was so

81
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.690
Lindsay Short: I was on Suboxone until

82
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.720
Lindsay Short: 2018

83
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.300
davi pakter: Okay, so anyway, so you were

84
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.290
davi pakter: using opioids.

85
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.930
davi pakter: Back before

86
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.980
Yeah.

87
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.610
davi pakter: No problem.

88
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.950
davi pakter: We'll figure it out.

89
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.450
Lindsay Short: Okay.

90
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.330
Lindsay Short: So I never I'm trying here when a few times when I went to school in New York.

91
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.150
Lindsay Short: I went to move to New York in 2011

92
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.590
Lindsay Short: And

93
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.270
Lindsay Short: This is

94
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.900
davi pakter: York City.

95
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.040
Lindsay Short: New York City. Yeah.

96
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:11.160
Lindsay Short: And I went there depressed after breaking up or something and then I messed around with heroin heroin their end up getting really depressed got locked up there for a long time and it's like hospital and that's when

97
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.400
Lindsay Short: Stuff went to shit and um

98
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.930
Lindsay Short: And then

99
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.140
Lindsay Short: Somewhere along the line I got put on Suboxone because I'd mentioned, I was off heroin for a long time, but

100
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.280
Lindsay Short: Other medications weren't working and I had a history of opiates. So they decided to try it is I guess I'm a depressant, and

101
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.640
Lindsay Short: Never. Who knows but um so I was on that for a long time and

102
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:49.470
Lindsay Short: Just kind of wean myself off of it. But anyways, I finally got my stuff back together and went back to school and then

103
00:07:51.030 --> 00:08:00.930
Lindsay Short: I was on medication on Adderall and Suboxone until I moved. Moved to Northern California. And then I moved back to Southern California. And that's when I lost my doctrine and

104
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.600
davi pakter: Doctrine while you were on Adderall and Suboxone

105
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.130
Lindsay Short: Yes.

106
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.090
davi pakter: And so then you basically went to meth and heroin.

107
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.680
Lindsay Short: No, I mean myself off this box and into any opiates for a long time.

108
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.640
davi pakter: Okay.

109
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.150
Lindsay Short: Didn't really do function without some stimulants.

110
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.450
davi pakter: Okay, but wait, so

111
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.220
davi pakter: That was in

112
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.120
davi pakter: When you wean yourself off. Something like that.

113
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:34.860
davi pakter: And then

114
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:49.380
davi pakter: And then you were using math and then about a year and a half ago. So, you're doing good from like in 20 Tori 17 1617 and 2018 you started using heroin again.

115
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.690
Lindsay Short: Maybe 2019 I

116
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.300
davi pakter: OK.

117
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.820
Lindsay Short: I see. Yeah, I mean, I, I'm still working full time and all that and

118
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.390
davi pakter: What do you do

119
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.850
Lindsay Short: And nurse practitioner.

120
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.410
davi pakter: Oh wow, okay.

121
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:08.850
Lindsay Short: What

122
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.730
davi pakter: What, what kind of patients do you work with

123
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.040
Lindsay Short: surgery patients.

124
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:25.620
davi pakter: Okay, so, so, in spite of all this, you're able to like go to school and hold down a pretty challenging job.

125
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.590
davi pakter: So,

126
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.890
davi pakter: Are we gonna say just

127
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.120
Lindsay Short: Somewhat, I guess.

128
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.950
davi pakter: Somewhat. What do you mean

129
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.230
Lindsay Short: For me, as well as I probably could, but in a single day for it, but

130
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.500
davi pakter: hate yourself for using drugs.

131
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.520
For

132
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.500
davi pakter: For self medicating

133
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.590
davi pakter: For finding something to ease the pain.

134
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.360
Lindsay Short: Yeah, and the potential for hurting and other people

135
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.980
davi pakter: When you're working

136
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.000
Lindsay Short: Well, not opiates, but in the morning I take a pill of stimulants.

137
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.490
davi pakter: Yeah, okay. So you take

138
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.620
davi pakter: You take it orally.

139
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.400
davi pakter: Like math orally.

140
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.210
davi pakter: Okay, um,

141
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:25.440
davi pakter: So let's see what other medications are you taking right now, anything

142
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.580
Nothing.

143
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.080
davi pakter: And how much heroin or have you been using

144
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.790
Lindsay Short: So I got Suboxone on the street. Three days ago.

145
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.970
Lindsay Short: And I've been doing, like, two, two and a half strips.

146
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.820
Lindsay Short: For the last three days before that.

147
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.060
Lindsay Short: I don't know how much when I mean I was shooting every couple hours.

148
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.980
Lindsay Short: Throughout the day

149
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.340
Lindsay Short: Except when you weren't working

150
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:03.030
Lindsay Short: It wasn't working, and at work. If I had a really long day I'd have to get in in somewhere in there like

151
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.340
Lindsay Short: More than a couple hours but

152
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.910
davi pakter: Okay, so are you.

153
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.140

154
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.770
Lindsay Short: Right.

155
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.540

Uh huh.

158
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.690
Lindsay Short: And I've just been breaking up, but I have

159
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.510

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.310
Lindsay Short: Nobody can know

194
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.620
davi pakter: Nobody knows what's going on.

195
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.290
davi pakter: You just been in this by yourself.

196
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.660
davi pakter: Do you have any friends.

197
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.230
Lindsay Short: Boyfriend. He doesn't know.

198
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:46.080
davi pakter: He doesn't know either. Wow. So you've been shooting up multiple times a day and taking math and nobody knows.

199
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.250
davi pakter: Huh. So you're good at kind of

200
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.160
Lindsay Short: It's not a good at.

201
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.840
davi pakter: hiding it apparently

202
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.130
Lindsay Short: It's pretty shitty

203
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.240
davi pakter: Okay, well,

204
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.130
davi pakter: What would be most support most helpful for you.

205
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.090
Lindsay Short: Hey, listen.

206
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.350
davi pakter: With regard to getting you into recovery.

207
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.170
davi pakter: Besides the Suboxone

208
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.000
Lindsay Short: I don't know. I think I'm pretty motivated

209
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.680
davi pakter: Do you want it. We need to get you into a therapist.

210
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.980
Lindsay Short: Even had a therapist that I didn't tell any of this do like bullshit therapy.

211
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.980
Lindsay Short: Yeah, you're angry.

212
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:43.920
davi pakter: So what when you were taking all those antidepressants and set and psych meds. What was the diagnosis.

213
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.890
Lindsay Short: Depression, anxiety, I guess.

214
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.090
Okay.

215
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:55.920
Lindsay Short: Um, they tried just mood stabilizers and stuff because everything else wasn't working.

216
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:56.550
Right.

217
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:05.580
davi pakter: Okay, so, depression, anxiety and hypothyroidism, were you I would meds before. Yes.

218
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.940
Lindsay Short: And hypothyroidism is a result of taking lithium.

219
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.280
davi pakter: So really,

220
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.710
Lindsay Short: It is all on its own or there's permanently destroyed but

221
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.330
Lindsay Short: Yeah.

222
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.230
davi pakter: I didn't realize it that that was common from taking lithium.

223
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.420
davi pakter: never had any patients have that. But someone told you that. Are you looked it up.

224
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.120
Lindsay Short: Knew I had a psychiatrist. Tell me that.

225
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.790
Lindsay Short: Blood tests and say, hey,

226
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.010
davi pakter: Okay. Are you having any thyroid symptoms.

227
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.250
Lindsay Short: Into drugged up to, you know,

228
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.040
davi pakter: hair, nails, cold sensitivity.

229
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.390
Lindsay Short: Yeah, but that could also be just withdrawing

230
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.510
Lindsay Short: Taking effects of drugs.

231
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.710
Lindsay Short: constantly going up and down with

232
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:04.980
Lindsay Short: Me left and

233
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.680
davi pakter: Right, okay.

234
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.070
davi pakter: So,

235
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:21.390
davi pakter: You're going to get your thyroid checked and then we'll determine whether or not we can treat the, you know, at least get your mood up from that.

236
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:34.020
davi pakter: Will get you in with our one of our therapists, a bright heart and start the Suboxone how's your, your self care do you exercise. Do you eat. Okay.

237
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.830
Lindsay Short: Yeah, I try to eat pretty healthy and

238
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.770
Lindsay Short: I need to get into a routine. Again, but usually do some form of exercise.

239
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.070
Lindsay Short: I just moved so everything's kind of in

240
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.230
Lindsay Short: Again,

241
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.900
davi pakter: Move cities or or houses.

242
00:16:52.140 --> 00:17:08.220
Lindsay Short: And just houses. Another temporary one. So, okay, um, I wanted to ask you though, in terms of being on you know both substances. Is it my plan was to do one and then address. The other is that good.

243
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.550
davi pakter: Yeah, that's a good plan. I mean the way bright heart works is that if you're

244
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:28.350
davi pakter: Still have something that shouldn't be in your urine will be we're going to be testing you, then you're only going to get a few days at a time of Suboxone so

245
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:45.450
davi pakter: The idea is to motivate you to get off the the math, basically. And then we can start extending it out and it's less of a hassle, but also just to really keep you engaged in care while you're still using other substances.

246
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.410
davi pakter: But if you really have a DD

247
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.680
davi pakter: Do you think that's, that's an appropriate diagnosis or is it more for depression.

248
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.620
Lindsay Short: And I think that's pretty appropriate

249
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.000
davi pakter: So yeah, I mean it's, it sounds like

250
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.070
davi pakter: I could imagine it's going to be tricky to get your primary to prescribe you Adderall given

251
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.430
davi pakter: Your substance use history.

252
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.960
Lindsay Short: I don't want my primary didn't know either. And then I'll talk

253
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.470
davi pakter: There is confidential, but

254
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:30.720
Lindsay Short: Yeah, but it goes in the same EHR as I work on and everybody I work with has access to

255
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.790
davi pakter: Wait, your primary is at the same location where you work.

256
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.560
Lindsay Short: New it's not, it's

257
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.290
davi pakter: Like the Harvard medical record.

258
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.250
Yeah.

259
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.100
davi pakter: Okay, well I'm saying whatever I put in in your

260
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.360
Lindsay Short: In your

261
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.270
davi pakter: Chart is confidential. So I'm not going to tell them

262
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.120
davi pakter: But

263
00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:03.180
davi pakter: You know, they're probably going to test you. I mean, if they're going to prescribe a controlled medication to you, they would most likely test you.

264
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.730
Lindsay Short: Wait a doctor.

265
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.080
Yeah.

266
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.720
davi pakter: Well,

267
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.780
davi pakter: You know, to be honest, I don't think that

268
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.410
davi pakter: taking Adderall.

269
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.750
davi pakter: Is going to be in your best interest in the long run.

270
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:25.950
Lindsay Short: I agree.

271
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.370
Lindsay Short: I think

272
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:39.330
davi pakter: Yeah, so I think it might be time just to have a real reckoning. Do you have any kind of spiritual practice. Do you believe in like a higher power or anything like that.

273
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:41.580
Lindsay Short: Kind of

274
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.590
davi pakter: atheist or agnostic.

275
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.680
davi pakter: Yeah.

276
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.320
davi pakter: Do you believe in, like you ever meditate.

277
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.830
Lindsay Short: Try I used to

278
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.830
davi pakter: Yeah, I think that that might be

279
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.260
davi pakter: A good way to start to get centered and grounded and

280
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:17.460
davi pakter: You know, reclaim your strength to be able to make these changes what what what is your motivation to wanting to get off the heroin in the math.

281
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.600
Lindsay Short: I can't live like this anymore. I mean, it's exhausting. For one thing, so it's either this or die so

282
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.720
Lindsay Short: I mean, I don't know.

283
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.670
Lindsay Short: I can't

284
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:40.380
Lindsay Short: People are gonna find out sooner or later if I keep going with it and it does not happen so

285
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.920
davi pakter: Okay, well,

286
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.120
davi pakter: Step one is just to get really clear on

287
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.130
davi pakter: What

288
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.190
davi pakter: You know what your motivations are

289
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.170
davi pakter: So that you can

290
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:57.270
davi pakter: Okay.

291
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.440
Good.

292
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.340
Lindsay Short: I don't want to, you know, just be such a

293
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.690
Lindsay Short: Shitty human being and

294
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:18.270
Lindsay Short: I'm just going to work and try and saying, I'm doing, you know, helping people. And it's all just bullshit where it could be my entire life is just a complete

295
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.730
Lindsay Short: I don't even know how it got like that.

296
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.120
davi pakter: Well, it seems like you are probably helping people.

297
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.790
Lindsay Short: I don't know.

298
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.720
I think

299
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.360
davi pakter: It's going to be helpful to

300
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:41.250
davi pakter: Catch yourself a little bit of slack to realize that not blame yourself for finding a way to

301
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.830
davi pakter: Deal to deal with the pain.

302
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.980
davi pakter: Have you ever read any Gabor Mata ever heard of him.

303
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.920
davi pakter: In the realm of the hungry ghosts.

304
00:21:54.060 --> 00:22:02.850
davi pakter: He might be a good person for you to read. He has a lot of information and different kind of paradigms around addiction that might make you feel better.

305
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:12.630
davi pakter: Gabor Mata he's a MD ma it's GA Bo AR and MA t

306
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.250
davi pakter: And

307
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.160
davi pakter: I think just kind of cuz

308
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.890
davi pakter: It's gonna be hard to

309
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.960
davi pakter: Get where you want to go hating yourself.

310
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.850
davi pakter: You know, so

311
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:39.780
davi pakter: Finding that part of yourself that you do love and focusing on that and

312
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:47.850
davi pakter: Pulling yourself through this by loving yourself is going to be much more sustainable and effective in the long run, rather than

313
00:22:49.680 --> 00:23:04.620
davi pakter: Coming from a place of hating yourself. I know it's easier said than done, but just, you know, some gentle encouragement. On that note, and maybe the meditation could help be helpful. Do you know about insights timer. It's an app for the phone.

314
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.520
Lindsay Short: Rid of it.

315
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:18.060
davi pakter: Yeah i n si GH T insight timer. Write that down to, and you can download that for free, and they have a ton of guided meditations there.

316
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:27.210
davi pakter: Thousands that you can filter by time and by content to find one that that might work and

317
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.660
davi pakter: I think just spending a few minutes a day.

318
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:37.230
davi pakter: With that, and there's loving, kind, there's self love and loving kindness meditation. Meditation as well.

319
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.390
davi pakter: Could help

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.840
davi pakter: You know bully you up a little bit.

321
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:50.100
davi pakter: Let me see. Let me make sure I'm getting all the information to document my note here.

322
00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:58.620
davi pakter: So we went through past medical history health problems, medications, you're not taking anything right. Hey,

davi pakter: Okay.

336
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:50.700
davi pakter: So did they, they didn't. We need to get some labs on you too. So we could do that. Thyroid testing with everything else did they tell you about getting the labs done

337
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:51.420
Hmm.

338
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.830
Lindsay Short: Okay.

339
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.940
davi pakter: So we'll be doing some blood tests and we'll add a thyroid on there.

340
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.410
davi pakter: And

341
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.530
davi pakter: Check like HIV and hep C and that kind of stuff.

342
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.840
davi pakter: And

343
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.270
davi pakter: You said you have a boyfriend. How long have you guys been together.

344
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:23.880
Lindsay Short: For a year.

345
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.690
davi pakter: Okay. Is he a good support, although he doesn't know what's going on.

346
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:28.890
Lindsay Short: He's great. Yeah.

347
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:29.790
Okay.

348
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:36.720
davi pakter: So, so that's also something that's probably motivating for you.

349
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.790
davi pakter: Sure, yeah.

350
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.740
davi pakter: Although, do you think you don't think you could talk to him about it.

351
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.970
Lindsay Short: I don't think so.

352
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.470
davi pakter: What does he do

353
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.600
He's in biotech

354
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.730
Lindsay Short: He doesn't

355
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.100
Lindsay Short: even understand like my mood. Sometimes, which

356
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.310
Lindsay Short: I mean, I can't, I don't think

357
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.410
Lindsay Short: Well,

358
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.740
davi pakter: I probably explain a lot. And if he's really

359
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.720
davi pakter: likes you. Then he might, you know,

360
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.680
davi pakter: Be better support if you're honest with them.

361
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.430
Lindsay Short: Yes, three kids. I don't think you think

362
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.920
davi pakter: Okay.

363
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:29.550
davi pakter: Well, we'll focus on your treatment here at bright heart which is going to be in. We meet in groups. After the individual appointment.

364
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.260
davi pakter: Okay, so

365
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:39.660
davi pakter: We'll see probably the best one. What's your schedule like do you work most days or

366
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.980
Lindsay Short: Yeah, but it's pretty changes a lot so like

367
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.470
Lindsay Short: It can be 12 hour days or can get two hour days just depends on the week.

368
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.140
davi pakter: Would you prefer.

369
00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:01.230
davi pakter: To see Monday at seven or Friday at 11am

370
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.070
Lindsay Short: Monday seven 7am

371
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.090
davi pakter: No PM.

372
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.120
Lindsay Short: Pm meeting better. Okay.

373
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.630
davi pakter: Alright, so we'll have you come to the Monday group.

374
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:28.500
davi pakter: And basically will be doing some quick meditate medication. Check Ins, and then there's a therapist that co facilitates and will do just some processing or a group activity to

375
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.020
davi pakter: support our recovery.

376
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.300
davi pakter: Have you ever done.

377
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.160
davi pakter: Any

378
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.700
davi pakter: recovery support groups.

379
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.790
Lindsay Short: A little bit. Not much.

380
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.250
Lindsay Short: Okay, for a minute.

381
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.520
davi pakter: It doesn't seem like it would really

382
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.110
davi pakter: Fit because you don't really have

383
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.720
davi pakter: The same viewpoint.

384
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.750
davi pakter: There's another one called

385
00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:58.470
davi pakter: Recovery.

386
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.150
davi pakter: Dharma.

387
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.160
davi pakter: Used to be refuge for recovery. Have you heard of that.

388
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.850
davi pakter: Yeah, if you look up

389
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:19.050
davi pakter: Recovery Dharma d h AR ma a it's another support for forgetting.

390
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.630
davi pakter: Forgetting off stuff.

391
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:23.550
davi pakter: So,

392
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:29.010
davi pakter: Because I think you might need a little bit more support you think

393
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.640
davi pakter: Only right yeah so

394
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.100
davi pakter: Alright, so let's let's go through our plan here.

395
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.900
davi pakter: Well, first of all, is there anything else that you haven't told me that I should know about you to be able to help you with this effectively.

396
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.970
Lindsay Short: Told you. We're done.

397
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.130
davi pakter: Okay, so

398
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.080
davi pakter: Number one, getting your primary care provider set up.

399
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.650
davi pakter: To determine about the

400
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.170
davi pakter: TSH testing and whether or not you need medication for that.

401
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:21.390
davi pakter: Number two, we're going to start on the Suboxone at three strips or three films and we're going to get you connected with our therapist at bright heart for individual or for an intake.

402
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.030
davi pakter: And then do the labs that we need to do.

403
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:34.230
davi pakter: Will get you into our group at Monday at 7pm and

404
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:41.100
davi pakter: Maybe, check out the resources that we discussed, which is the insight timer.

405
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.190
davi pakter: The Gabor Mattei book and the recovery dharma.

406
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.090
davi pakter: So between now and

407
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.640
davi pakter: Monday when we see each other, which is about a week what

408
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.880
davi pakter: What would you like to work on as far as any of this stuff that we've talked about today.

409
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.960
Lindsay Short: I mean, I love it.

410
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.520
davi pakter: Okay, with

411
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.270
davi pakter: This. So, obviously you're going to take the medication, but let's

412
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:30.690
davi pakter: Think it might be helpful just to have because it's a lot to get through all that stuff is there one that you, that is jumping out at you at something that you feel more motivated to accomplish this week.

413
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:38.970
Lindsay Short: I'm not really dead weight like to wait on the blood tests a week or two until my veins of fields, a little more

414
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:40.620
davi pakter: Okay, that's fine.

415
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:41.670
Um,

416
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.030
Lindsay Short: I don't know.

417
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.080
davi pakter: So either the book or the insight timer or the recovery dharma.

418
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.900
Lindsay Short: I think yeah insight timer. Sorry to interrupt.

419
00:30:51.960 --> 00:31:02.460
davi pakter: Okay, yeah. Good. That's an easy one. And yeah, if you do it, just a few minutes a day is more helpful than doing it like 30 minutes on the weekend so

420
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:17.070
davi pakter: What I found is like first thing when you wake up before you do anything else have a place in your in your house where you can sit and then yeah, just or you could do it in your bed, whatever. It's kind of better if you get up, I find, but

421
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.730
davi pakter: And then you can just do one of the meditations.

422
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:30.720
davi pakter: And then what you'll find over time. Is it the mind starts to settle and then gradually as you build up the habit.

423
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.290
davi pakter: It becomes sort of a touchstone for you to to

424
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:50.250
davi pakter: You know, stay focused centered grounded. So I highly encourage that. And there's a lot of evidence that shows that mindfulness is more effective than a

425
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.490
davi pakter: For recovery in general.

426
00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:00.900
davi pakter: Okay, so let me make sure I have a good pharmacy for you. Any questions at this point.

427
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.590
Lindsay Short: And I assume, they'll tell me what how I go about getting the other appointments and

428
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.320
davi pakter: Yeah, I'll have them reach out to you.

429
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.410
davi pakter: Actually, do you know about virtual clinic.

430
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:27.960
davi pakter: Yes, we should have checked in before you came here. Yeah, if you just pop in a virtual clinic, they will get you an appointment with one of our therapists.

431
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.330
davi pakter: And then there's another thing that everyone has to do, which is like

432
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:45.780
davi pakter: A health coach Jocelyn, who will do a kind of wrap around assessment to help fine tune your lifestyle and work on that kind of stuff, too.

433
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.200
davi pakter: So,

434
00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:56.130
davi pakter: Let's see, it's going to be one film. Do you take you take it throughout the day, or it all at once.

435
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.120
Lindsay Short: A day

436
00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:57.780
Okay.

437
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.220
davi pakter: I think it's also good to get in the habit of taking it consistently.

438
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:18.390
davi pakter: Not like waiting until you have a craving to take it. But just to be ahead of it so specific times during the day that you know you're going to take it what what would work best for you to think

439
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.270
Lindsay Short: Hey, like first thing in the morning.

440
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.260
Lindsay Short: 7am and 7pm or something.

441
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.900
I'm trying to wake up.

442
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.840
Lindsay Short: at 5am

443
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.630
davi pakter: Wake up at five. Okay, so five and then seven. That's kind of close together.

444
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.410
Lindsay Short: I didn't find

445
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.270
davi pakter: Five.

446
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:44.640
davi pakter: But that's just two times a day do you are you going to take it twice a day, or three times.

447
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:52.500
Lindsay Short: One in the morning to at night or I don't know. I've just been journey all spread out because I don't have enough but

448
00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.490
Yeah.

449
00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.590
davi pakter: Yeah, I would recommend

450
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.270
davi pakter: See why don't we just start with

451
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.900
davi pakter: Once one twice a day.

452
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.110
davi pakter: One film twice a day.

453
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.980
Lindsay Short: Morning, that's not gonna be, I'm gonna be

454
00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:23.520
Lindsay Short: Here. Can you see this in my skills like because I'm still having pretty bad cravings and diarrhea.

455
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.150
davi pakter: And that's on what that's on to a day.

456
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.440
Lindsay Short: To day. I don't know.

457
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:28.920
davi pakter: Okay.

458
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:32.460
davi pakter: Perfect it or not. Yeah. No, that's alright so let's

459
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.670
davi pakter: Then I think you're right. Let's do three a day.

460
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:47.040
davi pakter: I mean it's kind of individual, why don't we just let you fine tune the how you want to space out the dosing, but

461
00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:56.730
davi pakter: I think just by next week. Hopefully you can let me know what's ideal for you as far as what what time of day, you're going to be taking it.

462
00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:06.900
davi pakter: Sure. So getting on. I'll let you kind of figure out the the pattern. If you want to do two in the morning and then one at night or if you want to do one in one

463
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:27.270
davi pakter: To, you know, find out what's what is ideal. Because sometimes if you take two at the same time, you might be a little more sedated or, you know, have some more of the side effects, but some people do, just take all three at once, and then they're done for the day. So

464
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:38.070
davi pakter: I think that, you know, your body well enough to be able to figure that out. And I'll leave it up to you but will all say three films daily as directed, and then

465
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.520
davi pakter: Enough to get you

466
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.330
davi pakter: To so since

467
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:56.520
