Gwenevere Abriel: I said, Look. In this section, my client has that screenshot. You can see I couldn't get in

7
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And they couldn't see you couldn't see you couldn't see you couldn't see you and I sat in there like you're telling me you can't see her. Finally, just a few seconds ago. They said, no, I can see her now.

Gwenevere Abriel: So they just couldn't. It couldn't IT COULDN'T YOU COULDN'T GET I don't have the technological terms to describe it, but

10
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.150

Gwenevere Abriel: What are you gonna do, what are you going to do today.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.020
Lyndsey Lorett: I got some crafts.

15
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.740
Lyndsey Lorett: To do.

16
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was, um, what's home life been like, I went has group been like kind of bring me up to speed about things that have been kind of weighing heavy on your mind.

17
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:22.770
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm not. Not a whole lot. I'm enjoying group very much. I'm learning a lot and I'm trying not to get wrapped up in home life because I was so in it.

18
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.500
Lyndsey Lorett: That like this is, you guys are my outlet to come out in Greece.

19
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And remind me. Are you a

20
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: DO YOU ARE YOU HAVE A copay just want to check because I'm trying to see if you want to do, you don't

21
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to make note of my other groups. If you ever want to drop in, you're more than welcome to they will bill your insurance but

22
00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, everyone needs more services right now everyone's at really check in more and more and more and more. So you're more than welcome to give you more time to process maybe wait was unsettling. We give like 15 seconds for every to make a comment. I

23
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.030
Lyndsey Lorett: Do

24
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The same. So then we have that time to sort of marinate with it. If you have your recovery journal. I can give you some other groups.

25
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.510
Lyndsey Lorett: I do

26
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, yes, it would be lovely. If you gave me a heads up. But worst case.

27
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You could just drop in. I'm not kidding you could just say hey, Glenn said I could attend more groups, I'd like to attend this one and they'll message to say, hey, could you messaged her and I'll be sitting right here and it comes to this slack program.

28
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and yes let her in. So don't be daunted if there's any confusion. It's just that it would be a little different.

29
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But everybody goes to everybody else's groups we visit, they make up groups, things like that. So it's not unprecedented

30
00:03:44.190 --> 00:04:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure. Okay. So we have Monday 9am Monday 1pm we have Tuesday 7am you know that I'm adding next week, yet but do I'm you. You don't want to go on the same day though but

31
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: There is one in case something goes sideways. There was a 12 o'clock. I'm adding starting next week. On Tuesday, I don't have anything on Wednesday.

32
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Process when we meet and then group Thursday at 11 Friday at noon. They're all mountain standard

33
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.560
Lyndsey Lorett: Awesome, but so are you saying I can't go to two meetings in one day.

34
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you don't want to do two groups on same day don't want to do individual and group. So you want to kind of spread it out be thinking, well, I can disperse

35
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: My services across the week a bit

36
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.080
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I could do a Monday or Thursday.

37
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

38
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. Thursday. I think you would thoroughly enjoy

39
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know the composition of people in there. I'm Friday, it would probably be like

40
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, um, it tends to be my folks that are brand new to concepts of recovery. I don't know why it ended up that way.

41
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So sometimes we don't even get to do any of those last minute. Tell me what your thoughts are, you know, What did you notice about yourself that was sort of reflection things. I don't even have time for it sometimes. So if you're enjoying that piece, you might be robbed of it.

42
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

43
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I warn you I plenty of people drop in there, but it's a different flavor, it's theirs. It's just a little bit more concrete.

44
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

45
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.380
Lyndsey Lorett: No, it doesn't. I you have you do different things for newer people in recovery.

46
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it has to do with know all of you are new. Many of you.

47
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.040
Lyndsey Lorett: All right.

48
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a particular recipe.

49
00:05:50.100 --> 00:06:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a thing called group cohesiveness we won't spend too too much time with it, but a group either feels comfortable with itself. In other words, there's some cross talking. Hey, I could talk directly to so and so.

50
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I can talk about some of my stories and and there's more trust and helping one another in there. That is what we would call cohesive group.

51
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That one has a lot a lot of change in it since the end of the week. People are coming and going. It's open, open, open there and I'm kind of always doing an icebreaker and so then that takes up that 15 minutes and then there's like

52
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Five minutes left, so I don't have much time to develop that cohesiveness

53
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You can find out in real time because maybe you'll go and you'll be the piece of recipe.

54
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That softens it

55
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And because it changes. So even though I say it, it changes every week. And just like your group does it changes every week depending on who's there if we can remember that it's your group you get from it what you put in, and you have every right to share as much or as little as you want.

56
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, just let me know.

57
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.150
Lyndsey Lorett: But that makes sense.

58
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so do let's go over to

59
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you having any nervousness this morning.

60
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

61
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.670
Lyndsey Lorett: It says it's a. It has to do with my

62
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: homie.

63
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.520
Yeah.

64
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.830
Lyndsey Lorett: The wound changes have been like really rough lately.

65
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.940
No.

66
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that

67
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Later calculator your food intake is changed. It's just, you've got more infection, like what's going on.

68
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:47.640
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know if it's in. I don't know if it's infected again. Um, I mean, I usually can tell because my pain level goes up and the smell gets bad

69
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that makes sense.

70
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:55.110
Lyndsey Lorett: But I'm changing it twice a day. So the smell camp. We can't really get

71
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.780
Lyndsey Lorett: A confirm on the smell. But my pain has gone up.

72
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this typically when you reach out to your physician and say, hey, something. Something's changed in here and it's not for the better.

73
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:20.070
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, they're only seeing emergency emergency wouldn't patients and they said I could go to the hospital to get a swab.

74
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Because you know i battled Murcia,

75
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:29.700
Lyndsey Lorett: And it just it's upsetting because I worked so hard to get free of Murcia,

76
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know what is there any drop off. Do they have a system for specimen ID and just a specimen drop off. Do they have no

77
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.330
Lyndsey Lorett: No, they, they did. I had to go in to the emergency room to get the swap

78
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Have any familiarity with a nurse that you trust.

79
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: ER doc you trust that you could time it just right.

80
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.000
Lyndsey Lorett: Not, not in Gallo

81
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Daughter is

82
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.330
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, my dad's best friend is actually an ER doc, Dr. Campbell.

83
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

84
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts about doing it like that without throw everything off. It's a specimen was there.

85
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.410
Lyndsey Lorett: Do you mean to do the swap myself.

86
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know. I mean, that's the thing. It's like this ER doc because protocols changing fast because maybe this this friend might know something that could help.

87
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.890
Lyndsey Lorett: To help get the swag.

88
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, or

89
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:42.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Or urging carries they're not seeing any khokhlova 19 patients urgent care.

90
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.040
Lyndsey Lorett: in Farmington so maybe I need to do that today.

91
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I like it. And there's nothing wrong with a call. So what I've been talking to people about is if we call and say this is what's going on.

92
00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And they can say, okay we're accommodating you folks with this, this, this, maybe at least something cool like there's a person out there with a box and a label and you drop the specimen. I mean, what if it was like super convenient and we missed out

93
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, that's true.

94
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what you're

95
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, but if. What if it. What if it's a possibility or you even say it like let's mitigate both of our exposure and yea about this. I don't know.

96
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.800
Lyndsey Lorett: That's a good idea. That's a good idea.

97
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.460
Actually

98
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.170
Lyndsey Lorett: Fear of mine.

99
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I get it, but it's it

100
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Takes forever, forever to get rid of.

101
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Resistant

102
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.040
Lyndsey Lorett: And it's embarrassing to smell like something died.

103
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:58.050
Lyndsey Lorett: I used to say if I don't have green green green. I wonder what gangrene actually smells like because my wound smells awful.

104
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have to do it twice a day.

105
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.260
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, the tape my skin. Listen, putting tape on your pubes is never fun

106
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I imagine putting it on a bad but taking it off can be fun.

107
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.930
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, that's true.

108
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I don't even know what month it is. I'm so discombobulated I'm sitting here looking in March.

109
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: April.

110
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.570
Lyndsey Lorett: You were black yesterday.

111
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What you think

112
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.260
Lyndsey Lorett: It was a you you're 10 and the black looks good so

113
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And everybody notice to. They're like, why aren't you

114
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.420
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, that's

115
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Where that's why is filthy.

116
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that you guys can never tell.

117
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, it was just, it was just, Whoa, yeah i'm i'm gonna do something about that.

118
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.230
Lyndsey Lorett: glare on I'm like right in the sun.

119
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see. Well, let's talk about how you you are managing yourself at home you are doing something to get through it.

120
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:09.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

121
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing to

122
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of work, your new skills. Let me hear it without saying anything. What are you doing so that you don't get emotionally activated, or at least mitigate some of the intensity. What are you doing,

123
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:36.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, one I'm I am I'm processing before I speak, making sure that i'm i'm not all huffed and puffed about things.

124
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:55.200
Lyndsey Lorett: So that I can remember I'm documenting and I and I'm also just trying to be honest with them. I sat down with them and said, I have issues communicating. I have issues, saying, No, and I am trying hard to work on these things. And they said that they would work with me.

125
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Conversation like that that really seems profound

126
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well here's

127
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:13.920
Lyndsey Lorett: The thing. It all came down to financial stuff of me having to stand up and say, Okay, no, like, I really you can't keep doing this to me.

128
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning you can't take my money. I

129
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Day I received survivor benefits for all over

130
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:32.610
Lyndsey Lorett: And they my brother in law wants to buy his stuff every month, and he wants to be indigenous turn over the money and him to

131
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:53.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Get all of his needs. But I'm his mom and I'm financially in charge of him, and when I do that, it makes me discombobulated so I need consistency and structure and him telling me we don't need something and then days later, stressing me out saying we need something

132
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what is your brother in law actually buying is it stuff.

133
00:13:59.370 --> 00:13:59.730
Yes.

134
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.560
Lyndsey Lorett: The date the diapers, the wipes the

135
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.770
Lyndsey Lorett: Body what you know just baby stuff.

136
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So you want to be in charge of the supplies baby supplies.

137
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.790
Lyndsey Lorett: I have been ever

138
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.530
Lyndsey Lorett: For his whole life. But in the last few months. It's been an issue.

139
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.290
Lyndsey Lorett: And it shouldn't be an issue.

140
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but it is so let me hear what did you say

141
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to charge of it's the money is going to come in and I am going to buy the supplies. I like knowing when assessing it

142
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to have prizes and so you said that

143
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.350
Lyndsey Lorett: I did, yes.

144
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What did he say

145
00:14:42.090 --> 00:15:01.800
Lyndsey Lorett: He said he understood. You could tell he was upset and I asked him to to stay there so that if he was getting angry he could talk to me about it, but he left and then he calls his parents and gets mad at them and takes it out on them and

146
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.090
Lyndsey Lorett: I can't affect I can't control his response.

147
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.490
Lyndsey Lorett: But if he's wanting to improve our communication. He needs. Stick around.

148
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So it looks like this. You were honest, transparent in your communication you are assertive and clear you stated what you wanted. He

149
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Was irritable.

150
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and left.

151
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.880
Lyndsey Lorett: But he said, It's okay. No worries.

152
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You said it's okay. No worries, what his actions not consistent with a smile of yo no worries at you. So okay, so there's two communications going on right

153
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the tricky bit

154
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one are you going to listen to

155
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And nonverbal or the verbal

156
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.400
Lyndsey Lorett: And nonverbal is offensive.

157
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:10.080
Lyndsey Lorett: But I, I can't control his response and what it felt good to say no. I prefer to get his stuff I and it was a big thing for me.

158
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap. Is that a tab at the top foot or

159
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.260
What do you recommend

160
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:30.330
Lyndsey Lorett: I am my grandparents, they still have my car and there they have an old car and apparently when you turn the air on it taps.

161
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.030
Lyndsey Lorett: Like never even

162
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, come on. It's funny because you know what, I thought you were doing.

163
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember I said earlier. Are you feeling nervous. So I'm thinking you're going right TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED, TED.

164
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, that's funny. That's too funny. I want my car back

165
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness. So, you know, one of your goals you set for yourself. Was I want transparency and honesty.

166
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Did you see it and recognize it in yourself just

167
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.880
Lyndsey Lorett: I did but this fear that was going on inside while I was saying it.

168
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:23.760
Lyndsey Lorett: It makes me stumble over my words. So I have to like pause like to to be able to get, get it out right

169
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just stay with that for a minute.

170
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: No one said that fear wouldn't be there, not as a naive professional that says the fear won't be there.

171
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.940
Lyndsey Lorett: But wont to ease the more I will. Okay.

172
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the more that you literally it's that fraction of a second, where you do watch so I'm mid sentence sentence.

173
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.010
You

174
00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what Fred notice it all. I did. I had memorized said mid sentence. And I went quiet when I did was take a breath.

175
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's as awkward as it is going to get, but

176
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so what I was saying, that's it. That's as odd as it's going to be

177
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone may notice it and they may say what just happened. You say,

178
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just taking a breath, what I'm talking about. It's really important to me. And I think it's important to you to you were talking about yesterday.

179
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You do the I know this is important, or I imagine this is an important piece for us. I imagine it's a stall tactic, but it gives you another second to collect what to say next.

180
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.650
Yeah.

181
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It was important to remember. I know how important having the supplies are for Ali some really taking my time and thinking this through. We've had some, you know, some escalations in our conversations in the past. I'm really

182
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, and I just did it again. I just took a breath.

183
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do we have to talk so fast. We don't

184
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.570
We don't

185
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes, on one hand. Yes, I can reassure you, it's going to get easier.

186
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But

187
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe no one noticed a and b. So what if they did.

188
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we are scared. It's a scary thing conflict in general is unpleasant unwanted scary threatening. For many people, significantly. So, so, yeah. So, uh, and you can even say it. I'm nervous about this conversation. I wanted to go well.

189
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:45.090
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, yes. When I first started and I was stumbling night I said I need a second because that didn't come out, though, that didn't come out the way I wanted it.

190
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.100
Lyndsey Lorett: I was able to restart and clearly communicate after that.

191
00:19:51.810 --> 00:20:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that has like triple effect on you just back to back, sense of efficacy. I'm enough you back to back. I'm enough. It's okay, I can mistake I can be scared, while I'm doing it.

192
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I can still hold on to my truth. I'm holding on to myself on scared. This is unfamiliar. It took me years to get here to this habit. It will take me some time to get the confidence around doing it this other way. And I'm worth it.

193
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:34.530
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, there was an issue with my mother in law when she found out, um, I was in the bathroom and she said, Oh, she doesn't have the money, then if she doesn't want to send you to get it. She doesn't have the money.

194
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So, that is, um, miss. So there's two things there. There's process and there's content. So first of all, that secondhand information. You never asked it to be relayed, number one. Number two, it's inaccurate. So

195
00:20:51.450 --> 00:21:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know, you know, too bad for her. She Oh boy, you're really you are making decisions on on secondhand bad information I are more than welcome. I'm

196
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking me. I'm happy to share with you directly if you want to do that in the future, my money, pretty much. It comes in, consistently, I'll let you guys know if there's an issue but

197
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You

198
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.790
Lyndsey Lorett: Never not had what he needs.

199
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.320
Lyndsey Lorett: I

200
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:28.230
Lyndsey Lorett: I just work. We don't have a whole lot a couple hundred a month, but I make sure that he is good for the whole month

201
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep those receipts baby cakes, a picture of them emails.

202
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's your record, move on with your life.

203
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:36.180
Yes.

204
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I hate to be paranoid. But you know what, we can be both. We can we can want to believe in people's

205
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Honesty and then there's just going to cover my tush because of fright.

206
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Murphy's Law, right, if we protect ourselves that well then nothing will happen. It's just like, Well, maybe I shouldn't bother well

207
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I don't think you can ever regret documentation.

208
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're already. I can tell you already have that mindset. You've been documenting

209
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Through doctors offices things that have gone wrong. And so those receipts to show indeed the consistency. It shows the date the time the supplies. It's a real consistency to it. So just send yourself an email with the snaps. Great. Yes, those pictures of those receipts and move on.

210
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah. Nice. All right. Um hmm.

211
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we want to revisit a little bit, um, some of the topics we picked up on last time.

212
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:42.150
Lyndsey Lorett: And yeah, we were going to start something. Remember, huh.

213
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:42.990
Lyndsey Lorett: But

214
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.790
Lyndsey Lorett: We ended up running out of time.

215
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so right near the end.

216
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. Got a 90 year are subjective unit. I wasn't actually I didn't know what it was.

217
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I was about your dreams. And I think what I was inviting was this concept of, you know, what's the intent behind and you were sort of starting with, you know, is it you know God.

218
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes intention or is it Satan intention.

219
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And where did you kind of land with how you view your dreams. Now, what do you think about it.

220
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:32.610
Lyndsey Lorett: And I think it's just real issues that I haven't unlocked the box to and it's like a little reminder that says, beep, beep, beep. I'm not this box.

221
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, why don't we just do a little introduction, missy. Who's coming enough to you. Okay, so why don't I do a little introduction of positive

222
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Evening in so that you get a flavor of what the EM Dr will feel like

223
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you have that introduction.

224
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I see something or we were going to maybe start

225
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The there's so many things to do. It's so exciting. We've got enough

226
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Room. I think that's where I was going to start it. All right.

227
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What to do what to do. Let's do let me do a little introduction of the positive waiting, because we have this little chunk of time and

228
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:16.920
I

229
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Could take as many as three or four sessions. It really depends on how it goes, are one. It really varies, but this one. So let's see if we can even do it today. So if you're with your dashboard, not in your car. Is there any junk hanging around like a cop.

230
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, soda cans, something that could sit on your dashboard. Maybe if your phone was set on the dashboard and then next to about shoulder width apart. Well, that wouldn't work. So let me show you what I want, and we'll work it from here. So if I had my druthers, it would look like this.

231
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Here would be the phone on my dashboard.

232
00:24:54.150 --> 00:25:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then right here next to it would be something higher. It's a dashboard. So it can be really hard. If you run a desk. I would want like a water bottle like a big kind of thermos tall thing.

233
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Or even better, a computer screen because then I could just use my blue light going back and forth, but I've worked with what I got. But anyway, so I'm looking for his phone object here and I don't have three hands, but if I did.

234
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: On the right side would be this other thing. So in other words, there's a phone in the middle. And there's two objects on the outside of it. Those will be the two objects that my finger to peripheral vision. I will be pointing to them and your eyes will be looking left and right.

235
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.630
Lyndsey Lorett: Is that how it works.

236
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:46.050
Lyndsey Lorett: OK, and then how what what else happens

237
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's just start with the logistics for now I'm going to give you whatever you want. I will teach it, tell it, do it as much or as little bit first. I want to see if it's even a possibility.

238
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.000
Do. Okay.

239
00:25:59.550 --> 00:25:59.940
Lyndsey Lorett: Well,

240
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.430
Lyndsey Lorett: Actually, yeah, you have a breeze can

241
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it for Brees good

242
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.140
Lyndsey Lorett: Breeze can hear.

243
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.320
Lyndsey Lorett: And

244
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.780
Lyndsey Lorett: We'll do my drink here and then I'm gonna put you right in the middle.

245
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So me. Yeah, no.

246
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Far away. Yeah.

247
00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try this. Tell me that for Brees the for Brees might be a problem might be too high. Let's see what I'm looking for is this. Do you see that I'm looking straight into the phone, you see that

248
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Notice my shoulders are facing forward. And the reason why I want that for you. So I want that phone. Somehow, if you have a towel or something that can make it stay from the dashboard to the window, make it stay sticky in there.

249
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

250
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A hand tell or a scar for a sweater that's in the back that will make it stay because over to the side are going to be those objects. Notice how far away from you.

251
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it's not going to work. It's got to be this, because look at my eyes. This is what's gonna, it's going to end up happening, you're going to be doing this. The your eyes are going to be center and these two objects are going to be like, you're going to do this.

252
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

253
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So, not, not this

254
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I have to have this bilateral experience between the two hemispheres. So

255
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:31.350
Lyndsey Lorett: I did order a phone holder and that's supposed to be here from Amazon on Thursday.

256
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.030
Lyndsey Lorett: So,

257
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it going to sit in the air conditioner event or on your dashboard.

258
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.680
Lyndsey Lorett: It's gonna um it's a big long thing.

259
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so I

260
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Moved the phone.

261
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, nice. Yeah.

262
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now what do you have that sort of sort of a little tacky, which means like if you had a sweater. Let me show you. I'll do a visual we might be just working the logistics here today.

263
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what my thought is like like this because if with this. I might be able to make something stay on a dash between the dashboard and my

264
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: front window.

265
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Right here can hold it because there's pressure here there's pressure from the dashboard. Does that make sense.

266
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.110
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, double

267
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a blanket or anything in there.

268
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:32.400
Lyndsey Lorett: The dashboard it slants it's like down heels things

269
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, Lindsay. Put your hands straight out in front of you.

270
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:37.560
Okay.

271
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in front of you right right in front

272
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes.

273
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And even even more over to the left.

274
00:28:53.370 --> 00:29:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're getting it. Gorgeous. And now, take your two objects, they may need to be smaller and put them to the left and to the right.

275
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: We are almost there, girl.

276
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.300
Lyndsey Lorett: I may have to go smaller because it's all

277
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: hand lotion. If you have to hand spritz

278
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.710
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, here we go.

279
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah yeah

280
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now we're just going to do a comfort level. And we're going to get a sense, are they about shoulder width apart. Look at my arms.

281
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Are about shoulder width apart.

282
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.470
Lyndsey Lorett: Uh huh.

283
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not like way out here because that's going to hurt your eyes, that's too far of a look. So we want them about shoulder width apart, so that if I put my arm straight out from my shoulders.

284
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's about where they would land on my dash dink dink left and right in the phone. I'm in the middle, my fingers going to be pointing. So I'm gonna blow my screen on here.

285
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Other one is day

286
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that, that one thing you have this good as nice and low.

287
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.330
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I am too low things

288
00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Great. OK.

289
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so

290
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. So let's see. I want you to look, I'm going to set the pace with my finger and all you're going to do is look at the top of those objects, you're going to catch my finger moving from the peripheral vision. Okay, so I want you to top of them. Don't move your head gesture eyes.

291
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to look at me. You're only kind of getting the pace of it. I won't change the pace. So once you get the pace. You're just going to be looking left to right now are you, um,

292
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is one of these things closer to the phone than the other or they equidistant

293
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.790
Lyndsey Lorett: They are equally distant

294
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Did that hurt your eyes. Did it feel like a strain.

295
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. See if you can sit up just slightly forward only an inch like not crazy close. I just see something

296
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do it again.

297
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a little delay in the relay, but you would want to continue the pace. You don't need to come because we'd have these additional challenges with the tele health

298
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unlikely that I would change the pace. If I do, I tend to announce it I'll say something like, oh, I want to slow down.

299
00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I say things like this. And let's take an inhale, I'll say

300
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly breath, and then I'll say let's exhale together.

301
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll say, let your mind go blank and then I'll see what's coming up for you. And then you'll give me maybe a short phrase one sentence.

302
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I might say something like

303
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that. And I would do another iteration. So I just gave you, like, here's the all the stuff I haven't given you about this process. I gave you this. There's a lot more to it.

304
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I did just now was really get a sense of whether it's even possible in a car. Okay, so what I want to do is I'd like to just do a little bit of positive what's called installing

305
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a fancy word for just Let's really get deeply into your imagery of your positive figures, you've got first team. And we're going to do it by doing the the manual for I do it. Do you want me to take the rest of the time to explain what we're doing, or do you want me to

306
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.600
Lyndsey Lorett: Know, I want to know. I don't know about.

307
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Em, er,

308
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Ly never had it don't know what it does, it's been recommended

309
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.030
Lyndsey Lorett: But I don't know a whole lot

310
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we may not get to actually doing it today, but at least we got a setup. Now remember what this looks like.

311
00:32:47.400 --> 00:33:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes honey come in the car, try and get as high as you can because we want it. I level, not you, looking down. We don't want that we really want this. So as high as you can in the car, maybe play with it this coming week

312
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's a bit of an idea. When I say set up for em, Dr. You may want to just start today and always kind of have that setup. So let me a little explanation. I'm glad you spoke up

313
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So basically it's I movement Desensitization and Reprocessing only part that you really need to know is the desensitization.

314
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And reprocessing. Those are two different phenomenon. There are many theories as to what the mechanism of changes the eye movement.

315
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not, that's not it. It's the bilateral. So in other words, if you were in my office, you would have little buzzers in your hand, you'd have little buzzers in your hand. Boop, boop. You feel it, and you'd also have little headphones on your ears and you have both.

316
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be feeling those and then I would say you could even close your eyes, because for some people, when they want to do imagery

317
00:33:51.180 --> 00:34:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: They close their eyes. So you're going to get the bilateral stimulation and what I get to do. It's really cool. I have this little machine. I get to change the tone, because the mind will habituate to certain predictable sounds

318
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll get it'll it won't be distracting anymore. It will be novel and we want that. We want the brain to be preoccupied just enough with what's going on that.

319
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Will call it unconscious or unprocessed information have a chance to come up and they're going to be processed process now now as an adult now with a safe. Other that's me.

320
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Processed where you can sit with just a very narrow amount of information in our workspace and you'll hear me say pull up into your working mind. I'm just this piece so

321
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The basic there's two theories that I kind of go with. There's a lot of them. But again, the mind and brain are still not completely understood yet so we're still kind of like

322
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: understanding it. We're getting better and better at it. But we still don't have it all figured out yet.

323
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.220
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

324
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's two

325
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: There's two theories. I kind of like and I kind of combine them a little bit. One of them, it's not my favorite is that the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere are

326
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Integrating which means they're processing information. Let's say you experienced something when you were little, and it was you didn't have a language for it. It was like there was no wording and that's what our left brain does

327
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That emotional experience is typically over on the, on the right brain that's that sort of amygdala response. That's why we feel it so intensely

328
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But oftentimes we we don't get to sort of this summary experience of language and story and have it be completed. So the idea is that it's it's integrating both hemispheres. That's not my favorite one.

329
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: My favorite, favorite one.

330
00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The one I like is that that's because. So notice that you can have bilateral stimulation by just the by just touch going from left and right.

331
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I think the mechanism of change is that it's a it is a distraction that it's so distracting that while I asked you typically the invitations. There's I'm guiding like of the whole time God God God God guy.

332
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And so all you have to do is pay attention to your next thing that comes up. That's pretty much always anything a client really needs to do is just what's coming up what's coming up what's coming up. So what happens is

333
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say something like this. First of all, there's this experience where we find a target I find out what this target negative belief about the self is

334
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You have this memory and I'll ask you to probably do two things when you're doing the desensitization part I might say, what's the worst.

335
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Image of that that you just and you don't have to tell me what it is. So anything about this. It's not a talk therapy. You're not talking to me and telling me what that was. You don't have to re traumatize yourself and talk about it, you can

336
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to witness girl I will hear it but you don't have to. For it to work.

337
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:04.980
OK.

338
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's enough desensitisation exposure therapy for you to think it to pull it up so you can unlock the box you can take out a little bit. Maybe you look in you like

339
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the trickiest part you pull it out. You hold it in your in your mind that as small as patient as you want.

340
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But the key is that it not go everywhere to every awful thing that's ever happened. We want to just work with that piece and then I might say, now I want you to also hold in that working awareness. I want you to think about that negative cognition and the rate for

341
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: For the desensitization is much faster. So the eye movements going to be faster.

342
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might be

343
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Experiencing things, then I'll check in and say what's coming up for you and you'll tell me, and I might say let's bring in

344
00:37:51.180 --> 00:38:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The resources or I might not. Maybe we'll just stick with the sensitizing that's sort of where my part comes in, but you can always always always always always say stop.

345
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, or just stop. Okay, I'm never going to be offended you register. What is too much too little.

346
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be checking in on the suds I'll be able to sort of know where you are. If you're feeling flooded with emotions. We'll start with a number of, say, where are we at with that.

347
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, there's a lot of moving parts with this, but you don't have to do any of them except just listen to my guidance, each one and pay attention to yourself. There might be times when you want more. And you might say, oh,

348
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just do this and because you don't need to stop. Nobody keep going because something's coming up and you want to sit with it, even a few seconds longer. Okay, so then you don't want me to stop. Okay, so then you keep you might do that just say I want to keep going.

349
00:38:46.290 --> 00:39:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a little bit of theory on so desensitization is bringing up some of that negative experience that when it was originally imprinted in the hippocampus. You were flooded likely

350
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: With the Limbic Systems sort of arousal hormones, right, you've got this cortisol covering. You don't have a good time stamp anymore. You've heard that part before on this big pieces that are missing. And so it's not

351
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Integrated it's not desensitize it might be intruding into dreams coming out of nowhere. We might have these relived experiences in the moment that feel like there's too much. Did you sensitization.

352
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: As much like, you know, hey, I'm afraid of spiders. Well, we'll just put, you know, we'll put one

353
00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: In three houses down and just do knowing it's there is where we might start. Well, this is the same concept, except you're just thinking about it. You don't even have to say it. It's still exposure therapy.

354
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's, I find it less far less intrusive, then let's talk about it because some people don't want to talk about

355
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The other parts we talked about desensitization the reprocessing that's the piece, and I may have touched on it a little bit has to do with the fact that sometimes

356
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We didn't have access because we were so flooded. We didn't have an access to a narrative, the left side, we don't have

357
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Access to that. So it's just feels emotional and so when we get to reprocess it now it's oh

358
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm okay now I'm not ashamed. Huh. No, I feel my body. Now I'm okay that was then, this is now and there's a restoring of it.

359
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And just so you know. Yeah. So it's kind of cool. It does both. I happen to do another level of all of that and more. We haven't even gotten into positive, negative, and how true they think these things are. But there's another layer on top of it, which is

360
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I do attachment focused Cmdr. So it isn't just that I'm also doing this part in here between you and I are paying very close attention to

361
00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That this is happening between us, that you're not alone. You're not doing this alone that you have another human being that's listening to you that cares for you.

362
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And for some people. That's really important. It doesn't mean it's going to be a real central piece for you, maybe you will maybe it won't. But I'll should be able to pick up on some cues.

363
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

364
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.120
Lyndsey Lorett: All right, you

365
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Can look it up. Go. It's the go

366
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.060
Lyndsey Lorett: I just want to know that I'm getting the most out of, out of it.

367
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, yeah. Well, you're getting the most out of it sitting in a car using, you know, yes. I wish you were here on my couch. That's the truth.

368
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The most out of it with the resources that we have. Yes, and

369
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm watching people I've been doing it now because I was like, is this going to work on Telehealth.

370
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I wasn't doing it before. I've been doing it now. I think it's about four months, and it's working.

371
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.630
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, that's good knows

372
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So I mean, ideally, I just want to tell you would be on a computer screen because then it's my little blue light, that you can be looking at that would be ideal.

373
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:24.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so then I have a question by my father in law. What I he wants me to go in the garage with his computer and ear phones.

374
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:35.280
Lyndsey Lorett: They can't hear me. It's detached from the house and then I have that space, but I didn't know if I would hold back because I didn't want anyone hearing

375
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

376
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do a couple of different things you could let say set up your little phone you can download a white noise on app on your phone, you can put that right right there, leaning on the door, we're little ears might be snoop snoop. You can have that running

377
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a whole bunch of machines. This is a really old school one this is old school. I have you. But here's one. So, this is what they used to look like.

378
00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: They so listen

379
00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're it. It's a very common tool for therapists that just outside their door to your little ears were walking by, I have two more than or electronic they're much better because it gets this sound of more like a human voice. And so then it you can't hear it.

380
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, but there are kind of pricey. So the app is cheap or free. So I take a nap.

381
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.960
Lyndsey Lorett: That's a good idea, though, that but that's that's a really good idea.

382
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also may have things already around like a fan that could be right in front of the door that you plug in some other heater.

383
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Running right there. Something that's a real even keel sound on that you could have said right there.

384
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:07.980
I don't know.

385
00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:13.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, well, if you're willing to try it with me. Let's try it.

386
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm I want it. I want you on a bigger screen.

387
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.340
Okay.

388
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:19.710
Lyndsey Lorett: My son.

389
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:24.390
Lyndsey Lorett: Has covered his voice, and he

390
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone just texted you see your, your voice actually just went muted.

391
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.060
Lyndsey Lorett: You hear me.

392
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:45.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, he's like a cave, baby. And he just screams like he'll just that's his excitement coming out and he's just really loud.

393
00:44:46.950 --> 00:45:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So no on my side. You mentioned you feeling safe. That's the most I will do whatever you can see. All right, I'll adapt whatever I've got people hanging tape from their sun visor with two objects hanging down

394
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that baby.

395
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to worry about me. I'll do whatever it takes to make it happen. We want to stay in there.

396
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine with me. But I want you, because if you're holding back if you're not going to just relax into the body and let the muscles relax and if you're going to be distracted over here. You won't benefit as much

397
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Right.

398
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look and see what what's you know maybe that setting of where you sit, is way off away from

399
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: From ears. You can even test it and say, Hey, Joe, have a seat talk at regular voice. I want to see if I can hear you through the door. You can test it, you know, just some things just to check and see so that your safety your safety's

400
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:41.790
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

401
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.840
Okay.

402
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.370
Lyndsey Lorett: Alright.

403
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you need me to message a doctor. Are you out of any of the support medicine buprenorphine. Do you need me to message the doc.

404
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:55.860
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I did.

405
00:45:59.160 --> 00:45:59.970
Lyndsey Lorett: I

406
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:08.640
Lyndsey Lorett: Am Not sure. So this whole time every day before the one changes. I was taking a Xanax

407
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I remember I

408
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:32.970
Lyndsey Lorett: haven't taken one in over like a month and a half. What I'm really struggling with the Loon changes. And so I don't know if that's something I talked to Dr. Gabriel about or you or I'm just, I know I have a pain I'm meeting with the pain doctor and maybe that will help

409
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.770
Lyndsey Lorett: On another level. So I'm not really wanting to jump into

410
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: hope someone texted yeah

411
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, Lindsay, your, your number one you are conscious. You're aware you're in a treatment program you're clearly very conscious of. I don't want to add another dependence.

412
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You're using the benzodiazepine intermittently as needed isn't going to create the the dependence on it is one of those substances that if you were using daily, you wouldn't need to tie it right down so you don't have like

413
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what the amount is but it is one of the ones that you need to tie trick down from but you're not using it daily.

414
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:26.610
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't do that, you're right. I wasn't using it daily. So when I went to stop it wasn't. I didn't have any uncomfortableness at all.

415
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I didn't say it was uncomfortable. I didn't say what it was because I didn't want to scare you.

416
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:35.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, I figured trade trade means

417
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Something so touch rate means coming down on it, but

418
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But so I just want to keep it nice and narrow.

419
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now it's not an issue. You're not taking it every day.

420
00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to stay in my lane, and I'm going to say, why don't you talk to y'all about it. But when you're talking to me.

421
00:47:52.590 --> 00:48:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about awareness of using another substance using it as it is prescribed and that's exactly what is prescribed for the second piece. It is a sedative, just like

422
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: An op. It is so that is a concern, your day. If you take a half a milligram or full you take a full Malcolm. We're going to be wiped out for the day. So I don't know what how you want your day to go, but you might not be as productive as she's like

423
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.490
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, that's true, that's true.

424
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a fourth of a milligram maybe half a milligram. If you want to stay awake. So I don't know what your doctor and you have decided about that you use them before.

425
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you are, if you send a message to your doc and say, This is how much I'm taking when I'm taking it. Then if you were to test positive for benzodiazepine on drug screen.

426
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: We would already know in advance. You're going to hear it. Look, this is already Dr. A coordinated and off you go. It's not going to be anything

427
00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:58.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so I do I call virtual clinic to set up an appointment with Dr. April.

428
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me do something really quick. Let me just see.

429
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.680
Lyndsey Lorett: Because I think it might be good just to go over some things with her.

430
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Me see if she's free now she I'm trying to add her into

Gwenevere Abriel: Because I tried all day yesterday. She's like, I was busy. I was like,

434
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Why

435
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it your school supposed to choose the one on one of those. I was like okay you crack me up. Um, can you give me a different

436
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Oops, I put Dr. Rob real instead of your name.
