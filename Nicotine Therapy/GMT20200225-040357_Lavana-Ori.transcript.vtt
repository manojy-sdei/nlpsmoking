15
00:24:46.920 --> 00:25:02.250
LTE: My family's known their family for a long time. Actually, my brother's best friends, Grandma. So that's why I came here because that way. My brother could trust that I was with people that weren't doing drugs.

16
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.300
LTE: But grandma has the kids live here and and their kids so

LTE: I went to court after all.

20
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.490
LTE: Yeah. And that was a big surprise because

21
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:40.950
LTE: temporary custody turns into permanent custody and I when they went there, they must have found that out immediately. And that's why they were telling me not to go

22
00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:52.590
LTE: Because they wanted it to turn into temporary custody without me even knowing it until I until I it would until it was over. You know what I mean.

23
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:58.410
Lavana Oriley: How long, how long does it take to get from one position to the next.

24
00:25:59.520 --> 00:25:59.940
LTE: So,

25
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.510

27
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.220
Lavana Oriley: Mm hmm.

28
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:17.370
LTE: They had another one on the sixth of February. Then add another one right now on the 13th, which is the one I went to

29
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:26.760
LTE: I told Mom, I was going to end. Oh no, if the if the lawyer thought it was a good idea, then she would have told you to come

30
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.440
Lavana Oriley: Okay, but you went anyway.

31
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:40.050
LTE: I said, No, Mom. I'm gonna go because I'm part of the team and I don't want to look like I'm out on the streets doing drugs. Yeah. Oh, a fine if you're going to go there. Just go and she hangs up on me.

32
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.010
LTE: So,

33
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:58.110
LTE: I went anyway. And I found out that they're sending papers to every family member that they have to say because you have to tell it all the family members about this. That way if anyone wants to reject, they can

34
00:26:58.770 --> 00:26:59.070
Lavana Oriley: You know,

35
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:08.910
LTE: So it would have turned into permanent on the 13th, but one person they forgot to send it to so

36
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.960
Lavana Oriley: And it would have turned into permanent with or without you.

37
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.330
Lavana Oriley: Your consent or just

38
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.700
Lavana Oriley: You being there you prevented it from

39
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:19.890
LTE: Well, but having this

40
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.770
Lavana Oriley: Person signature. That's the only thing that prevented that.

41
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.150
LTE: That wasn't the person

42
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:41.250
LTE: Yep. And, and it was not. It wasn't even the signature. IT WAS THEY HAVE TO HAVE PROOF OF PROOF THAT THEY notified everybody. And there was one person. They didn't notify they didn't know they had to so on. Then they gave it the next court date is June 25

43
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.630
Lavana Oriley: So wow that's

44
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.010
Lavana Oriley: That's a long way away.

45
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:58.260
LTE: To me that's a blessing. You know, because these are my options. I can object which, if I object. I need to have a good plan like I need to have a place

46
00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:58.800
Lavana Oriley: Mm hmm.

LTE: After I asked them for help, you know,

53

65
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:50.910

68
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:35.490
LTE: Or you do one thing wrong. He's going to get them Trina and I just, I went off on her. I was like, you know, what if there's anybody that just realizes how serious this is. Right now, it's me, you know. So now I'm fighting. I didn't say this. I said, I know how serious

69
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:43.770
LTE: Are you and I said it, but I'm not going to your house and living with you for two years until you say it's okay. I know, and

70
00:31:44.370 --> 00:32:03.270
LTE: And, you know, my mom. She doesn't seem like she's about the money. But she sure does like having it you know because she gets her 900 disability for her head and now she's getting the 700 for the kids. And before when I lived her. She held my card. She had that money at that time.

71
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:11.070
LTE: And it went five years and I never got my card. You know, it was never even a question because I didn't want to fight her

72
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.380
LTE: So,

73
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:23.190
LTE: She ain't gonna give that up. I'm not going to put myself in that position, plus being under my mom's not right in the head.

74
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:23.970
Lavana Oriley: Mm hmm.

75
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:36.030
LTE: No, it's like being under a crazy person. Some, like she thinks that things have to be this way and there's no other way around it and this and this and this and you have to be Catholic

76
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:45.000
LTE: Or you're going to hell and you have to do this and that and this and that. And she ties and she bought me when I wanted to take the bottles away from my kids.

77
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.270
LTE: Mm hmm. And they were like, three by that time.

78
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:56.370
Lavana Oriley: So now, does your brother totally support all that with the everything says your brothers right along with her.

79
00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:12.180
LTE: Yeah, he is. Because they don't have that I have that assurance that I'm not going to do drugs. I have that peace in my heart. That's the only piece. I do have in my heart right now. I know that that's my choice and I don't ever have to make that choice.

80
00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:12.630
LTE: You know,

81
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:28.260
LTE: But they don't have that. So, Donnie sees it as the kids are with mom than this won't happen again. But I see it as my mom was 15 miles out in the middle of nowhere. She has my car. She practically stole it for me.

82
00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.930
LTE: And then when her car breaks. She's going to try to take my new one that I have to buy

83
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.930
LTE: And then she's gonna have her hand out for money 24 seven. It's not doable. I'll never be able to get on my feet ever

84
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.150
LTE: Very I'll lose my job because I won't be able to make it to work, you know,

85
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:59.280
LTE: And Donnie sees it as it's just easier that way I think to listen to mom and to go in Go is the safest bet for him.

86
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:07.080
LTE: You know, but you know I have. It's been two months I have about three more months until that

156
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.130
LTE: Like, I'm a good mom. So it's like

157
00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.460
LTE: I could understand if it was

158
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:28.800
Lavana Oriley: If she saw you abusing them. Yes. But no, she's doing this. She's doing this to punish you. She's doing this to I told you so she's doing this because you went against what she wants, and and

159
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:41.970
Lavana Oriley: Unfortunately, that's basically what you're going to have to do from here on out and you have to be a little kind of sneaky about it to see your kids, that's what you have to do because

160
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:53.580
LTE: And, you know, and it's that. And then also, they're also I found out my mom's the one that called child support and set up all this stuff with them.

LTE: Because she gets aid. So when you get a from welfare welfare. His job is to call child support. That's not your job, you know, but she went out of her way to do that because

162
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:19.170
LTE: I can almost guarantee you that the lawyer told her to oh you know if she's if she's getting money taken out of her checks, then it's just less likely that she's going to get our stuff together and or and you'll be able to get that permanent

163
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.270
Lavana Oriley: Guardian. Hmm.

164
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:26.250
LTE: But even if they even if they did get permit guardianship.

165
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:41.010
LTE: And I'm not going to let them. But even if they did, I just have to get my ducks in line and and all my i's and cross all my teeth and I could still terminate it, you know, and then all the

166
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.580
Lavana Oriley: Guys don't have ultimately you agree to that.

167
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:50.250

168
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.240
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, because I mean if the parents are dead.

169
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.830
Lavana Oriley: They can go ahead and do this. But if the parents are alive.

170
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.660
LTE: It's ridiculous. And I

171
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.360
Lavana Oriley: Can't see how they can just steamroll you like this.

172
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:11.760
LTE: And you know, I just, I was before I was a full for letting them guilty to me and not going to those first two

179
00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:09.660
LTE: From what I'm hearing. It's a lot more than what I was told. You know, and then. So I went to the little room where they tell you about what's going on and what your options are and the people were really, really helpful.

180
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:18.450
LTE: They wrote here. So they told me I can either object, but I do have to have it lined up like, hey, no, I want this instead.

Lavana Oriley: Right now.

182

426
01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:13.380

427
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:18.990
LTE: So he probably really doesn't even want to talk about it or anything, you know,

428
01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:24.990
LTE: Who will do give my kids back, you will have to fucking bother at all.
