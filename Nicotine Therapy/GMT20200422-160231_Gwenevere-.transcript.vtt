00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: In the camper.

2
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:35.820
Lyndsey Lorett: I am in the camper Gwen and I was not aware of the fact that they're there. They started the roof. He started redoing the roof this week.

3
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.460
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't know. So there's stuff going on outside, um,

4
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.450
Lyndsey Lorett: I, they can't hear me out there, but I, I can hear them.

5
00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, are you, I'm sometimes that outside sound disappears as the focus gets sort of centered in here. My guess is that will fall away. But if it's so distracting, just let me know.

6
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.900
Lyndsey Lorett: Once they get on the roof. They won't be as loud, they're just starting. So

7
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.020
Lyndsey Lorett: And I got my to stoop can't hear.

8
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.680
When

9
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.910
Lyndsey Lorett: I have a little phone holder.

10
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You ready

11
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.500
Lyndsey Lorett: And prepared.

12
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's soup cans. Do you happen to have, for they might be a little low. What do you think of that.

13
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I can go run in and grab to suit. Two more soup cans.

14
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: With what I'm going to be wanting is if the phone is here, then you're looking right above it like this.

15
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.860
Lyndsey Lorett: What I have a shampoo and conditioner that's

16
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

17
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

18
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.490
Lyndsey Lorett: I

19
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.710
Lyndsey Lorett: Do what do I do

20
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just, just go get even to, like, like you said, shampoo, conditioner to hairspray can sometimes those are nice and tall.

21
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, as long as they're about the same height will be good. I'll just stay here. I need to pull up a note anyway.

22
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, I'll be right back.

23
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.380
And plastic

24
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Now I don't know if it's, if it's a little bit taller, is that okay

25
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Because these are the same height. But they're up here.

26
00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So on. Let me just take a little we'll do a little logistics check here. And so let's just have your eyes just going all set the pace.

27
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And looking at the tops of those objects.

28
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: On about this pace, just the eyes, not your head just the eyes, left and right. You don't have to look at me at

29
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The top. So the objects.

30
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this straining for your eyes.

31
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.970
No.

32
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we got it.

33
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We do, we got it.

34
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we do, we improvise adapt overcome.

35
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.640
Lyndsey Lorett: For Kansas City. Over here I got the ocean and shampoo.

36
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: No, he was ready to go.

37
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.030
Lyndsey Lorett: I was

38
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's see where we're going to go with this today.

39
00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The things that I kind of have some background noise, if you will, or thoughts are things going on in the background are. I know you met with Dr. Rob real. I think she's added a benzodiazepine

40
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That working for you and how many times are you taking it and how many milligrams

41
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.680
Lyndsey Lorett: It's one milligram and

42
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.280
Lyndsey Lorett: I took one yesterday.

43
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What time of day.

44
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:32.130
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, I usually take it 30 to 45 minutes before I change my wound and that varies every day.

45
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.490
Lyndsey Lorett: Because my father in law does it

46
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK, I see, yeah.

47
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.230
Lyndsey Lorett: But I yeah

48
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you. Has anyone ever changed the word the dressing, other than your father in law historically

49
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.230
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, yes. Um, and I was going to

50
00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:07.260
Lyndsey Lorett: A physical therapist. They don't have any wound Centers here in gallop. It's a very remote area. And so I went to

51
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:21.870
Lyndsey Lorett: The physical therapist actually had a background in wound care. So he would, he would do it and take pictures. And then once a month, I would drive to Farmington with the actual wound doctor

52
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.530
Lyndsey Lorett: To monitor the progress.

53
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: When you sort of look at the experience of

54
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to have the physic the PT is going to change my dressing.

55
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Huh.

56
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that that 30 that build up right that time before. Um, do you remember the intensity of distress being high

57
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.610
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know. I don't know that distress is the right word.

58
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me the word

59
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.400
Um,

60
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:21.420
Lyndsey Lorett: I was more I was more comfortable with him. I took way less medicine with him. I'm just a really nice guy in a really nice nurse and they were slow and paid attention and um I had anxiety about it but

61
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.190
Lyndsey Lorett: Only when they would do the womb debris moments.

62
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.910
Lyndsey Lorett: One to twice a week. That's when I would take the Xanax with the physical therapists.

63
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where they are sort of getting cleaning it right

64
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, they go a little deeper event.

65
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.120
Lyndsey Lorett: Just the surface.

66
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this gentleman. Do you remember the PTS name.

67
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my goodness. No I do not.

68
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But you remember that you were when you sort of compare it

69
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Like the experience. Yes. And how I felt.

70
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That he was slower. He paid attention so pulling EVEN THE TAPE AWAY was slower was slower than paying attention. What was the paying attention to.

71
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:22.350
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm just making sure that I was in the most comfortable state to to to what the wound change.

72
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:40.830
Lyndsey Lorett: They don't just rip it off and then look at it and then put you back together like the womb actual wound clinic does. They're very rough and fast. They're very fast. Um, but he did. He just took his time.

73
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: He paid attention to how how you were doing.

74
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Mm hmm. Like,

75
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you do that.

76
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.760
Lyndsey Lorett: And if something hurts. He would stop or go slower.

77
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Or stay away from the area that was hurting

78
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:07.170
Lyndsey Lorett: And also, um, my insurance doesn't cover white cane.

79
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.380
Lyndsey Lorett: And so

80
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.410
Lyndsey Lorett: The the

81
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Months that I was seeing him. He had liquid light. It came and

82
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:37.770
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm that stuff's like gold, but my insurance won't cover it I battled and battled and battled them on this, they'll only covered the 3% cream. Um, and they said, I can't put the cream on the wound.

83
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I think Dr. Real gave you her

84
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Thoughts on that.

85
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:47.940
Yes.

86
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

87
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: father in law is doing it.

88
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he with you on this travel right now on this trip.

89
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Now I'm doing. I'm going to do it myself.

90
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.880
Lyndsey Lorett: I just don't do as good of a job.

91
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you aren't able, I'm assuming, to get

92
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A practitioner to come to you and assist you in the wound care like insurance won't cover that either.

93
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.650
Lyndsey Lorett: They don't have. They don't have home health here.

94
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.730
Lyndsey Lorett: They have one company and they will only treat people who are completely bed bound

95
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.350
Lyndsey Lorett: So we I've tried

96
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not necessarily the

97
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: medical training because physical therapists and models will be doctors with how much training they get I watched someone go through that. I was like,

98
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But the attunement that that

99
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.360
Lyndsey Lorett: When

100
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.430
Lyndsey Lorett: Glenn. Can you hear me.

101
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.320
Lyndsey Lorett: just froze.

102
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.390
Lyndsey Lorett: I know, I know what to do.

103
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.620
Lyndsey Lorett: That was so weird.

104
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Ito super weird. I don't freeze. But everybody. You can see my I was all like where I could see me frozen you frozen and then I walked away and check to see if other people

105
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I think my computer went black. So something I think, I think it was. I'm going to go with me. I guess my computer or something.

106
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're back. We're back up.

107
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.620
Lyndsey Lorett: So I didn't know what to do. I was like, do I leave the meeting. Do I like what do I do

108
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. You just want to do so, we were exploring sort of distinguishing between what has worked and what hasn't. So what we're at right now is you having to do it yourself. So

109
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I also have something in, in the, the background to that I want to check in on. Okay.

110
00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how the you guys do those brief addiction monitors. I don't look at them very often. Like, not very often at all. They're mostly I think for the doctor.

111
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I dive right in. Like, I am today. Just wherever you guys are out. Let's work where we're at. But I wanted this time, I do want to check in with you a little bit and see

112
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If this approach that I'm taking isn't quite what you're looking for and what I can do to make a shift. So check in and see if there's anything you want me to do a little differently or what I can do. Maybe to change the focus or how I can improve

113
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so I'm a little confused about that question.

114
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:52.080
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, that things things need to go in a different direction. They're not we're not making progress.

115
00:16:52.950 --> 00:17:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm okay all do this. Why don't I I'm. Oh, how did I do this. Are you making the progress you want. Let's, let's do that.

116
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, am I making the yet. Oh, yes, yes.

117
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I think I'll just pull up one of these little bands and we'll look at it together. And we'll see, we'll see because I'm again I don't look at it very often. So that's why I'm asking this question. I'm listening to you and your you sound confused.

118
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.000
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

119
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.570
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't understand the question. Sorry.

120
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, it had to do. Well, I'll just pull this up in this way it'll keep us real specific I about that my programs aren't all up anymore. I have to dance a little bit here and singing, dancing dancing dancing to get pulls back up.

121
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.430
Lyndsey Lorett: With a Bam.

122
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.980
Lyndsey Lorett: The week that I had my meltdown.

123
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no idea. Honestly,

124
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.360
Lyndsey Lorett: That one was a high numbered

125
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wow, okay. So let me just go to

126
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull. There you go.

127
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get you up here. It's not in the same database as my clinical record.

128
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

129
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There you are.

130
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Lunch.

131
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Different place almost there.

132
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like it's probably gonna be

133
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see a few of them together.

134
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: For all 13

135
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So physical health three anxiety to

136
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Sensitive sound weak.

137
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicotine for

138
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Absence confidence one cravings to

139
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I can pull it up so you can see what I'm looking at. I'm just doing a broad stroke. I'm looking down at 1234 all together and then I'll go in and I'll open the screen and you can see what I'm looking at two. Okay.

140
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so what one

141
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.450
Lyndsey Lorett: We want them to be zero. Right.

142
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost to that question. Almost there. So the one I must have caught my eye. I don't even honestly know when it was, it may have been over the weekend or something.

143
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Days high pain, three days pain.

144
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Different functioning three recovery goal progress to it's been steady at a to

145
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This is it. Okay, so let's do this. I'll show you kind of what I'm just now touching on

146
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is a broad stroke view. And then we're going to open up one specifically so you can see what I'm doing. So this is broad stroke. This is stepping back from it and seeing them collectively, you can't see the dates their way over here, but

147
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's just look at a couple of things. So here, you say days high pain. This was this happens I remembered it was April 13th. But look, this was actually a lower pain day you had had pretty high. This is for a four is the highest

148
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.110
Yeah.

149
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Recovery goals pretty steady on a to

150
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Know ER visits and counselor alignment is the one I'm referring to. This is actually the topic that I'm bringing up. It was a three. It got high to a four, which is the highest, it can be. And it's dropped down to a three. Same with physician support.

151
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can see goals starting talk more. And as a first time I'm looking at it literally looking at this with you for the first time to talking more about what I'm going through that was a goal you had my

152
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.740
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

153
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: My health and then this one I think was on for 13 continuing with being open and honest to get

154
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.060
Yes.

155
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. So we should have the date over here. I don't know how to make it do that, unfortunately. So what we're gonna do is we're going to dip in. We're going to go look at this one. Okay, this is the most recent one is that, okay.

156
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's do it.

157
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it.

158
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you that question you had will be answered with the number question you had, I just

159
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Figure out

160
00:21:45.090 --> 00:22:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To do it. I think it's this little pencil not it's going to be a little eyeball. There it is. So there's the eyeball. And yes, so this data service looks like it was for 13 what day a week is that false. That's a Monday.

161
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.640
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, usually do it the night before, because it's

162
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So smart. Okay, so this is how it looks for us when we're reviewing it.

163
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We have continuing some smoking. These are all zeros as far as

164
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Others substance use, then we have risk physical health, and this when I put my hand over over this, we can see what's going on in there. So we say physical health you rated as a fair

165
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Cravings and withdrawal you rate considerably depression, anxiety days. What number did you give it a two and anger. You're putting it at about two days, probably you had a couple days of that right at that point sleep issues.

166
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Two days.

167
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, how confident you are

168
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Considerably

169
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:09.750
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, so, but our answers aren't numbered, aren't they, like, somewhat um

170
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see the screen.

171
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:17.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, I'm going to move you for a minute and make it larger.

172
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Me too. I mean,

173
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm making a finger to. So if I see when I put my mouse over it, we won't spend a lot more time on here. We'll go another place with this, but see where it says considerably equals one.

174
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.210
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Okay.

175
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So there you go. So those numbers translate of when you're doing it, probably to a word and you marked it so it shows considerably. Now your abstinent confidence at this point. It wasn't

176
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Extremely but it was pretty good considerably is still a really high ranking. Wouldn't you say

177
00:23:53.610 --> 00:24:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, OK. And then, so we've got recovery goals and how is her progress doing moderately

178
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Spiritual recovery considerably.

179
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Positive support, uh, let's see, in the past seven days How many days were you in contact or spend time with family members or friends who are supportive of your recovery, you spent two days.

180
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.010
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, that comes from my church recovery group.

181
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, nice days high pain. Looks like you put a three three means three to four days high pain days pain funky and festivities. How many days has your pain prevented you from engaging and daily activities and you put three three equals three, four days. So pretty significant right

182
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.200
Yes.

183
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This one, a three announcer alignment, do you and your counselor. That's me agree on what is important for you to work on. This is where I want to know what I can do.

184
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.330
Lyndsey Lorett: Tonight.

185
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, because I'm pretty sure I answered.

186
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:07.620
Lyndsey Lorett: That things were going really well with my providers and my therapist.

187
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have they they put things in categories. And this is just a place for me to adjust

188
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.140
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, well,

189
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: If I need to adjust this is this is great. This gives people a chance to to make a point without, you know, having to do it during the session or maybe they're uncomfortable doing it.

190
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.300
Lyndsey Lorett: So, okay.

191
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got quite a bit is how you said it right. Three.

192
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. What would I do. What could I do to bring it to. Very much so.

193
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.230
Lyndsey Lorett: I think that's just a time thing, but

194
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:47.070
Lyndsey Lorett: You know, we will we things are going really well, but I, but we need more time.

195
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. One

196
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.160
Lyndsey Lorett: More session.

197
00:25:50.850 --> 00:26:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: More sessions. Okay. And is it something I can do. Or in other words we meet meet twice a week, or is it that we just have you and I have to just be patient because of the constraints of insurance or something. We just have to wait for time to pass. And we can do this work together.

198
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I think just more time would would would help.

199
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to schedule more frequently.

200
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Do you have time to do more frequently.

201
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I can if I can, I can do it. Um, because if that's what's going to be helpful because you're coming into this treatment really

202
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: really wanting to change really wanting these pieces that psychotherapy has to offer. So look, you know, now that I know what it is. It's not a hey I want you to not do that. Somatic stuff, whenever I want you to just stick with cognitive behavioral

203
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that I have a better understanding that it's about, well maybe we could move this along if we met more frequently than all look out for times to do it.

204
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.240
Okay.

205
00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, that works.

206
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's now go over to making the most out of the time we have.

207
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.430
Okay.

208
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go into the record here.

209
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now I've kind of touched on differentiating maybe father in law is a little quick about tearing off those bandages.

210
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:44.340
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just, you know, it's just awkward. In general, but he's been

211
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:56.880
Lyndsey Lorett: The main person who has seen the wound, how the doctors treat the wound. He knows the most. And even though it's in in my pubic region. I don't feel weird about it.

212
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.780
Lyndsey Lorett: But we do it quickly because it's awkward.

213
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So on one hand it's almost like there's. It's not awkward, but it is awkward, isn't it.

214
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.970
Lyndsey Lorett: It is not awkward. Like I feel like he's

215
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:13.530
Lyndsey Lorett: You know,

216
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But sexual and creepy, but it's still, it's over, you know,

217
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, for goodness sake.

218
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it was a father in law. What's he doing are aged me around there. Yeah, I got you.

219
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got some dry lips here so

220
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I got that. And then I also have this other piece of information which Dr L on real. I think I mentioned to you about doing some imagery

221
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, doing some desensitization to it and maybe even having

222
00:28:49.080 --> 00:29:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What I would call maybe a touchstone or a grounding object that we could maybe sort of help with that trepidation that comes right before you're about to do the the the wound care.

223
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:02.940
Yes.

224
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.110
Lyndsey Lorett: Tonight I'm willing to try

225
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:07.800
Anything.

226
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it.

227
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.100
Yes.

228
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in an environment that is somewhat out of the norm in the sense that you don't have all the stuff that you normally have access to. But you may have something around so look around your environment and see if you have a little object that is neutral.

229
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to have a little stone here. It's pretty neutral, it's not completely neutral because it has a word on it. So it has a positive attribute to it. Um,

230
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.130
Lyndsey Lorett: But you mean completely blank.

231
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, neutral or I guess I could say positive and let me just see what you come up with. It could be a little thing like this.

232
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be easily kept in a pocket, but something that you could conceivably carry with you something kind of small.

233
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be a pebble might be a marble, it might be some other little objects. So just take a look around your body. If we can't find it quickly. Then I'll shift gears and we'll do something else. Because we're going to have to improvise a little bit because you're in an unusual setting.

234
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.930
Lyndsey Lorett: I am in. I don't have anything in here at the moment.

235
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What about

236
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that commonly people have like we have erasers.

237
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.010
Lyndsey Lorett: We have a

238
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a lipstick here with us. We

239
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Have maybe a specific pin kind of distinct. See if you've got something

240
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:43.920
Lyndsey Lorett: I have a pen. I have my pen, it goes with my journal

241
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.210
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, goes with my journal everywhere.

242
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep let's keep experimenting. All I'm looking over here and I

243
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: don't floss.

244
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm what I have to improvise. I got to work with what I got.

245
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I got this pretty kind of a little, little string here.

246
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:09.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Uh huh.

247
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm also thinking about what you may have in a makeup case you may have in in your bathroom, something that is really small that we could have a connection to we could kind of do some work around this. You might have a small piece of fabric you might have a tissue.

248
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.090
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, yeah, I do have

249
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what we can come up with, because it's going to I want something that we can link it to and you can have it in your pocket.

250
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.930
Lyndsey Lorett: Have it in my pocket.

251
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Down the line, not right now but down the line, later on.

252
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: A magnet.

253
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Cloth when

254
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this a washcloth like a nice one that you would never cut into pieces.

255
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:23.070
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, oh no, I could cut it into pieces.

256
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So that might be something that you might decide that washcloth is kind of clunky and cumbersome and it may be too large, you may decide to only have like a small little piece of it.

257
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And we could use that. Does that have a distinct texture to it.

258
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, it does.

259
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do that.

260
00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.310
Okay.

261
00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me go in here and get get in touch with some of your imagery, you already have.

262
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And as those sounds come and go. You just attend to them and then you just let them go. You have you just

263
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasted good

264
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Listening to

265
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you become aware of them. It's just this sort of acknowledgement and then a turning inward to whatever is coming up in imagination you coming up in imagery and coming up in the tactile okay and that'll be right in your hand. So first,

266
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to do a combination of things to spend some time sort of cultivating that imagery with that that texture. I've got only 20 minutes here, but I'm going to do what I can.

267
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, what are we

268
00:33:48.960 --> 00:34:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. I would invite you to close your eyes and kind of take a nice nourishing breaths. Breathing into that lower lower lung that lower belly that belly breathing that I kind of taught

269
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Really giving yourself a chance to connect in Word.

270
00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That your perspective that your intuition. Your wisdom.

271
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Your

272
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection of the self nurturing and the self.

273
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That this wise figures right that figure of dad be present.

274
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can trust in that in that that's present

275
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That the protective quality of God, a strong guy, someone protecting his family and community that that quality be present.

276
00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that visualization very clear in your working mind you're thinking about it now.

277
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And making sure that you are interacting with those qualities of nurturing

278
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection and wisdom.

279
00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you have a clearly in your mind, in your right hand, I'd like you to be touching

280
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That fabric with your thumb and index finger or in any other way. It feels right for you and your right hand.

281
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, I've been holding it like this.

282
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Right, okay.

283
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right hand.

284
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now pull up that imagery and be touching it. And then I want you to open your eyes. And I'm going to do some bilateral movement. It'll be slow to when you're ready, you decide when you want to open your eyes and I'll be here, and I'll set the pace with my hand.

285
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You're interacting is the quality of nurturing

286
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The safety.

287
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Of protective figure

288
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the presence of trusting in wisdom.

289
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And moving also to how those fabric fields on the fingers and putting those two just back and forth just feeling it.

290
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And imagining and feeling

291
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and let's go with that. So just hold those two things, those quality of imagery, nice and slow, back and forth, not looking at me. You're looking at the top. So the objects.

292
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.180
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, I didn't know we were ok

293
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

294
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:51.630
Ready.

295
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

296
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

297
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And in the working awareness is the imagery of protective figure and in your right hand is the fabric.

298
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing the difference when it wasn't in your hand and now is in your hand.

299
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Connecting it

300
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To safety.

301
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The wisdom.

302
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad.

303
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Trusting in that wisdom.

304
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And the nurturing of God.

305
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel that fabric.

306
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The subtle movements between one part of it. The other maybe the edge of it feels a little different. Just really focusing on this imagery

307
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how your body feels as you're doing this now tuning into the body. Nice.

308
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.800
Lyndsey Lorett: wonderful feeling

309
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice where that wonderfulness is just tuning in, where it shifted sit in the chest, shoulders, the legs just tuning in

310
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel that fabric again bring your awareness to the fabric.

311
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To where that truth resides in your body of what you know.

312
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You can feel that fabric that's exactly how it feels.

313
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know how your body feels it's the truth.

314
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's what you're feeling

315
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The imagery

316
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: God

317
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong

318
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise Man being present with that.

319
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to hold all of that at once you're doing amazing we're working very hard.

320
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's do an inhale through the nose, big belly breath.

321
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, it all out.

322
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it all go let your mind go blank.

323
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: For even a beat.

324
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The notion of having quiet.

325
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Word between a note of music, their space.

326
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's quiet.

327
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, let me check in.

328
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

329
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well what what's coming up for you. Just in so far as we're progressing right now. What are you noticing.

330
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.390
Lyndsey Lorett: What when we first started, um,

331
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:21.360
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean, I could I visualized, you know, talking to God that it was him and I, and we were talking and I'm just, you know, filling his love and but there was a point when

332
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:28.860
Lyndsey Lorett: We were doing the back and forth. I just had like an overwhelming feeling that I wanted to cry.

333
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Even though we were focusing on something wonderful

334
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were brought up a point here. My guess is

335
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it perfectly. That's exactly what the mind is supposed to do. That's what this does. What this does, if you, if you go with the one theory, which is that it's a distraction that it's distracting enough for the mind that that a fragment can come up on its own out of the memory.

336
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Or wherever it comes up. And so that is probably what just happened. And normally what I would say is, go with that.

337
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But we set our intention today to do a particular goal which was to sort of change the experience and meaning of that tactile wanting it to be this experience for you. So let's just

338
00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just go to just, I'm going to pull back on the end. Dr. Part the bilateral piece.

339
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just going to do just the imagery and just the sensation of the tak tak just going to put those two things together just holding on in your right hand. You did everything right. That's exactly what we want a full hour to do that process work.

340
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, find some time. Also, this week, even, maybe we can continue that.

341
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.990
Lyndsey Lorett: But a memory didn't come up when I felt like I was

342
00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:56.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

343
00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay got it right on time. That's perfect.

344
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So good candidate for you and Dr. To work. That's what I just saw.

345
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I'm good. It'll work.

346
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So why not. I mean, you write it you allowed right the mind wants look the mind wants to heal itself. It really does. We want to be whole we want to feel like we're okay.

347
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: He wants to check some things out. So we'll, we'll get into that. But first, let's see if we can do a little bit around this.

348
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this fabric. So let's put let's do right hand. In fact, I'm gonna I'm gonna hold something in my right hand. I've got something in my right hand here okay I'm picturing some of the imagery that you

349
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You have Summit, which is talking with God.

350
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:41.790
You

351
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, just sort of picture.

352
00:42:48.330 --> 00:43:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That this this is that sort of conduit. This is the fabric that when you want to quickly connect with that conversation with God that you can touch this fabric.

353
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And the idea is

354
00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: tuning into how your body feels

355
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're feeling this fabric and you're picturing all of that love and comfort and peace that comes from talking with God.

356
00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: See how the body feels, see if there's any resistance to it or if it's if it's complete just

357
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to anything that comes up.

358
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:45.390
Lyndsey Lorett: I just go an overwhelming joy that in the moment that I am upset that I'll have this and I can just touch it and and maybe it'll

359
00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.490
Lyndsey Lorett: pull me back for a minute.

360
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

361
00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.240
Lyndsey Lorett: It's like my happy place.

362
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's exactly right.

363
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly right.

364
00:43:56.730 --> 00:44:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So because we we did start to develop this really late in in the hour, though. My guess is, you're going to need a little bit more in time with it, you can certainly do that on your own. We can do it together. But let's go back to how your body was doing

365
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just why don't we pay attention to what's happening now.

366
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay there any charge tension.

367
00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of words and it feels to describe what the body's going through, but just pay attention to anything going on in your body right now.

368
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.490
Lyndsey Lorett: I just feel very

369
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:45.000
Lyndsey Lorett: I feel very relaxed. No, no part of my body is 10

370
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

371
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Even even in the abdomen, even in the chest in the breath throat head arms, legs, all of that is relaxed.

372
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.620
Yes.

373
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

374
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel in your right hand the fabric.

375
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:06.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

376
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Describe the fabric to me.

377
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:13.740
Lyndsey Lorett: That fabric feels a little bumpy I'm

378
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Not really course just

379
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.170
Lyndsey Lorett: It's sewn together really well.

380
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.070
Lyndsey Lorett: And it's got little phrase.

381
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Shrink coming on.

382
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you notice this phrase.

383
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture.

384
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That they are

385
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The strings to God.

386
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:58.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah. Little bit. Oh, I, I put the whole thing as God

387
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.460
Lyndsey Lorett: I moving it to just that one part

388
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. Just the way you're doing it is the way it's going to work for you. I put my two cents in just shoe my stuff away. I like what you're doing better.

389
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.720
Okay.

390
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The whole thing, the whole thing is God, absolutely.

391
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's test it, just a little bit.

392
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I would like you to picture, far, far away. Maybe all the way over here in Florida. I'm holding

393
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Something dressing.

394
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: To change your one

395
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you notice as soon as I said that

396
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:43.650
Lyndsey Lorett: My heart surgery to be okay.

397
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go into that imagery

398
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention to how that fabric feels

399
00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:50.790
Okay.

400
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And what is it connected to the imagery, just see what comes up.

401
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:11.370
Lyndsey Lorett: I feel like when I when I'm touching this part. Everything else kind of fades away.

402
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Your voice does sound like it has something sort of right on the edge. What am I hearing

403
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

404
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.220
Lyndsey Lorett: I've just never ever felt

405
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.130
Lyndsey Lorett: Something that can block out

406
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:28.410
Lyndsey Lorett: Other things

407
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the emotion, you're feeling right now.

408
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:40.290
Lyndsey Lorett: That it's just so simple it's you know, it's so simple and

409
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.500
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just, I don't know.

410
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You sound like either a joy or a sad. I'm not sure what what

411
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.890
Lyndsey Lorett: Happy. It's like a happy cry. Sorry.

412
00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:04.770
Lyndsey Lorett: I never, I've never been able to block to block out things and just focus on one thing never

413
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:06.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Never

414
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Use YOU FELT IT YOU COULD YOU YOU SAW IT WAS A melting away right as soon as you tuned into like feeling the edge like let's go there again. Let's go right into the fray and

415
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, again, it's probably just going to be a small piece that you may decide to to cut, you don't have to do it now because you're already in this camper. And you can kind of keep it whole like on your mind, but so there it is. And so, feel it again.

416
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you're willing to bring this dressing, at least maybe over to what is what's a closer state Louisiana.

417
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To close out just the other side of Florida.

418
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.780
Sure.

419
00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got a giggle will notice the heart. See how the hearts doing

420
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And go right back to how that right hand feels maybe play with other fingers. Give them a chance to enjoy that joy as well.

421
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And what is the message.

422
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If this is the conduit. This is the wiring fabric weaves you immediately.

423
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To God wisdom or utterance, what's the message.

424
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection protection.

425
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And what happens in the imagination. When you picture that dressing over here in Florida. If you are protected. What happens to that dressing. And what's the meaning of that dressing.

426
00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:49.830
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm

427
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:52.620
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know.

428
00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:02.490
Lyndsey Lorett: It doesn't seem to have this same effect as the first time my heart rate didn't go up.

429
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Carry a song.

430
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:08.520
Yeah.

431
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.000
Lyndsey Lorett: That is curious.

432
00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's see if this dressing were to get further or closer to you. Which one means protection of you, it gets closer to you or further from you.

433
00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.090
Lyndsey Lorett: I think. Either way, it's the same

434
00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Distance isn't gonna

435
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.270
Lyndsey Lorett: gonna change that.

436
00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to imagination. Again, let's turn attention to that.

437
00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Fabric.

438
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel the bumps.

439
00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And let it resonate clearly to your connection.

440
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To protection.

441
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: To knowing to trusting just what to do.

442
00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Trusting

443
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In it wanting your full potential be reached.

444
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How can

445
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This dressing bring you protection.

446
00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.580
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean it's it

447
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:55.680
Lyndsey Lorett: I can't, I can't be protected from it right now. Well,

448
00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:57.480
Lyndsey Lorett: You know,

449
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's what I just heard, I know you want to finish that sentence, but it sounds like you still see this dressing as something to be protected from. Is that right,

450
00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:09.570
Yes.

451
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the intention of the dressing.

452
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:19.800
Lyndsey Lorett: I admit there. Well, it

453
00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Loses a lot. There's a lot of drainage.

454
00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.770
Lyndsey Lorett: So it's so except the drainage.

455
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:29.730
Lyndsey Lorett: And then

456
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.280
Lyndsey Lorett: And

457
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:38.790
Lyndsey Lorett: That and then we put a protective thing to help against

458
00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.470
Lyndsey Lorett: an antibiotic or night antibiotics, but infection.

459
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that protection. What do you call that, what is that is that I like a plastic sticky bandage.

460
00:52:52.230 --> 00:53:01.800
Lyndsey Lorett: On as well. It's called Hydra bear blue. Um, but then we put the sticky thing over that.

461
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:11.910
Lyndsey Lorett: And then we put an add pad because it leaks so much that that stops it from coming through my pants and looking like I peed myself.

462
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is

463
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:15.390
Lyndsey Lorett: Which is

464
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.510
Lyndsey Lorett: This huge binder that holds me and

465
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this whole thing.

466
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this protective thing this hydrotherapy blue and right the sticky thing over it and all of this, this whole process.

467
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounded like

468
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted to protect yourself from it.

469
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:47.250
Lyndsey Lorett: I do

470
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

471
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Protecting you

472
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.520
Lyndsey Lorett: What do you mean

473
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.870
Literally

474
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.360
Lyndsey Lorett: Is

475
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it helping you.

476
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.060
Lyndsey Lorett: The wound the

477
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the protective thing hydro Sarah blue

478
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:13.980
That whole

479
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Dressing I'm calling it dressing, which is like four or five different things going on over there.

480
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, addressing is it to protect you. Is it to help you.

481
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:29.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, it's it's essential

482
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:31.710
Yeah.

483
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So take your right hand and let's feel that fabric. Okay.

484
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with those words. This is essential.

485
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel that fabric.

486
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And feel that connection to the imagery

487
00:54:59.010 --> 00:54:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Of protection.

488
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing just what to do.

489
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:10.230
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm feeling a blockage.

490
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.610
Haha

491
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.060
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm filling up that it's not connecting

492
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

493
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Is that normal

494
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. It's happening. So of course it's normal.

495
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanna, I can see my next client just got here. I'm gonna, I'm looking at my book right now to see if we can

496
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Soon when, in general, what did the next few days look like for you. So I can see what even as possible.

497
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.350
Lyndsey Lorett: Because we have, um,

498
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.200
Lyndsey Lorett: This week I think this is, I don't think we can do it this week.

499
00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.870
Lyndsey Lorett: But next week, we could do twice.

500
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's let some will you be back to

501
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Ability to meet at seven again maybe on April.

502
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:17.520
Lyndsey Lorett: It, you said April 29

503
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.930
Yes.

504
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a Wednesday.

505
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:26.130
Lyndsey Lorett: at 7am yeah

506
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: For a hot second

507
00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm looking for

508
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I can do unless I think I can do 10 on May 1

509
00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:57.390
Me.

510
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So that would give you three services in that week so that intense for you mean but notice we got we didn't get the feeding get the full deal around this imagery

511
00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

512
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It'd be nice to just as soon as we sort of login to just kick in on that.

513
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's the blockage. That's, that's right. I think what it needs is more time, more imagery, more and more time spent, that's all we just kind of did it halfway

514
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and so I would want to know more about that blockage and and and we would spend more time with it.

515
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:43.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, perfect. Um,

516
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:47.400
