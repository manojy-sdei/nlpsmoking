Mary Kastner: Okay so diagnoses.

515
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.230
Mary Kastner: It's opioid use disorder on

516
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:40.410
Mary Kastner: agonist therapy.

517
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:47.070
Mary Kastner: Nicotine use disorder severe. Do you want any help with that.

518
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:53.340
Jennífer castro: Well, I would like to get it. I would like help without really came together and live life on track.

519
00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.090
Mary Kastner: Okay, you could talk to Dr. Jamison and see if she wants to order you some either nicotine patch or gun.

520
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.310
Mary Kastner: And also there is Shan tech. So once we get your mood.

521
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:07.530
Mary Kastner: Situated

522
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.980
Mary Kastner: And I lost my camera again. I don't know.

523
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.050
Mary Kastner: Why, my Zoom is doing this to me.

524
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:19.830
Mary Kastner: There we go.

525
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:33.090
Mary Kastner: Um, so once we get your mood settled. I'll be glad to try some Chantix with you or in the meantime, you could ask her for some nicotine patches or gun.

526
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.290
Mary Kastner: I'm the Wellbutrin you were on for

527
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.690
Mary Kastner: Smoking before classes through Seidel ideation. So I wouldn't use that

528
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.000
Mary Kastner: So I would say that

529
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:59.340
Mary Kastner: I would say more that you have a what we call cycle of time. Yeah, it's a persistent mood disorder. I wouldn't call you full bipolar.

530
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.430
Mary Kastner: Okay. Um, and

531
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:09.630
Mary Kastner: One of the best antidepressants, although you find yourself more anxious

532
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.720
Mary Kastner: So we might want to try something like

533
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.590
Mary Kastner: Lamictal.

534
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.540
Jennífer castro: What is that

535
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.670
Mary Kastner: It's a banana consultant that we use in psychiatry for mood stabilization.

536
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.540
Jennífer castro: Or that looks like yeah I remember that.

537
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:37.860
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and the danger with it. Is it like aspirin can cause a Stevens Johnson syndrome.

538
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:45.270
Mary Kastner: Which is a rash. Usually, it starts more in the extremities, sort of like chicken pox.

539
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:55.530
Mary Kastner: The danger is it can be internal and then therefore life threatening. So you have to go very slow with how you take it and you can't miss doses.

540
00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:05.400
Mary Kastner: So you would probably want to get up to, I would say at least 150 milligrams, but you would increase by 25 every two weeks to get to that point.

541
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.960
Jennífer castro: Okay, but there's something that's not so

542
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.040
Mary Kastner: Dangerous yeah um

543
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.410
Mary Kastner: Die Bell Pro X is another and a consultant

544
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:30.030
Mary Kastner: Can make you sleepy, which is why I didn't choose that at first because you didn't like that with Abilify I'm in can cause weight gain.

545
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.560
Jennífer castro: I've lost like 25 pounds in the last six weeks.

546
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.360
Mary Kastner: Okay. That would be another target symptom is that because you just don't have an appetite.

547
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:44.340
Jennífer castro: Don't want I don't need. I don't want to be around. I don't know what

548
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.090
Mary Kastner: Are you able to prepare food. Yes.

549
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.230
Jennífer castro: Sir, yeah. Yeah.

550
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.220
Okay.

551
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:52.770
Mary Kastner: So,

552
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:58.440
Mary Kastner: What do you think you and try to dive out Pro X or do you want to. There's another an A.

553
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.400
Mary Kastner: Major tranquilizer like Abilify that

554
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.480
Mary Kastner: more helpful with depression that we could try. It's called let

555
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.700
Jennífer castro: Somebody told me about the x and the commercial for that.

556
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:12.780
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

557
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.290
Mary Kastner: Well, that's another possibility.

558
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.830
Jennífer castro: Whatever you think's best, I guess.

559
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.800
Jennífer castro: First one that you told me kind of scared me.

560
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:36.480
Mary Kastner: Okay, okay I don't blame you. I'm in the lithium, you know, you never really had a full trial of that. However, I don't think that would be my first choice.

561
00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.680
Mary Kastner: So let's let's go with the lead to de

562
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.210
Mary Kastner: The way you start to de is

563
00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.080
Mary Kastner: It like I said it's an major tranquilizer. Um,

564
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.980
Mary Kastner: me get rid of this. I didn't mean to put that in there.

565
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:42.690
Mary Kastner: So we would start with 20 milligrams. If that doesn't do anything. We can go up to 120 milligrams, um,

566
00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.520
Mary Kastner: You need to see me in two weeks after you start this

567
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:48.210
Okay.

568
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.630

713
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:57.420
Mary Kastner: So, um, I don't have a problem with starting you on Suboxone if you had used sooner or your score was lower I would just give you an orphan because it can put you in what we call here you go with your yawning.

714
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:06.180
Mary Kastner: It can put you in a precipitous withdraw, which is not fun. So

715
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.130
Mary Kastner: But let's try this Suboxone it has no locks on with it.

716

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.060
Mary Kastner: Okay.

720
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.710

721
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:45.360

723
00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.520
Mary Kastner: Any thoughts of about what I just said.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:01.230

729
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:25.980

730
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.940
Mary Kastner: Okay, so I can't tell you that I'm

731
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.590

Mary Kastner: Okay, I'm going to order that

734
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:40.680
Mary Kastner: You know how to use it.

735
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.780
Shawn Lewis: No man, I've never heard of it.

736
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.680
Mary Kastner: Okay, I'm going to ask the pharmacist to tell you

737
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.550
Mary Kastner: Anybody that's on an opiate should have one

738
00:53:54.360 --> 00:54:00.000
Mary Kastner: You're the first person I've seen him withdraw that's yawning like that. I think that's a good sign.

739
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:19.200
Mary Kastner: So basically what it is. It's a nasal spray and, you know, if you've overdose, you are not able to administer that to yourself because you're out. So the best thing for you to do is to teach somebody how to use it.

740
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:31.800
Mary Kastner: So somebody that you see frequently needs to know how to use it, they will show you how to do it at the pharmacy, but it's basically spraying into the nose. Okay.

741
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:32.790
Okay.

742
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:34.920
Okay.

743
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.830
Mary Kastner: And it's not going to be any good if you don't teach somebody

744
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.210
Okay.
