162
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.230
Amber Romero: Okay, because it

163
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:09.630
Chris Alliman MD: Says it may smell. Does it make sense to you. Do you understand why they were waiting till you were at that point to give you the Suboxone

164
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.250
Yes.

165
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.520
Chris Alliman MD: Tell me why just so I make sure you understand

166
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:24.420
Amber Romero: Um, because from what I understand the narcotic can reverse the effects and sent you to withdraw. If you take it before you're supposed to

167
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:33.180
Chris Alliman MD: Right, so we're going to get you a prescription for Suboxone today we're going to do that. I just want to make sure you're taking it at the right point

168
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:42.330
Chris Alliman MD: Basically with just recently having used heroin. If you would take Suboxone now Suboxone would kick you into massive withdrawals.

169
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.130
Chris Alliman MD: And make us releasing

170
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.370
Amber Romero: Wait, about eight 910 hours.

171
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.540
Chris Alliman MD: So we want to wait till you're in moderate with drawls

172
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.250
Chris Alliman MD: Okay not early withdrawals and not severe withdrawals, but in the middle.

173
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:11.700
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And that can be different amounts of time for different people. For some people, you know, it's eight to 10 hours. For others it's 48 hours, it just, it depends a lot on the person. So

174
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:19.950
Chris Alliman MD: I don't have an office. I'm not going to keep you here on the on the call for eight hours watching you right and measuring these things.

175
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:27.390
Chris Alliman MD: What I'm going to do is send in the prescription and you're going to kind of consider this thinking about last time you went through it.

176
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:44.970
Chris Alliman MD: waiting till you're at that same point with the anxiousness the upset stomach little bit nausea, all those feelings, you're uncomfortable. Right. But you're not in the signal the massive withdrawals and you're not too early in early withdrawals. Don't want you taking it, Ben.

177
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.540
Chris Alliman MD: Want to wait till those moderate withdrawals.

178
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:56.190
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Okay, so that'll be typing on your part. Oh, okay. But we got lots of questions before we get there, so

179
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:57.780

200
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:24.600

Chris Alliman MD: I'm going to tell you that these instructions on how to take the Suboxone

381
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.470
Chris Alliman MD: It won't be printed on the bottle because they're too long for the pharmacy to put on the bottle.

382
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.820
Chris Alliman MD: But I'm going to email the

383
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.730
Chris Alliman MD: Email the instructions to you. Also, okay.

384
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:38.550
Chris Alliman MD: So you'll have them there. Okay, so first of all, moderate withdrawals. Right. We want to wait till you're in moderate withdrawals.

385
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.130
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, you're in

386
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.090
Chris Alliman MD: When you're in moderate withdrawals. You'll take one full film.

387
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:56.400
Chris Alliman MD: Two to four hours later if you need to, you can take half of film. And if you need to two to four hours after that you can take another half of film.

388
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:06.840
Amber Romero: Okay, um, the for the for is supposed to last me how many days.

389
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.820
Chris Alliman MD: So there's so there's going to be 10 films for four days.

390
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:14.790
Amber Romero: They appeal.

391
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.230
Film

392
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:18.810
Amber Romero: Okay.

393
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.460
Amber Romero: Yeah, okay.

394
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:29.100
Chris Alliman MD: And then on the second so you heard how to take it. The first day on the second day, you start with your total amount from the first day.

395
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:31.950
Amber Romero: Okay.

396
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.440
Chris Alliman MD: So I assume you're going to take this here.

397
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:40.380
Chris Alliman MD: You'll take the two films. The first day, I assume. So the second day, you'll start with two films.

398
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.390
Chris Alliman MD: First thing in the morning.

399
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:52.530
Chris Alliman MD: And then two to four hours later you'll take another half a film. If you need to, in two to four hours after that if you need to, you can take another hath fulfilled.

400
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.880
Chris Alliman MD: So that's a total of three films on the second day if you need to.

401
00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.010
Amber Romero: On the third day

402
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.420
Chris Alliman MD: You take the total from the second day, so if you only took two on the second day that's what you start with on the third day

403
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:08.760
Amber Romero: Okay.

404
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.410
Chris Alliman MD: If you took all three on the, the second day that's what you take on the third day

405
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:20.340
Chris Alliman MD: There's but there's no extra films during the day, it's just those three

406
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:22.590
Amber Romero: Okay.

407
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.460
Chris Alliman MD: On the fourth

408
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.480
Amber Romero: Day and not right.

409
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.330
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's the maximum we use. We don't go higher than that. Anyway, but on the fourth day

410
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.600
Chris Alliman MD: You'll have just two films for the day. This is to help you get through the withdrawal time

411
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:43.290
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Okay. And then on that fourth day I'll send in a new prescription

412
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:53.940
Chris Alliman MD: To get you going again likely you'll be in grew up in group this Friday because that's going to be like, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday somewhere, somewhere right around there. So,

413
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.880
Chris Alliman MD: We refill medication that group time

414
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.630
Okay.

415
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:08.100
Chris Alliman MD: At group and it there. So if you miss group you miss therapy, you're risking going without medication. Make sure you attend. Okay.

416
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:28.200
Chris Alliman MD: Now here's the part. Here's the part about checking in. For group for for Friday 12 noon you calling into the virtual clinic, like you did today is like going to the doctor's office or calling the doctor's office. There's always align and there's always paperwork to do

417
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.590
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so that means don't wait

418
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.050
Chris Alliman MD: Don't wait until five minutes before group time to call in, because you're not going to get in.

419
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:50.640
Chris Alliman MD: Call in about half an hour ahead of time so you can get everything taken care of. You don't have to stay on the line. The whole time, they will email you the ID to get into our zoom meeting like you had today.

420
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:53.220
Amber Romero: Okay.

421
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.720
