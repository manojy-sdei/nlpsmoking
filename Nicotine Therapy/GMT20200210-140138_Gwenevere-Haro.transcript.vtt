Christina Haro: To take care of his wife.

63
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:05.550
Christina Haro: And then she passed away two years ago. So he stayed alone so I you know I still visit him once in a while and then whenever he really needs anything he calls me

64
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but what why does he need help.

65
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:22.740
Christina Haro: Um, he's he's he's really old. He's I'm disabled. It doesn't really walk much he's 85 years old. So does that better his legs are really bad.

66
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's just set

67
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Set some tasks associated with with I want a job. So typically what people do when they're starving. You had already started was they'll say, all right, I want to submit

68
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, a minimum of, you know, three applications, a day or, you know, something like that, or my my challenges is follow up calls

69
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Three out of five days a week or something. So let's just take maybe where you're already are. And and kind of see where you need to improve, I don't know, let's let's set a goal for this. What, what do you think you need to do more of

70
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:25.590
Christina Haro: Well, um, last week was really a busy week because every day. My God, online and I had a couple of interviews last week. So every day, I looked at

71
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:34.380
Christina Haro: Applications. I had every put in to see if anybody has called me, and I would put in, like, every day I will put in another application.

72
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:48.870
Christina Haro: And then I've actually gone out and submitted applications I submitted application at a up because I used to be a cashier, a while back. So I actually hadn't submitted a few applications here locally.

73
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So I, I

74
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.760
Christina Haro: Had been doing about three a day. OK.

75
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, I will refuse submitted applications daily and submit at least three

76
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Three applications. How many days a week. Will you do that.

77
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.300
Christina Haro: I say about probably four days out of the week. Okay.

78
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.860
All right.

79
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, and just to explore a little bit your, your, sort of spirituality. How it helps you in your recovery process. How do you sort of knew that

80
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.560
Christina Haro: Um, I do go to church on weekends. On Sunday, I go to church. So, you know,

81
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.830
Christina Haro: I do, I do do a lot of praying night. Talk to God I you know

82
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.320
Christina Haro: I really

83
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.100
Christina Haro: Do my own little thing during the week.

84
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.280
Christina Haro: But other than that, you know, I'm not too much into

85
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:13.890
Christina Haro: Um, I'm not too much into the religion. I was raised with so I just tried to do my own, you know,

86
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.220
Christina Haro: write my own thing at home.

87
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it connected for you to the recovery.

88
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:32.220
Christina Haro: Um, I think that the whole thing with me being able to, you know, just kind of sit there and, you know, um,

89
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:47.520
Christina Haro: I don't say talk to myself. But, you know, kind of, you know, ask God to help me, you know, and I think it makes me feel better when they have that little discussion on my own, or that little private moment it it does help me. It gives me some some guidance.

90
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Or their periods of your life where you weren't doing this.

91
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.760
Christina Haro: Um, yeah.

92
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:12.420
Christina Haro: There was there. Yeah, you know, my mom is Catholic. So my mom went to Catholic school when she was young so all of us went, you know, to the did the Catholic thing and I bought I

93
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.450
Christina Haro: When I first moved here, which was 12 years ago I was really involved with the church stuff.

94
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:29.760
Christina Haro: And then as time went by and my relationship with down the drain and things just started going downhill. I kind of just did not even go to church.

95
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:46.710
Christina Haro: So I say I I think about maybe the last six months. I started going back to church and and it's not because it's the whole you know at my kids asked me, they don't go to church, but my kids tell me what why even bother going if you're not

96
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:56.190
Christina Haro: You don't consider yourself you know Catholic. And I said, I go for myself. I don't go because it's the whole Catholic thing you like

97
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.110
Christina Haro: The feeling I get, you know, I do it for myself. You know, I

98
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.910
Christina Haro: So just recently I've gotten a little bit more into, you know,

99
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:12.810
Christina Haro: Going to church and, you know, doing my own little spiritual thing here, and it makes me feel better.

100
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. You know, just hearing that positive

101
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Sermons and hearing you know being around people that are really trying to have that connection can feel spiritual even though maybe the name of it isn't something you identify with anymore. I mean, it makes sense to me. Certainly.

102
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see what else we got here scrunched down. Um, I want to feel normal.

103
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

104
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an interesting thing.

105
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you noticed that you have felt glimpses of normal. Do you even know what normal is for you, like, Tell me about what normal is

106
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.830
Christina Haro: I think that to me normal was, um,

107
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.820
Christina Haro: To me normal was

108
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:19.770
Christina Haro: Me being a part of, you know, the family doing things with the kids, even if they were a little older, I still felt really connected to them. And, you know, we could do things as a family. But I think as

109
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:30.660
Christina Haro: I tell you, my last relationship with down the drain. You know, my kids got older, I started having problems with the girls with the boys, whatever, you know, we're not

110
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:41.190
Christina Haro: Everything just went down the drain and I just didn't select myself anymore. I didn't feel like I was part of the family. I didn't feel like I wasn't mother. I didn't feel like me and you weren't

111
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:50.310
Christina Haro: Especially these last few years where everything got worse and I started doing more of the bad stuff. I just realized

112
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.170
Christina Haro: I wasn't even myself anymore. I didn't feel like myself.

113
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.990
Christina Haro: And now I think lady.

114
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:14.910
Christina Haro: In all these discussions and the group stuff and just being in this thing and then listening to other people. I'm starting to to realize, Hey, you know,

115
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:27.930
Christina Haro: I wasn't me. You know, it's like all that that I look back at this this era of time for I went down down hill and it's like, I can't even remember what I did.

116
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:39.420
Christina Haro: It's weird. It's weird, but now I'm starting to you know get back and start to do things look for a job and I'm starting to feel like me, I'm starting to feel like

117
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.260
Christina Haro: I'm back in my body. I'm, you know,

118
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.410
Christina Haro: Normal things for myself.

119
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.190
And

120
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The dynamics, you've mentioned your daughter's in this program to

121
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: When she explains to your maybe she hasn't how that came about why she went that direction.

122
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it have anything to do with sort of her upbringing. What, what sort of the story behind that.

123
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:45.300
Christina Haro: No, we have thought the bye bye tell you we just don't talk about the program we've talked about stuff, but she just she doesn't really, I think, I think, with her is because she had a really bad first relationship and it really went downhill really really like quick

124
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.250
Christina Haro: And it just

125
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.140
Christina Haro: She just I think she just got into a dark place.

126
00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you think, are you guys um neighbors living far away living together. What's the deal there.

127
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:14.850
Christina Haro: She lives down the street, which she was probably about like seven houses down the street. Yeah. So we're pretty close. I mean, me and her have always been close always

128
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:24.810
Christina Haro: Even the kids on my other kids to tell me that. Oh, she's your favorite. She's your favorite. But no, I didn't know what are we just been we've always had a close relationship.

129
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:31.050
Christina Haro: You know, she can call me anytime and she knows. I'll be there for her and you know she does the same thing for me.

130
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does she had to say about your, your substance use.

131
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.270
Christina Haro: She um

132
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:56.220
Christina Haro: I was the one that found this book. First, you know, and I signed up and stuff. And then I told her about it as a suggestion. Because I think when she's ready to do something, she'll do it and then

133
00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:06.780
Christina Haro: When I got into this stuff. I got into the stupid stuff and then and then she did a while later, she actually told me, hey I signed up.

134
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:20.070
Christina Haro: And I said, oh really, you know, so then we had a discussion about it and then we didn't talk about it anymore. But she seems to seems like it. She seems to be doing good.

135
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.930
Christina Haro: I'm happy.

136
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, where's your last truck screen.

137
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.570
Christina Haro: Oh, they just sent it in. I got, I got a

138
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:50.460
Christina Haro: I got an email that they sent they sent me one I should be getting any that probably tomorrow.

139
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.740
Christina Haro: I haven't had one yet.

140
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.990
Christina Haro: I did the initial

141
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

142
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were in group and you were talking about that there are still some things that you still feel some

143
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: shame about that you're having letting hard time letting go of or is this still this area that really not comfortable talking with family about

144
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.660
Christina Haro: It. Yeah.

145
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We're fun

146
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:36.690
Christina Haro: I remember. Remember, yeah. Well, this is something that they, you know, there's things that they asked me, you know, from the paths that you know there's things sometimes a can't

147
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.800
Christina Haro: fully answer. You know, sometimes, you know, you just don't want your kids to hear a lot of stuff.

148
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.290
Christina Haro: I just don't

149
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.260
Christina Haro: You know, and, and we're talking about the guilt and the shame. Yeah.

150
00:19:53.250 --> 00:20:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So what would happen if you shared a little bit with me. What do you think might happen to that shame. Do you think it would increase

151
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Resolve if you shared it, because remember with shame if you share it, it starts to go away. So what would happen if you shared it with me. What do you think might happen.

152
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.830
Christina Haro: I just some

153
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.280
Christina Haro: There's things I, you know, I'd like to say, but no, not yet.

154
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.260
Christina Haro: But I will share it with but I'm not ready do

155
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you think that's because a negative consequences will happen or you think that I will judge you.

156
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.520
Christina Haro: I know I just

157
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:40.950
Christina Haro: Not

158
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.540
Christina Haro: You know,

159
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.210
Christina Haro: Maybe later in time. I just don't. Duh.

160
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's the plan, but I'm asking you to see if you're

161
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.170
Christina Haro: Yeah, probably. I'll probably do you know

162
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the plan. But what I'm asking you to do is to look inside and understand why.

163
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.800
Christina Haro: Why I don't want to share it yet, or why I wouldn't share it.

164
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've already got a plan together where that's you've already got a plan. But I'm checking to see if you know why. So I put I gave two ideas and if it isn't, those two, maybe it's something else you've already got a plan in place.

165
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.150
Christina Haro: No, I don't think there's no negative consequences. You know, I just

166
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:37.650
Christina Haro: You know, I just got to think about, you know, there's, there's a lot of things like when we were talking about it cross my mind when we're talking about all that.

167
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:49.170
Christina Haro: And there's just things. I started to remember during that time when we're talking about it and group and then there's things. I started thinking, wow, you know, I haven't thought about those things in a while.

168
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:59.670
Christina Haro: So I think slowly publicly in time. I probably start sharing stuff, you know. No, I don't. I don't think there's a problem with me sharing stuff.

169
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so no you that again. You've restated the plan.

170
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm asking.

171
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.180
Christina Haro: I don't think you would get to me. That's why I'm here. I don't, I don't think you would judge me.

172
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So no negative consequences and no judgments. So let's look look look in there. Again, try and see

173
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What would the reason is, you wouldn't we already know the plan is LATER. LATER. LATER. We already know it's I'm not afraid of a negative consequence, we already know it's not

174
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That you'll be judged trying to see what you're worried will happen just see that a little longer. Don't rush into the answer. Just take your time you've already ruled out to

175
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not afraid of a negative consequence and you're not afraid of judgment. Those are pretty big ones typically why they don't want to say it out loud.

176
00:22:49.950 --> 00:23:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So just go inside. Nice and quiet and easy and just kind of go inside yourself and say, just try on the idea I'm concerned that such and such will happen just sort of go in there and see what might be coming up for you.

177
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:29.430
Christina Haro: I'm not really know I'm not really concerned about anything happening, and to some other tell you and maybe

178
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:46.650
Christina Haro: I feel I probably feel a little embarrassed and ashamed. I'm not saying I'm you know I'm shameful of stuff. No, because I think that when I'm ready to share it. I probably be a little embarrassed and stuff.

179
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.100
Christina Haro: I'm not worried about

180
00:23:51.540 --> 00:24:01.290
Christina Haro: Not you judging me I'd be worried about my kids judging me you know that's why there's a lot of things I don't say to them, okay so

181
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay there for a minute on these things that you predict

182
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be embarrassing with a witness. You don't want your kids to be aware of things that you did or didn't do. Right.

183
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I'm wondering is, let's take hold one in your in your in your awareness just picture, okay. I did this behavior, boy, I sure don't want them to know this. What are you doing,

184
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That where you're holding yourself accountable, because that's where guilt. That's where a healthy accountability is. So what are you actually doing.

185
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's consistent with your belief system.

186
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Where maybe you what caused the feeling of potential embarrassment is I acted outside of my belief system, but now you're acting in your belief system. What are you actually doing that evidences you're holding yourself accountable. What are you doing,

187
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.610
Christina Haro: Well, to me, I feel like I'm protecting them from a lot of stuff.

188
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.680
Christina Haro: I protecting them from looking at the moment, saying, whoa, Mom, you know,

189
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:38.130
Christina Haro: That's, you know, that's really messed up or, oh, or, you know, that's how I feel. I don't know. I mean, that's, that's how I see things, but I don't think I'd be too. I'd be embarrassed calling you, but I don't think they'd be

190
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:41.520
Christina Haro: Right now you

191
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.700
Christina Haro: I don't think it's the guilt or anything. I don't

192
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:51.690
Christina Haro: I don't know.

193
00:25:53.310 --> 00:26:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So typically, you and I have a pretty pretty smooth process. I think something's happening. I think think something's getting getting kind of blocked in here somewhere. Because I've noticed that, um,

194
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:21.210
Christina Haro: You know, um, let me tell you that the things I'm talking about are not things like things that happened like recently in this time where I, you know,

195
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:29.310
Christina Haro: I was all messed up the things in the past house that I haven't told them, and there's not more recent stuff. No.

196
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:47.970
Christina Haro: There's just stuff in there that I have not shared with them. That's what I'm talking about. But it's not anything like recent you know it's things from the past that up. They've asked me questions, and I'm like, No, you know, other stuff like

197
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.660
Christina Haro: You know, pretending to my addiction. I've shared most of everything with them.

198
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.790
Christina Haro: Things in my past that I don't talk about

199
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.900
Christina Haro: Yeah, but it's not anything like recent

200
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.510
Christina Haro: Them. And I'm like, yeah, no, you know, and like

201
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.120
You know,

202
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you therapist only cares about recent stuff.

203
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:20.460
I know

204
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.080
Christina Haro: We talked about since I was a little girl, you know, I'm

205
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.180
Christina Haro: Not it's not it's not anything, um,

206
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.740
So,

207
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What what I asked you was to take a look at what you deem as embarrassing and see if whatever that is. You either behaved in a particular way or fail to behave in a particular way. Let's just say since you won't tell me right now.

208
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:54.240
Christina Haro: I'd be a particular way, it would look at me and say, Oh, Mom, you know,

209
00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. So just know what you said in here just now. And I said, what, what is it doing, you know, what are you doing differently and your answer to me was, I'm protecting that so stay there a little longer, and see. So if I if he if you were to tell them what you had done.

210
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How is that keeping them safe.

211
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:27.960
Christina Haro: I'm not kidding, it's not. I'm not. You know, it's not anything to keep them safe. I just wouldn't like them to look at me like, say, Oh, Mom, you know,

212
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.550
Christina Haro: You did that you know yeah that case.

213
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.610
Christina Haro: I'm uh yeah I I'm ashamed of my kids looking at me like that.

214
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see,

215
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:51.570
Christina Haro: But I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ashamed of telling you you understand there's a difference. I can't. I couldn't, I couldn't be able to say things to them because I'm ashamed of them.

216
00:28:52.110 --> 00:29:04.920
Christina Haro: looking at me like that. But I wouldn't be a shame to tell you because you're much better than you know we've shared other things, and probably in time I'll probably end up telling you, it wouldn't bother to tell you

217
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So how are you feeling right now. Let's check in with yourself, because I've been pressing pretty hard, you're on an issue. How you doing,

218
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:13.830
Good.

219
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:24.900
Christina Haro: Things are, you know, and there's enlightened telling you. Again, when we talked about that guilt and shame. It was something I hadn't thought about in a long time.

220
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:32.790
Christina Haro: It just happened to pop into my mind when that question came up, and there's something that whoa I remembered, you know, and that's why I brought that up.

221
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And when I talked about the value of shame. Do what do you recall from that discussion and group, what's the value of it.

222
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.900
Christina Haro: The value of shame.

223
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.710
Christina Haro: And I look at my notes.

224
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.640
Christina Haro: Down. I'm like, I'm

225
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.400
Christina Haro: All I remember is you saying

226
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:18.150
Christina Haro: That shame is an immense feeling a negative experience that I remember the value chain.

227
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.290
Christina Haro: Feeling unworthy.

228
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.590
Christina Haro: feeling sorry for yourself.

229
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.140
Christina Haro: And it could be a start of an addictive behaviors that what you said.

230
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.990
Christina Haro: So my little notes I wrote

231
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a good notes. So what's the value I

232
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess.

233
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:59.160
Christina Haro: But to me, the value of shame and I think it's something that you have to let go in order to to move on. Because if not, then I think shame goes along with

234
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.800
Christina Haro: feeling guilty. And then I think you feel like

235
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.410
Christina Haro: You feel like you're not worth anything. You know,

236
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:27.900
Christina Haro: But, you know, again, that's I'm trying to tell you those those few things that that I tell you that I have been here and I thought of and I hadn't thought about it in a long time, you know, then again, I just thought about it and I was like, you know,

237
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:40.320
Christina Haro: When that question came up, it was something I said, Oh, I would never tell my kids because, to me that's shameful and that's how I feel, you know, I feel ashamed.

238
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, exactly.

239
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.960
Christina Haro: And and then it you know it makes you feel like

240
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.820
Christina Haro: Makes you feel. I don't know the word to me the word that comes to mind for me is that

241
00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.900
Christina Haro: Makes me feel dirty makes me feel unworthy me what

242
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I bet.

243
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to sit with that.

244
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.330
Christina Haro: Yes.

245
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:22.590
Christina Haro: And I thought about it in a while, but you know you know definitely you know it's probably going to come out because, you know, they get older.

246
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:33.480
Christina Haro: I look back, let me, let me give you an example. I look back at my mom is she kept a lot of things inside a lot of things she had when she passed away, we

247
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.410
Christina Haro: We found out a lot of things. Mm hmm. And

248
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:50.910
Christina Haro: I wonder, you know, as many times as we asked her mom, you know, tell us the truth. You know, you're going to go, you know, and she kept saying that it was not too. And I don't know if I shared that with you right that my little sister little sister.

249
00:32:51.390 --> 00:33:03.720
Christina Haro: So I would be the baby and she's really not my sister. We knew that growing up, I only saw her before she passed away. And that was one of the things she kept inside of her I would not tell us the truth.

250
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:23.160
Christina Haro: Hmm. So I wonder, you know, me being on the other side with that one. I understand because it really bothered us and after she passed away and we we we already knew. But what we really, really found out that it was the truth. It was like, how could you do that. Mom, you know,

251
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.740
Christina Haro: So, me being on the other side with that one. And seeing my mom get that for a while.

252
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:45.180
Christina Haro: Was very hurtful. Yeah. We're sisters got together and fight so I'm but that was a big one that was a big one. You know, so I understand there's things that I think we should we should let go, we should we should just let it go.

253
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about if you don't let it go. The relationship, the effect that it has on

254
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The voice of addiction and I've talked to you guys and I never know who's really heard this, and who hasn't

255
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have a voice that says normalizes substance use. It's very seductive that rationalizes and said, your. Come on, let's go us again.

256
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's a really big network got some history in there. And then there's the authentic self. So, for a moment, I want you to think about if Shane continues to exist.

257
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What might happen. What's the relationship between Shane and addictive thinking

258
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:42.240
Christina Haro: Well, to me, to me, that would be, you know, I just, okay, to me, that would probably be you know make you feel like, oh, you know,

259
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:55.650
Christina Haro: That, uh, that addiction little boys be telling me, Oh, come on. Let's just go. Let's go do something. Let's feel better about it. Let's go hide it, you know.

260
00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go hide it. Yeah. You don't need to certainly not talk about it.

261
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a big piece of what that group content was about was the relationship between shame and how it fuels.

262
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The justification for addiction.

263
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Chemical dependence those that's your biological you know opiate receptors is not something you consciously or even unconsciously this is just a chemical effect of putting a substance in your body. But right now I'm talking about

264
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A different part of the brain and

265
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, just sort of hear yourself. Tell a story. How does it sound when you say well if I yes I'm going to hold on to this shame and know it will never impact me and my future substance use and no, it's never impacted past substance use. I mean, what's your truth.

266
00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.530
Christina Haro: To

267
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.020
Christina Haro: That one thing that I never said

268
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.760
Christina Haro: Has

269
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:26.940
Christina Haro: Really hasn't come up in my brain. I think other things like what impacted by my there's other things that impacted my addition because I can say there's a third that I can actually separate those two because the things that made me do get into addiction.

270
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:33.960
Christina Haro: Uh huh. I'm really didn't have anything to do with that little thing that happened in my life.

271
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.360
Christina Haro: Okay, because I think me. It was more

272
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.140
Christina Haro: Me more the relationship stuff that really does.

273
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.500
Christina Haro: roll down the hill really quick.

274
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:59.670
Christina Haro: Yeah yeah yeah but I understand. I understand we have, you know, in order for you to get on the road of recovery, you have to

275
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.650
Christina Haro: You have to let go of all that, and I understand. I know.

276
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you are an intelligent woman, no doubt.

277
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:10.890
Christina Haro: I know

278
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Christina intelligence addiction.

279
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Addiction. It doesn't discriminate on your IQ.

280
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.880
Christina Haro: How much

281
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How many cars you have, how much money you earn the biggest house doesn't discriminate

282
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.920
Christina Haro: I know, I know.

283
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.630
Christina Haro: So,

284
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for this last bit, and you're working very hard to tolerate this. You're doing great. Just for a moment. I want you to picture that one of your, you know, your daughter or your son had the experience of feeling dirty.

285
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And unworthy.

286
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hold it for a second, don't run away just stay there present that one of your children had that experience.

287
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling unworthy.

288
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Something they did or fail to do activated this shame and had to live with it for the rest of their life.

289
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And live with it because they wouldn't share it, they wouldn't let it go, as you put it, right, because to share it is to extinguish the shame, actually. So just picture. And do you have one of your children in mind that you're kind of envisioning that maybe has

290
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Has that

291
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:27.390
Christina Haro: Yeah.

292
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:40.530
Christina Haro: Yeah, well, my oldest daughter. She's done a lot of stuff. If I were to tell you the things she's done. You'd be like, Oh my God, yeah, she's done some pretty horrible disgusting things

293
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.790
And

294
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it something that your

295
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Higher Power

296
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: could forgive

297
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.270
Yeah.

298
00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:04.980
Christina Haro: I had to. I had, we had to, well, you know, I don't know. My other kids. Forgive her, but you know, I, I've been able to you know put it past me and say, well, you know,

299
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:13.830
Christina Haro: SHE'S NOT OKAY. WELL, BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS TOLD THIS JUST JUST JUST NOT MENTALLY okay but you know I

300
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:22.680
Christina Haro: I don't think. But see, in her case. I don't think I'm the one that should be able to forgive her because the things she did. She has

301
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:36.030
Christina Haro: She's gonna have to forgive yourself, sooner or later, because if she gets all this is going to realize what she really did, you know, but I understand where what you're saying, I don't think my other kids. Forgive her, she did some

302
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:39.450
Christina Haro: Or horrible disgusting things

303
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

304
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:52.140
Christina Haro: And I think they judge her. The way I see it, you know me standing here and with all this and with my daughter. They judge her and to this day they judge

305
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Do you remember what I asked, which was, Do you believe

306
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That the god is you know it.

307
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: can forgive and love her.

308
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:05.760
Yes.

309
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:13.470
Christina Haro: And I believe, and I believe my God, forgive me, and

310
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.420
Christina Haro: I've actually

311
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.940
Christina Haro: I've actually talked to my, you know,

312
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.840
Christina Haro: My God, all the stuff I've done you know

313
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I

314
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.090
Christina Haro: Think you know

315
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:38.370
Christina Haro: To me at that time and I talked about it with God. And I would go to church and I hope I didn't forget, forgive me for what I did. You know, I just think, okay, you know, I talked to him about it, you know, somebody will forgive me for what I did.

316
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.630
Christina Haro: But that's another thing you know me looking at me looking at the way

317
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:51.660
Christina Haro: They judged her. I just, you know, I'm like, whew, you know,

318
00:40:54.150 --> 00:41:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so go you know how you said you know so what you want to do is want to finish that you're almost there. Christina you're working very hard. Okay, I know this is uncomfortable.

319
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But this distinguishing between the two is pretty important. So

320
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tracks that all the way through. When I look, you got to use your own words, your own truth when I think about how my other kids judge my oldest daughter makes me think about my own behaviors, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, tell me.

321
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:40.890
Christina Haro: Makes me feel that if I were to talk about those things that I've done in my life. They would probably did probably think, oh, maybe that's why she's like that.

322
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.470
Christina Haro: That's how I

323
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.640
Christina Haro: You know, I don't know. I don't know, you know,

324
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:54.840
Christina Haro: They've never given me they've never they've we've had, I tell you, with the kids. I have here.

325
00:41:55.350 --> 00:42:05.220
Christina Haro: We were really open about stuff. And we talked, we all talk about different things, you know, my, my oldest son has shared stuff that we look at him like, Whoa, you know,

326
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:25.710
Christina Haro: And he says your mom, you know, I've done this and that we've all shared stuff and they never given me. They never made me feel like they would even to me like that. Or they would even say, Oh my God, or even shut me out. You know, I don't feel like they would

327
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.850
Christina Haro: But then again, I don't know.

328
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the worst thing they could do is shut you out.

329
00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:39.420
Christina Haro: Probably, but I don't think that would happen. I don't think that would happen.

330
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.190
Christina Haro: I'm pretty sure it wouldn't. I just think that I would have to be

331
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:59.100
Christina Haro: comfortable enough to actually talk about stuff if you know things because you know we've all got together and decided we all get together and say here in park and then one of them will ask the question, you know.

332
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:09.210
Christina Haro: They'll ask the question, and we we played games or we actually say, oh, what's the worst thing you've ever done, you know,

333
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.130
Christina Haro: Which of course they've probably never told me the worst thing they've ever done, but

334
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.910
Christina Haro: But, you know, of course, there's things. I wouldn't share

335
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:32.850
Christina Haro: But compare monetize. Let me share this compared to what I hold inside and compared to what my oldest daughter has done.

336
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.810
Christina Haro: Hers really takes the cake.

337
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.630
Christina Haro: It's back. Okay.

338
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold up for a second.

339
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: In your mind, whether it's rational or irrational, deep down, do you see some

340
00:43:51.810 --> 00:44:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Blame on yourself for what your older daughter did you blame yourself in some way, some sort of wild abstract way do you blame yourself.

341
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.240
No.

342
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.430
Christina Haro: I never connected. I actually sold served I've

343
00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:23.970
Christina Haro: You know, talk to God about stuff if thought about the anti to actually come up with the reason why my older daughter is the way she is and I'm never blinked myself.

344
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:35.790
Christina Haro: I've never ever I've thought, God, you know, maybe I did go wrong, but then I look back at it, and I'm like, No, I know I didn't because

345
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:44.550
Christina Haro: You know, the things that she's done are really bad and I know I had nothing to do with it.

346
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.740
Christina Haro: I don't feel like it's me. I really don't. Yeah.

347
00:44:52.380 --> 00:45:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, you went, you went pretty intense into these concepts of guilt and shame today very impressed you hung in there. It's not an easy thing to do to

348
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To take a look at what's keeping keeping you from sharing something, but I'll continue to to promote this idea all through this week, which has to do with making the switch from Shane.

349
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: To just responsibility.

350
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because taking responsibility means

351
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We take all the fuel all the gasoline away from the the addiction.

352
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's exciting.

353
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:37.620
Christina Haro: Yeah.

354
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing that can come in and hook you oh my gosh, I just saw this horrible thing happened. I just remember this horrible thing. I can't tolerate this in myself. Why then it becomes very convenient to want to reach out and now now.

355
00:45:52.470 --> 00:46:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. You did good, my lady. So let's um let's meet again on a Monday and I'll get to see you on Friday. Is there any medication attached to today. Are you just good to go.

356
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:06.870
Christina Haro: No, I'm good to go.

357
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:07.770
Okay.

358
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:10.290
Christina Haro: Thank you.

359
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll see you Monday also obviously this Friday. But then, February 17 at seven.

360
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.160
Christina Haro: The usual yes

361
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll go back in and we'll do a little bit more of the processing with the FDR. Okay.

362
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

363
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.430
Christina Haro: Yeah, great. Bye bye.
