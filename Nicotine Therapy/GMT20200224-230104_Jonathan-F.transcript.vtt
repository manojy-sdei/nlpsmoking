117
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.960
Jonathan Figg: Have you had any history or problems with your liver.

118
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.100

119
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.400

120
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.470
new: I believe so. Okay. All right.

121
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.470
Jonathan Figg: And do you know the results of that. Yeah.

122
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.460
new: Now I'm clean

123
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:10.680
Jonathan Figg: You came up negative. Good. Okay. All right, so what's your understanding of buprenorphine the medication were interested in using here.

124
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:17.670
new: And I was reading about him too, and I tried to explain to the people at the ER that it's not the same as the Suboxone you know

125
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:28.740
new: This way it actually doesn't have the no oxygen in it. Correct. The sublime text version, the pill version. No, not the sublingual version.

126
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:41.400
new: SEBI texts, what I had does not have naloxone in it. So that was just an opiate to wean myself down and like a safer OBO correct that there's a box as the

127
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.820
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, so there's two brands right we when we say Suboxone that's the brand, the actual medication is called buprenorphine Suboxone the brand.

128
00:10:52.020 --> 00:11:00.600
Jonathan Figg: Has naloxone in it as well, which is the reversal agent and that's an abuse deterrent in there so that people don't

129
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:09.000
new: Hurt good though man is I've taken that before you can you can feel that part of it in your brain, you know, knocks on

130
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.100
Jonathan Figg: What do you mean, so

131
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:20.250
new: They benefits it that deterring where you can't get high, it alters your brain in a good way. You feel normal. Once

132
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:31.680
Jonathan Figg: Again, yeah. So let's talk about. So the two things in there. The buprenorphine is an opiate it's different in the way it works, then fentanyl or oxy or something like that. Phenol oxy those

133
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:41.100
Jonathan Figg: few important things they do, they turn on the pleasure center of your brains that gives you the high the euphoria, they turn off the pain receptors in your brain.

134
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.830
Jonathan Figg: What's your chart log out there, they turn off the receptors in your brain.

135
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:55.860
Jonathan Figg: And then they turn off the breathing and wakefulness centers in your brain, right. That's the overdose that we're concerned about if you if you take too much, you will stop breathing. Alright.

136
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:08.280
Jonathan Figg: buprenorphine. If you think about each of those actions as light switches okay buprenorphine only moves them halfway instead of all the way. So it doesn't give you the euphoria, the high. The other medication.

137
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.660
new: Right.

138
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.020
Jonathan Figg: It's a partial I actually right. Yeah.

139
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:32.100
Jonathan Figg: And so it will stop your withdrawal, though, because it's still moves the switch, but it doesn't have the high and it doesn't turn off your breathing and wakefulness. The way the other ones do so by itself, it's exceedingly difficult to overdose on which makes it significantly safer thing.

140
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:42.420
Jonathan Figg: The nine o'clock zone is a reversal agent, and we'll talk about that. So the way that the medication is taken in this is dissolved under the tongue.

141
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.400
Jonathan Figg: There's a set of veins underneath the tongue that are in the skin is really, really thin

142
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:57.180
Jonathan Figg: So your saliva dissolves the tablet or their film and the buprenorphine crosses and gets into your bloodstream. So you get the effect of the north, and then the locks on is too big.

143
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:14.250
Jonathan Figg: Of the chemical and so it doesn't so you don't get that a lot. It's, it's a tiny fraction point out something 1% almost negligible amount of no lock so the. However, if you crush it and snort it or shoot it or something like

144
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:14.610
That

145
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.010
Jonathan Figg: And it puts people into withdrawal. So that's the abuse deterrent effect there.

146
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:35.490
Jonathan Figg: If you chew it up and swallow the pill or the film almost nothing is absorbed through the digestive tract, neither the buprenorphine or no oxygen. So it's like taking nothing so people will withdraw if they've been on something and take it the wrong way. So,

147
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:45.120
Jonathan Figg: Has to be taken a very specific way. But it is a safer medication and because it will keep people out of withdrawal.

148
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:55.140
Jonathan Figg: It will move this word, so it suppresses the cravings do something else. But it doesn't have a high, it tends to be a more useful thing for people who are wanting to be in recovery.

149
00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:06.840
Jonathan Figg: The other important part is that when you take buprenorphine and once it gets into your brain. It grabs on hold on to the receptor in your brain tighter than other things. And what that means is

150
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:24.180
Jonathan Figg: If you're on Suboxone and you take something else oxy fentanyl Norco whatever it won't get hold of the receptor, the buprenorphine will block the effect so you won't get the higher the effect of taking something else. So it helps deter people

151
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.420
new: From

152
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.590
Jonathan Figg: All. Hey, I have this on hand. I'm going to take it because they won't get the high from the base. So, that makes sense.

153
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.000
new: Yeah, I do.

154
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.410
Jonathan Figg: Know you were

155
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:57.480
new: You had a prescription, though. So are you like the opiate doctor or like are you like my doctor now or like what, like, are you just in this, like, like if I had like a nether like mental like anything like would you diagnose that or is it just per opiate right

156
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:14.940
Jonathan Figg: So I'm an internal medicine doctor. I'm a primary care doctor by trade by training and I specialize in addiction treatment, though I don't I don't generally do the other mental health stuff, depression, anxiety, things like that with bright side, I do addiction treatment.

157
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.280
Jonathan Figg: With

158
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:28.800
new: Bryce Are you like focused on you only prescribe likes box. And so, like, what if I was like trying to wean myself off and like I always have had trouble sleeping, like what I can be used for that or like

159
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:36.960
Jonathan Figg: Sometimes, but generally for broader mental health conditions. We want you to see your primary care doctor

160
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.840
Jonathan Figg: All right. Okay. Um,

161
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:55.560
Jonathan Figg: So, um, I wanted to ask you, you got a prescription from the ED for the buprenorphine and the Suboxone and the eight milligram form. It looks like most recently, and that was a 14 how much of that were you taking per day.

162
00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:14.880
new: Oh my god. On the 14th and I didn't even take them until like the 15th like late the 15th. And then I was sober from my fence and off since like the 15th, but the first night to like three and I have honestly

163
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.150
new: stretched it out a little bit and took three and then

164
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:33.540
new: Had to go like a day of feeling like shit because I wasn't getting to you guys in time. And I knew I had a very limited supply. So I was doing like to

165
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:44.970
new: Know, and it went from like three to to to to to like I have like one left and I did like a half and a half, you know, just to something, but

166
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:57.570
new: The most I took was three. Though the last two days yesterday and the day before. I only had like a half or like a whole house but still feel pretty shitty but

167
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:04.020
Jonathan Figg: No. So when you're taking a half and a half in a day were you having symptoms of withdrawal.

168
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.240
new: For sure. Okay.

169
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.790
Jonathan Figg: When you were taking more than that to tablets in a day were you having symptoms of withdrawal.

170
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:25.410
new: Know it seemed like about two and a half did it for me three might have been a little too much or all I want. Probably, but maybe like two and a half or three a day was like what I needed at first. Okay.

171
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:36.270
Jonathan Figg: So somewhere around two or two and a half, you felt like was a better place three was too much did it make you drowsy constipated, dry mouth, Domino pain, anything like that.

172
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.040
new: Okay, just

173
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.880
Jonathan Figg: need that much still felt okay on two and a half, okay.

174
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.210
Yeah.

175
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:53.190
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so let's talk about your withdrawal when you withdraw from opiates. What's the general pattern of symptoms that you develop what happens first.

176
00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:10.320
new: Just completely lethargic in the day this week, no appetite just feel like moving 1000 miles every step. But, and then at night, just like terrible restless legs can't sleep at all, you know,

177
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:18.450
new: Okay, well, gee, stuff like that, no appetite just looked Arctic no motivation, nothing.

178
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.210
Jonathan Figg: Do you get nauseated.

179
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.340
new: Really

180
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.140
Do you have diarrhea.

181
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.720
new: Sometimes, yeah.

182
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.200
new: Runny nose. Yeah. Use bumps.

183
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.330
Jonathan Figg: Right. And does that kind of develop as time goes on.

184
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:38.610
Okay.

185
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.610
Jonathan Figg: Are you totally out of Suboxone no

186
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.750
Yeah.

187
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.610
Jonathan Figg: Alright, so your last dose was last night. Just to make sure I understand that.

188
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.210
Okay.

189
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:57.120
Jonathan Figg: And where are you currently as far as your withdrawal in the way symptoms develop what do you currently have.

190
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.840
new: I get it. The worst at nighttime so

191
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:17.340
new: I wouldn't be, it would be a rough night like sleeping night but just like a little unmotivated like lethargic, but tolerable for now but I get it, like the rest of his legs asleep, is what really gets me. Gotcha. Okay. All right.

192
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.720
All right, I think.

193
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:36.480
Jonathan Figg: I think that's the majority of the questions. So whatever to just the way it let me, let me explain how bright side works so brightside is an addiction treatment program that is based around weekly support groups.

194
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:46.230
Jonathan Figg: So the way the support groups work is we put you into a group that meets by zoom here like just like we're meeting.

195
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:54.750
Jonathan Figg: With other people who have gone through or are going through similar situations with a history of opiate addiction independence.

196
00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:04.050
Jonathan Figg: Who are in various stages of recovery and it's kind of like an NA meeting. It's led by a counselor or therapist with a history in addiction treatment.

197
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:15.480
Jonathan Figg: And it started. It's about an hour long and it starts with a check in with the doctor. So you basically get access to your doctor on a weekly or every other week basis.

198
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:27.210
Jonathan Figg: To make sure your medication doses right that you're not having side effects where you are, as far as are you keeping a stable dose. Are you tapering are you going up or down, things like that. And to make sure that you don't run out of medication.

199
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:37.500
Jonathan Figg: And then the therapist has some kind of topic about preventing relapse or stress management, you know, various topics and things like that.

200
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.680
Jonathan Figg: We see

201
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:49.140
Jonathan Figg: I have a Tuesday 3pm group that has openings. Would that work for you.

202
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.630
new: I got cool actually get what are your other times that day or

203
00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:01.440
Jonathan Figg: I have a Thursday 3pm as well that has openings. What's your schedule like

204
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.450
new: Monday. Monday, Wednesday tend to

205
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.500
new: They tend to be and then whose day there is a 123

206
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:22.980
Jonathan Figg: I see. Okay, so those are those are bump up too much. Okay. And then here's what I'll do, I'll have one of the care coordinators.

207
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:36.420
Jonathan Figg: Get ahold of you right after this to figure out a different group that that I'm not the only doctor, we have quite a few doctors and they have other various times that may work better for your schedule. Okay.

208
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.030
new: So when you be my doctor or would I have a different doctor different time what

209
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:49.890
Jonathan Figg: You probably have a different doctor so that you would be able to see them on a regular basis, you know, depending on your schedule, if

210
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.830
new: You're only a Tuesday, Doctor.

211
00:21:54.060 --> 00:22:09.180
Jonathan Figg: So I have openings on Tuesday and Thursday at 3pm for my groups. Currently, but those don't work for you and that's okay. I want you to, you know, be successful in school and have a job and things like that. So we have other groups, run by other doctors

212
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.070
Jonathan Figg: As well.

213
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.040
new: Let's try them Tuesday. We're trying to say.

214
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.440
Jonathan Figg: Do you think you'd be able to

215
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:23.160
new: Be able to do it. I just, I get I think I'll be fine. Honestly, I get out like 230 or something. So, okay.

216
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.160
Jonathan Figg: Because I don't want it to be a stress point for you.

217
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.310
new: I think I'd rather just wrap it all up, it might be better.

218
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.830
new: I think I'll be able to do. I wouldn't, I tell you. Now, if I was going to be there.

219
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.700
Jonathan Figg: And just so you understand its weekly, it would be every Tuesday at 3pm.

220
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.900
new: Okay, it's only one every Tuesday or Thursday, right,

221
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.220
new: Right.

222
00:22:44.250 --> 00:23:01.710
Jonathan Figg: Oh yeah. Those are just my availability, so yes. Correct. So we will get you signed up into the Tuesday at 3pm group and me and the therapist. With me is her name is Yvonne, and she's great. And then we have other patients who are going through recovery and are

223
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.760
You know, in similar or have been. And so our situations to you.

224
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:13.020
Jonathan Figg: Okay. And then what we'll do is I'll issue you a prescription for

225
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:20.250
Jonathan Figg: The Suboxone. Let me see. Make sure is right eight on Folsom Boulevard, the correct pharmacy for you.

226
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.380
new: For okay

227
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:34.920
Jonathan Figg: Here. Here's another one more question about the medication. First day gave you a script for films and the second time, most recently they give you a script for tabs. Is that correct,

228
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:43.530
new: Yeah, I think good tabs work i don't know i they work a little better for me the strips were disgusting for me.

229
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.580
Jonathan Figg: Do you know if there was any issue as far as what your insurance would pay for

230
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.800
new: Yeah, my insurance didn't want the strips. That's why I got the tabs. Okay.

231
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.700
Jonathan Figg: So we'll send for the tabs that she's one less headache to jump through

232
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:08.370
Jonathan Figg: One was hurdles to jump through. OK. So I'm going to send it for a dose of two and a half. What I would say just since it takes about five to 10 minutes usually for the thing to dissolve under your tongue.

233
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:16.170
Jonathan Figg: If you can do more than one that's great if you want to split it up and do it like one and a half and one later in the day.

234
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.280
One and a half in the morning.

235
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.910
Jonathan Figg: Okay. That would probably be easier.

236
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:39.000
Jonathan Figg: The medication usually last 24 hours of 28 hours and most people system, but sometimes we split up the dosing just for convenience sake. So that would be fine. And then we'd be able to join us tomorrow at 3pm. The first Tuesday.

237
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:55.470
Jonathan Figg: Sure. Okay. Cool. All you need to do as I know you'll be leaving school. But as soon as you're able to tomorrow before 3pm. You're going to call the virtual clinic, just like you did before our appointment today and then they'll make sure any

238
00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.030
new: First number this this number or the very

239
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.920
Jonathan Figg: First, the first number that you call that's our virtual. It's kind of like a front desk of a medical

240
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.960
new: That you have that again.

241
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:13.260
Jonathan Figg: I'll have to pull it up. I'll get it for you, though, and then

242
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:32.700
Jonathan Figg: They'll make sure everything's taken care of. As far as paperwork or urine drug screens and things like that. And they'll give you our room number which changes every week for the group. Okay. All right, cool. Um, alright, all this your prescription. Do you have any questions or concerns, I'm

243
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.410
new: Just curious, have you ever

244
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:42.960
new: Talked to people in person and we have you ever did you start off in person and lead to this virtual end of Dr. Yeah.

245
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.790
Jonathan Figg: So I I practice. I have my primary care practices. I live in Jackson, Wyoming.

246
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.380
new: And when you're

247
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.180
new: You know,

248
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.170
Jonathan Figg: You're in. I can pull it up.

249
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.330
new: In California,

250
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:03.750
Jonathan Figg: Yeah, I'm unlicensed you're in Sacramento. Okay unlicensed in California as well so

251
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:13.620
Jonathan Figg: I have a primary care practice where I also do addiction treatment here in Jackson and then I do telemedicine because that lets me help more people

252
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.030
new: Besides the virtual

253
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.990
Jonathan Figg: I find it's really convenient for a lot of people

254
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.170
Jonathan Figg: I enjoy it. Yeah.

255
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.300
new: Oh, okay.

256
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.000
Jonathan Figg: Any other questions or concerns, I can help you with right now.

257
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:34.740
Jonathan Figg: Of the trend. I'm an issue, your prescription. I usually recommend give it about an hour or so and then go to the pharmacy just so

258
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:41.100
new: How long does that last. What is it, how every until Tuesday every Tuesday I come in to you or

259
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:49.260
Jonathan Figg: So I'm going to issue a prescription for a little over a week just to get you through this weekend, and the next week.

260
00:26:50.430 --> 00:27:00.540
Jonathan Figg: And then my suspicion is that will play with your dose, a little bit. And then as we stabilize out the prescriptions will get longer just for convenience sake.

261
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.750
Jonathan Figg: With bright side, our policies are. I want to give you as long leash.

262
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:17.340
Jonathan Figg: As long a prescription as I can to help you succeed to keep you functional to keep you, you know, able to, you know, so that you're not spending all your time with the pharmacy when people

263
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:32.040
Jonathan Figg: Buy policy when people start missing groups which prevents them from recovering as well. Then we start shortening the prescriptions so that they have to come back to the group and be engaged in the program.

264
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.050
new: They say, okay,

265
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:41.130
Jonathan Figg: Our goal is to support people as best we can in their recovery from as many angles as we can. So all

266
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:57.180
Jonathan Figg: Right. All right, then I will have them all have the care coordinator follow up with you because I can pull up the virtual clinic zoom number right now. And that way, don't make sure you have all the information you need for tomorrow. Okay.

267
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.380
new: All right, thanks.

268
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:03.390
Jonathan Figg: Awesome. You have a wonderful evening, go to the pharmacy in about an hour, hour and a half to you.

269
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.330
Jonathan Figg: Take care. Bye bye.

270
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:24.330
Jonathan Figg: Okay, so we pulled trends cures report during the visit, which shows you didn't initially, go to your printer feigning prescription for 10 milligrams. And then for eight milligrams and that would be from the

271
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:33.540
Jonathan Figg: Emergency room, which is what he was talking about, and then back in 2019 there's scripts for triathlon, which is probably

272
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.160
Jonathan Figg: The detox program that he talked about

273
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:53.370
Jonathan Figg: And to get back to we pulled his as I am an expert questionnaires and as I am. I didn't see anything concerning

274
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.870
