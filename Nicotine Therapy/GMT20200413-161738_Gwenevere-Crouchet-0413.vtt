Jaime C: Yeah, I do want to give you the heads up though.

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.770
Jaime C: I am working I'm covering the desk and it's only I had somebody quit this morning.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.990
Jaime C: And I got here.

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.210
Jaime C: So we're kind of stuck.

12
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.230
Jaime C: A look you today.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, thank you.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.980
Jaime C: You're always looking at them.

16
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Get in here to a note but boo boo boo BA so good, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Now you're able to um

17
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you kind of not have a Betty bustin Anya.

18
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.790
Jaime C: Yeah, I hope my office door shut, and I only have a couple people here, but I could, I mean the phone could ring.

19
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.180
Jaime C: So I just want to let you know if that happens, or if somebody walks up to the desk.

20
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.170
Jaime C: That's my worry about

21
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a front desk urine.

22
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
Jaime C: Well, I'm in my office and I can just watch the desk from the camera.

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe we won't go any kind of deep stuff will kind of keep it cognitive behavioral today.

24
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.760
Jaime C: Okay, perfect.

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That seems smart.

26
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: 13th and

27
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

28
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to keep the same hours are you still bringing in the same income has your life significantly changed from what's going on.

29
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.230
Jaime C: Oh no, I mean it has not changed much. No, I mean, except for I'm working more

30
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.380
Jaime C: They are talking about a lot of the corporate people had to take a 50% salary cut

31
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.570
Jaime C: And

32
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.430
Jaime C: It hasn't gotten down to our level yet, but I am a little bit worried about that coming

33
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I've zero percent.

34
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.420
Jaime C: Yeah.

35
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if we think about it like this. I mean, I don't know how you're thinking about it, but I'm thinking if this last to July, August, something like that.

36
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe better than losing the whole job.

37
00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.110
Jaime C: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And I keep reminding myself that that if that does happen. It's only temporary.

38
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.300
Jaime C: And that I can go and get

39
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.620
Jaime C: The company's still tells us that we can go get partial unemployment.

40
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.030
Oh,

41
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.330
Jaime C: So it'll be okay.

42
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just inconvenient.

43
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.090
Yes.

44
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, that's what's funny, it's obviously an understatement. But

45
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.390
Yeah.

46
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's check in on. How's your son.

47
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.820
Jaime C: He is good.

48
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.110
Jaime C: He we changed counselors.

49
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.050
Jaime C: Are you seem to like a lot better.

50
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.950
Jaime C: And she's doing video. I mean not video but a telephone calls with him every Friday.

51
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:58.860
Jaime C: So I was a little worried about that, when all this stuff happened because he had missed a couple of appointments, but then they started doing the via telephone calls. So, um,

52
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:15.720
Jaime C: I feel like that she this new counselor. I feel like is definitely a better fit for him. He's, he's she seems to be digging in a lot deeper and further and he's doing really good. There's been a couple times where him and I

53
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.750
Jaime C: And my buttheads. We really do.

54
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.360
Jaime C: But

55
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.390
Jaime C: I think that both of us are kind of learning how to communicate better

56
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to spend some time on average wants to focus to go somewhere else.

57
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.350
Jaime C: Um,

58
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.100
Jaime C: Yeah, I don't even know what to talk about today.

59
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.780
Jaime C: I do know the bowl great things been bothering me a lot. This last week.

60
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.600
Jaime C: I've been having a hard time with it.

61
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it that you're feeling lonely.

62
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.780
Jaime C: I guess maybe that's what it is.

63
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

64
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well who else do you call around with

65
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.190
Jaime C: Nobody

66
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.910
Yeah.

67
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um, and now

68
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What I

69
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Have been inviting is that people kind of use this forum this sort of zoom platform to reconnect with people, even as far crosses across the state across the country just

70
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Setting up, what if you did a network event. What, what would that in your world and your either your business world, or people. I went to school with, what would that look like if you were to host. I'm a coffee.

71
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Girls coffee afternoon or something or wine and cheese, minus the wine.

72
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.630
Jaime C: Well, I don't know. I don't really know. Anybody here. The only people I know here are people I work with, really.

73
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.540
Jaime C: And I wouldn't feel comfortable

74
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.560
Jaime C: I guess going and having coffee with my with my employees that I manage

75
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.940
Jaime C: Right.

76
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am watching, not only in my own life, but in other people's lives, especially in the corporate setting their hosting like they'll have a

77
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Something similar to a happy hour. But maybe it's a yoga hour and they might show a video and there might be people that are doing some stretching that day, there might be

78
00:06:45.870 --> 00:07:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Little I was talking to one person about maybe changing. She's kind of in HR. So it was kind of turning HR concepts and trainings, so that it's not unpleasant because they're getting sort of meeting fatigue in Zoom is my point that is

79
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I do. Yes, that's what I'm talking about, talking about having it in a meeting in here.

80
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now you're getting it right.

81
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you're either whether you're seeing it as sort of a way to enjoy company with people maybe on your level and maybe slightly above or, you know, something like that.

82
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Or yeah, this discussion, or maybe it's reviewing HR concepts or a scavenger hunt or maybe you're the one hosting these team building pieces.

83
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is a great opportunity. I think for people to see it as a way to where you know people above administration can see your creativity can see that this is an increased stress and how I use the resources that you have to stay connected. Keep the cohesiveness of your organization.

84
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this is an opportunity to shine.

85
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.900
Jaime C: See ya. Good idea. Yeah.

86
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:05.850
Jaime C: Because I have a lot of people, you know, have you know colleagues on LinkedIn.

87
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:14.460
Jaime C: Through our whole region and other regions so that I could use that through LinkedIn, I think, like, make a post on LinkedIn and

88
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.590
Jaime C: Yeah.

89
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it's and it's working.

90
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then you get this contact you get to feel that aptitude and like you're still in your groove. I'm feeling intelligent and capable and all of that. And sometimes it's also that camaraderie that we're missing because we're not really

91
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, you're not isolated to too much, but you were making important connections when you were, you know, few months ago. Really important career connections and you don't want to lose those right

92
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.220
Jaime C: Right, right.

93
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:47.970
Jaime C: Yeah.

94
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.310
Jaime C: Yeah, that's a good idea. I think that I will. I'll definitely look into that one. I like that idea.

95
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

96
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now shift over to a social one who on more of a social maybe not LinkedIn, but maybe more, if it is LinkedIn that has people that maybe you've always kind of wanted to kind of pal around with, and you did a ladies night in and you are the host

97
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.180
Jaime C: I know that was like my friends and stuff back from home.

98
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

99
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.830
Jaime C: I would be good, but I've never talked to them and I missed them.

100
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.110
Jaime C: Yes, yeah.

101
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do now, here's what I noticed when I ran. I did one of those. And I learned some important information from it.

102
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever done a group a video chat before where there's multiple friends and have you ever done that.

103
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.580
Jaime C: I haven't, I haven't hosted one I've been in them but

104
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So here's what I saw, I had people that didn't know each other. And it went badly.

105
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm saying badly because right I run groups all the time, more, the merrier. But I'm also doing this the whole time.

106
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I'm like making you know I'm doing it right. So,

107
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a really different dynamic in a in a in a meeting because we're normally if we were sitting at a dinner party. I would be talking to the person next to me the person across the table would be listening.

108
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe they would lean and be like, Oh my gosh, would be to you would chime in spontaneously and now you've got these three and then the one next door hears that and and they pull in

109
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But because of the challenges in the when we over talk in, zoom, it's cumbersome. It doesn't flow like

110
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Where we can you can hear little, little things like, well, you can join as easily.

111
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.330
So, yeah.

112
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, of course, this just kind of been a characteristic of a particular group of people that I was in. Well, good.

113
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Question.

114
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:52.920
Good.

115
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.470
Jaime C: Question.

116
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.310
Jaime C: How would I spend my money.

117
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.250
Jaime C: Because my

118
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:10.590
Jaime C: Shirt.

119
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.240
Jaime C: Because we're in a big town. So do you still have the paperwork that you got with it that envelope that it can

120
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:22.800
Jaime C: Maybe look on the

121
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Recording

122
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

123
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's it making you think of for social like so I was trying to say what I saw went wrong with mine.

124
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to have really people that didn't know each other and really different personalities and it was just very, you know, I ended up kicking into gear as the host right and I picked a topic.

125
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it went fine but in other words, having a theme is what my takeaway was it's a book club.

126
00:11:52.740 --> 00:12:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's favorite coffee shop or bring your coffee. What do you like most or share a recipe. In other words, having this sort of like we're all talking about this and then we talk about things gives people a place to start.

127
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.180
Jaime C: Okay.

128
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.070
Jaime C: Yeah.

129
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:15.780
Jaime C: I have. Well, I had a group of friends from back home. There's about six or seven of us.

130
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.670
Jaime C: That all went to like from kindergarten all through high school.

131
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:29.070
Jaime C: In life after. So maybe I mean, and that's been a long time since all of us together. So maybe we could just get together just to kind of reminisce maybe

132
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't that be fun.

133
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.400
Jaime C: I would be, yeah.

134
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To cry.

135
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.010
Jaime C: Like that idea. I did.

136
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good.

137
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.220
Jaime C: Enjoy.

138
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that there are even free little cute invitations. If you wanted to make it super cutesy, you can always do it through your social media that you have a regular text.

139
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, if you've got your little zoom accounts you can send them a little invitation right from your phone just they do this, and they'll

140
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, well, this is the number is because you're going to have your own. You have your own personal ID number. I don't really know how to walk you through that you could get into virtual clinic and they probably help you but

141
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You do have one that's associated with you, I believe, and you guys used to because I used to meet in yours. So don't walk in on them because before we had a waiting room there was people with just

142
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Own so that was fun. Um,

143
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so, anyway.

144
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be fun and you're not the only one experiencing this everybody's feeling lonely.

145
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:38.550
Jaime C: Yeah.

146
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because we're even at work when that's where we get our social connection. We're not getting that water cooler experience.

147
00:13:45.630 --> 00:14:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's all this low grade anxiety about finances, our family members, health and it's all happening to all of us. So that is even someplace. We can talk about. Okay, so this is watch this. This will make you giggle. This is what I shared

148
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When it would get too serious because I bring up you know really serious stuff I'm playful, but I also bring up. Sorry. So, so it's like okay. So just so you guys don't

149
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: take it too seriously. I'll show you.

150
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What this was cute.

151
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Man Wow. I was like this I was like okay so this is me every morning.

152
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't judge me.

153
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it done.

154
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, why do you have to be bathing suit.

155
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Plus laundry detergent to us.

156
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you could do. I'm

157
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: A joke party everybody brings three jokes and read them and you show

158
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Right. I mean, it could be anything but it's great.

159
00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: For everyone, they're like, well, I don't know what I'm going to say I'm going to see the long time. Bring your before and after pictures, you know, bring your take a snap of your high school picture.

160
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I will try and get something fun, you know,

161
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:15.270
Jaime C: Yeah, that's a good idea because I still have a yearbook. And we all have tons of pictures on our yearbook. I could pull those up.

162
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or like you only try and on the guests. Like if you block out this like, who is it

163
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.880
Right.

164
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.980
Jaime C: See if they can go there. Good idea. I like that.

165
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.500
Jaime C: I'm excited to do this now.

166
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And you do it and then you can pass along to someone else who's you're starting to notice is feeling isolated and

167
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we can feel less isolated. I will say careful of your eyes. I'm noticing a lot of i i'm i fatigue from how much online course i'm on and all day long but

168
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: For people that are just be mindful of that, that it's it's definitely that whatever that blue lighting or backlighting or something.

169
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: can have an impact.

170
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, I took the fun right out of that deny

171
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got ways to reconnect. And yes, it will take a little bit of effort. But wouldn't it be neat.

172
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:19.740
Jaime C: Yeah, I'm excited about that. I really am. I don't know why we got about stuff like that before.

173
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're busy thinking about Greg and about what's missing what's missing what's missing, could I write what what are you thinking when you think about that relationship. What's coming up.

174
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.820
Jaime C: I'm just, I guess I'm just

175
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:47.880
Jaime C: I don't understand how we got here. I don't understand that. It's just shocking to me almost it just baffles me that we could be so close for five years and all sudden just bam, nothing.

176
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.570
Jaime C: That's what I think about

177
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's interesting that you say we

178
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't I mean like

179
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We were close. So what if it was just you. So I was close to him. Look at me, I'm not doing

180
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The same thing. That's what if you looked at it like that like

181
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You were close to him. You felt close to him.

182
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, okay. So what did you do differently.

183
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.790
Jaime C: What well what do you mean

184
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know.

185
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't think I don't think it's

186
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I have an opinion about it, but I don't know what's real. So we were so close. And now we're not together, but she but something's happened some things happened.

187
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Some things happen to you.

188
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That didn't come out of the blue today.

189
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.330
Jaime C: I got to what it feels like.

190
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.760
Jaime C: I mean, I don't

191
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.610
Jaime C: Hold on, my phone's ringing

192
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right.

193
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.690
Jaime C: Thank you for calling the king. So this is Jamie, how many hope you

194
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you not

195
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationship with Greg what I

196
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.260
Jaime C: What I didn't like about it.

197
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.480
Jaime C: Well, I just, I mean, I didn't like that we never saw each other.

198
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.120
Jaime C: And

199
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.990
Jaime C: I didn't like that.

200
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.480
Jaime C: I that I felt like I was putting more into it than he was.

201
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.400
Jaime C: I'm sure that this whole thing is probably a blessing in disguise.

202
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:57.840
Jaime C: You know,

203
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:09.270
Jaime C: Be better to have a boyfriend or somebody that was around and hang out with, and be around with all the time. Or, you know, or even it's

204
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:15.870
Jaime C: As much as it hurts that he's not around. It almost feels like a relief to

205
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.080
Jaime C: Or you just, I don't know.

206
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.860
Jaime C: It almost feels better to be single than to have

207
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.820
Jaime C: I mean, it was a long distance relationship.

208
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at your words, they're interesting ones if you'd look at them just sort of as

209
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of metaphors and symbols. We were so close.

210
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually

211
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We never saw each other.

212
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a long distance relationship. It's interesting that you said we were so close.

213
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What if, as you begin to tolerate more intimacy more intimacy with yourself with memories with fright as your healing.

214
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're able to possibly tolerate more intensity of emotions. Maybe your expectation on what close can mean maybe it means you might be getting close to maybe being WITH someone who's writing town.

215
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you're getting ready for that. What if that's what you're up to weigh in the unconscious

216
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.460
Jaime C: Yeah.

217
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a scary thing.

218
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:44.640
Jaime C: Yeah.

219
00:20:53.370 --> 00:21:05.700
Jaime C: I don't know the whole. It just doesn't. I guess the part that I keep thinking about it. Just like I keep trying to remind myself of certain things that I just didn't like about the relationship just

220
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.660
Jaime C: It just doesn't feel right.

221
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.810
Jaime C: I don't know how to say it other than that.

222
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning you artificially tricking yourself but really it was a perfect relationship.

223
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:33.030
Jaime C: Yeah, like us not being together just doesn't feel right. And I've never I it's just, that's a new feeling for me. I've never anytime. I've ended relationship or, you know, gone through a breakup, I

224
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:40.950
Jaime C: Luckily, just been able to deal with it pretty easily, but for whatever reason. This one I have a hard time with

225
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't remember the details. Exactly. Um, but I had in my head that it was you. You got to correct me. Don't you know to me. I can be really wrong, but I have in my head that it was like

226
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't make time for me clearly had time you were talking to your daughter. You did have time haven't been checking into me and that's it. Was it close to that.

227
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:14.610
Jaime C: Summer. Yeah, and he's because he's sitting in the middle of Mexico chasing cartel guys that

228
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:23.550
Jaime C: escaped from prison and I'm like worried sick about him every day. And he's taking time to check in with his daughters, but not me.

229
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.290
Jaime C: I just, I felt like that was so disrespectful and so wrong for him to just not

230
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.060
Jaime C: I don't know. He could have took that worried for me. And he chose not to.

231
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you end up saying like the way you are. Now, what, what was his response when you brought it to him. Just the way you did just now.

232
00:22:48.030 --> 00:23:00.000
Jaime C: He just said that he's diamond supposed to be on the phone and that when he does check in with me. He shouldn't even be doing that. So basically he was making me feel like I should be grateful. But the communication that I am getting

233
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't care. Interesting. Can I share what I've heard just now.

234
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that there's you're not that your perspective is there someone here.

235
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: No, my ears are all funky do so I gotta do there.

236
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I heard.

237
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I only have a few minutes.

238
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to call my daughter.

239
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I heard.

240
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If you only have a few minutes. Aren't you going to call your son.

241
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.370
Jaime C: Yeah.

242
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's what I heard.

243
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of me getting offended. Like I could see the logic, because I applied it to myself and I'm like, I'm sorry, honey. You're a grown man. I'm gonna check on my, my kid. First, you see it.

244
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.280
Jaime C: Yeah, absolutely.

245
00:23:51.780 --> 00:24:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And but then we have to say I'm sorry, sweetheart. I prioritize my daughter over you and nobody's going to want to say that. So I'm wondering if that was a difficult choice for him and maybe he doesn't have that emotional thing to be able to say

246
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to say that out loud. I love you but I budgeted if only got three or four minutes and I'm already risking my job and getting written up or being found out because that can get Tracer. I don't know how deep you know I watched a lot of movies.

247
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Or know what it is, you know,

248
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm watching Call Saul, or something like that and my head. You know, so it just like, but what's it like to hear someone else's perspective on that.

249
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:51.870
Jaime C: It makes. I mean, it makes 100% sense I just never thought of it that way. And I wish I would have gone for I said the things that I said

250
00:24:53.340 --> 00:25:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You think that maybe that's why there's this in congruency inside like the way it's not settling like I don't understand why we're not together does something doesn't feel right. Because normally it's really clear I'm imagining

251
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in a whole I'm a good person and you've been able to let them go. Right.

252
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're like dude. Now Miss you mature, you're just

253
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A look because if it happens if we might be onto something. Now then, what if it's just that that would be a weird thing to, I don't know, maybe that's not what you actually believe, maybe you would have done the same thing or

254
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's why you're having trouble not being together doesn't feel right. Maybe it's somewhere in there. Maybe that's not exactly it. But maybe it's somewhere in there. Do you think

255
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.850
Jaime C: Yeah, it could be

256
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.950
Jaime C: I could be. I mean, I have a lot of regret about getting mad about it.

257
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.940
Jaime C: And I really

258
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.220
Jaime C: I don't feel like he hates me or is mad at me. I feel like

259
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:19.500
Jaime C: I feel like he and because of the little things that he kind of said when we were going back and forth. I feel like he thinks he's doing me a favor, like he wants me to be with somebody that's there every day. I mean, he has said that many times throughout our relationship.

260
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.490
Jaime C: And I think that's what he what he's doing is that he wants.

261
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:37.800
Jaime C: I know that he doesn't like it when I feel bad. He hates that part. And then when I talked to him about how I feel bad. He kind of shuts down. And so maybe

262
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:43.380
Jaime C: I think he just got to the point where he doesn't want to watch me feel bad anymore.

263
00:26:47.130 --> 00:27:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What if there were lots of people that you were compatible with and it could mean that your expectation for what you think you want deserve need all of those what if it's starting to increase. What if you're starting to see maybe you want more.

264
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you do. I don't know. What do you think

265
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

266
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to have someone that's nearby that you can have physical hangout time with

267
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:26.130
Jaime C: I feel like that would be nice but

268
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:36.480
Jaime C: I was perfectly happy with our relationship and the way it was. I don't feel like I was missing out on anything.

269
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.490
Jaime C: I feel like

270
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.390
Jaime C: I just felt when we were fine. I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything.

271
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Except

272
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of pushed him away so

273
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like you wanted something you wanted to be maybe a priority.

274
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.180
Jaime C: Probably

275
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:25.740
Jaime C: It wasn't easy with that guy. The first couple years. I mean, it took, we were dating for five years and probably the first half of it. He what he didn't open up or talk about anything like you didn't even talk about his daughter or son wouldn't say their name, nothing and

276
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:34.740
Jaime C: So the last couple years of it. He had opened up and was just telling me everything there was to know about him and

277
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.910
Jaime C: I forgot where I was going with that. What

278
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want someone nearby and you came back with basically I was perfectly happy with the miles of distance

279
00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:01.230
Jaime C: Yeah, I was. I was good. I was. I didn't feel I really didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. I thought we had a good relationship.

280
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:07.650
Jaime C: You know, I mean, yeah, it's not ideal, but I feel like if

281
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.960
Jaime C: If the distance was because he's out there and doing a good thing.

282
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.240
Jaime C: It didn't it just

283
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And it works for you.

284
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.690
Jaime C: Yeah, it's good.

285
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But did you like about that little contact. Would you like about that.

286
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:41.610
Jaime C: Well, because I'm at a time in my life where I really needed to focus on my career, I really needed to put all I could into my career and and my son, you know, my son was having a hard time. I feel like it gave me the ability to do

287
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.670
Jaime C: That to focus on my career and take care of my kid.

288
00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:52.350
Jaime C: And still have him out here while he's out there doing his thing. It just, it worked. I was out in my life.

289
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I hope that this discussion has given you a little bit to think about maybe different angles to come at it. Yeah.

290
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The relationship that you have with him.

291
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a bit. It looks familiar.

292
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To to a parent.

293
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not really right in our life. But, there they are reassuring us and loving us from a bit of a distance and he's very similar to a mom figure which is almost impossible to get any juice out of which finally did, and right so it's this thing that's way out here, but

294
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you want. Again,

295
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it don't want confrontation that might be involved in having more intimacy more closeness where you'd have to say.

296
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I need, I need more space or I don't know what this is the chance for you to kind of explore what you want.

297
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:06.420
Jaime C: You know,

298
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.830
What the fear is

299
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's

300
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Schedule another appointment, you and I push that

301
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: A weeks.

302
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe seeing if we can get

303
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Some. I mean, I know you didn't intend to have it in your office.

304
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can let me know. The night before, or if you happen to know that will we can try to do that and I'll try and schedule someone

305
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Very good. You want to make a change on the day or time or anything.

306
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.310
Jaime C: No time and do

307
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So will will schedule for April 27 at 10

308

309
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You know if you can see ahead into time even two days ahead or we can say this, I can see it's not gonna be stuck here. I won't be able to do in that deeper work than just let me know and we'll reschedule. Okay.

310
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

311
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.570
Jaime C: We're good.

312
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm glad you're doing well. You really do. SOUND You sound like you're you're cruising along, you can take in the punches with what's going on and our crisis.

313
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, any, any strong cravings going on.

314
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.630
Jaime C: No.

315
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:44.670
Jaime C: I was doing pretty good. This last paper that I did was definitely one of the easier ones that kind of seems like it.

316
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:57.090
Jaime C: I don't know goes in waves or something. The first couple papers were rough. Yeah. I mean, there were okay and then there and then it got just rough and now it's getting a little bit easier again. So

317
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I tried to tell that to people. And I hope you say it and growth, next time you're in there.

318
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's exactly what it does. We don't, we don't know for each little body, whether it's going to be, you know, 16 to 14 are you wanting to feel those. And then, but you'll feel it from six to four.

319
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean, we just don't know. But it's good for you to remember. So there's no way to say I'm going to have to find out in real time. What's this one going to be

320
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll need it and I'll communicate it, though. I need to slip back it up 2.5 I'll take this one. Slow it really does it changes.

321
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.920
Jaime C: So we are crazy.

322
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:39.630
