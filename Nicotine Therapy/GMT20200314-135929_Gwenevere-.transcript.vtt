Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, very cool.

10
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, so it's been on my mind that you were planning to

11
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.420
Brittney: Take

12
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Her pretty

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Quickly. Right. Right. And

14
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me a little bit about how many milligrams. You've been taking for how many days or what you're going through.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.490
Brittney: I've been on point five new drop down

16
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.290
Brittney: Great.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.660
Brittney: How many been a week one week. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

18
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

19
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What I heard because I was concerned about you. Right. So I was in this is outside my lane.

20
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But I did tell her I was meeting with you if she could make yourself available if you guys needed to real quick, like kind of really stay on top of it. But, but let me just check in with you first what what I said, Okay, well, if I meet with Brittany. This is what I'm going to say

21
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's good to stay at point two five for two weeks and that I didn't know if you had heard or willing to do or

22
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.240
Brittney: Like where you are. I was planning on trying to drop down to 25 minutes instead of that data for at least two

23
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so point

24
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're nervous. Okay, well then

25
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.480
Brittney: Yeah.

26
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.360
Brittney: Yeah, there was

27
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.480
Brittney: I felt so strong that he did

28
00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you did. Okay. All right. Well, let me hear about that. So you went from point seven five. It's been about a week. You said, and this one you you had some sticky receptors and so it's giving you a hard time, tell me what the physiological tell me all about what you were feeling

29
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.240
Brittney: Is irritable with muscle aches trouble sleeping, but also kind of coincided with preparedness stuff so

30
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.590
Brittney: Put your

31
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body, you know, which

32
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:29.010
Brittney: Which was a little yeah yeah I had like sweats and stuff. But the thing that I really can't stand the nerve nervous system came into

33
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.530
Brittney: My hands together sometimes like

34
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.990
Brittney: I don't know.

35
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you do. So something's happening up here now nervous system. You called it pain.

36
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.900
Brittney: Yeah what tingling.

37
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And zero to 10

38
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How how bad did you get

39
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.760
Brittney: I'm probably like a six or seven. OK.

40
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And now that you're at about seven days into it. Has it started to

41
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.430
Brittney: LAUGH I'm starting to feel like I'm almost back

42
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.810
Brittney: To like the center. Yeah, just in time to go.

43
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're now remember, or let me remember our clarify, you're doing this quickly because of you are concerned about the dental part, right, is that what

44
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.260
Brittney: Yeah, even though I have like this big.

45
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.940
Brittney: What I did to my cheek. It's all swollen. They're scared to turn to another one of those ulcers, because they were getting like pretty big like nickel sized

46
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.500
Brittney: malakal Susan. I mean, which I've never experienced before. I mean, I've always gotten little canker sores, but nothing that

47
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:59.400
Brittney: Traumatic and then my teeth and just been hurting a lot and I can see a cavity and one of my teeth. I know I have another one that like we need a root canal. I'm terrified of the dentist. Oh, yeah.

48
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:15.480
Brittney: And I don't have money for it right now, so I was like this just seems like it's getting worse. And so I did a little bit of research on Suboxone and found out that it can cause those sorts of symptoms and so I reached out to them.

49
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know, it's interesting. The timing on that it's really

50
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: She's actually been talking to each group, she jumps in. She says, Okay, one more thing and then she talks about the dental hygiene. So at the timing of that is amazing that it came at the same time, but she's already been talking with people about it.

51
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It's everybody wishes. There was a super pill that had no side effects and you could solve all of our world's problems I'm

52
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.380
Brittney: In yeah

53
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.190
Brittney: I know

54
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.120
Brittney: It doesn't exist.

55
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't exist. And that's, that's where this courage that you're working with me. You're looking at the hard stuff.

56
00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what's going to make the difference. So, but I also have this this strong

57
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to sort of say,

58
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If you go so fast. What's, what's all week. What's three weeks going to do that. Those years did the damage to so it's so easy to try say it's like these couple extra weeks or a month, let's say in the behavioral health part and getting your psyche ready

59
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be so valuable and it might be an overreaction

60
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: For these last months when it's really the the damage was done for the years. Do you see what I'm trying to get at. So I

61
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess that's what's coming up for me. I'm you're doing your tapering your tapering aggressively. You get super, super girl points for that superwoman points for that, but

62
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to work.

63
00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm glad I'm hearing that you're willing to do at least this this extra week to get back to normal. And then, then what's the plan. So let's say we're back here again next Saturday. What, what kind of did you have in mind.

64
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:20.610
Brittney: I don't think I'm gonna drop rate from 352 point two five. I think for a few days. I'm going to cut one of those force in half. So I'm going to do.

65
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I need to clarify something so I'm wrong. I literally wrote down that you've been at point. Ah, yeah.

66
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wrong. Okay, I'm so sorry. Okay.

67
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.780
Brittney: No worries. So, so, point, five is a

68
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:55.380
Brittney: Half like quarter of my two milligrams strip. And so a half of that would be important to five. And so I'm going to take the remaining part of it and cut that in half. I don't know what that equates to because I can do fractions and when

69
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We can, but we can do a visual so

70
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Itself down 2.25 I'm. Just tell me when you're thinking

71
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.570
Brittney: Point two, five and a half plus so 25 plus 12.5

72
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

73
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.060
So then

74
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.910
Brittney: No for. Yes, yes.

75
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.260
Hmm.

76
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.140
Brittney: No, that's all right 37.5

77
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But you were, you're not wanting to go 2.25 that's the resounding message like that's feeling

78
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.860
Brittney: I want to get there. I just want to do it a bit more slowly.

79
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:39.120
Brittney: Because I cut. Last time I cut my dosage by a third, and that was intense. I don't want to cut it by half, okay. I mean,

80
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.930
Brittney: Right away.

81
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:48.360
Brittney: And I'm going to put down to that for three to four days. And that'll drop down to the point, just want to do that a bit slower.

82
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I don't know quite how to write it. Why don't we do this, I'm just going to say

83
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.480
Brittney: It gets 37.5 milligrams my methods. Okay.

84
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll say slow progression. Let me just have an even if you don't follow this, that's fine. I just want to reference point. When do you think you'll do what we're calling three sub 37.53

85
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:16.410
Brittney: I want to try this next weekend. But, oh, I may push down on that week.

86
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so tentative and what may make the differences you feeling good again.

87
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:35.670
Brittney: This yeah I think mental health, too, because it's hard it's I've been struggling. The last few months, and it's been getting to the gym as much. And then what taper. I feel like crap. So it's just

88
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So at this point, though, just to kind of keep track of it. We're thinking

89
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Honor about 321 and then would you want to stay on that for a week for a week to two

90
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

91
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.640
Brittney: 37.5

92
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:07.590
Brittney: Uh huh. I was thinking about just doing it for like three to four days and then dropping down to the 25 but I guess I could do it for at least a week and then

93
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.300
Brittney: Why don't you do that.

94
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.980
Brittney: Till I feel good.

95
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.440
Brittney: Okay.

96
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If we just because keeping the math easy if we just say we just sort of brought it up next to

97
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Your name.

98
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, then you

99
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Because what's really remember that window. It's like, well, it's only off by a few days a week is only seven days. And this is might be that really sticky time for those few clients that I've been able to see go through this last part.

100
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: They sort of disappear from me. I don't get quite as much involvement. It seems like, then it's just the client in the doc. And I'm like, What about me but I'm my weight, but it sounds like you're here with me still, you're not you

101
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.750
Brittney: Know, yeah, I'm planning on continuing to see you. Okay, good.

102
00:10:53.850 --> 00:11:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you can pull it off. I just have a feeling this is going to make the difference because you'll have somebody to be able to say okay this is Game on.

103
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.490
Brittney: This is yeah yeah notice a few cravings and stuff.

104
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.080
Brittney: It was kind of scary.

105
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.650
Brittney: Thought that was in the past. Yes.

106
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now what I've heard from her. So just, just for number sake.

107
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's transcribe this. We've got tentative start date of 37.5 on March 21 tentative start date of point two five at 328

108
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's subject to change, and you're going to pay attention to your body going to communicate that as much as you can, however, you are with with Dr. Rob real

109
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now about that those cravings.

110
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The blocks own alone.

111
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The way the doc describes the efficacy of this. She just can't speak highly enough of it, how well it gets rid of the craving.

112
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, she just really confident and the two people that I've watched do this over a really long weekend weather was three or four days and then they just go to the lock zone. I'm

113
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having the craving. So I'm excited. I hope that that does the trick.

114
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But again, it's it's anecdotal, it's what people are saying

115
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And I didn't get to do any of the outpatient care that this after they just left.

116
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So there were right there in a hurry and they, you know, whether it was money or they were most people like what's happening is they leave the state. So they're in a real rush because they don't have a product provider over there and blah, blah, blah. So

117
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to do this kind of more ideal.

118
00:12:51.330 --> 00:13:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But I guess what I'm saying is if it's true that this is the walk zone is what she's describing and if it is indeed what the clients described to her. I'm excited for you because it sounds like this is going to be

119
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Your big concern, it will address the I'm having the cravings. I'm having them now craving is right. It's just a word. It's just floating around there. Can you bring me into what that was for you. I was here, I had this emotion I had this feeling, and this was my thought.

120
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.620
Brittney: It's working left into one physical pain.

121
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:30.600
Brittney: Yeah.

122
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about it. Where were you what was

123
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.140
What was going on.

124
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:48.030
Brittney: I just like to sleep all through like three to four days and around. I think it's like my stuff like my information and my hips and stuff just really bad. Yeah, so just still

125
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.800
Brittney: Okay, my mind goes to, it would be nice to speak.

126
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There read. That's it. That's the one nice to escape.

127
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.700
Brittney: Yeah. Just fill up like okay

128
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

129
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So just sort of thinking I'm awake. I don't want to be awake. I'm noticing.

130
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it not only I'm not sleeping, but I'm also unrest. I'm moving

131
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.310
Brittney: Around in bed. I can't see.

132
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice pain.

133
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In the hips.

134
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.000
Brittney: Knees just felt like all inflammation in my body is turn book.

135
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.430
Brittney: Back. My back's been real mess.

136
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.530
Brittney: That's what I get for throwing myself around like a rag doll down mountains.

137
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.000
Brittney: Like to snowboard too much.

138
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.700
Brittney: Beer. I'm getting too old.

139
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:51.510
Brittney: Okay.

140
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you recognize

141
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.570
Brittney: That these might be

142
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: From actual injuries, the hip and the back part and the nice rather

143
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:18.600
Brittney: Yeah, I don't know about my hips. They just such just have your to me and I don't know that's to be determined. But right my back pain. And I have this like shoulder to color pain that's definitely associated with my snowboarding skills here.

144
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.140
Brittney: Okay, and a couple items.

145
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:36.300
Brittney: Yeah, so always the last run on the day I just decided, I'm not going to go after three o'clock in the afternoon anymore. It's like you're exhausted. It gets IC them and then they eat shit. The call shadow, we

146
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:37.800
That's right.

147
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think that's important, though, because there's a there's a real time for you with pushing this body of yours because it's also this refuge, but

148
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the message back to you is this extreme stuff just doesn't work. You can't push it.

149
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to do these things.

150
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That work for you. Unfortunately, right, with more moderation and I nobody likes to hear it. I know, but

151
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.870
Brittney: But I mean, I'd rather be able to go for half day not hurt Russell.

152
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:21.780
Brittney: But you can always get her though, I need to get a helmet and some knee braces and there's there's some precautions. I could take that I don't take, you know, to me,

153
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.660
Brittney: All right, I'll try to do it smarter.

154
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:34.200
Brittney: Okay, but I don't think too many years left in thinking about trying to learn to ski because people don't seem to be on their butts as much skiing, so

155
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I I've never had any kind of thing. I'm not a big skier, but the skiing and then I see what what y'all go through with the snowboarding. And I just, I'm in all

156
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.300
Brittney: It's like my favorite

157
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

158
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.270
Brittney: No hard to give up.

159
00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're worth it. Right. I mean, at what point do we say since you haven't been able to do this, this awareness of limitation with the snowboarding right exhaustion is real, like we have to say, I'm tired. I'm not at my best.

160
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've kind of bypass those things.

161
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.300
Brittney: You're putting out danger.

162
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it doesn't mean giving it up, it means I've got to pay more attention. And that's the work that we're doing here is paying attention to you and the messages.

163
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we've got it would be nice to escape. Now I want to know, laying in bed, you feel here feel it. Oh, it would be nice to escape as soon as that.

164
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Voice of addiction. That's the one that says, Wouldn't it be nice. Come on. Look, we got great evidence, you've got paying here pointed out, you got here, here, here. Come on, come on, come on, how many seconds. Do you stay there feeding that thought.

165
00:17:53.790 --> 00:18:07.740
Brittney: It's quick, it's real quick, like five seconds or less. It's not something I dwell on or I I take seriously, it's just, it's just in my poor me moments.

166
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well it. This is actually very tangible

167
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.100
Brittney: Yeah.

168
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be nice to escape that was a real thought

169
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What real thought came in encountered it

170
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.270
Brittney: I'm

171
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.340
Brittney: Just that I don't want to be that person.

172
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.110
Brittney: Unless it's a slippery slope, know what I mean.

173
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:46.740
Brittney: It can't be just one, but I have about trying to go see a pain specialists to try to fix some of this and find some alternatives. If there are any that will help me.

174
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:54.780
Brittney: Because I don't know. I don't know what's out there. I know, my friend. Brandi has like a bulging disc thing. And she told me about like a

175
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:07.650
Brittney: Horrible full song thing that's non addictive. It doesn't get too high, but it like takes away her back. Okay, really well. So I'm going to see if there any other options so

176
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The only right. I don't have a lot of resources that I will say there is a gal here. I'm assuming that you already know about Dr. Ken del she's the chronic pain person, I think.

177
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.530
Brittney: Oh, good. No, no.

178
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm not. I'm going to say something, but don't have confidence in the schedule because

179
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: My nose isn't in it, like, are you there, or did she show up and did to death but my recollection is it's every other Wednesday 130 in the afternoon. Now I could be wrong, but I know there's been a couple of clients.

180
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That have gone and met with her and I have heard Dr rail say everything she says is right in line with her belief system. So it's not you know it's not reinforcing addictive behavior, things like that. So that sounds encouraging.

181
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.950
Brittney: You know, she can order, Mr eyes is that, do you have any idea.

182
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.580
Brittney: It's a great. Let me see something

183
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.560
I was hoping

184
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.380
Doc would be awake right now and I could

185
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.810
Brittney: I don't think she's up yet. And, you know, I'd done on my hips so

186
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.260
Brittney: Hopefully that would give me some answers. I don't even know where to go from there. But

187
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.500
So can conductor.

188
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.500
Brittney: Sure, it's nice to line it up with my period because that's what it seems to flare up and everything's gravy. So

189
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.620
Our

190
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.240
Guys.

191
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.010
I'm asking

192
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here with I'm letting her kind of in on a little like saying, hey, we're talking about

193
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain.

194
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.550
Management, Doc.

195
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you don't want me to say anything that's up to you.

196
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.490
Brittney: No, no, that's fine.

197
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:15.540
Brittney: I appreciate. I mean, to get moving on, on that solutions.

198
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

199
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, heck, even if if someone tells me acupuncture works, man. Go ahead and stick them in there.

200
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.880
Brittney: You know, and we're going to try some dry needling

201
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:36.000
Brittney: Oh, and on a little scared about that because it was at the physical therapy place like this environment needles looking

202
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.650
Brittney: Do this in a doctor's office.

203
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit more hygiene needed

204
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:43.800
Here.

205
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I put skiing how funny. I've got skiing and my brain. Instead of asking

206
00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:04.560
Brittney: Yeah, I think like my back and shoulder stuff is definitely from the snowboarding, but that's been short term, those are so obviously been in the last three months or so it's the hip thing that

207
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That has remember

208
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.340
Brittney: The hips. It's been five years.

209
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.140
Brittney: I can't

210
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.350
Brittney: Get to the point where real fed up.

211
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.270
Brittney: With my being.

212
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What where we're in the hip do to know the name of the part that

213
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.480
Brittney: Really did my pelvis. It's from here to here.

214
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's not that. So right now, are you saying it's tissue level right there. The hip flexor

215
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:48.180
Brittney: I think it is. I think it's great here, but that is rate where all those tendons like bend into the hip. So I don't know. Okay. Yeah, but it's like hip flexor my the end of Dr. So they refer to that as ling ling ling.

216
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.650
Brittney: We will maybe. Yeah. When, when I think oh alright so

217
00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: This whole time I was thinking, I'm glad you stood up and showed me because I had this this

218
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Image in my mind that it was

219
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: In the barn.

220
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Like the outside. I thought it was literally you were having some sort of bone pain and now. Okay.

221
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.770
Brittney: I don't know really because it does feel like I have like

222
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:31.500
Brittney: A very limited range of motion. And when I hit that it kind of feels like it could be an impingement. But they didn't see evidence of an impingement on my x ray, at least from like a bone. So, but I feel like it is kind of more the tissues surrounding

223
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.960
Brittney: Because they flare up and then I will

224
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.460
Brittney: run down my leg. Sometimes I'll get paid up around my hip to but

225
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.740
Brittney: Not as often.

226
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I knew more about the hormonal changes and how it affects inflammation. I wish, I wish. That was something I had more knowledge around

227
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.740
Brittney: Which anyone many doctors even have

228
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.140
Brittney: Period.

229
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.540
Brittney: ones I've talked to

230
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The practitioners that they're just they're not affordable. Are these I forget what they're called, but they're, they're not holistic, but they are basically they're sort of functional practitioners and

231
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Insurance companies doesn't pay don't pay for them. Unfortunately, but I have a feeling. Those are the kind of clinicians that you would need is to really be able to analyze just this whole

232
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.550
Brittney: This whole bottom. Yeah.

233
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.090
Yeah.

234
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I do find osteopaths in their training are much more holistic if you have a choice to go to an MD or do at least do is have what, wait a minute, any doctor can order an MRI. She writes might you be referring to pain, doctor, Dr. Tracy Jackson. Whoops, I said, Kendall, hey, my dad. Yes.

235
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, Dr. Jackson. Hey,

236
00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:02.340
Brittney: I was talking to, I don't know if my insurance will pay for it or if that would have to be paid out of my deductible. I'm hoping they'll just cover it, but I'll have to see.

237
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:14.640
Brittney: Cuz my the doctor who I talk to you about. And then each radio says it's on my options are like surgery or pain management, if that's what's causing it basically

238
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:23.940
Brittney: And I can do like the idea to try to keep the hormones from being really bad. Um, but he said that

239
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:42.870
Brittney: likely they'll try to make me do a cast down, but the house like 50 times in a radiation is an X ray for and where Mrs. Don't have any radiation. So that's like a pretty you know sacred part of the body and I really need a ton of radiation, like one of my reproductive organs.

240
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I know.

241
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have touched on these. I want to jump into maybe

242
00:25:53.130 --> 00:26:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Hearing a little bit more about sort of the cognitive frame. I've heard a little bit about the negative thinking and you said, I don't want to be that person so

243
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: For now, are we talking about, I don't want to be that out it. I don't want to be the one that has that life where I'm constantly having to

244
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:18.150
Brittney: Yeah yeah I don't. I just don't want to be upset with myself, you know, hold myself accountable.

245
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:25.380
Brittney: Right, I talk. I like I'm really proud of the amount of time have been completely

246
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.890
Brittney: I know I will start back to day one, you

247
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.930
Brittney: Know, I do.

248
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we can we celebrate that a little bit by talking about the skills because their skills, even if it's that counter thought

249
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Or remembering things like I'm worth it. That's an actual behavior, you can minimize that that shifting that thinking is a behavior. So can we name them this morning. Let's name on, let's get behind it. Let's reinforce them. What are you doing differently that you are really proud of.

250
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.490
Brittney: I think just

251
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.830
Brittney: loving myself more and creating boundaries.

252
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.890
Brittney: And those are the two biggest like changes.

253
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.470
Brittney: Huge

254
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear. I want to hear about where you honored your own

255
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.310
Brittney: Preference your

256
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Own need your own want

257
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The love of you and you didn't let someone's

258
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Craziness or accusation or label or whatever it was, tell me a story about where you

259
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.620
Brittney: Detected

260
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.970
Your space.

261
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.110
Brittney: I'm from myself and the story is a few days.

262
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.120
Brittney: I was like, pretty depressed and started crying and driving home.

263
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.580
Brittney: I was just lying on falling into bed and doing absolutely nothing all night, but

264
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.160
Brittney: I talked myself out of it.

265
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.800
Brittney: Went down by the river and walked for like an hour and a half.

266
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.300
Brittney: And it really did help. And then I came home and I have motivation to clean.

267
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.810
Brittney: And cook and do stuff that I wouldn't have done otherwise I think I just told myself.

268
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:30.270
Brittney: That it's a choice to get into it and like it's a choice to stay in that depressive number to try to find out.

269
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is a tricky piece because it's not like I'm saying that I'm

270
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: A depleted amount of serotonin isn't a real thing. It's a real thing. So I walk this this delicate line right. It's like, how do I build its chemical and at the same time. That's true. You do have a choice. But if we say that a part of a combination is

271
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: A particular kind of thinking

272
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Can increase or decrease a chemical response.

273
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we can kind of put the two together. So when you were in touch with nature, which for you has a very much a spiritual connection.

274
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and water. I mean,

275
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.610
Brittney: That's just right.

276
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.410
Brittney: Now I'm starting to realize how

277
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.780
Brittney: Important water is

278
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

279
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.320
Brittney: Though it is a really look if I if I

280
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.500
Brittney: Earth sign would probably be that even though I brought

281
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.400
Brittney: Water makes me feel lively

282
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And remember the original imagery was mountains, you're in kind of water. Right. And those mountains around you. That's the way I'm remembering it.

283
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.080
Brittney: As pretty

284
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty important yeah don't deny that just being present with it.

285
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:51.720
Brittney: And I've been

286
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.200
Brittney: Trying to develop the creative side of my brain more to

287
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.580
Brittney: Just I've been, you know, doing photography

288
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:04.860
Brittney: Stuff like that.

289
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about that. I didn't know that.

290
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What

291
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.250
Brittney: Ever thought that I could be

292
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.160
Brittney: Creative like I just felt like

293
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.400
Brittney: Something was just not connecting

294
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.770
Brittney: Oh, it's just like

295
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.290
Brittney: Encouraged my friends who have artistic ability stuff.

296
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.580
Brittney: Thought that I would never be good enough to create

297
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay but but but hold on to that is it, is it possible right now is it

298
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm giving

299
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: There, there's a crack in the door that it might be that I have access to this.

300
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

301
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.610
Brittney: Yeah, just feel like I believe

302
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.100
Okay.

303
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay that's grief.

304
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.090
That's grief.

305
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.730
Brittney: And and

306
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The way through grief magic recipe.

307
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.700
Brittney: You have to actually do it. Yeah.

308
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So sad.

309
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And crying belongs so that that typical thing where you do is you say, I hate this emoting I hated about me. Look at me, I'm nope, you're supposed to

310
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're supposed to be able to say this was the image of myself and I'm grieving it. It's not that

311
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:20.220
Brittney: Media like I'm starting to see a difference in my crime like when I get upset when I'm stressed out versus what about actually feeling emotion. You know what I mean.

312
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.040
Brittney: Yeah, it's a different thing.

313
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.300
It is

314
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's neat that you can catch it like that.

315
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.410
Brittney: I'm starting to see that.

316
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.920
Brittney: I don't allow myself to

317
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.040
Brittney: Short, short thing not

318
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.080
Brittney: Crying all night. You know what I mean.

319
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So I heard again. I heard choice. I heard

320
00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:49.980
Brittney: I can get

321
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: In I can see it as a useful important part of my process.

322
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.200
Brittney: Works very

323
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to get to the water and to walk.

324
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Renewed happened. Do you remember when you actually left the water and you kind of went back to the house to kind of do cleaning and

325
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:11.850
Brittney: Cooking.

326
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember what you were thinking at the time when you made your way back

327
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.910
Brittney: Just felt inspired

328
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.500
Brittney: Yeah.

329
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.120
Yeah.

330
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been able to take some pictures of nature of water of mountain of those things that inspire you.

331
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.260
Yeah.

332
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you keeping them to yourself. Are you sharing them with people. What do you do with them.

333
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:50.700
Brittney: I share someone Instagram, but I'm really weird about what I shared and you know that goes back to the

334
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.120
Brittney: Self loving thoughts.

335
00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, the, the medium itself doesn't lend it to too much vulnerability. It just doesn't

336
00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:10.050
Brittney: Yeah. Yeah, you gotta jump to yourself. I've been thinking about making a Reddit anonymous and I can actually say,

337
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.750
Brittney: Talk about vision talk about whatever I feel like

338
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.620
Brittney: I wish that could be a bigger part of

339
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.470
Brittney: What I will

340
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Say that again, but with more detail. Let me hear more about that. I want to understand

341
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:37.200
Brittney: You know, maybe being able to help people who haven't gone through addiction understand a little bit more

342
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:39.660
Brittney: Because I feel like there's a

343
00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.350
Brittney: Our systems just broken

344
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.040
OK.

345
00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:52.800
Brittney: Super broken, so there's anything I can do to help the people and then also I want to rant about her. She

346
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.390
Brittney: Stuff. I can't. I mean, I did a little bit of Instagram, but

347
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.640
Brittney: I don't go crazy.

348
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:09.960
Brittney: It would be cooler to have an open platform where you can have real conversations without people attaching your face your life to

349
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.430
Brittney: Be like you're contradicting yourself or you know

350
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.900
Brittney: So,

351
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think keeps you from registering around an account.

352
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:36.090
Brittney: I just started the new model like this last week. So it hasn't been on the table for very long. My friend uses a lot

353
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:42.180
Brittney: He's like she likes it, and he hates social media, he doesn't have a Facebook.

354
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:51.750
Brittney: And I feel like Instagrams, just like for the mass hysteria content and this is

355
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.150
Brittney: That it's so healthy

356
00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.070
So you can be

357
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.040
Brittney: Right.

358
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The focus is less on

359
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How is someone else is

360
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.720
Brittney: Contributing affecting you.

361
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Your focus is shifting its to I want to contribute, I have something to say I have something to express now tendency right if I've been listening is you're going to interrupt that you're going to keep yourself from doing it.

362
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the reason you're going to keep yourself from doing that. Do you think

363
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:33.960
Fear.

364
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:36.780
Brittney: Uh huh. Yeah.

365
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Fear. Some one's going to

366
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Type words that are critical and contradictory. Yeah.

367
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.720
Brittney: Yeah, and

368
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.360
Brittney: It's just hard to be vulnerable.

369
00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:04.110
Brittney: I mean I feel like I already have to deal with that more than other people because of my emotional responses. So it's like

370
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.020
Brittney: I guess I I haven't heard her and

371
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.870
Brittney: I think that might be like, why I didn't miss your art to its ability

372
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.910
Brittney: putting yourself out there to be judged. You go, okay.

373
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what's happening right now. I just saw a little wave that you deprived yourself.

374
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.060
Didn't you

375
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.490
Brittney: Yeah, okay.

376
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Big deal. I don't have access. I don't have a right to it. And that's starting to change you're putting your little toe in there and I

377
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.740
Brittney: Yeah, I'm trying to

378
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.530
Brittney: Get back to

379
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:45.810
Brittney: I felt like

380
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.880
Brittney: When I was younger.

381
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:55.560
Brittney: You know, both and I still I still do some degree, but there are

382
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.940
Brittney: avenues that I haven't gone down because

383
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.650
Brittney: I'm planning on

384
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.350
Brittney: Organizing like a big clean updating on the trash on but

385
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.030
Brittney: I've been planning it for two months and I haven't done it.

386
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what if I can't tell the difference. And you know what it is. I've been planning it

387
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Like not done it. So tell me,

388
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what what do it would be. There's an action in there that quote unquote

389
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.930
Brittney: Does it. Yeah.

390
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Feels like

391
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the doing part that's missing.

392
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.110
Brittney: Money left to buy some supplies.

393
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:51.390
Brittney: Some of it.

394
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.050
Brittney: I don't know, maybe I would be a little upset of people didn't show up.

395
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.920
Brittney: But I don't know if I would be

396
00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:04.740
Brittney: Here.

397
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:08.820
Brittney: Sorry much it's bothering me.

398
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.720
Okay.

399
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about the planning.

400
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.200
Brittney: I've picked the first location by my work.

401
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:37.620
Brittney: You can tell where the city stops taking care of their like the big long ways that people like walking, biking forums on traveling by the mountain.

402
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:51.600
Brittney: If they stop taking care of it like rate up where the shopping center starts and like that whole path. It's just covered in trash. So I think that's where you start because it's by my work in the dread cast

403
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be an interesting experience for you is

404
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.880
The second to have the impulse

405
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.640
People over you go pick

406
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Next time you go into your car, you have recyclable bags or whatever it is you think that you're going to use to contain these things.

407
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be a little naive around some of this, so forgive me if

408
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.550
Brittney: I am no I am too bored as far as that goes.

409
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

410
00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:24.570
Brittney: So one

411
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because that's not the part of the, the part that predict pieces are coming

412
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that an irrational almost fear of it. So there's this is an exposure therapy thing would be a second I thought of it. What does she say to do. I pulled off and I went in there.

413
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I drove over and I'm like, There is literally nothing wrong with what I'm about to do. I'm going to take care of my planet and

414
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Your planet.

415
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It needs it needs what what you have to give it badly and you connect with it on a deep level and there's no dissonance. It's pure you pull over, you get it. You pick it up.

416
00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:15.270
Brittney: And you

417
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Find out Wait a minute, I'm doing I'm doing exactly what feels right.

418
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's anybody going to say

419
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What could they possibly say

420
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.700
Brittney: After Sally's

421
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Approximation um

422
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I just remind you of some real simple pieces around procrastination.

423
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.840
Brittney: Yes.

424
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You did these have been very useful. And even if I've said that before we forget them because we go back to our old way of looking at our tasks.

425
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I truly do believe

426
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That it is those four seconds from that thought notice right here.

427
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back to this one. I laid in bed and I i had a thought.

428
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Be nice to escape. And how long did it last.

429
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.570
Brittney: Less than

430
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Five right if you left it there, there was potential. It could be fueled by that brain. It could just give you evidence for how that's that's the escape route, it can work the other way to

431
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I said the second. So here's what happens. You have

432
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Four seconds, let's say, and just suspend disbelief. If it's four and a half or it's six or whatever, just, let's just go with these four or five seconds. So you've got five seconds to

433
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A second to have the thought, you have to stand up and you have to go do it because the mind will come in and convince you to not risk.

434
00:42:53.430 --> 00:43:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Rejection criticism. It's not worth it. It's not worth. It's not worth it. It's design is to keep you safe, which means social safety to

435
00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Write for the reject and the abandonment. The all fail or maybe I'll succeed. I mean, that stuff. It just gets super complicated, but notice how that can all flood in fractions of a second. That's why I'm saying when you're driving

436
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You recognize you're driving closer to that exit. You know it's there. The second to have the thought.

437
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You turn the clicker on and you change lanes and you get off the exit.

438
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've already gotten off the exit.

439
00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to, it's so much more likely that you're going to go. I find a picture with the tram is. Is that near Albuquerque. Is that the one in between.

440
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.680
Brittney: Yeah, so it's the travel is the road that life.

441
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.240
Brittney: is parallel to

442
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:54.090
Brittney: The mountain so it goes all it's that last rude, you can get to that you take them to the casino and stuff. I don't know if you've been here. Yeah, sorry.

443
00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I say right on whatever that freeway is I go Albuquerque Santa Fe. I've done that.

444
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:01.590
Yeah.

445
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm probably off a little bit, but basically you get the point. You pull off and you do it, the likelihood that you will continue in that trajectory

446
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is so much higher because now watch what could possibly be the contradictory evidence to not do to not continue to drive and go Park and I walked out and I saw that trash and I picked it up and I put it in the bag.

447
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that much like what it is when you went to the river and you took it in. But this has an added piece.

448
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're giving back you're you're helping. You're not just taking you're giving your

449
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:47.910
Brittney: Something

450
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the energy

451
00:44:49.320 --> 00:45:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: At the thought you are intimately a part of this planet. You feel it in a deeper way than many people do. And so there's no dissonance.

452
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Dissonance means sort of this opposite belief that sort of contradicts right it's pure and simple, and you just go do it.

453
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And when asked you, what are you doing it like this, some trash share looks like it's been here for a few months. And, you know, our findings kind of broken down to do you want to join me doing it to

454
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This

455
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no problem here, it just pick it up and then what do I do with it.

456
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:29.610
Brittney: You worry about that. Maybe I over commodified with making it needs to be this big thing.

457
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's later this

458
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:32.130
Year.

459
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to know in real time, this, this will have I already know you are this highly intelligent woman did all that other stuff all that planning business all the

460
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Social part how to market it a blah, blah, blah. I don't need to check in on that I already know that you've got all the skills necessary that the part that I can be of service is you getting out of your own way.

461
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.520
Brittney: Yeah need gotten several areas of my life.

462
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The one skill this hammer works on my roof. It works on my window. It works on this nail

463
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That one hammer. It's not for baking a cake. That's true. But this one hammer can do a lot of different things, but that one skill. So, this is it. These are the two things you have five seconds. That's a deadline and that speaks to the second piece of it. There has to be a constraint.

464
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird thing about us and I may have talked to you about it, but we have to have a deadline, notice that I've got to get to work. You have to be there and an early in here when people are like, oh, I want to go to therapy talk about my

465
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.660
Brittney: Literally every time because I want to sleep.

466
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:52.470
Brittney: But

467
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something that compels you about this deadline, you said it and you've made a commitment.

468
00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So when

469
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this might seem really weird. But when you say if you really buy into this. I have five seconds to take action.

470
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I kid you not, I have studied more I have back to back, gotten more done because the second I have it that meal is made that this thing is done. This is done. People are exercising, they're doing because they didn't wait for the brand to convince you.

471
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's not going to work out your brain and I and I'm grateful for the piece that has kept you safe. I am

472
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But you need to use other skills and this one right here. The second I have the thought I'm going to schedule this MRI. I'm going to

473
00:47:44.880 --> 00:48:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Call and get certain doctors numbers. I'm going to walk outside. I'm going to clean the cabinet in my my bath, whatever it is just like a river you you can't delay, you have to see that those five seconds are the constraint with urgency.

474
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:19.710
Brittney: Yeah, I would say that I've noticed that even because that when I made the decision to go to the river. I got a little distracted in here for like 20 minutes, maybe I should go was like, No, you're going to get your ass up and get out of the house.

475
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And notice that you once you've got up, it's unlikely. You're going to sit back down. You're already okay well I mean even I'm already moving in that direction, it's so bizarre your all your intention is already manifesting forward and you're going

476
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I guess because you're so intelligent I worry that maybe you think this is just tiny or something.

477
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:57.390
Brittney: No. It sums make sense. Like even if I don't go do the big action if I do something part of the planning.

478
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.430
Brittney: A step forward.

479
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This pulling over and going and picking up trash. That's the only thing you have to do, Brittany,

480
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The plan or the executive functioning this one up here, the one that's so intelligent, the one that can

481
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Both notice things in the now and plan things in the future that's up here in the front of the brain. I know you've got that.

482
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The one I'm trying to address has to do with more amygdala stuff that you're not trustworthy, that if you came up with this idea. It's not going to be good. It's going to be flawed. It's going to right that's the one I'm trying to address.

483
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not worried about the secondary gain of let's say you follow through with this, you're going to here's what I already assume you're going to know from driving over there. Oh, hey.

484
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, you know what I just realized I'm going to make sure I have a really nice map.

485
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be precise about the exit number on it for people that are visual it'll be a left turn at the such and such. And I'll notice. Oh, where's the place to park with these things. I already know you're going to pay attention to that.

486
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know what you don't know until you go do it. But the part that's in the biggest part of the way is just following

487
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your intuition, you go do it. And then we see what comes because once you get there, you're going to notice some things

488
00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, that could I need to make that a part of the plan or you're going to notice as you're doing it the terrain. Oh, I want to remember to tell people to wear comfy shoes. No sandals you it's all of that is going to come

489
00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll be interesting. And you'll take in information that you weren't

490
00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't have had access to, if you had just gone and done it all and that's going to come in line, but you're getting there. This is part of these five seconds. Just get off your ass that one.

491
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:59.100
Yeah.

492
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.990
Brittney: We need

493
00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But if what you take away from today is

494
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to have a deadline so

495
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.520
Brittney: You're telling me. I really do.

496
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't

497
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't talked to you about the guy that video, the master procrastinator guy that one.

498
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.390
I haven't talked to you about now.

499
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.280
Brittney: Cute.

500
00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have time to show you the video but

501
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.200
Brittney: On YouTube

502
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

503
00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.520
Brittney: You just type

504
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Type in master procrastinator. He's, he's he's adorable.

505
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.270
Brittney: He's got

506
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A key. It's really cute. It's worth every little minute of it. You'll have a little giggle throughout. He laughs at himself and TED talk, but it's not your usual TED talk. He's, he's very informal

507
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: T shirt jeans kind of guy.

508
00:51:50.670 --> 00:52:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But the takeaway, and the part that if for some reason you forget this. It has to do with this part people that are, let's say, trying to write their PhD thesis there. They have this massive open. There's no deadline. It's just out there nebulous.

509
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: They keep wasting time.

510
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not writing

511
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's no deadline, we need them. And as much as out loud, we may say I hate it. I think all the time constraints. If you're thinking about it and sort of are grateful to them.

512
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You take that and we will we'll wait to the last minute. But wait, if there's no deadline or last minute we keep moving the five seconds, like out like this.

513
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not done.

514
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.270
You've

515
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Done you've given yourself. And that's the thing with an entrepreneur, they have to set their own deadlines or they keep pushing it away.

516
00:52:51.180 --> 00:53:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to stick to it. And so it's these two concepts. It's you've only got about five seconds before the the monkey mind comes in, says no, there's no no no we want to play. We want to rest and he's going to talk about that monkey mind or whatever. It's adorable.

517
00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And the rational mind is like, Listen, there's a finite amount of time here. You know, you're going to have to go work and we've got these other obligations and that monkey brain is like let's play pushes them aside.

518
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But anyway, so he's going to explain

519
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it, he's gonna say, I don't want to ruin the punch line because I want you to enjoy the video.

520
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But the bottom line is if you get if you really have a constraint. What we do is wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, okay, hurry up and get it done. We do it right up but it up against this, but if you don't have one.

521
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:37.980
Brittney: And you just don't do it at all.

522
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's two things you have about five seconds before the monkey mind comes in and says, Oh, wouldn't rusting be better for us.

523
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. You don't have time to second afterthought. You get up even if it's standing up, you'll work out what you're doing. You get up and put the shoes on. You grab your keys. Why do I have my keys.

524
00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I have this one man. I'm gonna go do this. And the second thing is, see that those five seconds are the constraint. You have to do it.

525
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Another way to set commitment is you tell us

526
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's risky but when we notice how you made a commitment to me. There's something in here where maybe I don't really want to piss off what a beer or let her down. I don't know why you're motivated, but it worked.

527
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's bypass the, the one that says I want a snooze. I'm so glad I can do that when I make a commitment to someone, I either have a little respect for or something, whatever you recognize in here and you risk you tell someone about it. They

528
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it. And then guess what you have a constraint. You've made it

529
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:45.870
Yeah.

530
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

531
00:54:49.170 --> 00:55:04.050
Brittney: I feel like I feel like that works. I need to to work on progress estimation. They I feel like I usually get around to stuff, but it's like it takes me a while like today, we're going rock her name name have to go first and fluoride.

532
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:10.590
Brittney: And I've been chatting with this guy on Instagram for a while, who goes out and does a lot of rock candy.

533
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:20.220
Brittney: And it took me a while to like actually make the plan to go. So now we're going. It's just hard when steps outside of the comfort zone.

534
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.530
Brittney: But I have to like talk myself into it over to like reach

535
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:30.000
Brittney: So I like the plan. I like the Glam

536
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.840
Yeah.

537
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice it was a commitment to another human and Now guess what you're going to keep it.

538
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.100
Brittney: Yeah, it's usually

539
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.120
Brittney: I try to keep as much as I can.

540
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: They help, they help. Most of us were

541
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:56.250
Brittney: Like if I would have slept there my alarm. This morning I woke up feeling crappy and upset at myself, you know, so I

542
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:58.380
Brittney: Think they recognize that

543
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: By those two things, the moment you have the inspiration there. I don't have time to go into all of the benefits of what that's going to do for yourself to see

544
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your self esteem, your identity self love if you have the idea

545
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:20.520
Brittney: Don't do it.

546
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we'll

547
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Have many more seconds left before you will end up not doing it.

548
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You only have five seconds only have five seconds.

549
00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And start making commitments, because guess what, that's the constraint, you need to go get it done those two things don't have to call yourself a procrastinator anymore because we all are. I am HE IS SHE IS ALL OF US ARE

550
00:56:52.470 --> 00:57:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We are. We're just better at maybe making a commitment, like I said I was going to go do this. I invited people over I did this thing where it was kid I set up a contingent right I was now the responsible one now. Right. I gotta do it.

551
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, pointed me now instead of saying, you know, what have I done no see that we're all like that we all need those they compel us to move forward, otherwise our mind all of our minds will tell us stay in bed.

552
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have anything broken in you. There's nothing wrong. We all have that

553
00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:32.430
Okay.

554
00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:33.960
Okay.

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So share a little bit about what you notice was important for you today. Just, just do a nice little have that rewind of of how today was and get little pictures and what seems important to you.

556
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:21.120
Brittney: I just I like I like the action plan this, I've never thought of. I've never thought of just, I've never really broke down just getting up the second I think it will make a difference to me. I feel like I'm like if I'm ill prepared. I can't do it, you know.

557
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:27.120
Brittney: For us as an excuse for what, but I think it's a good plan. I

558
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:31.470
Brittney: Think that's probably my biggest takeaway today.

559
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:35.760
Well,

560
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:38.970

00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:40.830
Take

562
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 seconds and convince yourself that it's not a good plan. Right. I hope you immediately do it.

Hi.

592
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been a while.

593
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I get a note open probably if it's been a month. That means we got to check in on the goals, a little bit right a little something something

594
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There was some I think travel that that you were doing was that a positive thing for you. I don't remember what the text was, well, we have to

595
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Rochelle Martinez: My niece and her is needed to come down from Idaho.

596
01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:58.170
Rochelle Martinez: And me and my mom had to go pick them up some

597
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.650
Rochelle Martinez: Fun working

598
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like we met. Okay.

599
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did an activity with me.

600
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Called MTR. What was that like for you.

601
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.050
Rochelle Martinez: It was good. It's like

602
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.660
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know. It just made me like being more than I usually do like

603
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.120
Rochelle Martinez: Just, um,

604
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.340
Rochelle Martinez: I guess. Find a safe.

605
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:49.770
Rochelle Martinez: But nothing

606
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice you were more irritable less irritable.

607
01:03:56.430 --> 01:04:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice anything, you know, even a few days after

608
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:18.150
Rochelle Martinez: I'm trying to think back to then I can't even

609
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.470
Remember,

610
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:25.440
Rochelle Martinez: Remember, but I don't remember like

611
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:30.900
Rochelle Martinez: I was in her method blurry. I'd be lying if I say something

612
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.310
Rochelle Martinez: Now,

613
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So for most people, they they remember because there's a such a change such a distinct change. So my guess is not too much significant irritability, no intrusive thoughts, no change in nightmare content dream content. No, no huge changes right

614
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.490
Rochelle Martinez: Okay. All right. That's, that's

615
01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's convenient. Now that might happen. That's, that's one of the sort of

616
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: downsides of this particular intervention that for some people, when they're working through some

617
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What I would say a neural network that's been cut off for the rest of it typically it's around a trauma.

618
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If they've been cut off from it, it means that there's now more connections and it's starting to come into the thoughts unexpectedly for a little while until we kind of get, get it processed that can happen.

619
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just want to keep cautioning my clients about that, that if there is, irritability, there is something that's going on. You might want to remember. Oh, this could be a byproduct of this em Dr work I'm doing. I want to make sure I tell one of your about it.

620
01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, and just, you know, like if it feels like it's coming out of nowhere, then it's like, okay, I understand why.

621
01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, let's see.

622
01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got

623
01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been some

624
01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say concern not your wording, but thinking about how will I handle myself if I run into my x, where are you around that nowadays are your thoughts going and such.

625
01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.190
Rochelle Martinez: I don't even think I'm worried or even concerned anymore like he's been out there.

626
01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:37.380
Rochelle Martinez: For months and they, I think that level anxiety is gone now.

627
01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:43.350
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know. I've had some anxiety at night and I can't like

628
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.570
Rochelle Martinez: I can't figure out where it's coming from. Maybe

629
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:58.950
Rochelle Martinez: I just, I've had trouble sleeping like for like the last two weeks, like last and then I think I didn't want to miss this group.

630
01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:13.200
Rochelle Martinez: This individual. So I didn't even see like an all night last night. Like I fall asleep, like 20 minutes, enabling share. I'm not gonna wake up in the morning for group. So I like literally have been up all night.

631
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. Have you ever valued or needed to to be careful, like that before around these

632
01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.280
Rochelle Martinez: No budget, I think, because I had, I missed

633
01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Last one.

634
01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:33.210
Rochelle Martinez: Now with you I it's because I was out of town, but that

635
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:48.750
Rochelle Martinez: Was it last week, the week before I missed group because the baby had a neurology appointments. It was she gets them done every six months and they just to see the specialist. So I was in all the friggin I just got sidetracked and

636
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:56.130
Rochelle Martinez: I by the evening I totally spaced out that we had group on that Wednesday. So I missed group and

637
01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:58.230
Rochelle Martinez: I think

638
01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:04.320
Rochelle Martinez: That's part of where it was coming from because I didn't want to miss this one so

639
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:06.900
Okay.

640
01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So, it ended up keeping you awake.

641
01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.290
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah. Well, I was just like,

642
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:23.040
Rochelle Martinez: I guess so tired that I was like, damn, if I fall asleep, then I'm not gonna get up and then knowing that my Chrome was here on the weekend, tell me what the BB

643
01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:36.810
Rochelle Martinez: I was just afraid I was gonna oversleep and not get up, I guess, logical, but I've had trouble all week while I was asleep. It's like I'm getting four hours sleeper, if I'm lucky and I

644
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else change besides

645
01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:44.310
Rochelle Martinez: Just being hmm

646
01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me where you are with the tapering you don't think it has anything to do with a recent taper, nothing like that.

647
01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:52.080
Rochelle Martinez: I haven't tapered anything

648
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.100
Rochelle Martinez: I'm still a one in three quarters.

649
01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:57.720
One of

650
01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.040
Rochelle Martinez: The

651
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:02.070
Rochelle Martinez: Best that I stay there.

652
01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:03.240
Rochelle Martinez: For

653
01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.260
Rochelle Martinez: A minute, just I don't even feel like I'm using gift for

654
01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:11.250
Rochelle Martinez: I think I'm using it more for pain management than I am.

655
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:13.440
Rochelle Martinez: Anything else right now.

656
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And that's, um, I can't remember who which doctor is trading at this point, is it still Dr Arielle

01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Using it for pain management. Okay.

661
01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:55.740
Rochelle Martinez: Got one in that one is 300 milligram maybe because I'm not only on the strips so

662
01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.860
Rochelle Martinez: I'm on a low. So those

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:37.380
Rochelle Martinez: Like if I was

688
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.820
Rochelle Martinez: I need a more people to rely on for my sobriety like

689
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:45.270
Rochelle Martinez: I knew that.

690
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:58.020
Rochelle Martinez: I could attend a meeting and not be discouraged quiet. The last time before that it had been such a long time that I had ended in me and it was just all negative. So when I went back

691
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:05.940
Rochelle Martinez: Now, and I was actually focused on my sobriety and seeing that there was more positive than there was negative there so long.

692
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:11.850
Rochelle Martinez: Just being able to interact with somebody

693
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And how you feeling about that particular goal. Shall I leave it there, we kind of take a peek at what's keeping you from having gone in, in this new year.

694
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it's pretty simple. You're just taking care of the baby.

695
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.670
Rochelle Martinez: I just haven't had any time like even myself to

696
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:47.040
Rochelle Martinez: Attend one I have the baby like every day. And that's no excuse. You know, they mean

697
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:50.730
Rochelle Martinez: I thought was just so tired after working

698
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:54.240
Rochelle Martinez: I just feel bad even going into town.

699
01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.290
Rochelle Martinez: I live in her with her tissue works all day long and

700
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.140
Rochelle Martinez: Sometimes you just need to read too much.

701
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.390
Rochelle Martinez: It's just lack of free time.

702
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we sit with me. She needs a break for a second. Yeah.

703
01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you get yours.

704
01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.600
Rochelle Martinez: Usually on Saturday among

705
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.090
Rochelle Martinez: The baby Friday night.

706
01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:35.610
Rochelle Martinez: Until you just use beekeeper Friday night, Saturday night and bring her back end, but because of all the stupid will not do the virus stuff she's been real

707
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:48.990
Rochelle Martinez: Busy so hospital meeting with state officials with that. So I told her not to worry about it this weekend. They know she was about to have a hectic week. A week to come and get her list as well.

708
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:14.190
Rochelle Martinez: If I need just a little bit of peace of time I do leave it with my drama and come into my room and just like meditator even when she's not being very united mean we go for a while and just get peace of mind.

709
01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.590
Rochelle Martinez: It's not nothing over

710
01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.620
Rochelle Martinez: Overwhelming. You know what I mean, like,

711
01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:27.420
Rochelle Martinez: Overwhelmed yes

712
01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having thoughts of using not letting yourself get overwhelmed, you're not being preoccupied with concerns of running into your ex.

713
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And what is your would you say your level of life satisfaction is these days.

714
01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:14.040
Rochelle Martinez: Overall life I'm, I'm, like, satisfied you marry me, like the first time in years that I've been sober and just level headed clear headed and

715
01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:20.190
Rochelle Martinez: Just be able to contribute like

716
01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:26.550
Rochelle Martinez: In my family and just I'm pretty good like

717
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.080
Rochelle Martinez: That at all.

718
01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So this giving

719
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: To this baby and of course you're taking on the parent role for your daughter feels good.

720
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:43.770
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

721
01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a big give

722
01:16:49.080 --> 01:17:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know, I know. It gives back to you too. I know it's not just for your daughter, it's you're getting a chance to write to be the parent to be that mom maybe hit and miss chance so doing, was it was I hearing that last time.

723
01:17:03.630 --> 01:17:05.100
Rochelle Martinez: I'm somewhat

724
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:12.540
Rochelle Martinez: Okay, we're both. I was always there for my daughter, you know, to mean like 80% of the time it wasn't

725
01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:14.730
Rochelle Martinez: Like

726
01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.860
Rochelle Martinez: For the most part, yeah.

727
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me ask the question, Why are you taking on the parent role, instead of your daughter.

728
01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:38.760
Rochelle Martinez: Just wasn't ready and responsible at the time.

729
01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She wasn't ready

730
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.450
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

731
01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: He isn't ready is not kind of

732
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:46.740
Rochelle Martinez: isn't ready yet.

733
01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she need, what, what would it look like if she was ready.

734
01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:10.530
Rochelle Martinez: I don't even know. I guess to be more mature about it.

735
01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:28.710
Rochelle Martinez: She just never accepted responsibility so they

736
01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:31.710
No.

737
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.860
Rochelle Martinez: Longer words but we're

738
01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.940
Rochelle Martinez: Actually is more focused on herself and going to school and doing what she needs to do. Then she is about a baby so

739
01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you and ground on weren't there. Do you think that would be different. She would focus on the baby.

740
01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:57.180
Rochelle Martinez: No, I don't even know if the baby would be in our lives. I think she probably would have given up for adoption. She just wasn't ready at all.

741
01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But she ready to have a sex life where she ready to have that kind of intimacy to begin my

742
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope.

743
01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How did it come to be that that that happened. Do you think that she ended up being in that type of relationship.

744
01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.380
Rochelle Martinez: Teenager, I guess, I don't know, hormones, crazy. I don't know.

745
01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:30.630
Rochelle Martinez: I can't

746
01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:35.220
Rochelle Martinez: I can't think what she was thinking, cuz I'm not her.

747
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:41.550
Rochelle Martinez: No cerebral no say.

748
01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No say

749
01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, sometimes you know Karen's kind of set the framework of how to approach sexuality, was that something maybe you had talked with her about or didn't talk with her about

750
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.030
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, we talked about it and

751
01:19:59.130 --> 01:19:59.790
Rochelle Martinez: Just

752
01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.650
Rochelle Martinez: When possible, in

753
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:07.380
Rochelle Martinez: Like even birth control and everything.

754
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.250
Rochelle Martinez: Happens again.

755
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:14.820
Okay.

756
01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well what something because right now. I think it's time that we reshape the focus

757
01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it be something that you're kind of kind of want to put energy towards it sounds like you've got meditation, you've got that sort of finding peace and quiet for yourself so you don't get yourself overwhelmed, that's a big part of people's long term recovery success.

758
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this a na. We still got that goal in here, you basically only have a couple

759
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them is this one. Is it safe to assume you want to leave it here and see what was a once a month was your goal. Do you want to

760
01:20:59.670 --> 01:20:59.940
Rochelle Martinez: Do it.

761
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:05.820
Rochelle Martinez: Um, yeah, probably. So if I get back into like little

762
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.210
Rochelle Martinez: Little

763
01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:19.800
Rochelle Martinez: Not scheduled but a little routine. Yeah, there you go. Sorry. My brain is just like so. Okay. Yeah, little routine.

764
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.640
So,

765
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: One way to get a new behavior in is to stack it and by stack it i mean

766
01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You already do certain things routinely. Let's see what's already there every month. Are you already going

767
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Near that room and a room is a meeting room. Okay. But you already going near when you drive near that room once a month, you're already driving to go shopping. You're already picking up a script. You're all ready near. Can you see it.

768
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.530
Rochelle Martinez: Not, not really. I'm

769
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:06.600
Rochelle Martinez: Probably looking if there's something not a little bit closer, but

770
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:18.270
Rochelle Martinez: Little bit more in the neighborhood. I guess I should take this, this one's about 20 minutes away. So I don't buy it again.

771
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that might be one of the pieces that we do here is, have you task yourself with looking at I'm

772
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Closer location. Yeah, okay. So I'll say one action step would be to

773
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Locate closer fellowship fellowship location.

774
01:22:53.250 --> 01:23:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what you do is when you set set the schedule. If you can figure out something. Let's say it's picking up a prescription, whatever, you know, I don't know your life, don't, don't get hung up on the detail.

775
01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: you label it. What do you do each month right that you could embed I'm going to add that in my calendar. I'm already in the car, what would it be

776
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you're in the car, not with the baby even that might be the key piece.

777
01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:27.450
Probably

778
01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:31.440
Rochelle Martinez: Either picking up a script or

779
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:34.740
Rochelle Martinez: Running to get drops or

780
01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:43.350
Rochelle Martinez: Even just going to Walmart because I do go for the most part, by myself.

781
01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.780
Rochelle Martinez: Okay, well,

782
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.700
Rochelle Martinez: Every week

783
01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh right, think we found one. So already going to Walmart every two weeks and not with the baby.

784
01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be it right there.

785
01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:01.590
Yeah.

786
01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's, there's at least two steps in here. There's first finding out location and time in the meeting.

787
01:24:18.450 --> 01:24:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then setting in your phone that shopping. You already have it in there. So if it means delaying going to Walmart, a few times. If you don't need those items so that you can be compelled to actually go in two weeks.

788
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you go now and then reset it for every two weeks. This is getting complicated. But the point is, is that that be the thing that it be linked to

789
01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here, I'm at Walmart. I'm not with the baby. I can go to this meeting and stack it in there just making it a routine. This is what I do now when I go to Walmart and I'm on my own. I go to these meetings.

790
01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:00.150
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I just look I just googled

791
01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:01.740
Rochelle Martinez: A new me

792
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:05.700
Rochelle Martinez: It looks like there's one

793
01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:10.200
Rochelle Martinez: I think it's a meeting. Okay.

794
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:13.680
Rochelle Martinez: It's yellow closer to town.

795
01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:26.340
Rochelle Martinez: I think I've attended one of those when I was in the program that that name looks just familiar, but I have to

796
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:33.870
Rochelle Martinez: Check because the rest are either in Santa fear of tricky. It's either that one or the London.

797
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:35.340
Rochelle Martinez: Pull off.

798
01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: How close that meeting. Can you see to a Walmart.

799
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:48.330
Rochelle Martinez: Going to be about maybe three mile 7.1 from

800
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What time's the meeting.

801
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:55.560
Rochelle Martinez: It doesn't say

802
01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.300
Rochelle Martinez: Man, this

803
01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.180
Rochelle Martinez: Is the location.

804
01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any questions about kind of what I'm saying though right now this concept of embedding right stacking another task right next to one that's you're already doing you have any question.

805
01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's pretty simple, right.

806
01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:27.210
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah yeah

807
01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I figured. Okay, so we're going to keep that goal. And then the the task for you are to continue moving forward on getting clearer and clearer about when it is and then putting these tasks inside your phone on a calendar telling people about it.

808
01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And protecting it or shell. This one. Oh, this is one of the ones in the protection can start a month beforehand.

809
01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. This is the one I let me let me take the baby. Here, let me make sure I go to these extra appointments here but this one. The one I go to Walmart this one. Now I protect this one and why because you are worth it, pure and simple.

810
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is one of your tasks that you want to accomplish. You want to make sure you continue to have people in your community that you can talk to and feel connected in and close to

811
01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

812
01:27:27.930 --> 01:27:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So, another one is increase grounding and emotional regulation skills. Tell me just check in.

813
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Mindfulness exercises like the belly breathing. I've stopped calling it box breathing, because I really want to make sure people are remembering to expand the belly when they're on the inhale.

814
01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat on the exhale. So I stopped calling it box breathing and now I'm calling it belly breathing so no one forgets the most important part is that that the expansion of the belly.

815
01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that, that, that the air not stay up here that it actually go all the way along. So is it safe to say that one is now just a routine part of your life.

816
01:28:08.190 --> 01:28:12.120
Rochelle Martinez: Yet is just a routine, because even when I'm doing group with them.

817
01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:16.290
Rochelle Martinez: Nominee that's the breathing that I use and

818
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:22.620
Rochelle Martinez: When I'm having like even just a stressful moment I sit

819
01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:30.420
Rochelle Martinez: I sit here and I just concentrate on my breathing and make sure that my stomach splitting out and then the

820
01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:33.900
Rochelle Martinez: Beautiful uniformly every breath. Beautiful.

821
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the goal here I set this though, but I probably had you're buying on its. Let me just see how it's, it's probably exceeded even from zero times a week to five times a week. Is it safe to say you've met that goal that you're doing it more than

822
01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.110
Good.

823
01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:51.780
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, that's what I thought.

824
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm gonna, I'm going to close this one. But before I do, I want to ask you.

825
01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

826
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have times when it would be nice to use another one, much like the, the one that I can't remember if I've taught you. I probably have we've been we've known each other while now.

827
01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see it here. Do you ever remember to do grounding in the five

828
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:27.450
Rochelle Martinez: Crown is like the one. Is that the one where you're like filling it in your leg and then feeling getting your head.

829
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.710
Rochelle Martinez: No.

830
01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's progressive relaxation. That would be something like aggressive relaxation. Looks like I tighten all of my my toes yeah.

831
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:39.060
Rochelle Martinez: And I think

832
01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the progressive relaxation. So I, my guess is that a dominate taught that that's fantastic. It's a great one. Even if you're trying to go to sleep. That's a good one to remember this one is

833
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just show it. I think as soon as you see it, you're going to remember it.

834
01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:04.050
Oh, no. Oh, see if the poster poster. I've been showing a couple people. This week, it might still be up

835
01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: When it can't be far, it just showed people to swimming. He

836
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.150
Rochelle Martinez: Does it called grounded five

837
01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: grounding in the five senses it. Yeah, I'm going to show you. I think it recognize that once you see it and we'll just review it.

838
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's also a great one. When you know how you maybe you're with the baby and you're noticing you're you're feeling and patient or something's happening you you want to get centered. Again, this is a nice way to get out of your head.

839
01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And get back into your body. So, in general terms, there's a couple ways to think about coping skills. They're either top down.

840
01:30:52.440 --> 01:31:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Which means our thinking changes our physiology. We can have a thought. And it can bring our heart rate down, it can bring our respiration down that's top down. We're thinking changes and our body starts to calm down, relax. The other way is bottom up.

841
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the breath work and this exercise. I'm going to review with you is bottom up, which means the body relaxes and then it tells the mind we're okay.

842
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Autumn up the body tells

843
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll do this, we can actually do this in vivo, um,

844
01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:36.930
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

845
01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do it in vivo, which means let's have this exercise be effective with a real event so

846
01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I do it a little differently.

847
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up into your working memory.

848
01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:08.130
Rochelle Martinez: But don't

849
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:10.140
Rochelle Martinez: Let me, let me screenshot it

850
01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So just for a moment.

851
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about something that is a little distressing. Maybe it was upsetting last week or something that causes you a little bit of distress. You don't even have to tell me what it is. But if you want to you can

852
01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.480
Rochelle Martinez: It's a clone of area.

853
01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you've got it in your mind and there's probably some images that you get that are of concern to you.

854
01:32:50.280 --> 01:33:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're thinking about them and just as you think about them. Notice how your heart rate notice your chest. Notice your muscles in your arms and legs, your gut. Just pay attention.

855
01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: you noticing any tension any tightness.

856
01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:14.130
Rochelle Martinez: I noticed my heart rate on. Okay.

857
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what you do as soon as you're aware of that. So then you take grounding in the five senses and we're going to do this first with data coming through the eyes, not a label, not this is a pencil, but rather data meaning, yellow, black numbers silver shiny.

858
01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: White gray see adjectives that come through.

859
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The sense of vision, not a label, not a label is pencil use it, then I stopped. I stopped talking I stop analyzing don't I once I say pencil, but instead I say red, orange shiny angle.

860
01:33:55.140 --> 01:34:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Curved flat black numbers, letters writing reflection bumps smooth, round long. Okay. Okay, now you're going to do this.

861
01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You say, as many adjectives as you can, try not to put a label on it. And I'm going to give you an object to look at. You ready, here we go. That's right in front of you on the screen.

862
01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:22.650
Rochelle Martinez: Last but it

863
01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:27.120
Rochelle Martinez: Would

864
01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:32.640
Rochelle Martinez: Literally edgy.

865
01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice, nice.

866
01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:44.520
Rochelle Martinez: Little rigid

867
01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:46.410
Rochelle Martinez: Very nice.

868
01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:51.270
Rochelle Martinez: White in it. No.

869
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:53.160
Rochelle Martinez: Maybe black

870
01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Now turn your attention to

871
01:34:59.370 --> 01:35:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Put your right hand on something maybe a comforter, or if you've got a little seem on on a on a sweater or something or your glasses. They have lots of different texture right here. There we go. Fine.

872
01:35:12.150 --> 01:35:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So go to temperature change in texture and just use as many adjectives as you can but not through your eyes through your finger fingertips.

873
01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:23.100
Rochelle Martinez: Cool.

874
01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:25.230
Yeah.

875
01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Texture

876
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:38.070
Rochelle Martinez: Circle.

877
01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:40.530
Rochelle Martinez: Straight

878
01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:47.730
Rochelle Martinez: There's a little invention.

879
01:35:49.650 --> 01:35:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Anything sharp are kind of almost anything like that.

880
01:35:54.570 --> 01:35:57.450
Rochelle Martinez: This is yeah yeah yeah there's something sure I'm right here.

881
01:35:58.890 --> 01:36:00.540
Rochelle Martinez: Raise where they me I'm

882
01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, solid squishy any of that.

883
01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:05.910
Rochelle Martinez: Hard for

884
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.970
Rochelle Martinez: You

885
01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be, it might be

886
01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: well rounded you caught some curve just now. Didn't you get

887
01:36:16.650 --> 01:36:18.690
Rochelle Martinez: Like this. Yeah.

888
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now let's turn attention to the other sense, we've got another one. We're going to do, which is your ears. Let's bring in data from there so close eyes and turn all your attention.

889
01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To data coming into your ears and see if you can label as many things as you can and include the tele health include things you might hear through here.

890
01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.370
Rochelle Martinez: The ball bouncing

891
01:36:43.290 --> 01:36:44.790
Rochelle Martinez: Like humidifier going

892
01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:53.700
Rochelle Martinez: You will be the cup or something my pencil clicking

893
01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:58.530
Rochelle Martinez: The TV way in the other room.

894
01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.520
Rochelle Martinez: My nephew running

895
01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.880
Rochelle Martinez: The baby making noises

896
01:37:10.710 --> 01:37:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, brush your fingers just across your ear and can you hear that, can you hear that as that brushes across your ear.

897
01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:17.550
Yes.

898
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's beautiful. Any other sounds

899
01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.640
Rochelle Martinez: I just turned the water from the humidifier gets did

900
01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.420
Rochelle Martinez: You hear my voice. Yeah.

901
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful keep those eyes close. And now I'd like you to inhale through the nose and see if you can catch some labels of smell.

902
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:41.940
Rochelle Martinez: And won't be Megan.

903
01:37:42.570 --> 01:37:42.990
Big

904
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.320
Rochelle Martinez: Potatoes.

905
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:55.530
Rochelle Martinez: Muslim mental mental lead him.

906
01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:57.090
Rochelle Martinez: To be

907
01:37:58.680 --> 01:37:59.940
Rochelle Martinez: A little bit of lavender.

908
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, you're good at this.

909
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.200
Peppermint.

910
01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And taste what you got in there.

911
01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.570
Rochelle Martinez: still taste the toothpaste.

912
01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:18.330
Rochelle Martinez: The body.

913
01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now focus and scan the body and see. See how it's feeling

914
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:28.680
Rochelle Martinez: This call

915
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice your mind really get its best to try to provide as many words as many adjectives to describe from those different senses. It worked very hard to do that.

916
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.070
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, it took my mind off what I was thinking before

917
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That amazing. Yeah.

918
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That is what I mean by grounding in the five senses.

919
01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, the way this poster is written. It says five things you see four things you feel three things you hear two things smell. One thing you taste. You can obviously do it that way. But my enhanced way.

920
01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Means you work even harder up to do it. You grab as many things as you can possibly which means you're you're working so hard in your brain that it can't. It can't focus on that that distress thought

921
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Or that distress image. And that's the goal is to get you get you off that neural network that's feeding the fear what might happen to this when I happened to that. So that's what's cool about this and brought and it brings the heart rate down

922
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.630
Rochelle Martinez: So we started with seeing and then we went to a

923
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Tactile which is feel

924
01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. But yeah, so you can you can do it if you

925
01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, it doesn't really matter.

926
01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.180
Does it. Okay.

927
01:39:49.860 --> 01:40:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The mechanism of change has to do with the focused attention. Okay, the ones that are easier to have more access to information is our eyes.

928
01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Our ears are touch and then we're into smell, and then we're in to taste those last three are hard like you caught more um you caught smooth or rough or whatever. But there's not a lot to to it.

929
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If we pick an object that doesn't have much going on but like this pen would have a lot going on. If this was nearby because look, I've got squishy.

930
01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Even bumps right here and then it goes. There's a rich, then it goes smooth and there's round small and it comes back up and then I've got this

931
01:40:32.850 --> 01:40:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This plot. Okay, then it's a bump and then it's smooth there's kind of a hill, then it transitions again and and you can smell. Sure. Dan, and there's a click to moves in. So, this one has a lot to it. Whereas you know

932
01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

933
01:40:49.650 --> 01:40:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: A pencil. Well, if I had this one wouldn't be bad because I

934
01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Got to go through to sew it all but but that little scarf. You had maybe doesn't have to be.

935
01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:01.410
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah yeah

936
01:41:02.730 --> 01:41:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if you know what to

937
01:41:05.010 --> 01:41:09.210
Rochelle Martinez: Eat eyes use touch, taste and smell. Yeah.

938
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I ears, touch, smell and taste because taste last because really, how much are we really going to taste. I mean, if we maybe if you have the ability to pick up. Let's say you like

939
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: An Indian or a Thai food or something. Maybe you have the ability to pick up on.

940
01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, sweet coconut lemon grass like maybe you have the ability to do that. And if you're ever in in distress and you want to add more focus can go put something go put chocolate in your mouth while you're doing it. Go.

941
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A go put put the, let's say it's an omelet, and you want to really be present with it. I know this sounds really kooky but these cookie things work. So

942
01:41:51.090 --> 01:41:51.390
Yeah.

943
01:41:53.460 --> 01:42:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And everybody else thinks you're eating. So it's in your mouth and you're just really appreciating it. You know, that's, I can feel the texture that that piece of green pepper and it's kind of squishy mean you can really get into something

944
01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And focus your mind off of just this negative thought that's the idea is really mindfully doing something so

945
01:42:17.370 --> 01:42:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do it this way, in a pinch, you're really in a moment. And you were like, I've got. I'm going to take

946
01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just 60 seconds. I'm going to walk away from, let's say, a crying baby or someone's upset and I need to collect myself, not only do you have breath.

947
01:42:31.650 --> 01:42:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But the breath will probably help you remember this activity. You've already been breathing for three or four times and then you go do this.

948
01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're even more grounded I yeah you know what, now I've got perspective, this isn't such a big thing. This is a chandelier. This is a privilege dilemma. I'm okay let me go handle my business. Yeah.

949
01:42:50.190 --> 01:42:52.980
Rochelle Martinez: That'll work. This next two weeks with the kids out of school.

950
01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.570
Rochelle Martinez: Oh, I'll be here more.

951
01:42:57.090 --> 01:42:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All my clients, everybody's like,

01:43:06.450 --> 01:43:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to get out the finger paint. We need, we gotta get we gotta get our art supplies together. We need, we need everything we can to get through these weeks. Right.

954
01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.880
Rochelle Martinez: Yo, I was on Amazon ordering them.

955
01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:30.540
Rochelle Martinez: Kindergarten work look because I'm sure my nephew will be here. Good amount of the three weeks so was like, No, you're gonna have to share dish and you're going to practice everything you can. You're not going to

956
01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:32.130
Rochelle Martinez: Do we

957
01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Lose it if we don't practice it, we lose it.

958
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.970
Okay.

959
01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and so just from today. Are you noticing that you

960
01:43:49.110 --> 01:43:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to add a particular goal.

961
01:43:58.410 --> 01:43:59.970
Rochelle Martinez: I can't even think of a goal.

962
01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

963
01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:04.050
Rochelle Martinez: I'll touch on a couple of topics.

964
01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Interpersonal so for a lot of people. It's about communication, they want to use I statements. They want to know how to mirror

965
01:44:13.710 --> 01:44:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The you're not in an intimate relationship right now. That would probably be coming up. That's, that's what's probably missing a big piece in here when you're in an intimate relationship.

966
01:44:26.670 --> 01:44:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, I don't really want it for people that are in early recovery, because this is the time for self growth but but the the upside of them is

967
01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the almost pressure to resolve.

968
01:44:41.190 --> 01:44:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Difficult arguments and topics of child rearing. Who am I now without my substance use. Oh, I haven't been paying attention to how rude. You are how inconsiderate. And now, how do we navigate this new relationship because

969
01:44:55.530 --> 01:45:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a different person. You're, you're just not the same anymore. But that's not there. So what you and I haven't been bumping into

970
01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: communication challenges.

971
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Either that or you're you really soak in. And or just you just doing it magically on your own.

972
01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:22.800
Rochelle Martinez: I i do practice like those much like it example but it's more with like my grandma and my mom. Do you know what I mean it's not nothing

973
01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.830
Rochelle Martinez: Nothing intimate, it's just

974
01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:34.470
Rochelle Martinez: For we for when we're having a conversation or whatever. And it's just yeah but yeah

975
01:45:35.850 --> 01:45:37.890
Rochelle Martinez: But it's nothing intimate, it's just

976
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:48.750
Rochelle Martinez: It's like growth to just talking about like where I am today. And like how I don't need

977
01:45:49.770 --> 01:45:50.520
Rochelle Martinez: Whatever.

978
01:45:52.710 --> 01:46:03.240
Rochelle Martinez: whatever's going on. You know what I mean, like how it changed from here today, and they all just sit there and we talked in yeah we'll see me in person. Yeah.

979
01:46:04.050 --> 01:46:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I don't hear from you. I don't hear my grandma is so self centered. My grandma so critical. I don't hear because you don't make complaints, might it may very well see how you're shaking your head. You're like now. So you're very blessed, Rochelle. It means that

980
01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:25.110
You are

981
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when the smoke cleared right you have a lot of support, you have a lot a lot a very blessed. Some people when it clears away. They see the toxicity of their family members, right, you're hearing it in group right they're having to really set clear boundaries.

982
01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:45.480
Rochelle Martinez: Were with you.

983
01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: All you had to do was right, stop turning towards the substance and escape and just settle down and let the love in spend time with your family have just these loving people in your life and you're very fortunate. Not everyone has that

984
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.160
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, that's true.

985
01:47:02.610 --> 01:47:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You hearing that sometimes like you'll hear about a really like almost violent and abusive people in people's lives to revere those

986
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:11.610
Rochelle Martinez: Ingredients yeah yeah

987
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what I'm saying is part of I think sometimes for us is you have a lot really going for you and and really it's about this chemical dependence, which you are kicking its tush.

988
01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're before, maybe it was this life satisfaction piece, do I remember early on, do I want to go to school. I don't know what I want to study. Now you have embedded in your life meaning by being

989
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This baby's mother, basically. So you have

990
01:47:40.110 --> 01:47:40.590
Rochelle Martinez: Now,

991
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of, I think, found your purpose. At this point, and she's going to grow and if

992
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:46.920
Rochelle Martinez: You're going to be faced with a

993
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Mind you,

994
01:47:50.460 --> 01:48:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And so your challenge. It sounds like right now is getting still putting yourself as an invaluable important person equal to everybody else that's that's a little vulnerability still where your time is

995
01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Important as anyone elses and getting out and going to these support meetings, making sure

996
01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That you don't deny

997
01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is the part the unknown for me. Don't deny yourself the same right to intimacy to romantic intimacy out of fear.

998
01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:30.030
Rochelle Martinez: I don't think it's out of fear. I think it's, um,

999
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:37.500
Rochelle Martinez: I'm just too busy working on myself now. And I guess there is a little bit of fear.

1000
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:48.180
Rochelle Martinez: But I think it's just me being selfish because right now I just need to work on myself and not worry about somebody else.

1001
01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:53.400
Rochelle Martinez: Okay, stuff like that. I think that's just where I like

1002
01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:59.730
Rochelle Martinez: Don you feel right now. Do you know what I mean, like, right now it's just I need a better Rochelle before I did.

1003
01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:05.400
Rochelle Martinez: He have any good to anybody else. You know what I mean.

1004
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I get the philosophy, but the inverse of that. If I say, well, what are, what are your goals for shell, you'll have a hard time telling me how you are bettering yourself.

1005
01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:17.490
Like you won't be able to go

1006
01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.640
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1007
01:49:21.150 --> 01:49:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know what they are. I don't know how to

1008
01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.330
Get behind

1009
01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to say

1010
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.150
Yeah.

1011
01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:29.130
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I know.

1012
01:49:29.490 --> 01:49:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so it's probably going to be around something like this.

1013
01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that's because I saw a tiny glimmer of it when you are starting and they don't last long, because you have a way of resolving tension on your own. Very well.

1014
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw a glimmer of it when your ex was back in the community. Again, and there was a concern. I will bump into her and I will follow her. I will listen

1015
01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will let go of what I need, what I want, but I believe in. I will almost Stephen I use wording like this all abandoned myself.

1016
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: For this other person. That's what I used to do. And I might do it again. Now that's a very, those are general terms, I know, those aren't your wording. I know that's not how you know

1017
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a glimpse of it and we were able to, we did some MTR around it. We did some hard work right there with it and then you showed here today. It's just not present for you, but I can't help it, but say if we aren't out testing our environment, we're not finding out in real time.

1018
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I have what it takes to mind my own boundaries to respect what I need. What I want protect my recovery in the presence of someone who I want in my life.

1019
01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How you balance, what you need, what you want with someone else's needs and wants. If you're not practicing it you, I know you're doing it with your family, so

1020
01:50:57.030 --> 01:51:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's crushing I'm confident about that, but I got a glimmer of it that something really different happens to you when it's romantic and I can't deny that something was different.

1021
01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:09.540
Yeah.

1022
01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a boundary. That's a will maintain myself, do I value myself in the presence of someone who I'm attracted to where love might be on the line here and I'm so used to for going what I want for someone else. That's what love look like then we'll like go do that same thing

1023
01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: These are important pieces and so

1024
01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:38.880
Rochelle Martinez: We have, is it but

1025
01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.790
Rochelle Martinez: To not be able for me not to have

1026
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:48.810
Rochelle Martinez: Been in that situation, it's like hard to answer any of it because I don't know like

1027
01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:58.770
Rochelle Martinez: I know what what I want to do and what I want to say, but without being in that situation. I can't say for sure. Right, exactly what's going to happen.

1028
01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the plus is if you go do this other thing where you actually are going to the fellowship meetings, believe it or not, what you are going out in the community, which means you risk being attracted to someone

1029
01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so for me it's an opportunity, it's you're going to be interacting with non family members, which means those same skills that you need to maintain which you need want and prefer

1030
01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Your ability to maintain those I

1031
01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't think this person is funny. He's kind of rude, I'm really want to sit next to him, you pay attention you honor that or hey, she's, she's too cute. Oh my gosh, I feel so nervous. What is that

1032
01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh we okay that's important. We get to find out how you are around those feelings, but it's it's still very relevant. So to me, when you get out in the community. We still get to kind of bump into opportunities for some of these skills to be tested.

1033
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:55.890
Rochelle Martinez: Maybe

1034
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll go ahead

1035
01:52:57.390 --> 01:53:08.010
Rochelle Martinez: I'll, I'll pay attention to stuff like that. Yeah, when I do attend all all know it'll be it'll be in the back of my mind. So, yeah.

1036
01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, and you'll know it from things like this. You feel confident, you're like okay, these five people. It's nothing. Nothing's happening not not anxious, nothing's going on unless I was a blessed day whenever, all of a sudden, you got a butterfly.

1037
01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:25.830
Rochelle Martinez: Now, yeah.

1038
01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I want to leave.

1039
01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:30.150
Rochelle Martinez: Now let's just get out of here.

1040
01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm going to want to hear about right there. Yeah, yeah, you feel me. Yeah. That's the one.

1041
01:53:40.410 --> 01:53:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to want to get to know those feelings too.

1042
01:53:44.490 --> 01:53:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't want you to deny yourself the same enjoyment that everybody else has access to. Okay.

1043
01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.680
Rochelle Martinez: I don't. Sure. Okay.

1044
01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.000
So,

1045
01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll stick with the the goals, we've got here, since it has some nice byproducts of getting you on the Community, which we just talked about. And you're saying you can identify anything in particular, as far as a communication skill.

1046
01:54:13.710 --> 01:54:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Or in any particular conflicts with anyone, your ability to

1047
01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: sort of manage the demands of children, you've been able to really hone in on those right you're not completely overwhelmed by them. You can set limits with the kids. These are these are things you didn't have when we first met, I'm impressed. Yeah. Yep.

1048
01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well car.

1049
01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Put something out. Um, I was going to be out of the state. But if everybody canceled on me. So I'm not leaving the state anymore.

1050
01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like okay so much for that training.

1051
01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Seattle. So let me

1052
01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.450
Rochelle Martinez: Know, going to be in Seattle radio

1053
01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that there's a lot of I've got exposure to different kind of an international kind of place, you know,

1054
01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just stay out of there. Now they canceled it anyway. On a gone. I was just gonna be like, whatever. I'm gonna I'm

1055
01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna go I'm sitting at

1056
01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:13.800
All

1057
01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Compromise. So I thought I'll just go

1058
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:20.160
Rochelle Martinez: No.

1059
01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: They're gonna do it through zoom. I'm like,

1060
01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:26.370
Rochelle Martinez: I get to stay away room and get

1061
01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Stuck in here all day talking about

1062
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:33.750
Rochelle Martinez: Was gonna play anyway.

1063
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just take a peek here that would put us over to

1064
01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: April.

1065
01:55:42.630 --> 01:55:44.760
I go over to

1066
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't remember if right these days you've been preferring

1067
01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Somewhere between like nine and 11 kinda in there is that been something you've liked

1068
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:58.260
Um,

1069
01:55:59.310 --> 01:56:01.650
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, but it probably be

1070
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:06.000
Rochelle Martinez: Better between seven and nine just

1071
01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:12.870
Rochelle Martinez: This baby still sleep at that time. So I'm able to me. Absolutely.

1072
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I don't have anything right now.

1073
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: People meet weekly but there's nothing penciled in this far ahead. So we are going to get whatever you want.

1074
01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So pick a day. That's not a typical group day, um,

1075
01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I mean, it can be

1076
01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Friday, April 3 at seven can, you know, would that work.

1077

Rochelle Martinez: Um, yeah, let's go ahead and do it Friday, April 3

1078
01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll send a text reminder, the day before. I mean, assuming I remember I've been pretty pretty consistent with that to help people kind of check their own schedule. But if something comes up so the sooner you put it in your calendar.

1079
01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:00.750
Rochelle Martinez: I will type it we say

1080
01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Going. Okay.

01:57:03.570 --> 01:57:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll, you'll be the first. Sometimes I have a 6am that moves bi weekly there but you might be my first client at the time. Okay, we've got that one set. Now do you need any need you need it and message. The doctor anything. I'm assuming you've been getting your medication.

1082
01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.040
Ordered and yeah

1083
01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:26.520

1085
01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:38.490
Rochelle Martinez: This one day.

Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

1087
01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And just, just to remind you, if you do want to still work with Dr brielle

1088
01:57:51.150 --> 01:58:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you remember, but we do have because your morning you didn't use to like the morning. So, now get review, we do have a seven in the morning group on Tuesdays.

1089
01:58:01.530 --> 01:58:02.340
Rochelle Martinez: And Thursdays.

1090
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:05.340
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, okay.
