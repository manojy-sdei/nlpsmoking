Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, okay.

129
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.550
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually a good meditation.

130
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.470
Jocelyn Corrales: When you do yoga.

131
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.800
Laura: Really. Yeah, it's like

132
00:12:53.430 --> 00:13:07.170
Jocelyn Corrales: It actually requires a lot of concentration. So it's like a self meditation. When you do yoga and you know you mix it with me. See, and you know it relaxes you. It's also a good form of exercise actually

133
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:16.650
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's not that painful when you do active exercise, but it's also another type of maybe working out or exercise when you do yoga.

134
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you do time with nature like going out. Go nature tripping or walking

135
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.850
Laura: Know what I've shown

136
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.520
Jocelyn Corrales: That's also good.

137
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Is, is that is that far away from your area.

138
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Just you have a nature park near your area.

139
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.720
Laura: Yeah, of course. I'm yeah

140
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, you should do some walking there sometime

141
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.760
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually good.

142
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:59.340
Jocelyn Corrales: I think you should also think about it. It's also nice doing nature trips alone, you know, walking the trees there, you know, seeing nature, it's actually

143
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:06.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Make sure that when you go there. There's not a lot of people so that you won't be you know you won't be this distracted. So it's like

144
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:22.260
Jocelyn Corrales: self reflection going to nature, walking through the park with lots of trees, you know, wind blowing in your fees and like around relaxing. It's actually relaxing. I like actually going to nature trips

145
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:37.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it's also nice just start walking maybe around 15 to 30 minutes of work. They just come back doing self reflection. If you're not doing yoga. You can actually do walking you know we nature.

146
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:46.560
Jocelyn Corrales: That's a good thing to do. And it gives you some in, you know, when are some artists, what they do is that they like to spend time with nature, because

147
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.040
Jocelyn Corrales: They feel inspired

148
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.030
Laura: You know,

149
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.500
Jocelyn Corrales: You could get some inspiration there, like for example for you, drawing you want to draw something so when you try to go out to nature to relax.

150
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:09.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. So with regards you've mentioned that you do not have a good relationship with your parents, your parents leave together there with you.

151
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.100
Laura: My mom or my dad.

152
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.510
Uh huh.

153
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.730

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:43.410
Laura: With sometimes. Okay. Your friends that I hang out with that, like, you know, are pretty supportive of me. Just because like

169
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:58.140
Laura: You know they they either knew me before I got locked up or whatever, and they have my back or whatever. And now, and I'm, you know, sober and doing them. They're very supportive of it because, you know, that's all I wanted for me. You know what I mean, like, they saw that I was doing bad

170
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.680

Yeah.

180
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:54.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Just in case you're not, you know, because of the pandemic right now. It's very difficult to meet your friends, but you can do like now like what we are doing now, you can do come in, you can communicate with your friends through calling texting, but I think Zoom is better.

181
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.380
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried Zoo. Zoo and

182
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.820
Jocelyn Corrales: You can try to suggest it to them, just in case you know

183
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing a phone call is different in doing a

184
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:17.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Texting is different but you know sometimes when you you would like to hang out with your friends and you cannot hang out because of the currency. We shouldn't right now.

185
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:29.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Zoom Zoom calling is actually a good option. You could try doing zoom, zoom, zoom, with your friends. You mean it's like you meet with a group of friends in zoom

186
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.760
Jocelyn Corrales: And you get to see them also.

187
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.970
Jocelyn Corrales: You could also try a, like a for example, you mentioned that you're

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Sometimes feeling depressed,

189
00:18:53.790 --> 00:19:02.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Or you usually feel depressed when if you don't want to talk to a therapist or you don't want to talk to me. You can always talk to your friends.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.580
Yeah.

311
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:15.030
Laura: Okay.

312
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:17.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Well,

313
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.020
Laura: It's really

314
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.800
Laura: Not five minutes, four minutes. And so, Mike.

315
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:41.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you used to do that but that up to six maybe on the first alarm, turn it off. Then I'll just wait for the next alarm, but the lex alarm or and the third Li ready, wake up.

316
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:42.510
Yeah.

317
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.040
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

318
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.710
I made it a medication.

319
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.070
Laura: Medication I'm honest.

320
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.580
Jocelyn Corrales: And and also you mentioned that you're not able to sleep well.

321
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.740
Jocelyn Corrales: So probably so yeah

322
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.280
Jocelyn Corrales: You know,

323
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:02.700
Laura: My boss. Like, it takes like four hours ball say okay so i when I'm asleep, I'm like, Okay, I'm done. I'm saying

324
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:13.830
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, probably. That's also one of the reason that's why it's hard to wake up very early, even if you set up an alarm because probably because you're you sleep late

325
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.710
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so do you eat on time.

326
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:17.700
Yeah.

327
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.360
Jocelyn Corrales: And I'll mention

328
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.720
Here.

329
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.950
Jocelyn Corrales: So I right here, you rarely have

330
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.360
Laura: Been, knocking them off of drugs and stuff. So that's good.

331
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.890
Jocelyn Corrales: She's eating you're eating better since you were all

332
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:51.690
Jocelyn Corrales: So you are able to eat on time like breakfast, lunch and dinner or do you skip breakfast.

333
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.150
Laura: Or you say, I usually always eat breakfast.

334
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.110
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

335
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.340
Laura: I'm skipping lunch.

336
00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:57.900
Oh, why

337
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:01.470
Laura: Why

338
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.930
Laura: Because normally if I'm doing something like if I'm busy or something.

339
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.590
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, but, but do you feel hungry.

340
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:15.510
Laura: Oh yeah, I'll still eat like you know like a pre dinner or something.

341
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.100
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

342
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:24.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Sometimes you miss lunch, or is it always you miss lunch.

343
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.450
Laura: Sometimes

344
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.200
Jocelyn Corrales: But not always something she misses lunch.

345
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.200
Jocelyn Corrales: But it's theater.

346
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh key so

347
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Try not to forget eating your lunch, even if you're very busy.

348
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.860
Laura: I will try for you.

349
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, that's good.

350
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:55.080
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, because sometimes it's the effect, sometimes it has a button.

351
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.270
Jocelyn Corrales: When you can affect like everything

352
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Kind of like the moment. Yeah. Yes.

353
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Something like it could have, you know,

354
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:11.940
Jocelyn Corrales: You know when you're hungry. Sometimes, and you're very busy doing work, and you're very hungry. Sometimes it frustrates you or something.

355
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:21.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Changes. Yeah, sometimes. Eat affects your mood or emotions because you know you want to finish something, and you do not want to eat.

356
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to eat just just maybe even a light lunch, a sandwich maybe or a foot maybe

357
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:41.130
Jocelyn Corrales: So so so you don't feel hungry, you can actually schedule it so that you won't feel hungry. So like for example for breakfast. Of course, you wake up at nine probably eat breakfast or 930 or 10 so

358
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:58.830
Jocelyn Corrales: When you eat lunch like you could eat a late lunch, probably because you ate breakfast late also. So you try to eat lunch alleged around maybe one o'clock like this, a sandwich maybe or a fruit or any snack so that you won't feel because

359
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:10.740
Jocelyn Corrales: From 10 o'clock to dinner time that's already a lot of time in between. So try to add on a little time in between to eat snacks or

360
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Light lunch.

361
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.020
Jocelyn Corrales: You won't feel hungry.

362
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:30.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so with your ad else try you wanted to try yoga.

363
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Why not try doing yoga instead of, you know, a heavy type of exercise.

364
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Walk with nature.

365
00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Or self reflection.

366
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.150
Jocelyn Corrales: And relaxation

367
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so what time do you usually go to bed.

368
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.440
Laura: You are honest truth and you want to lie.

369
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.390
Jocelyn Corrales: The honest truth.

370
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.700
Laura: Okay, like 12 123

371
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:39.360
Okay.

372
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.110
Jocelyn Corrales: It's okay. So it's usually around 12

373
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:50.430
Laura: One, two. Okay, so between like 23 because I try it out and try. Trust me, I'll try and with laid out like no I haven't.

374
00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.210
Laura: But I talked to my New Testament

375
00:33:55.290 --> 00:34:04.770
Laura: Trust turned around, turn by myself trying to, you know, turn off TVs and then turn it back on and turn it off. Turn it off, turn it back on. Yeah.

376
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:12.690
Jocelyn Corrales: That's why you wake up. Yeah. That's why I understand why you wake up late. Also, at times, probably

377
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:18.300
Laura: I like to wake up early. I don't like to sleep in. I don't I get. It's not my thing.

378
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.030
Laura: Whenever I toss and turn like that. It's like

379
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:24.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried tiring yourself to be able to sleep early at night.

380
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.030
Laura: Let's try what

381
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.570
Jocelyn Corrales: Tiring tiring yourself like doing exercise.

382
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Or you can do yoga. So at night.

383
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Just maybe about 15 minutes of yoga.

384
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:36.480
Five.

385
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.180
Laura: Before I go to bed or something like

386
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.370
Laura: Working for me.

387
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Is it safe to walk.

388
00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:45.330
Laura: Out there at yeah it's

389
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.490
Laura: Bad part of town. I'm good.

390
00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:48.330
You're always

391
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Say it's not crowded. Okay, that's my

392
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.200
Laura: Partner my partner time maybe

393
00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:10.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could try walking around the house. I'm not sure if it's safe to go outside. But anyway, if you think it's safe. But I think doing yoga or walking around the house just nearby that just don't go very far away.

394
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.570
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe earlier at night net net net didn't wait around till

395
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.590
Laura: 10 o'clock.

396
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.460
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

397
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:21.540
Maybe

398
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:43.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe date around maybe around that time would be eight nine or 10

399
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:54.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so what I have written in the planning is that

400
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:03.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Let me check if I did miss anything. There's still pain. Yes. A will improvise exercise.

401
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:30.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Charlie.

402
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.970
Jocelyn Corrales: A plane should

403
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.630
Laura: I say Sudoku.

404
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:40.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.680
Laura: That's what I thought okay yeah me. I love it.

406
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:50.010
Laura: Do I think a stack this high like one man. Yeah.

407
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:59.790
Jocelyn Corrales: I used to play Sudoku. But it's on the phone. It's very hard to do. It's very hard to date and up in a

408
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Book. Yeah, because you have to erase a lot when you do it in a book, but

409
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.400
Laura: You have like a model. Why not right there. Okay.

410
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:14.520
Laura: Why not everywhere, but it's okay.

411
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:16.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

412
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:22.350
Jocelyn Corrales: This I like another food because or maybe you can try using a pencil instead of a bogus.

413
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.340
Jocelyn Corrales: As the data.

414
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Is strong and you have to date again.

415
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.640

Jocelyn Corrales: Online.

419
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe via zoom if they are familiar with zoom

420
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.280
Jocelyn Corrales: So that you'll be able, you know, to be connected.

421
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:06.990

422
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.520

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.380
Yeah.

425
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.070
Jocelyn Corrales: You just leave nearby each other.

426
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.450
Laura: No. Well, we have like two miles one

427
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:34.950
Jocelyn Corrales: To

428
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:36.420

431
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:52.800
Laura: Propose

432
00:39:53.580 --> 00:40:00.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, it's like a follow up just like checking on you and like it, it would be shorter than what we have now.

433
00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:05.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Instead of the first. Yeah. Yes. Because unlike the

434
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:14.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Left, we're doing that many. So it's, it takes quite longer but toward a follow up and just, you know, ASKING. HOW ARE YOU DOING AND MORE OF chitchat now you doing well, if you will.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.790
Jocelyn Corrales: And how are you sleeping right now. Maybe after 30 days. I hope you're sleeping better

437
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.320
Laura: No obstruction.

438
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:36.900
Jocelyn Corrales: And let's check on that. And let's check on your, you know, if you're still feeling better. Are you still feeling more depression. And how's your exercise. Doing so, something like that.

439
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.920

440
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.110
Laura: Out of me for that. No.

441
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.250

447
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.090

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:56.040
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, good friends are the ones who tells you the truth, who tells the bad things about you in front of you.

469
00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:02.070
Laura: Like I said, they all said you were horrible under but you know now, you're a stranger a lot better. I'm like, thanks.

470
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:04.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

471
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:12.060
Jocelyn Corrales: True friends are actually honest people. They're not that typical person that you know are nice to you, but men, you know,

472
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.810
Jocelyn Corrales: You turn your back around and like you talk a lot about you. Yeah.

473
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:25.320
Jocelyn Corrales: They talk a lot behind you, but a true friends are someone who could tell you what strong review what's bad about you in front of you.

474
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:31.920
Jocelyn Corrales: And that told me about it behind the view. Yes. I appreciate those kind of people actually

475
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:48.780
Jocelyn Corrales: I have. I used to have a co worker and everybody hates her because I don't know because of the way she she talks, maybe the tone of her voice. I don't know why they hate her. But you know, I like her very much because you know she's, she's a two person. She's an honest.

476
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Person, what is

477
00:43:51.030 --> 00:44:03.510
Jocelyn Corrales: What you see in her is actually really her unlike other people that what you see is just a facade. You know, you know, when we hear back there, you know, the, say, a lot of nasty things about you, but her

478
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:16.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Know in France, she's really like that. But behind. She's, she's a good friend, you know, something like that. And I don't know why. Maybe because you know some people, you know, hate it Monday think you're too honest, you know,

479
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.090
Jocelyn Corrales: So they say they would hate you for that. If you're too honest but you know

480
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.000
Laura: You liked it for you real. I know it's a true person.

481
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:36.000
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes, because that's, that's really her that's that's her person at the end. That's what she's trying to show is the real her or her true self, not unlike other who you know who's wearing masks or, you know,

482
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Yesterday, no. Okay.

483
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:40.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, I'll share

484
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:50.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, there are a lot of people like that, you know, so try to choose your friends wisely sometimes other people would you know think

485
00:44:52.710 --> 00:45:02.730
Jocelyn Corrales: They would like a dual letter want to hang out with people who are really nice to them good to them, you know, but when you are in trouble or you're in from their old guy, you know,

486
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so I'll show you the plans because

487
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:24.060
Jocelyn Corrales: The what's working well and not working well I incorporated in one area. I'll just, I'm just going to arrange this or I'll just edit this in a while, you mentioned about your exercise and you're not being able to sleep well. But I'm going to edit this later.

488
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:27.510
It's actually very long.

489
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.070
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually very wrong. This is about your ideas, your be

490
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:45.510
Jocelyn Corrales: At else and you're not able to sleep well. But you wake up early pretty fast able to eat well, but I also mentioned that you are not a leader on the leader portion that you are sometimes missing your lunch.

491
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:56.970
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're able to exercise and follow in exercise video online, but sometimes doing such exercise triggers a lot of pain and, you know, makes you stop to

492
00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:10.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing exercise. So let's improvise that I have included in the plan. You mentioned that you're depressed alot stress is okay and is able to manage it by reading a book, Thinking a lot

493
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.320
Jocelyn Corrales: And that bright heart health.

494
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:21.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Is helping and you talk to your friends. Sometimes I I also, I just, yeah.

495
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.240
Laura: And you want to try again. Yes, I do. I will, I will watch my watch. I will try it.

496
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:31.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Just like the basic

497
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Just try the basic yoga first

498
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:41.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Not the very hard ones, then you can try the more complicated once once you're used to do.

499
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:50.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Sometimes it's like doing yoga sometimes also very, it's like doing exercise also sometimes, you know, it's

500
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.660
Laura: All kind of

501
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. He also he

502
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:54.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Also

503
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.570
Jocelyn Corrales: It's also a key.

504
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.920
Laura: She says,

505
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.400
Laura: We should just

506
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.490

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:34.080
Jocelyn Corrales: I'm just gonna arrange it later on. Just going to edit here. So in here that's working because he pointed out, you do not have a good relationship.

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:36.030
Jocelyn Corrales: With your desk still Jinx a lot

511
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.520

Laura: So much records and this. Yeah.

546
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:17.520
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, some sometimes when I try to share it to other patients, they're not able to, I'm not able to share the mouse to them or if, if ever, I'm able to share it to them.

547
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.080
Jocelyn Corrales: If I'm able to share it to them. It's very difficult for them to

548
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:29.190
Jocelyn Corrales: To control the mouse.

549
00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:30.840

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.270
Jocelyn Corrales: tried doing

552

Jocelyn Corrales: planking, you know, at the sport also part of yoga planking and, you know, they also have, you know, other positions that are just easy but you know

553
00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:16.620
Jocelyn Corrales: I realized even 15 minutes of yoga is actually tiring at first, but you start with 15 minutes the later on, do it for 20 minutes then later on 25 minutes until you're able to tolerate it for

554
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:23.670
Jocelyn Corrales: A minute okay and eat healthy snacks and food. Okay, try. Oh, that's good, that's good.
