Natalie Austin: Um,

16
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.950
Natalie Austin: So tell me about your, give me your story about some opioid

17
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.040
Natalie Austin: Issues and Suboxone therapy. How'd you How old are you started

18
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.530
Natalie Austin: How did you get in

19
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.460
I

20
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.960
Kathryn Bolles: OK, I was probably see

21
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.180
Kathryn Bolles: It was in

22
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:49.590
Kathryn Bolles: 2016 so that was four years ago. So I was 31 um it was after I had my second child.

23
00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:12.030
Kathryn Bolles: I had an accident, I guess you could say, or the doctors did with an epidural to where I had to have your nerve damage in my back. And so after that happened, then they prescribe me prescription opioids for the pain.

24
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.310
Kathryn Bolles: And then I also ended up after that going into postpartum eclampsia.

25
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.530
Kathryn Bolles: So I'd like severe migraines because of the magnesium issues and things like that. And I was hospitalized. So then I was also put on pain medication for that.

26
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.820
Kathryn Bolles: To where they realized I had like a super high tolerance for pain medication. And so I was actually put on

27
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:56.400
Kathryn Bolles: oxy codeine or oxy cotton. I don't remember which one that it was, but, um, and so I was taking that for a while and the father of my kids is actually a former drug addict.

28
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:13.890
Kathryn Bolles: He started with a football injury and got prescribed prescription opioids and then it just got progressively worse till it turned into heroin and so I kind of had seen with a head done to a person to a family two kids to everything.

29
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.210
Kathryn Bolles: And I didn't

30
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:27.690
Kathryn Bolles: want that to happen to me, and so it's almost like after so long, of taking the prescription, because I was hospitalized because of all of this, after the baby for like three weeks.

31
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:40.500
Kathryn Bolles: So I only actually took the opioids like given to me by the doctor in the hospital. And once I got the script. I was like, I don't want to take this because I had the fear that what had happened to him was going to happen to me.

32
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:53.160
Kathryn Bolles: Um, and so at the time he was actually on a Suboxone treatment. And so he was like here, just take this, you know, this will you know help ease the pain but

33
00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:05.220
Kathryn Bolles: You know you won't have the issues of getting addicted to the opioid so I did that. And then when I tried to stop taking it. It was like impossible, like I couldn't stop taking it.

34
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:22.230
Kathryn Bolles: And I also struggle like super bad with like anxiety, like my anxiety is super high. I've been tested for like all kinds of cardiac issues like everything there is. I've been to see a cardiologist.

35
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:41.820
Kathryn Bolles: All things like that. And they say, if there's nothing wrong with my heart in that same year in 2016 I had been to the emergency room probably 50 plus times thinking I was having a heart attack and it was anxiety. I'm sorry. It makes me emotional um

36
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.040
Kathryn Bolles: But, and then. So I went to see like a doctor and a therapist and things like that for my anxiety.

37
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.920
Kathryn Bolles: And

38
00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.160
Kathryn Bolles: None of them would prescribe medication and they only wanted you know to do like cognitive therapies and nothing was working for me.

39
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.220
Kathryn Bolles: And so basically I guess since then, because

40
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:21.510
Kathryn Bolles: They wouldn't give it to me. I was getting it from, you know, people I knew who had it, which I know is it right but I was trying to do what I needed to do because I was a single mom and I had two kids to raise

41
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:31.710
Kathryn Bolles: To make myself feel better. Um, and then the same thing with the Suboxone I tried to go in our area and get Suboxone treatment but around here.

42
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.720
Kathryn Bolles: A it's almost impossible to find somewhere that will take insurance.

43
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.420
Kathryn Bolles: So it's super, super expensive and as a single mom of two kids. I couldn't afford it.

44
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:56.250
Kathryn Bolles: Um, and then because they require so much like you have to go every single day to meetings like three hours a day and things like that. You can't take your kids with you and it's like I felt like

45
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:13.800
Kathryn Bolles: No one was willing to help almost, I guess. And so I just did what you know whether it was right or wrong. I did what I had to do just to be able to live day to day and take care of my kids. So I guess that's kind of

46
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.530
Natalie Austin: So what did you have to do day to day. What did you resort to

47
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.470
Kathryn Bolles: Um, well, I mean, I would just

48
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:43.860
Kathryn Bolles: I had me on the street. Yeah, I had known people who had prescriptions of, you know, Xanax in Suboxone and so I would just get it from them and I had known that because my husband, because then on top.

49
00:06:45.030 --> 00:07:03.990
Kathryn Bolles: Of all that like I already had pre existing anxiety and then in 2017 my husband had actually got back into using drugs like because he couldn't afford to keep going to Suboxone clinics anymore, and all of those things. And so he got back into using drugs.

50
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:16.530
Kathryn Bolles: He took my daughter with him in a car to get drugs and the police, you know, realized what he was doing chased him he crashed a car with my baby in the car.

51
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:34.500
Kathryn Bolles: went to prison for three years, like, yeah. And so it's just kind of been like a roller coaster and like so that set my anxiety even higher because that we lost our house. We lost our cars. I mean, we lost everything. I was homeless with two kids.

52
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:47.850
Kathryn Bolles: And so like I said, like I just, I mean, I basically had to turn everything like around by myself, because like we don't have any like family like around or anything like that, um,

53
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:56.730
Kathryn Bolles: And so it was just me and the kids. And so I just did. Like I said, I knew people who had had it, because obviously his circle of friends.

54
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:16.620
Kathryn Bolles: Was, you know, former drug addicts and things like that. And so I just knew where to get it from. And I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I also knew that if I didn't have those things that there was no way I was going to be able to function to be able to take care of my kids so

55
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:27.000
Natalie Austin: What age did August. What age were you and he has this the C section with your second child hold up all the started. How old were you

56
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.250
Kathryn Bolles: And I was 31

57
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.110
Natalie Austin: Okay, how old are you now.

58
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.580
Kathryn Bolles: 3536 3536 I'll be there. I'll be 36 in October.

59
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.540
Okay.

60
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.480
Natalie Austin: So 31

61
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.530
Natalie Austin: To five years almost six years of this

62
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.730
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, she was born in 2000 december of 2015

63
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.200
Natalie Austin: Right, okay.

64
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.540
Natalie Austin: Um, how have you see, you see have gone to other Suboxone clinics, but

65
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.180
Natalie Austin: Any astronomical fee, whatever it is.

66
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.350
Kathryn Bolles: Great.

67
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.750
Natalie Austin: I think then you left there because you couldn't afford the monthly fees and the daily whatever it is that's

68
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:16.140
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, it was really. I mean, a lot of them. It was like they wanted like $500 just to initially see you and then you have

69
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:16.380
Natalie Austin: To

70
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:24.210
Kathryn Bolles: Pay for your prescription because they wouldn't run it through insurance. So you had to then pay for the prescription and then you had to pay for like the daily

71
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:40.860
Kathryn Bolles: meetings that you had to go to like with a therapist. The group sessions, all of that. And I mean, it ended up coming out to thousands of dollars a month. And that just wasn't. I mean, I was barely getting by. It wasn't even something that was kind of attainable to do

72
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.390
Natalie Austin: Right. Oh my gosh.

73
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.230
Yeah.

74
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:52.560
Kathryn Bolles: And then, and then with like the anxiety medication. I had a doctor for a while, who kind of, I guess, had seen like

75
00:09:52.860 --> 00:10:03.150
Kathryn Bolles: Everything I had been through, and I had tried going you know to therapist and tried the different things to deal with my anxiety, but it's almost like my anxiety has turned to, like, kind of like

76
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:13.950
Kathryn Bolles: A PTSD kind of thing and sort of way to where like there's things that just trigger like my anxiety and like I can't control it and it will raise my heart rate and that's what

77
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:23.640
Kathryn Bolles: leads me to go like to the emergency room because I think I'm having a heart attack, because I have all those symptoms and so for a while I was actually prescribed

78
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:36.180
Kathryn Bolles: Xanax and add a van. I was prescribed to add events to take during the day just to keep me calm during the day and then the Xanax to take at night to help me to be able to sleep through the night.

79
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:44.310
Kathryn Bolles: And then after so long, she said, Because of, I don't know, some certain laws or something that had passed in the state of Ohio.

80
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:58.410
Kathryn Bolles: That she as my primary care physician was no longer able to prescribe them. And so I was cut off like cold turkey from those medications and then when I went like I said it a try to go see a therapist. They wanted nothing

81
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.540
Kathryn Bolles: Any kind of medical

82
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:01.800
Kathryn Bolles: And

83
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:15.510
Kathryn Bolles: The people that I went to, I guess, they just they said they didn't think that it was necessary. They didn't believe in it. They thought that there was other ways to deal with it and that that led to the same kind of

84
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:32.040
Kathryn Bolles: Like the same thing has like the opioid crisis because like Xanax as an addictive medication, but I mean, it's one of the only things that works like because that's how bad that my anxiety is so

85
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.230
Kathryn Bolles: That's why I signed another slide psychiatrists that will prescribe that for you.

86
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.500
Kathryn Bolles: I haven't been able to know, not one that will take

87
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.450
My shorter

88
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.590
Natalie Austin: You called your insurance company to see who's covered under your insurance. They have a list of all. Oh.

89
00:11:49.590 --> 00:12:04.260
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, I have a huge list of different like psychiatry city therapist stuff. And I've, I went to probably about six different ones or talk to about six different ones. And I can't get prescribed anything that

90
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.940
That would help.

91
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.930
Natalie Austin: Even even buying that off the street to them.

92
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.120
Natalie Austin: Yeah yeah

93
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.180
Natalie Austin: Um,

94
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.480
Natalie Austin: So when was the last time you had a prescription for the Suboxone

95
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.450
Kathryn Bolles: I've never had a prescription

96
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.740
Natalie Austin: I've never done. Do you always got clinics, but they handed them to you, kind of, okay,

97
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.010
Natalie Austin: So the last time you took us the box them today.

98
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.660
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, this morning.

99
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.300
Natalie Austin: The film or the pills.

100
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.830
Kathryn Bolles: The film.

101
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:50.820
Film

102
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.470
Natalie Austin: Do you have a pharmacy.

103
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.450
Natalie Austin: You

104
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.110
Natalie Austin: Use the phone.

105
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.700
Natalie Austin: We usually do like daily or twice a day dosing

106
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.040
Kathryn Bolles: Is the standard. Yeah.

107
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.640
Natalie Austin: Which one works for us. And once a day or twice a day.

108
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:22.350
Kathryn Bolles: I usually take it twice a day. I usually take it like in the morning within like an hour to of getting up

109
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:22.800
Kathryn Bolles: Right.

110
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.300
Kathryn Bolles: And then like later in like the evening, like a few hours before I go to bed.

111
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.860
Natalie Austin: Right, okay.

112
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:36.540
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

113
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.990
Natalie Austin: So what else is included in your past medical history, and we've been designing

114
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:44.790
Natalie Austin: And

115
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.670
Natalie Austin: You never use IV drugs. Did you

116
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.280
Natalie Austin: Know that, that's good.

117
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.310
Natalie Austin: Um, do you have a high blood pressure. Do you have diabetes thyroid disease.

118
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.220
Kathryn Bolles: I do have an issue. I do have

119
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.720
Kathryn Bolles: borderline hyperthyroidism. But to the point where I

120
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.720
Kathryn Bolles: It's really complicated. I guess like because it's super like borderline so like

121
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.850
Kathryn Bolles: It. He oh it's whole tour and it makes my heart race it tear

122
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.310
Kathryn Bolles: Down because they can't get it under control, because it's like so borderline that if I

123
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:23.700
Natalie Austin: Will give you

124
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.210
Natalie Austin: Medicine.

125
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.160
Kathryn Bolles: I have medicine for it.

126
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:43.470
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, but if I take the medication daily it automatically throws me into hyperthyroidism because it's so borderline that they're still trying to figure out, like if I just need to take the smallest dosage, which I think is like five milligrams, which is what I prescribed

127
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.430
Kathryn Bolles: Like once every three days.

128
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.050
Natalie Austin: Or once every other day.

129
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.880
Natalie Austin: Right now, if I

130
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:56.400
Kathryn Bolles: Take it every day. Then it like throws me the other way and then it's just a whole different

131
00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.570
Natalie Austin: Set of symptoms well being and being hypo might not be bad for you though.

132
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.460
Natalie Austin: You know, I mean, because you are so you're so manic, you're so anxious

133
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.260
Natalie Austin: Yeah, might actually do good, you know, I mean, just because

134
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.190
Kathryn Bolles: He

135
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:17.910
Natalie Austin: Still feeling of hypos yeah being tired, you're not you're anxious at all. You know, it's a complete opposite.

136
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.680
Natalie Austin: Yeah, people my function better at that means that make sense.

137
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:32.130
Kathryn Bolles: Right. Yeah. Because I guess they said that I was when I finally, I was just diagnosed with hyper last April. So it's only been like a year.

138
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.610
Kathryn Bolles: And they said that I probably went for

139
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:43.440

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.590
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, for sure.

292
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.930
Kathryn Bolles: Started missing out on that now.

293
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.090
Natalie Austin: Yeah, but that way they can actually see each other on the screen. Kinda like you and I are, you know,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.760
Natalie Austin: You just send you sign up and then you start sending links to everybody and you get in this little circle. It's pretty cool.

297

Natalie Austin: Huh.

298
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.730
Natalie Austin: Okay, so under your past medical history, do anything else besides just anxiety and hyperthyroidism.

299
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.810
Natalie Austin: Know ideas do you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol.

300
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.150
Natalie Austin: No, you're too young for all that, too.

301
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.250
Natalie Austin: Um, any past surgeries.

302
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:30.570
Know,

303
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.780
Natalie Austin: Just to divert to natural birth.

304
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:34.980
Kathryn Bolles: Yep.

305
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.660
Kathryn Bolles: That's all you

306
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.400
Natalie Austin: Know C sections section.

307
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.920
Natalie Austin: No. Do you have

308
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:48.930
Natalie Austin: When you have a nerve damage from the epidural. I still have, you still have nerve nerve damage from that.

309
00:27:50.130 --> 00:28:00.210
Kathryn Bolles: I still feel the pain in my back. Yeah, it's definitely not as bad as it was. But again, I mean, I also use the Suboxone. It's kind of like a pain.

310
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.010
Natalie Austin: It works for pain management.

311
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.440
Kathryn Bolles: Kind of thing. So, I mean, that definitely helps it

312
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:12.990
Kathryn Bolles: But I can tell that I still have especially like when I first wake up in the morning like my back is like really stiff like in the places.

313
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:25.530
Kathryn Bolles: Where I know that it like because it was where the needle was like injected they like hit something wrong and they had to take it back out and then put it back in. And it was like a student who did it, and

314
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.030
Kathryn Bolles: They almost told me immediately. Like, you're probably going to have

315
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.000
Kathryn Bolles: Pain in this area because of how it was injected the wrong way. So,

316
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.280
Natalie Austin: Yeah, in our nerves along your spine like this.

317
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.210
Kathryn Bolles: Mm hmm.

318
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:48.390
Natalie Austin: Yeah, they put the injection right in the middle. If they're too far left for too far right, even by a millimeter you'll hit a nerve.

319
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.010
Kathryn Bolles: Right. Yeah. And I think at a

320
00:28:50.010 --> 00:29:05.760
Kathryn Bolles: Time and it was painful. Because I remember getting the epidural for the first kid and like it was like nothing like I thought it was gonna hurt so bad. I was so scared. I almost didn't get it. And then they're like, Okay, we're done. And I'm like, that's it. Like you've already put it in.

321
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:19.500
Kathryn Bolles: And it didn't hurt and then with the second one, when they stuck it the first time, like I like screams like in like horrific pain and the doctors like yep he hit the nerve and he was. She was like, we're going to get the regular, you know,

322
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.290
Kathryn Bolles: Doc person in here. Yeah, to do it, not the student or whatever. And I was like, oh my god, it was so

323
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.330
Natalie Austin: Sore thing.

324
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.800
Kathryn Bolles: And then to have to go through birth. After that, it's like

325
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.880
Natalie Austin: Oh, don't, don't ever know Mia. Did they ever get it not not

326
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:42.990
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, the doctor eventually came in and got it in the right way and then it works fine. So the actual birthday to her at all.

327
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:43.650
Natalie Austin: Oh god.

328
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.620
Kathryn Bolles: Once it wore off though I could tell that

329
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.790
Kathryn Bolles: That was. And that's when they started like the pain medication.

330
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.680
Kathryn Bolles: Because not

331
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.710
Kathryn Bolles: The actual pain from, you know, having like a natural

332
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.940
Kathryn Bolles: Birth, but then to have the nerve damage in

333
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:08.430
Kathryn Bolles: Right, and then they also put me on something else for nerve damage. Back then, too. I think it was called like

334
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:15.540
Kathryn Bolles: Gabba pet never heard. Yeah, because of the nerve damage before so

335
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.280
Natalie Austin: Are you still on that to

336
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.060

Kathryn Bolles: No, they don't live near us but

364
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.790
Kathryn Bolles: A lot of things have happened within like our family when

Kathryn Bolles: The my kid's dad like went to jail. And like all of that stuff happened. And so, and that's all freshly coming to an end, like he just

366
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:41.700
Kathryn Bolles: Came home within the last six months or got out of jail in the last six months. And so that's been a lot to deal with within our family and then like he doesn't have like a family like his mom is a drug addict, his brother is

367
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:52.260
Kathryn Bolles: Kind of crazy and just unkind and then his dad passed away from cancer like six or seven years ago, so

368
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:57.870
Kathryn Bolles: We don't have any family like from his side, so

369
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.700
Natalie Austin: See if he moved back in with your you guys get back together.

370
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:15.510
Kathryn Bolles: He is living with us right now. Yeah, just for the kids sake, and we're trying to, you know, work on things and stuff like that. And we were supposed to start going to like a couples therapy.

371
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:25.830
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, before like this all started. So that's kind of been put on hold, but we will once this is lifted, or whatever you want to say.

372
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.600
Natalie Austin: So you were married, and then you got divorced and then now you're kind of dating again.

373
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.650
Kathryn Bolles: We never

374
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.910
Kathryn Bolles: Got divorce.

375
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:33.870

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:03.690
Natalie Austin: Aspect the medicine.

387
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.450
Kathryn Bolles: I think it's a great idea. I mean, I hope.

388
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.970
Kathryn Bolles: They continue to do it like once

389
00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.320
Natalie Austin: I do to

390
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:18.000
Kathryn Bolles: This is all over. I mean, I feel like it keeps the germs or whatever, you know, out of doctors offices. You don't need to go there unless you need like

391
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.610
Kathryn Bolles: A procedure or something like that. There's no reason just to go in to get

392
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:30.330
Kathryn Bolles: Like I know for my thyroid meds, like I have to go in, just to get my meds felt like I had to go see the doctor just for him to be like

393
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:42.060
Kathryn Bolles: How you doing, you okay okay here. Let me right you have another prescription for six months, like to avoid things like that, just to avoid germs of going into a an office visit or whatever.

394
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.110
Natalie Austin: The boys emissions gasoline time everything

395
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:52.800
Kathryn Bolles: Right, yeah. Yeah, so much more convenient, especially, you know, having two kids. I don't have to Kurt to

396
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.720
Kathryn Bolles: The doctor with me and

397
00:34:56.130 --> 00:35:06.990
Natalie Austin: I wasn't the doctors long the other day at the hospital. I work at. And there's two primary care doctors talking about this and I joined in, you know, and they said, We hope this continues. They said the same thing.

398
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:12.330
Natalie Austin: They said we really we love seeing patients this way and you can see a lot more

399
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.290
Natalie Austin: doesn't waste a lot of time when I'm sitting in the office. Exactly.

400
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.120
Kathryn Bolles: Right, well yeah are sitting there.

401
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:22.830
Kathryn Bolles: Waiting for 40 minutes just because they're running behind or, you know,

402
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.580
Yeah.

403
00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.700
Natalie Austin: It's crazy on the voice of time.

404
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:27.510
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah.

405
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:33.840
Natalie Austin: And then vitals, you know, they can just go to Rite Aid and go on the machine and then tell us the vitals. What we were

406
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.690
Natalie Austin: Right. They were doing. I'm like, That is genius, you know,

407
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.520
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah. Or you can even get like

408
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.530
Kathryn Bolles: Like I know machine have one blood pressure machine here and the things take your heart rate and

409
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:48.540
Kathryn Bolles: All that stuff you can do that stuff at home. Yeah, exactly. And just tell them

410
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.010
Natalie Austin: You know what your readings are

411
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.290
Natalie Austin: You. I think it's amazing.

412
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.880
Natalie Austin: Yeah, so I mean they're even talking about continuing that so I hope it does too.

413
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.140
Kathryn Bolles: It's yeah yeah

414
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.180
Natalie Austin: I think it's a great idea.

415
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.170
Kathryn Bolles: Mm hmm.

416
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:06.960
Natalie Austin: I mean, even with all everyone's saying home like the climate has gotten better, like the emissions.

417
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.220
Natalie Austin: Is great. Not much smoke and fog out there. I mean,

418
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.630
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, there's yeah they're saying a lot of things have gotten better like

419
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.400
Kathryn Bolles: You know, people are actually getting back to what like really matters. Instead of, you know,

420
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:21.900
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah.

421
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:30.450
Natalie Austin: People are cooking meals at home. Now, kids or families are sitting at the table eating now and they're playing game.

422
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.200
Kathryn Bolles: Again,

423
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:46.650
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, we were. I mean, we're a family that is guilty of being so busy because I run a business from home until like I'm constantly, you know, doing stuff for work at home. And so it's hard to it's hard for me to separate work from home because I work in my home, you know,

424
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:51.690
Kathryn Bolles: Right, and so we are super guilty, especially like what it was just me and the kids of eating out

425
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.100
Kathryn Bolles: Like every single night.

426
00:36:53.460 --> 00:37:07.980
Kathryn Bolles: Like never come home and ever since this started. We have saved so much money not going out to eat, and we all do. Like we never would sit down at the dinner table and eat together every night we sit down at the dinner table together. So I mean it's just

427
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.840
Kathryn Bolles: It makes you realize like the things that you kind of take for granted, like

428
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.230
I know

429
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.180
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah.

430
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.430
Natalie Austin: And that's the only good thing out of all this.

431
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.810
Kathryn Bolles: Right, yeah.

432
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.670
Natalie Austin: There's a silver lining to

433
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:25.260
Kathryn Bolles: It has definitely brought some good along with a lot of bad obviously but

434
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.430
Kathryn Bolles: It's definitely brought some good, I think, to a lot of people

435
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:39.720
Natalie Austin: I know people baking more I made read the other day older than that. And so long, so we can get to the store something I'll make some

436
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.350
Natalie Austin: Munchies before you know all this happen.

437
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.960
Natalie Austin: Made

438
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:53.280
Natalie Austin: So yes, it's neat freak started a new hobbies are all at all, all those

439
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:54.990
Kathryn Bolles: No, not really.

440
00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:01.710
Kathryn Bolles: But I mean we're definitely like playing outside more like my kids have a sandbox and you know sidewalk chalk and

441
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.700
Natalie Austin: Oh, yeah.

442
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:13.290
Kathryn Bolles: So, I mean, we're definitely like doing a lot more stuff together and you know being like outside because you know we can be in our backyard or they can ride bikes or, you know, things like that. So just doing

443
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.210
Kathryn Bolles: A lot of that stuff when the weather permits because our weather here is crazy, like one day, it's

444
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.670
Kathryn Bolles: 80 degrees. The next day, it's 45 degrees. It's snowing. And I'm like,

445
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:34.350
Kathryn Bolles: And then I've noticed that, like with the rain or like the snow, like I get really bad headaches and I get really bad like sore throats like I get really sick, like with the change of weather and then of

446
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.880
Kathryn Bolles: Course my anxiety tells me

447
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:40.680
Kathryn Bolles: Oh my god did when you go to the grocery store. You got this, you know, covert or what I've been a

448
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.920
Kathryn Bolles: Cycle if they

449
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.010
Kathryn Bolles: Stay away from me. Don't touch me. I could be sick.

450
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:48.900
Natalie Austin: Funny.

451
00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.860
Natalie Austin: Social history. So you're yeah you're married.

452
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:56.970
Kathryn Bolles: Um, he

453
00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.610
Natalie Austin: What do you do, what's your employment.

454
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.350
Kathryn Bolles: I own a clothing boutique and online clothing boutique

455
00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:05.820
Natalie Austin: That's cool.

456
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.410
Natalie Austin: It's like, do you have to close your house or you sell it.

457
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.550
Yeah.

458
00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:13.920
Natalie Austin: Oh really, yeah.

459
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.590
Kathryn Bolles: We store everything here we

460
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:22.980
Kathryn Bolles: I got the business license last year, but then I started going through, like all of like my medical

461
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.240
Kathryn Bolles: Stuff, like I said, like I was diagnosed with the thyroid and stuff like last April.

462
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:37.380
Kathryn Bolles: And that's right around when I got like my business license and everything in place so it kind of like took a halt, but around like Christmas time is about, like, when it really started up. So, I mean, we're still really small.

463
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.490
Kathryn Bolles: And hopefully we'll be able to, like, move into like a warehouse space and you know

464
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.120
Kathryn Bolles: Or even like open a storefront or something like that in the future.

465
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:52.680
Kathryn Bolles: But right now we just do everything out of our house and sell via like live sales like on Facebook.

466
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.160
Natalie Austin: Right.

467
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.140
Natalie Austin: Stuff like that. Sorry dear.

468
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.160
Natalie Austin: Product from

469
00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.590
Kathryn Bolles: Vendors in Los Angeles.

470
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.710
Kathryn Bolles: So right now it's kind of hard.

471
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.920
Kathryn Bolles: Because a lot of LA is shut down.

472
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:14.790
Kathryn Bolles: But we have a couple of vendors that we work with that are outside of the LA area that are still up and operating. So we're kind of working with them.

473
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:22.710
Kathryn Bolles: Right now, just to keep it going. But business in general is just slower now because, you know, people aren't working, and don't know

474
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.250
Kathryn Bolles: You know, can't get access to their unemployment or, you know,

475
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.870
Natalie Austin: Cash flow.

476
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.710
Kathryn Bolles: Right.

477
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.170
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah. And then that affects us but

478
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:46.950
Kathryn Bolles: We're still selling. So, I mean, that's good. Whether it's a little or you know a lot at least it's still like we're still active. So it still keeps our name out there. Our business out there, you know, for when things. Eventually, I guess you go back to normal.

479
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.780
Natalie Austin: Well, that's really cool.

480
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.110
Natalie Austin: First, we're called

481
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.890
Kathryn Bolles: It's called fired by grace.

482
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:04.980
Kathryn Bolles: Kind of just because of, like, I guess our story like to have grace with people and my daughter's name is Gracie.

483
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.140
Natalie Austin: Oh no play

484
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.910
Natalie Austin: Oh yeah, that is so cool. I'll check that is on Facebook.

485
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.710
Natalie Austin: Yep. Check it out.

486
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.290
Natalie Austin: And use use PayPal or something to buy,

487
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.650
Kathryn Bolles: Right now, we use the cash app. I don't know if you're

488
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:33.000
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, use the cash, you have to invoice because it's just easier for us. But we're as we're getting bigger. I don't know if you've ever heard of comments sold the comments old system.

489
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.110
Kathryn Bolles: It's a

490
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.140
Kathryn Bolles: It's a live selling platform where

491
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:51.720
Kathryn Bolles: Basically they give you like a free website, they give you like an app. So like your customers can download an app to your phone to view like your inventory and then you can go live in the app as opposed to like Facebook or you can do both.

492
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.250
Kathryn Bolles: Simultaneously, and then like when people would claim something

493
00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.890
Natalie Austin: Like, everything is assigned a number and then

494
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:12.600
Kathryn Bolles: It automatically is placed like in a cart for them. And so then they can add their leisure like just go and check out like instead of waiting around for an invoice, sir, and it just keeps track of inventory and

495
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:13.350
What's

496
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.990
What's common soul.

497
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.950
Natalie Austin: Co me aunty. Yep.

498
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:20.520
Natalie Austin: So,

499
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.680
Kathryn Bolles: Ellie And it's all one word. Yep.

500
00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:25.230
Natalie Austin: Okay console app that's cool.

501
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.060
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, it's really cool.

502
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.290
Team.

503
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.210
Natalie Austin: And you've already signed up with them or you're thinking about it or

504
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:41.670
Kathryn Bolles: We're yeah we're thinking about it, we're in the process of it. It's just we don't because of, like, a lot of our vendors being closed right now. Like we don't have a ton of inventory

505
00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.560
Kathryn Bolles: And so we're kind of on a like

506
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:56.640
Kathryn Bolles: Delivery by delivery basis, like when we get something delivered will go live and show it, and our stuff kind of like because we carry really low quantities, because we're still so small kind of sells out right away so

507
00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:02.430
Kathryn Bolles: There's nothing really for us to upload to an app or to a website or anything like that, or at least not a lot

508
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.680
Kathryn Bolles: I see kind of waiting until like this is over to where we can kind of

509
00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.380
Kathryn Bolles: You know stock up on more stuff and then

510
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.190
Kathryn Bolles: It'll make more sense for us tonight.

511
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:21.090
Kathryn Bolles: So that people then can go like if they miss alive sale or something like that. They can go shop on the app or the website or

512
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.890
Kathryn Bolles: Right. Or they want to. Yeah.

513
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.810
Natalie Austin: I say about you can say, you know, 10 left least you'll have your inventory set right

514
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:28.770
Kathryn Bolles: Right.

515
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.750
Natalie Austin: Pretty left or yeah so that way.

516
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.450
Natalie Austin: It's not there. Yeah, yeah.

517
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:34.680
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, and then it

518
00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.860
Kathryn Bolles: prints out all your shipping labels like packing slow

519
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.210
Kathryn Bolles: Down everything. Like, it just makes it makes everything super simple.

520
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.160
Kathryn Bolles: Instead of like manually having to kind of do everything so

521
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.080
Natalie Austin: It sounds really cool.

522
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.850
Natalie Austin: And you said you're a teacher to you have a teacher certificate

523
00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:00.660
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, I do. I have my bachelor's degree in early childhood education.

524
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.360
Kathryn Bolles: And a reading endorsement and then I

525
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.180
Kathryn Bolles: Finished half of a master's degree.

526
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.580
Kathryn Bolles: In educational psychology

527
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:25.500
Kathryn Bolles: And I taught for, I don't know, maybe 10 years, eight years, up until my son was born, and then it made more sense for me to stay home than to send him today care.

528
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:32.250
Kathryn Bolles: Just because of the costumes and we were in a place at that time, like where my husband made enough financially to

529
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:40.920
Kathryn Bolles: Be the only one that worked at the time. And then I just kind of never went back to it. Since then, because that I started after my son was a couple of years old.

530
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:53.430
Kathryn Bolles: You know, I started looking into doing things from home. Like, I tried out different like you know like MLM companies and, you know, things like that, just to make a little bit of extra money like from home and stuff so

531
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.100
Natalie Austin: I already go back and finish your masters.

532
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:57.720
Kathryn Bolles: Oh,

533
00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.280
Natalie Austin: I was like,

534
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.050
Kathryn Bolles: I say

535
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:10.800
Kathryn Bolles: I want to just because it's something that really interests me. I don't. I honestly if I'm being honest, I don't have any interest in going back in teaching, um,

536
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:21.840
Kathryn Bolles: I, I used to like it. And then I went back once my husband went to jail. I had to, obviously I went back to teaching that year.

537
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:32.370
Kathryn Bolles: And I just was I wasn't a huge fan of it anymore, but the the educational psychology part of it and working as like a school counselor.

538
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:39.300
Kathryn Bolles: Even in like a high school setting or something like that, like, you know, helping kids like figure out what they're gonna do for college or

539
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:53.070
Kathryn Bolles: You know, things like that that interests me more than teaching. So if I were to do anything, you know, that would be what I would want to do if I were to like go back like to work outside the home. So yeah, I'd like to say I would

540
00:45:53.580 --> 00:46:04.080
Kathryn Bolles: Want to finish it. But again, money is a factor in trying to to finish it, but I thought about doing it just like online and just slowly like one class at a time.

541
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.110
Kathryn Bolles: You know, if it takes me five more years to finish it, but

542
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.870
Kathryn Bolles: At least, I would still have it and then

543
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:13.380
Natalie Austin: Yeah, just because you put off the work into it already.

544
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.150
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, that's all like

545
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.850
Natalie Austin: I put so much into it already, you know,

546
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:19.230
Kathryn Bolles: Like

547
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:19.950
Natalie Austin: A lot of work.

548
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:20.910
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, I

549
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:28.320
Kathryn Bolles: Did it up until like I had my son, and then I plan to only take one semester off like because he was born in July.

550
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.690
Kathryn Bolles: So I plan to take that fall semester off.

551
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:42.960
Kathryn Bolles: And then I kind of just never went back well because then after that is kind of to, like, a year after that is kind of what things with my husband started kind of going down hill, though. Yeah, yeah.

552
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.500
Natalie Austin: And you were alone for three years when he was in prison. Right.

553
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:47.370
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah.

554
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.540
Natalie Austin: The men tough.

555
00:46:48.930 --> 00:47:00.570
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah, it was horrible because we lost because like he was the sole like income provider. So we lost our house. It was foreclosed on like all our cars were repossessed.

556
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:21.630
Kathryn Bolles: Like we were basically homeless, like we had to basically start over from nothing like at one point I honestly was just like, I didn't know what to do. And I put what we did have left as far as like our clothes and things into a rental car and we moved to North Carolina and

557
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:22.800
Kathryn Bolles: Because I

558
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:29.550
Kathryn Bolles: Was I had a bunch of like teaching interviews down there because they're more native teachers like down south and up here.

559
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.750
Natalie Austin: Yeah, they are repayment.

560
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.060
Kathryn Bolles: Okay, a lot better.

561
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.590
Kathryn Bolles: So,

562
00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:42.540
Kathryn Bolles: We went down there, you know, for a while and then like a hurricane season came around, because we lived in Wilmington.

563
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.570
Natalie Austin: Yeah, pretty good. Right. And we live there. Right.

564
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:48.690
Kathryn Bolles: That same summer that the hurricane came through and the

565
00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.880
Kathryn Bolles: Hurricane actually took out our house.

566
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.630
Kathryn Bolles: But we had come back. We weren't

567
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.380
Kathryn Bolles: There like

568
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.100
Natalie Austin: Wow, good.

569
00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:03.420
Kathryn Bolles: But we had come back right before because I was like, I'm not saying down here, like when there's hurricanes going on. So we kind of came back to Ohio.

570
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:09.060
Kathryn Bolles: I did stay with my parents for a little while and then you know the hurricane happen. I was like,

571
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:23.310
Kathryn Bolles: I can't do that every year that's gonna happen like and so then we just decided to stay here and I got like a small apartment and not so great neighborhood. But now we're out of it and we live in a nicer house and a nicer city.

572
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.950
Natalie Austin: Good for you, you accomplished a lot

573
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:27.690
Kathryn Bolles: Yeah yeah

574
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.880
