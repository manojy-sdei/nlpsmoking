iPhone: We don't talk

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And he, but he gets that you, you're gonna have your own room, he gets that

43
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.820
iPhone: I've expressed it

44
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's like you'll deal with it when it happens, closer to the

45
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Time.

46
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.080
iPhone: Yeah, yeah. Because there's no point in trying to talk to him right now because

47
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.380
iPhone: It's just

48
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.520
iPhone: He's just gonna blow me off like he always does.

49
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So just, you're just going to move the bed in

50
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you have another bed. Do you already have what you need.

51
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.660
iPhone: No, I've been looking for one

52
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.660
iPhone: Part of me is like, I'm just gonna take my bed, and he could figure it out.

53
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.730
iPhone: I'm guessing for the first

54
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.160
iPhone: Few days when we don't have another better. I'm gonna have to, we're all gonna have to sleep in the same room on the same bed.

55
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there people in your family that are about to update any way.

56
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It can pass

57
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.720
Down.

58
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.800
iPhone: Actually, I think.

59
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.270
Really

60
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.400
iPhone: How

61
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:10.800
iPhone: My uncle is upgrading and he's doing his best to my grandparents and my grandparents his bed is pretty comfy.

62
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go.

63
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an idea.

64
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you could already have it stored at the apartment.

65
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Have it around.

66
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

67
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.900
iPhone: I'm busy. You're gonna have to wait. Okay.

68
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, he's not feeling

69
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't appreciate that much. So I'm just curious. I've got I'm looking at your relapse prevention plan here and keep adding more and more to it. But I will say there's

70
00:07:52.860 --> 00:08:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No one listed under people I can call if you are starting to have a craving is there someone you could call just to get your mind off of it. Get your head straight kind of thing.

71
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You can always have me, I always want to be a part of that. If you ever want to reach out, you can text doesn't mean I'll always be free but at least you know you can

72
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But who else

73
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were like, Oh my gosh, all they want to do is use right now, even though you may not like that you're having the thought the thought still may come and I want you to feel like you have somebody that you can talk

74
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

75
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.060
iPhone: Have no idea

76
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that say about the people that you are hanging out with

77
00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What

78
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.800
iPhone: I don't really have those thoughts.

79
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.140
iPhone: But I don't

80
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's not the answer though. See that's that's living in the wish that I'll never have them. But that's why this is called relapse prevention.

81
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Prevention so

82
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Hope.

83
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.710
iPhone: I would really have to put myself in that mindset. Like I wouldn't really have to be

84
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.460
iPhone: Close to the edge in order to even

85
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.230
iPhone: Have those kind of

86
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.440
iPhone: Thoughts, I'd have to put myself in that mindset and

87
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.490
iPhone: Figure out who I'm gonna call

88
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Would it be

89
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Who could snap you out of because oftentimes

90
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because notice right now you have a home your baby's safe, fine. Everything's fine. This isn't when

91
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The proverbial duty hits the fan. It's when it's not fine. That's why we write these things down. That's why I have this continuing to develop because

92
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're at your worst got to be able to look at it and say, Okay, I'm not thinking straight. Now, what do I need to do. I just need to do everything on this list.

93
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And it takes a lot of effort because once. Your mind's made up once it's headed down that track.

94
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't want to reverse someone, it's going to be looking for this little spray of dope. I mean, it's going to want to finish. That's the answer. It already feels good, you starting to think about it.

95
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just the way the brains wired. You're gonna, it's going to take quite a force to get it to shift back. So let's think again.

96
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe this is what what can focus today is look how difficult it is for you to think of someone who you trust.

97
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.820
iPhone: I mean, I could think I know who I can trust, but I just don't want them to freak out.

98
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you

99
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.650
iPhone: Make my older brother.

100
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that's

101
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.400
iPhone: Know my oldest brother.

102
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What's his name.

103
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

104
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I can roll my R's.

105
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

106
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want him to freak out. So is he a square like he's never done anything and and he was shame. Your something

107
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.230
iPhone: No, but he's like

108
00:11:53.250 --> 00:12:01.890
iPhone: And we make fun of him for those who are warrior and the family freaks out for me to keep the oldest she's always been

109
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.960
iPhone: You know,

110
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.610
iPhone: Like she's always had to take care of us we look out for.

111
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.730
iPhone: And my mom so

112
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.880
iPhone: He's the worrier in the family.

113
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: How does he know he is the warrior she know that and kind of laugh at it. Can you laugh at himself.

114
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

115
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

116
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.130
iPhone: I mean we why we laugh at them.

117
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But does he you know like

118
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I know things about myself that like in my own family that I can laugh at that maybe I wouldn't really want anybody else to laugh out but in my family. It's okay, I can make fun of myself. Like, does he know he's the warrior.

119
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

120
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.890
iPhone: Yeah yeah it's established

121
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So yes, um,

122
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice that at your worse, like right on the edge.

123
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You put into question whether you would quit his freaking out, even though this he knows that's what he does.

124
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's good at it, he's practiced at it. He does it every day. Does it for all kinds of people in the family and at your very worst right at the edge. You would prevent yourself from reaching out to him.

125
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't want to freak out. So let me understand that a little bit more. What is freakout look like. And now let's take metaphor out of it really be specific. What is when he's freaking out. What is he actually doing.

126
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.990
iPhone: I'm

127
00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:01.770
iPhone: I feel like it would make them jump into action like let me go pick you up. Let's talk or let's go out to eat or something.

128
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now. What don't you like about jump into action.

129
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:17.040
iPhone: It's not that I don't like it. It's that he'll be so upset that he'll tell me man and man.

130
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:32.580
iPhone: They'll just make a really big deal out of it. I guess it is a really big deal and like the whole family will get together and they'll talk to me, you know, and then they'll start looking out for me.

131
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So on one hand

132
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica, I am my jaws dropping like you have an amazing support.

133
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: System. I wish everyone had that

134
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish everyone had the ability that they would stop the press. Everyone huddle. Let's go take care of Jessica.

135
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.380
iPhone: That's

136
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.480
iPhone: True. That's true.

137
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that I can think

138
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that I can think of any clients that have that

139
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And the very thing.

140
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The very thing that you don't want is the very thing that could save your life.

141
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: On some level, that family support knows your life is at stake, the very thing that you like about have this nice relationship with my son. I have unable to put money aside so that I can do this for this second second room. All of that is possible because you're staying in your recovery.

142
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a significant event when you're starting the mind is starting to go

143
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.710
To

144
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Your get it.

145
00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna go off the edge.

146
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how much pressure, it takes to get that to back off your whole family rallying

147
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I had no idea. You're gonna tell me that

148
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really cool.

149
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.950
iPhone: It is when you put it that way.

150
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.680
iPhone: But then then with that will come like

151
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:34.440
iPhone: Be able to be a burden to be on my own like leave the house on my own and

152
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.450
iPhone: Have nothing

153
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's really. Let's see how true that is just a reality testing.

154
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you the same woman.

155
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That you were three, four months ago.

156
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

157
00:16:51.990 --> 00:17:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's not all or nothing. Maybe you're still because you haven't read. We were in a moment when we're having a we're contemplating we're thinking

158
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: My life is so difficult. This is so awful. I want to escape.

159
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome.

160
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:34.800
iPhone: I was just thinking like, I know what I remember what that feels like. And I'm like, and it's like, Okay, I have these $20. You know, I don't. All it would take is like, like this one time and that's like, I remember what that feels like. And I

161
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:46.530
iPhone: I can say that I have those thoughts. I can't say that. I'm like, oh, I have money like the first thing I think about when I have money is like buying makeup or something.

162
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That is wonderful and I don't mean to diminish it

163
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But you were on an opiate right now.

164
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So what this is doing what we're doing right now is trying to deconstruct trying to take all the little moving parts.

165
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And make it possible, so that when

166
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You have either a significant stressful event or when you decide to go on a taper off protocol which you're not on but maybe someday you might that you have these additional skills and that we have confronted

167
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The potential moment where you have an actual craving that it's they're not

168
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: They can come literally come from a smell. It's not like you're going to be planning it they can come out of nowhere.

169
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's convenient that you don't have the thoughts but it's kind of wishful thinking to thank you never will. Okay.

170
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back. I remember why I lost my train of thought and had to do with this concept of you're not the same person anymore.

171
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: If

172
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A book, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. I won't have my money. I don't understand what you mean by oh you don't understand if everyone gets involved in my life. I won't have my money anymore. What does that mean, what does that mean

173
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:25.530
iPhone: But they won't let me carry money anymore. And like they'll look out on that to make sure that, okay. Well, she said that she wants to do this in order to do this, you know, just like, oh, look out for me, Mom.

174
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.170
iPhone: Will be like okay she can't have money on here because we

175
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.010
iPhone: Show going show you, she can't be out by herself.

176
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.860
iPhone: You know, because she she already like said that she has that intention and

177
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me let me understand this. I have a $300 sitting in my checking account, they're going to go to the bank and remove it all, you know,

178
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:04.800
iPhone: Or when they'll probably not, but tell me how it gets done. I don't quite get how they take all your money, how they hold it. How do they

179
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull that off.

180
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:12.150
iPhone: I don't know. Probably they would probably just take my card or something and not let me be by myself.

181
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: They would take your credit card.

182
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And they would stay at the house.

183
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when really what is it that you need.

184
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So substance isn't going to fill it.

185
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, if we've been seeking this chemical solution to a psycho spiritual problem. What is it that you actually need. Do you think

186
00:20:50.340 --> 00:21:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well access and, you know, like people that are starting to slow down from or quit altogether smoking. I tell them, put it in the trunk of your car, get it out of

187
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Convenience. So what that does. If your family is saying, well, let's let's make it less convenient, so that you can inhibit which means stop the impulse

188
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's right here, the likelihood of me doing it is higher, because I don't have to think it's right here. I don't have to question what i'm doing those few seconds that it takes to actually do it.

189
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So what that family idea of putting some time. That's what they're doing when they take your money is they're saying this is

190
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: No longer convenient, but the part I'm asking you about. How are you different. How come you can't say to them.

191
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What it is, you need hey you know what guys ticket for a week. But if I'm clear headed

192
00:21:54.690 --> 00:22:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth is I'm going to find a way. No amount of you taking the money is going to do it if I've already made up my mind. Yo, I love you guys, but

193
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it is inconvenient. I'm going to get it done so in a week. You guys can kind of make it inconvenient for me on the week thing is made up number. You do whatever you want.

194
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just a random number. But the truth is, guys. If I really have made it my mind. Ain't nothing gonna stop me.

195
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

196
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you see

197
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You might

198
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a runny nose.

199
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That was adorable.

200
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: No way that you know he did, he did.

201
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Runny nose prevention, he got in there before it even got running

202
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Cute little

203
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:51.720
iPhone: Cute. Yeah.

204
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

205
00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back. How are you different when it comes to assertive communication that you are not

206
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Pass for

207
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you got some skill. Yeah.

208
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh boy. Now you've done it.

209
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's that tissue. Where's the tissue.

210
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication, you know that term, right.

211
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So how can you speak, you don't lose your rights, just because you're in a vulnerable moment and you're on the edge, still a woman that has rights.

212
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You knew enough to say it out loud.

213
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were really if you really made up your mind. You wouldn't tell a soul.

214
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

215
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.800
Someone might stop you.

216
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you more assertive than you used to be or hasn't really not changed too much.

217
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.620
iPhone: Like I can be assertive, but

218
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's let's do another reality test.

219
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your family knew you were using correct

220
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it that they're not controlling your money over at your house. Now, how much time actually passed.

221
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, how much time actually pass right. What's the reality of it. Yes, they were in my face. For how many days.

222
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.730
iPhone: What do you mean, like, okay.

223
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You said, I don't want to tell my brother, my brother will tell my mother and then everybody will be staying at my house. They won't leave me alone. I won't have anybody for how long.

224
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.950
iPhone: I don't know.

225
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.560
iPhone: What you've made, however.

226
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.760
iPhone: I really don't know. I mean it.

227
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.310
iPhone: Okay, so I can communicate with them like a, you know,

228
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.890
iPhone: This was just the thought or

229
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.970
iPhone: This is just like, it's not really that big of a deal. But thank you guys for being there for me.

230
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice scenario just now. Hi, cutie patootie. Huh, that it was knowing that you are not alone.

231
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There are times Jessica when having one of those thoughts like, you're going to go to the edge is so much worse when you think I'm doing this alone.

232
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So just even just even telling your brother and. And what about being able to tell

233
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brother.

234
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I trust you.

235
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not an all call this is not

236
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone needs to rally and come to the house. This is

237
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I just need to tell someone

238
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.530
iPhone: You could get down.

239
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.030
iPhone: Oh, come on.

240
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:30.270
iPhone: Look like

241
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.630
iPhone: Laurie Laurie.

242
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference. So assertive. I heard the assertive part. But what about to your brother.

243
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't lose all your rights.

244
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you ever had a conversation. What about having it.

245
00:27:49.950 --> 00:28:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Currently, like, you know what I'm trying to set up a relapse prevention plan and I want to be able to reach out to you when I'm feeling like today sucks. And I had a thought. But I don't want you to have to call everybody. I just want someone to talk to.

246
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can vent. So I don't go us

247
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's assertive.

248
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about that. Does this sound like I'm speaking like

249
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Martian

250
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:21.660
No.

251
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.940
iPhone: No, it makes sense.

252
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.630
iPhone: Just to have that

253
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:38.220
iPhone: That understanding there right now would be nice to talk to him and tell him that

254
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm putting that's right I'm putting you on my relapse prevention plan.

255
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And my fear is I won't call you because I'm be so afraid that you guys will treat me the way I was when I was using. But this is different. I want to be able to reach out and say, I'm feeling

256
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I know whatever

257
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And

258
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to be able to confide in you. Otherwise, I may not reach out at all.

259
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you not tell Mom, can you

260
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let me share and just listen to me. And in fact, brother. Can you remind me.

261
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Of something. And that's my question number I was saying, what is it that this chemical solution was trying to solve that really isn't a chemical problem.

262
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is it that your brother could remind you of

263
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.540
iPhone: Then

264
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone.

265
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

266
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What else your first what what would felt what would have felt like love

267
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Back then, when you needed something

268
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To make sure that you were okay and taking care of and loved and that you're not alone. What's something else you would have wanted to afford

269
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone. And what else

270
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.990
iPhone: And

271
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.840
iPhone: Enough to me and

272
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You matter. Oh, okay, I get this one I got it in there. These are just too good.

273
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: These are so good.

274
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.320

276
00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something when I'm kind of feeling

277
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Low but I

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Assist. What I want to hear. I want. I want you to remind me. So you're not alone.

279
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I love can you

280
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me that instead of freaking out and getting off the phone and calling mom because I'm not ready for that. I just need to have someone I can reach out to that cares about me unconditionally.

281
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: They can sit with my discomfort. I have to sit with it. Can you sit with

282
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It also can you sit with it. Can you sit with that.

283
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And he may say no. Now here's a right to say no doesn't

284
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Make you think about as we're doing this relapse prevention.

285
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.300
iPhone: making me think about

286
00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.280
iPhone: How truly lucky I really am and

287
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.330
iPhone: And how

288
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.170
iPhone: Delusional I am

289
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:29.160
iPhone: Thinking that it goes. That's why come to mind. Sooner or later.

290
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:30.840
iPhone: And

291
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So that thing right there. I'm

292
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All both parts. The delusional part it's wishful thinking.

293
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody in recovery. Does that one. They think so, you're not alone. I'm just letting you know.

294
00:32:50.160 --> 00:33:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: They think, well, I'm not having a now. And so they project that into the future. And then of course I'll never have it because it would be convenient if you never had it, but that's why we lost prevention planning means we look at the how we look at hard stuff we get ready.

295
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Luck favors the

296
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Prepared

297
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Be prepared for good luck. Sounds good to me.

298
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.390
iPhone: Yeah.

299
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.510
iPhone: Wow.

300
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It was right now. It's now you did another piece of it which fewer people do, which is in the same moment meeting session on your own you. You went to

301
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, I'm a little delusional my thinking. I'm not going to have those those cravings again are not going to have what's called stinking thinking

302
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.800
iPhone: Thank you thinking

303
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking. Thinking that those are. That's the addict voice that you know it's goes by a lot of different names, but either way it's going to send you on that route to oh you're going to feel good. It's gonna sit here.

304
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll be difficult to turn it back around the more we're prepared for it, the more it's written out you could literally like when you're done with us here at the program. I'm going to email this thing that I'm writing and you're going to have it.

305
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just completely. Yeah.

306
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.320
iPhone: That's cool.

307
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Because maybe there'll be a certain phrase Olivia inactivity, that when we're at our worst

308
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that wiring in the brain. The one where you go to use had nothing to do with belly breathing. It's not. There's no it doesn't remember anything about that was just where's that guy down what street well

309
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe I'll just walk by that sharp again you know it's nowhere near any of these neat things that we're learning here. So it's going to be helpful to have it all written out she'll just be like,

310
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Call roll and go look at my real estate and look at my list and just go do it.

311
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And later on, you can say, hey, remind me. Also I matter and tell me to go look at my relapse prevention.

312
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.750
iPhone: Well, because it's kind of like

313
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.140
iPhone: Okay, so whenever I'm like

314
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.460
iPhone: putting away my stuff or getting my stuff ready for the next morning like

315
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:41.070
iPhone: Like I set my stuff up for my future self to help my future self out and then I'll find something somewhere. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, I'm so awesome.

316
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.150
iPhone: So it's basically like doing that right like

317
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.410
iPhone: Setting it up for your future self, just in case.

318
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.720
iPhone: That make sense.

319
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but I like the way you put it

320
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I just got this picture of like a little Easter Bunny, like you're you put these little eggs different places. And then, oh, look at me.

321
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.640
iPhone: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

322
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.400
iPhone: Like

323
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.120
Playing

324
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.210
iPhone: And then when before. Like I wouldn't have even had that resource or

325
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.550
iPhone: I wouldn't have even

326
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:28.590
iPhone: Known to think, okay, well, can I call and a relapse prevention program and

327
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.350
iPhone: Plan. I mean, and

328
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.760
iPhone: So I'm hopeful.

329
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:37.950
iPhone: I'm hopeful.

330
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:38.640
Well,

331
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm optimistic, too, because I wanted to finish my comment.

332
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.470
iPhone: From

333
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're being silly. When I don't even have those sites anymore, right, kind of, shoo, shoo, shoo to What Am I delusional, Chris. I'm going to have those thoughts you went in one session you did that. That's a, that's a big step.

334
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it would be more convenient to think I'll never have to face the dark side of my brain again. Yeah, I would be convenient, but it's a little naive like

335
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't be there.

336
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe me, I don't get any satisfaction of being there.

337
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Prove me wrong, Jessica, feel free.

338
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.450
iPhone: Hey,

339
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it.

340
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.910
iPhone: That's awesome. Thank you so much.

341
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.880
iPhone: You've really helped me out a lot.

342
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just a simple thing. All we did was sort of say, well,

343
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened before. What can we get ahead of to make sure it's those same things happen again. This you are aware of more resources.

344
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.640
And I want to be on that list.

345
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That support network.

346
00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:58.740
iPhone: Okay.

347
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, you know, this is why when you'll hear people say, well, just, just go to a room.

348
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It will say that

349
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a fellowship room. It's a and it's just you just go

350
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Open right just go

351
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Does the same thing that a calling, rather

352
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Than just being

353
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Validated and feel so good.

354
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:32.250
iPhone: That. Yeah, that's something that I was thinking about to like

355
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:39.090
iPhone: I don't know, it's just it's I guess it's like this with everyone that

356
00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:46.830
iPhone: When you hear it from your parents and from your family. You're like, whatever, but from somebody else.

357
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:49.500
iPhone: Or something, you know,

358
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.620
iPhone: Something like that. Yes.

359
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.090
iPhone: Yeah. Cool. Yeah.

360
00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.020
iPhone: Yeah.

361
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:09.510
I like

362
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.910
iPhone: Funny.

363
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yum, made me hungry.

364
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

365
00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

366
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll notice that in group to I'll say you guys talk because I don't have the credibility. I want you guys to talk to each other, you know, it's going to your take it in better than hearing my mouth going

367
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I think you mentioned something about wanting Braveheart helps to sort of maybe

368
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.560
Even create

369
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: A group, and it has it on the back of my mind it's been there for a while to create a group on a actually on a Saturday morning.

370
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a what, there's some challenges to it, but it's back there. So my mind.

371
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.140
iPhone: Yeah, that would

372
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.220
iPhone: That would be cool, because sometimes like something will happen and

373
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.600
iPhone: Then I go all want to share it with someone you know

374
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:23.610
iPhone: Like, oh I accomplished this or I overcame this today and I'm so proud of myself.

375
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.740
iPhone: Stuff like that, you know,

376
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are more than invited you could send your brother message you could send me a message. You can also attend another group.

377
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:40.770
iPhone: Really

378
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.680
Do you want me to do. Yeah.

379
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.710
iPhone: Yeah, that would be cool. All right.

380
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put it on that notebook. So it's in that

381
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.990
iPhone: That same room with

382
00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: All the other stuff. If it's around

383
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.980
iPhone: Okay, yes it is.

384
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.330
iPhone: I always put it in the same spot, but it wasn't there.

385
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.990
iPhone: Bless you. Bless you. Okay, I'm ready.

386
00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, Mondays 9am and 1pm

387
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't go on the same day but exceptions can be made. We just can't, we can't bill for it. So you have to say, Listen, I really want to go. Can you not bill.

388
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I just have to talk with the physician. And we do this whole thing, but the I can do it. I just have to really be mindful about it. So then Tuesday 7am course you know and then 12pm

389
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you want to be come in and brag. You can come in and brag. You did something from seven in the

390
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning and you're like, you know what I want to roll in there until everybody when it is you could come in there.

391
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Let us know Thursday at 11

392
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And Friday at noon.

393
00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say I discourage people Friday at noon only because you're welcome to it, but it's oftentimes it's a catch all group. These are people that are kind of filling in. There's not a lot of group cohesiveness

394
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's not a lot of folks that have quite a bit of clean time in there so

395
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's just sort of superficial in the sense that we won't get deep into a lot of feelings.

396
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Especially more than welcome to go

397
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me ask you.

398
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to speak with our plant.

399
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.930
iPhone: Yeah.

400
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got a plan. So next

401
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Monday at 11

402
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.470

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: will enjoy some tacos.

406
00:43:59.010 --> 00:43:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear you do it.

407
00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:00.990

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.970

iPhone: Say,

411
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:11.310
iPhone: Goodbye.

412
00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see you tomorrow.

413
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.330
iPhone: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Bye.
