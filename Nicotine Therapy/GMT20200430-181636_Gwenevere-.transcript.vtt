00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.620
Yeah.

63
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get this in the transcription. We've got Seroquel and you've been taking the kotel a program that was the one that starts with a Q. How long have you been taking we're going to call it Seroquel. How long have you been taking that

64
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.220
Bianca Garcia: The one with the right is

65
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The one with the cube cube. So,

66
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:45.510
Bianca Garcia: Um, I got it. Um, let's see, since since 25 2020 so that's

67
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what march 25 So Sarah phone's been taken since March 25 2020 psi telegram, which is necessary rise and take it for two months.

68
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

69
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

70
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that's confusing is

71
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see any of the symptoms in here. I'm wondering

72
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering why

73
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Why I don't see them typically I'll see the symptoms inside of the treatment setting.

74
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you may be over these couple months, we've been working together. How are you and I, how are the dynamics between you and I, different than when you're sort of at your worst anxiety.

75
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I

76
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Couldn't even talk to you. One time I text you and I couldn't remember that time I texting. I said I couldn't

77
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.770
Bianca Garcia: Talk to you that they were to reschedule. That was one of the bad times and then

78
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:13.290
Bianca Garcia: When I first started, I really didn't want to like talk as much as I am now, I guess. I don't know why I'm not really been talking in group so much, but I have opened up more to you.

79
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.220
Okay.

80
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's stay with that one a little bit longer.

81
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So you had a panic moment he had a high GPA hi distress experience, but you didn't log in to meet with me so I couldn't see it.

82
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.350
Right, yeah. I couldn't even manage to do that.

83
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What so just trying to reflect back on that episode.

84
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you end up texting me. Was it

85
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Before five minutes after an hour later, two hours later, I can't remember. Do you remember how

86
00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:04.140
Bianca Garcia: I think it was like right before, possibly, and I could explain to you what was going on. And we did talk about it.

87
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.930
in Bali table.

88
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.890
Bianca Garcia: Session, we had

89
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've got something on Friday. Hey, Glenn, I'm having a hard time with my baby non stop crying and father not here today to help. I should I go to grew up regarding regardless

90
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:49.080
Bianca Garcia: PROBABLY MET regardless. No, I did go that day I went at 130 and I was just asking you use it to

91
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Track with you that way. So,

92
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.760
Bianca Garcia: I did and I just didn't hear anything back. So I just I just went into group and then I'm

93
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:15.540
Bianca Garcia: Dr. All the man was he, I told him we had a 1210 appointment today and he said that it was in at 12. He said it was at 110 so when you confirmed yesterday I was, I was like, yeah, I was pretty sure to talk to him, but he was saying was 110

94
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stay focused on this other this other experience okay state go back in time a little bit because I've got some some curiosities about it, missy to do can't do today. I know about the two meetings.

95
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: When it was

96
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Description. Okay, I think I got something so maybe march 24

97
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So we were scheduled for one o'clock on March 24 and you let me know your time. Let me see, that's about four. So about three hours later.

98
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello, I'm so sorry I didn't even notice the time

99
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Usually my alarm goes off, even though I did confirm yesterday, if you can please see me today. If you have any openings or whenever you schedule is open, please let me know. Thank you. Um,

100
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what's coming over me, but I believe my crock. So notice the first part of this had nothing to do with anxiety.

101
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you hear my, I didn't hear my alarm.

102
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay. Then it goes, then it's a new

103
00:14:47.580 --> 00:15:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so then the second part, then it's I don't know what's coming over me, but I believe my chronic anxiety and panic disorder is taking over. I need to do something about it.

104
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you wrote, right, I need to say something about it, call virtual clinic to reschedule. And then you put a hand sign

105
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:13.350
Yeah.

106
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So then, later in the day. I can't get my prescription at all. The lady at the virtual clinic said yesterday.

107
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: They would send it in. And I'll just go to Friday group is normal, but I'm going to wait on it. Once again, can you please have your own and send in my prescription and i'll see you to Friday and you can schedule with me and any day. No problem, if you like.

108
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just please let me know. For our individual meetings. Thanks.

109
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you very, very much.

110
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

111
00:15:51.630 --> 00:16:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just cover just some norms. It's fine. If so, there's plenty of times when people are in a high distress moment and it happens to align up with an appointment.

112
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not supposed to be at your best when you show up for treatment.

113
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You. This is treatments.

114
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact, it would be better for me to see what panic looks like on you. I be able to have been able to see it. Yeah, that's probably what I don't want you to see.

115
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. So, well, let's talk around it a little bit because there must be some belief that you have about yourself that I'm sure I don't have it. But if we don't take a look at it, it might stay there. So what is it that you think you're doing when you're in a panic moment. That is unacceptable.

116
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me try. I can try again. I could say, what is it that you're doing in a panic moment that you don't want me to see

117
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:24.330
Oh, oh yeah just probably the way I'm acting the way that I feel a cat, you know, just like how I am right now. Like, I can't just chill or

118
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:37.290
Bianca Garcia: Like I just felt like I can't focus or or my thoughts are running. I feel like I wouldn't be able to talk to you about it.

119
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, like when I'm my okay got it really helpful. So now let's let's investigate a little further.

120
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: In a panic moment where your babies still around your kids were still around, right.

121
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: They

122
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Were still cared for. They're still eating. Maybe there was nothing urgent which you were still taking care of them right yeah I've managed with that like to bear always took your voice just

123
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:29.400
Bianca Garcia: Did all I like in my head. Sometimes, and then if it gets really bad. Then I walk to myself to the restroom, or wherever, or go to walk.

124
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:48.900
Bianca Garcia: Quick yard. Again, whatever it is, or the breathing in the bathroom like when I'm like, so I could move away from them and they'll be fine, they'll be in the room watching TV or a class or sleeping, whatever it is, and I just feel like I just need to calm down alone.

125
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:49.950
Yep.

126
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's interesting is

127
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not any different than all you would have to do now, there's some logistics to logging in. There's some logistics to that that are maybe more complicated than what I'm about to say. But in here. You could literally be crying the whole time. And that would be fine. You could be angry.

128
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be saying things like, I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I can't, I don't know what to say. I feel so disorganized. I feel overwhelmed. I know what's going on. You can be however you want to be. It's a very unique privilege to have this Tele health go into your home.

129
00:19:46.320 --> 00:20:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So you are missing out on an opportunity that a psychiatrist that doesn't do till the health. They can't see, they can't get in real time. We had a great opportunity to actually see how maybe I could have been helpful right in the moment.

130
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah, we

131
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted to do that for some reason I'm scared to show that. Uh huh. Yep. I do see her through the computer, too, though they do.

132
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but this has to do with timing. So now that you really hopefully get

133
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There's even

134
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You could even call me. And you could say, or tax whatever or go into virtual clinic. And you could say, I feel terrible. I'm a mess. I'm very emotional.

135
00:20:40.920 --> 00:21:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to check in after and hopefully they would make an exception if they didn't, then you could log out. But for you this next piece this next step might be just to test this theory, you have which is it's not okay for you to be a mess in public for anyone to see you like that.

136
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's not true. This is exactly what this treatment is for is for people that are feeling overwhelmed.

137
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And

138
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you are a woman of few words as it is. So it would be useful for me to have been witness to have been there and been able to kind of get inside your head and and to have been able to tease out

139
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What was going on right before that was there two babies that would they were refusing to listen to and you were already tired and you were hungry and someone had already insulted you, I wouldn't want it to seem the context of what preceded that panic.

140
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.920
Keep that in mind, I don't want to shy away from the problem.

141
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.130
Is just, I guess.

142
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.700
I don't know what it is. I can just being shy or embarrassed.

143
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.140
I don't know.

144
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:31.890
What I mean obviously we don't want to be like, oh, this is like show everybody or exact problems, even though that's what it's okay, I understand that. But I think anybody wouldn't want to

145
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: See let other see themselves like that. I mean, even though this is what it's for. But, you know, just, let's just straight. Let's do the first part, let's stay with the first part.

146
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're wondering if I think it's normal for us to hide the worst parts of ourselves. Yes, of course. It's normal.

147
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:53.670
Yeah.

148
00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But you do it like to a really high degree you miss out. You miss out on the healing nature of what this therapeutic relationship can be you're robbing yourself of real support because somehow you

149
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't think it's okay to be a mess. Yeah. You can be a mess.

150
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: In fact, it's more useful. In fact, I have clients, where I say show up to group a mess because you're working so hard to make this impression that you've got it all together.

151
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to get in the way of you really receiving the healing effective what what therapy is therapy isn't just advice I give, I like to think I don't give advice. Actually, it's actually believe it or not, it's what's going on in here.

152
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you are not bringing your natural self who you really are. Then I don't get to really know you

153
00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:58.920
Know,

154
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.150
I'm scared of us, but I think it is. I'm just

155
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.350
I guess I

156
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:21.060
Bianca Garcia: catch myself is, show me for whatever reason. I don't know why I'm just weird like that against but I've definitely tried to do that because, obviously, that's what I'm here for.

157
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to get there, but a little difficult for me. Yeah. So remind me. Do you have a lot of siblings.

158
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:43.500
Bianca Garcia: Well, I am the oldest two to three on my mom's side and then my dad side like I don't even know any of them.

159
00:24:44.670 --> 00:25:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the oldest of three. Did you say your oldest of three yes on one side and then there's a group of family that you don't even know very well. Yeah, but I know I'm the sole second oldest on his side, then I have younger siblings and an older sibling that I have. I don't even know.

160
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But she was the oldest um when you grow up, we use the elder sibling, the way you grow up, yes.

161
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think back to being a kid, you know, when you were a little girl are you responsible for your younger siblings sometimes. Yeah.

162
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How many, how many more years old are you, and then

163
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:49.770
Bianca Garcia: Well, me and my sister five years apart and me and my other brother are 14 years apart and then me and my younger brother are 19 years apart.

164
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have a

165
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're they're older. Your 14 year they're older than you.

166
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: 14

167
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.750
Bianca Garcia: Years Younger

168
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my god. Okay, let me see if I get it. You are the eldest of me see over here. I gotta get the ages together.

169
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So is your sister like

170
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: 26 or 789 30

171
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn 28 April 10

172
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's 93132 so she all she's about your four years old so sister 28 your brother is

173
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.460
Bianca Garcia: He will be 19 so he's 18 right now.

174
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then you have a 19 year difference with another sibling.

175
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:19.980
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, he's a 13

176
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: How much of it. You know how I said that there were times maybe that you were taking care of them, how the how much

177
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: How young, were you when you were basically babysitting.

178
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:57.900
Bianca Garcia: Um, well, I remember why I didn't babysit my my my five year old sister, because now that she turns 20 I'll be 33 but when when she was like six or something. I was like, like 12 or 11 or something like that. So I didn't babysit her

179
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:10.560
Bianca Garcia: But my younger brother, when he was like board. I think I was like 14 and I would like watching him when he was like one. So when I was 15 I would like watch him here and there.

180
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:27.300
Bianca Garcia: But or help out a lot. But then, with my younger brother, I was already like an adult. And so I would help out with him to like you would come over a lot play with my kids and because my daughter and him are the same age.

181
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So yeah, so he I would you know you come over and OR I'LL TAKE HIM OUT, or we would go do stuff he would come to stuff with like our family. My kids.

182
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just FYI. This this connection, we have today is is not 100% so there's a little bit of delay.

183
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: In like I won't hear you every time.

184
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This the psychiatry.

185
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: At the University

186
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: University. Yeah. No. Okay.

187
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.040
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I got the universal constantly

188
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

189
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Universal so I wrote University, but it was universal. Yes. Okay. And are you seeing a counselor over there.

190
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.320
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

191
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

192
00:29:52.110 --> 00:30:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I was already seen her before I started a program with you guys. I know. So here's, here's the thing. I'm

193
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

194
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That I said can have two guys I tell everyone because it's it's a problem.

195
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So at the time.

196
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: On February 22 you said I need to get therapy. I'm on a waiting list so universal

197
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: made aware, she's now receiving therapy and no concurrent psychotherapy treating the same mental health conditions.

198
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This woman verbalized understanding, she will receive services from bright heart health psycho therapist. So just the opposite of what you just said.

199
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

200
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. I have it, it's so important that I literally wrote it down because you can't have two psycho therapist at the same time.

201
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:13.920
Bianca Garcia: No. Well, I'm I am like there's. Okay, so there's the medication management and then there is a therapy, but that were you like, how we talk so I

202
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:33.960
Bianca Garcia: Don't talk as sit was there for an hour, like I do with you. She's managed him a pain medication management and um, and then, you know, now I am on the waiting list to have the therapy like to talk like this. So, there is a waiting list for that.

203
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So do not little like just

204
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:44.670
Bianca Garcia: Not like how we do meeting, but she so we about the medication and how it's going and blah, blah, blah.

205
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm concerned.

206
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm concerned. I'm still not quite communicating the concern.

207
00:31:51.870 --> 00:32:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't have both. Yeah. Think of it like this and I'll do it as many times as is to make some some so that I make sense.

208
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture you're getting an opiate prescription from Dr. Solomon and then you're also getting a prescription from either universal for the buprenorphine and they're both treating you

209
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's illegal.

210
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

211
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. No. Okay, so that's reason why February 22 I was so careful about my note because it's that important.

212
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was very anything then when I told you about it. I told you what medications. I was on

213
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not talking about medications right now so I'm glad I'm still talking because I can tell by what you just said about medication.

214
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That you still don't understand. Let me keep going. Let me keep trying. So let me tell you what I just did. I just gave you

215
00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A metaphor I was giving you an example of what conflicting treatment. Looks like I was giving you an example. Yeah. For example, you can't have two DOCTORS PRESCRIBING clonazepam

216
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay hold on to that it is the same.

217
00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: As psychotherapy, you can't have to treating the same person treating the same diagnoses.

218
00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, most people if they've never really had psychotherapy before they don't know that. And I don't think you knew that either except on February 22 I was really careful about explaining

219
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't have to because I knew I could see you're on a waiting list and you're saying it again today so I still don't think it's making sense or I'm failing to say something and I don't know what it is.

220
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I was just making it

221
00:33:50.730 --> 00:34:08.520
Bianca Garcia: Clear that I'm I mean obviously I don't I been on that list, way before you guys and I, they would call me. Obviously, I would not take it because now I know, but I'm making it clear that I was, I was not like seeing her as I see you

222
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.360
Bianca Garcia: But I understand what you saying yeah

223
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But okay, yeah. Okay. And remember, we're on this really slow.

224
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A Tele Health Day. So it's making it really difficult so hang in there for it. We're going to get all the way through it. We're almost there. So all I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit more information to that note so that were

225
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Spot on. And there's no confusion. So in your own words, what's your plan with I'm still on the waitlist at Universal. What's your plan and I'll write it down so it's real clear

226
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:54.390
Bianca Garcia: Well, obviously I'm not gonna do that. I mean, it's been so long. I don't even I'm even got any calls from him, but I obviously if I would, I would not do it.

227
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

228
00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.980
Bianca Garcia: I was just telling you what you remember from the past.

229
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.430
Been a long time, actually, that I

230
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Was waiting. Mm hmm.

231
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's check in. Um, so here's what I wrote. But the problem is with the word it, it runs the risk

232
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Of still being confusing. So let's plug in some some subjects or objects into it. So we're almost there. I'm not going to do that. What's the that I'm, I'm not gonna do when you said the waiting list. I said, I'm not going to do that. So I was just answering your question. I know I'm

233
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Universal counseling. Okay, got it.

234
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, perfect. And I have not

235
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Been getting calls because you've been on happiness for quite some time. And let's just leave it like that. Perfect. So now we're totally clear

236
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's get into what this

237
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: misunderstanding between us felt like that was a big one. Wasn't it

238
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Uh huh. So where do you feeling in your body right now as this man there's misunderstandings happening.

239
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:29.070
Bianca Garcia: I don't feel anything. I just felt I felt a little confused at first. Okay, I don't recall like you saying that I

240
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:45.960
Bianca Garcia: Cuz you I told you I wasn't like counseling with her and I did tell you I was like getting medications for you. I don't recall you saying that I couldn't do that until now, so I was confused. I felt confused, but I understand now.

241
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it surprise you. And I literally read that you had verbalized understanding that she won't be getting so surprised you

242
00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So now you can see why I'm so specific. When I write things down. It's very risky until a health. I've got to be really clear until it gets so both people are very, very, very clear. Yeah. Okay. And so you were really confused like what's the big deal.

243
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand.

244
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:26.970
Bianca Garcia: No, no I well just because like we we agree that I wouldn't do the counseling, but I had told you, since before what medications. I was on and you never said anything.

245
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Hold that thought. Hold that thought. Now, hold up. That word medication.

246
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychotherapy that's. This is not the same as you getting psychiatric medication from a psychiatrist that is great. I want you to get psychiatric medication management, that's a yes the Seroquel and the

247
00:37:53.340 --> 00:38:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What the heck else those patella program that's a yes. Those are not the same treatment. One is psychiatric medication. I can't prescribe medication that's a good thing I'm thrilled that you have it thrilled. Okay, see it now.

248
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes.

249
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. So I'm glad you kept talking because there was still a missing piece.

250
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:22.200
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I'm trying to get clear on me. I was like, because I

251
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Know we talked about my medications before

252
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:32.610
Bianca Garcia: So yeah, that's the difference with with her is some medic medication management.

253
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so the piece that the only problem will be if you get a call, it's going to be. I am receiving

254
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You can call it we go by a lot of different names psychotherapy mental health treatment substance abuse treatment, you're basically you're getting you're getting those things now. Okay, so

255
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're just, I mean we've been meeting for a while and we're still working on getting you comfortable. It takes a minute.

256
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're still protecting this environment from the raw. The, the actual distress that you're in and well I think we'll get there, but this moment right here where you held on tight.

257
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And you held on yourself and got your point across to me. I think it's going to be important. And I'm guessing. Next time, like, hey, I can have a misunderstanding and I can persevere and I can get my point across. I think it's going to be a good piece of work, just this even

258
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You need you think it would be the opposite. Like, oh no, we had a misunderstanding. But that's not what it is, it actually will will bolster a hopefully your confidence that if there ever is a misunderstanding is you will be able to hold on to your truth.

259
00:39:45.720 --> 00:40:04.440
Bianca Garcia: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I didn't see it that way. You see everything differently and you make it clear, and you make it where I could see it your way. Like I could you know work. I see it clear, and I'm glad I did make that you know point across, because

260
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

261
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you almost didn't right you almost didn't say that last bit. Yeah, yeah. You don't give up on yourself. Don't give up.

262
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this ultimately that's what this program is for. It's about wherever in any tiny way or big way. You might be

263
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting in your own way of you reaching the goals you want

264
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to help with that. So let's go back to this topic of what anxiety is and

265
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Depression.

266
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So that day. We already covered. Oh, I don't want to be embarrassed and I don't really want other people to know

267
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you really look like when you're in distress.

268
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is normal. A lot of people get like that.

269
00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But those same people that protect the image of themselves don't benefit from therapy. So you're robbing yourself.

270
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

271
00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep let's keep deconstructing that day. Let's go back in time.

272
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Number. I read that text to you. So it was what memory was like, wasn't it, like one o'clock or something. It was like 11 in the morning 10 so just picture what was going on on that Wednesday. Nope. Tuesday the 24th Tuesday 24th.

273
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's getting towards 11 your time getting 11 o'clock. It's getting to 12 o'clock. What was that day like

274
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.680
Hi. No, I was like, anxious and

275
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.210
Bianca Garcia: I was a little scared at first.

276
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.440
Bianca Garcia: A little more scared of the authority

277
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: At first, um, yeah. So it was it was a lot of mixed emotions. Mm hmm. And now talk about the context of that day. Tell me what that what you had done that day.

278
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:29.790
Bianca Garcia: What have I done that day. Um, well, I definitely missed my employment and I was dealing with a lot of worrisome and and stress and I'm

279
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:53.040
Bianca Garcia: Just everything was happening that day that good. It's just, just a lot. It seemed that day and I just couldn't get myself, I guess, to get like I couldn't control my emotions and everything. And I couldn't be normal to talk to you. And that's what I was scared of. I

280
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't want to be a mess. I guess I don't know.

281
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stick with that a little bit more. Let me hear more about what are the kids doing when they're because you said, Mr appointment, the kids that agenda. I couldn't control my emotions. I wasn't normal

282
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What were the kids doing or not doing that was unsettling Korea oh obviously all kids.

283
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.900
Bianca Garcia: ACT UP SO boy and I

284
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:47.190
Bianca Garcia: Remember them like just not listening and or settling down, they were like yelling fighting like play fighting and just like they were like hyper and I was so overwhelmed that I couldn't control everything that was going on at once. I was like going crazy that day.

285
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just imagine that you didn't have to see me that day. That wasn't on the docket wasn't scheduled

286
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, when the kids play fight and they're hyper and I get what I know what hyper kids look like I know that kids sometimes physically can wrestle

287
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I know they can be running things can be thrown. There's a lot. There's we're worried about them hitting their head worried about something breaking a mess.

288
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We're worried about a lot of things when we're seeing this play fight now they know they're playing, but they're not thinking about all the safety issues that we, as a parent, are

289
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

290
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: In your notice that I just said a story, but all I had from you. Was the word kids.

291
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You may think you're communicating a whole bunch of information, but you're not

292
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's do it again. So I want you to kind of go back in and remember that day.

293
00:44:54.450 --> 00:45:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Where were the kids in What room are they standing, were they on the floor. What were they doing, see if you can try and remember that while they were in my room and they were like jumping on each other and then the two little ones attack the older one

294
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:23.370
Bianca Garcia: And then they're like, pulling hair and they're just jumping kicking and I'm like, you guys are gonna hurt themselves and I'm like yelling at them to stop.

295
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:34.500
Bianca Garcia: I have to go up the little one off from the big ones. And I'm like, stop. That's enough for you're gonna hurt yourself. And when right when that happens. Somebody Christ.

Oh,

300
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's hard. Oh, I don't know. It was probably a good 15 minutes or 10 minutes that they were

308
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:52.590

317
00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: 1510 minutes of that kind of chaos without much noise danger to the kids and would be overwhelming.

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

319
00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:13.410

321
00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will say something like this, much like what you've seen me doing here, don't I say, hey, if you need to go get your kids entertained. Give them a toy. Don't I say, hey, go take care of them.

322
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still going to do that. But the beautiful thing that I get privileged to do is I can hear and see what's Bianca style if she had her wits end. What does she sound like a look like. Has she could I remind her to breathe Take a second

323
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or focus somewhere else I might be able to see from your eyes what that looks like it might be really neat.

324
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this will you go to an office, this, this is not a possibility because you're not with all your children.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Please one kid is hard. I do I have to tell you something. You are just amazing. But she did the amazing part. People think when we get a compliment. That means that we can't lose our shit. Of course, you can lose your shit every parent does

329
