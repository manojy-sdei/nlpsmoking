Dawn Abriel: Program. This time,

19
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.930
SAMSUNG-SM-N920V: I relapsed

20
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.340
SAMSUNG-SM-N920V: And started doing heroin and morphine and oxy cones.

21
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:18.900
SAMSUNG-SM-N920V: And my parents came to me and said, it's time for me to get some help. So I was doing really good on the program last time. So I came to recommit to the program because it was working really well.

22
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.760
Dawn Abriel: What was working about it for you.

23
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.720
SAMSUNG-SM-N920V: The counseling, the groups. The Suboxone as all all it was a good program.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.210
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

25
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.620
Dawn Abriel: My memory is that it was a struggle for you to keep appointments

26
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.190
SAMSUNG-SM-N920V: I was with my grandkids and I'm not now so it won't be a struggle.

27
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.020
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

28
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.680
Dawn Abriel: And at this point, the therapist, you were with before is

29
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.230
Dawn Abriel: She's full. So you're going to end up with a different therapist.

30
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.040
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and a different time. In fact,

31
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.960
Dawn Abriel: We should kind of decide. Let me pull up let me save this. So I don't accidentally lose it. And then let's look at

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.900
SAMSUNG-SM-N920V: Good. Alright so much. See you guys. Friday at 130

So,

314
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:29.010
Dawn Abriel: You do have to give them time to get the order in to package it and I recommend that you call first and make sure it's

Dawn Abriel: So,

320
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.060
Dawn Abriel: Let's go to the psychic impressions and let's put in

321
00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.460
Dawn Abriel: Where it says

322
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:05.250
Dawn Abriel: Oh, it doesn't automatically go to the one you pick. It's got to be

323
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:14.580
Dawn Abriel: PH second pressure initial select every time you go to it. It doesn't save it. Wow. Okay.

Dawn Abriel: Now, I don't see how to do it that way.

328
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.510
Dawn Abriel: To pulse instead

329
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.530

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.990
Dawn Abriel: Okay, maybe we'll try going to mythology.
