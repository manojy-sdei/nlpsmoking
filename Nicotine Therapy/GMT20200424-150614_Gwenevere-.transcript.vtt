00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

2
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.110
Matthew Montano: Good morning. Nice to see you.

3
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: See you. We're going to have a different kind of day.

4
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.240
Matthew Montano: Yes, excited

5
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we take off right where we left off. See if you can identify what you're going to do in here today. That's not going to be the same as last time. What are you going to do in here today.

6
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.590
Matthew Montano: Um, I'm going to

7
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.500
Matthew Montano: I'm going to talk to you more in Berlin give you my soul.

8
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need your soul. You can keep your soul. So you probably you probably still don't know what what went sideways last time, right, is that right

9
00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:05.070
Matthew Montano: I was just that I just thought it was a misunderstanding, because we were doing the evaluation and I kind of didn't think we needed to do that. So I did. I thought I was answering your questions wrong. I really wasn't holding anything back or trying to be an asshole or anything.

10
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what if you were an asshole. What would ask Hillary look like

11
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:19.380
Matthew Montano: Um, I felt like that what you thought I was doing like playing mind games with you, but it wasn't doing that. I just didn't, didn't know how to answer the questions.

12
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: About whether what would look what would asshole look like I just want to know in case we run across it on my side on your side, let's just say

13
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.020
Matthew Montano: Oh, maybe Nashville. I would

14
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.250
Matthew Montano: I probably I probably just be blunt, I'd be like, I don't want to be doing this shit. I'm happy to be here like

15
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.730
Oh,

16
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:56.010
Matthew Montano: I was really, I was really trying. I was. I wasn't like I don't, I'm not wasn't paying like my I took it as you thought I was playing mind games or something or like trying to like cover something up. But no, I just didn't

17
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what is a mind game look like

18
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.660
Matthew Montano: A mind game was my

19
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.010
Matthew Montano: To me a mind game looks like a

20
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.200
Let's see.

21
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.690
Matthew Montano: I would

22
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.350
Matthew Montano: I don't play very many mind games. So like unless that in a relationship by mine game.

23
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.910
Matthew Montano: Like I've been dealing with them. I kind of, I still have been really dealing with the break of my ex because it was our final break up.

24
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:52.710
Matthew Montano: Like I officially decided to break up with him and I'm to show him I broke up with him. I played a mind game with him. I did something bad i i are not necessarily bad. I hope I had sex with his ex boyfriend and

25
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.590
Matthew Montano: Sent him a video of it.

26
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll do the track. Yeah.

27
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.940
Matthew Montano: That's a mind game. Yeah, just to show him just so that he leaves me alone. Also, you know,

28
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

29
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.400
Matthew Montano: Now, but so he leaves me alone.

30
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't work.

31
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.870
And I

32
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.530
Matthew Montano: It, it made him very angry. So he's probably going to try and like

33
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.530
Matthew Montano: I don't know if he's gonna he's probably going to try and do the same thing back to me or something.

34
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:38.010
Matthew Montano: But there. Um, when we try to work it out. The last time I'm I found out some really crazy stuff that might have been going out throughout the relationship. Okay.

35
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, that's probably something you want to talk about

36
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

37
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: There was an awareness last time, and it's still happening in here, there is a misunderstanding and this time.

38
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I will wait for you to figure it out. I'm just going to spoon feed it, okay.

39
00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.490
Matthew Montano: Okay.

40
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's still not it's still my interpretation, though, Matt. There's still two versions of a minimum. There's my version. So I'm going to spoon feed my version and that is this

41
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's recorded the whole session is recorded, and it's recorded where I say, Matt.

42
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to do a treatment plan review today.

43
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know there's a pink elephant. I know because I was very deliberate about how I said it but you had forgotten.

44
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And I said, we're going to review the treatment plan today. It's been over a month. And it took a long time to figure out when that was I looked and looked and looked and I was sometime in March, March 10 or something took a long time looking around.

45
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And I said, we're going to review that you can plan and I went through each goal and really

46
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: tidiness with every single client.

47
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopefully you're here. So hold on to that. Don't say

48
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I do with every single client every single month. Doesn't look the same, but I do it yeah my accreditation right for bright heart health is very happy with that because they want those reviews every month.

49
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The other thing I said was, I'm going to do a treatment plan review with you and we'll talk about the pink elephant in the room a little later. And then we went into kind of really, you may not know what a pink elephant is and then we kind of picked it that and and then

50
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We played a bit of a game.

51
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And your game, in my opinion, was I'm doing my best max doing his best.

52
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.300
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

53
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.510
Matthew Montano: Yeah, and I really do feel like I am.

54
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so hold on to that I am doing my best.

55
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, what did I just say about what we did last session that surprises you

56
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.490
Matthew Montano: That you feel like I'm not doing my best or

57
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I didn't, I didn't say that. I did. I

58
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go. I'm going to do it all over again.

59
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Matt, the last session we met.

60
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you mentioned in here today said, I don't know why you did that reassessment that that that that that hold on.

61
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I did every assessment.

62
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Last session, we met Matt I introduced the entire session together with the following

63
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to review your treatment plan goals.

64
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I do it.

65
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's been over a month and I spent a lot of time looking and trying to figure out, am I right, has it been over a month and I figured, yes, it's been over a month and then I proceeded to go over your goals.

66
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that that is a treatment plan review. It's your goals, not mine, and it is not a re assessment.

67
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You interpret it as something else. And do you know what you did with that.

68
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you do. What was it, what did you do with when I reviewed the treatment plan goals. What what meaning. Did you make out of that.

69
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.340
Matthew Montano: I thought we were starting all over

70
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.470
Matthew Montano: Yeah. And now I see what you're saying you it's something you do

71
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:42.480
Matthew Montano: When you haven't talked to one of your clients in a while. It's just something you do you go over their goals you

72
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:43.950
Matthew Montano: Know,

73
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Not quite. You're almost there. You're almost there. I review my clients goals I review them every single month.

74
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there are times in here when you guys or gals have something so pressing so pressing that I can't

75
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, You know what, let's go through each goal I don't choose to do that. What I do is I kind of

76
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I listened to y'all. And I assess it myself and I make some comments and I kind of write little status reports on it and I don't focus on the goals necessarily that particular session. That's what I do.

77
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We were not. We weren't starting over.

78
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We were reviewing your goals. But notice how for you. It felt like let's find out what was the emotion you felt when you thought we starting over. What was the emotion.

79
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.920
Matthew Montano: The emotion I felt was frustration.

80
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.420
Yes.

81
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What's another larger amplification of frustration. What's another emotion that's big. And then we'll go. We'll talk about Ryan here in your relationship in just a second. Okay.

82
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:17.910
Matthew Montano: It was frustrating and it kind of pointless and kind of was I guess kind of pissed me off.

83
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes. If it turns out that number that asked Hillary thing we were chatting about I don't want to be here.

84
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is a waste of my time. If it is a fragment of it.

85
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it's pointless.

86
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's possible. There was a little bit of it there.

87
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Then the openness and willingness to have hurt the fact that these are your goals like this isn't a reassessment this is these are your goals. Why wouldn't we talk about it.

88
00:10:52.500 --> 00:11:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A resistance to sort of really being open and talking about what the pink elephant in is the pink elephant is our dynamics is this flow that we had for a while, but the flow couldn't happen because there was, I think my opinion. I'm

89
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Not keeping commitment that's it not why I have lots of reasons why I can't keep up commitment. Okay. But I give you those I show up.

90
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I made a commitment.

91
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a commitment necessarily just to another human being. I am a human being.

92
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I am a human. Yes, it's through the screening never met me face to face, but I have a whole other life like I have this whole thing going on like you have a whole work thing going on right I'm a human.

93
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't just you got called into work you affect another human and that human has a lot of other people connected this some human. So this is where empathy comes in.

94
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was missing. It's missing.

95
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.680
Hmm.

96
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:01.980
Matthew Montano: Okay.

97
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I don't actually I don't need a lot of it.

98
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.510
Matthew Montano: With me, yeah.

99
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now it doesn't take a lot because you don't know any of my stories and I don't ever ask you guys to sort of take care of me, but the part where you can show empathy is is to realize it's not just because you've got

100
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Called into work that you don't keep a commitment that affects a human being. It affects her mortgage the time she spends with her other commitments and obligations, the people that she didn't book.

101
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe they really were in crisis and didn't get to meet with their therapist, and that's just me throwing out a couple of random things. So hold on to yourself. That's where empathy can live. That's a space.

102
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It means you take a second and you say, well, what about my recovery. What about my commitment to my recovery, what about this other human being, I made a commitment to

103
00:12:54.990 --> 00:13:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I better let her know or I better really take a look at when I commit to something I share is F better not do it unless I really mean it. And I better communicate it to my workplace that I'm legit. This is a doctor's appointment. It is the same as any

104
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: dental appointment.

105
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But just you'll spend time on your own thinking about how it's really not as important to you. It's kind of pointless. And so it gets dropped down to the bottom of the list of important things

106
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel it because I'm the recipient of it. So that's the elephant. That's the one. And we danced around it and said we had this little volley right

107
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.040
Yeah.

108
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, and so we played a little word game and we danced around. We have some fun and it was a little, little like her. Our. Wow.

109
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:54.360
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I felt like I was being nice. I you I could feel you are

110
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So you think you were being nice. So let's just think about that. Let's just think about the animal kingdom for a second. Well,

111
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.870
Matthew Montano: I wasn't

112
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:10.080
Matthew Montano: I wasn't be nice and the fact that I didn't have empathy that I was wasting your time. I didn't think about that.

113
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, not to waste my time this has to do with

114
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The earlier pieces around. Hey, I got work. I can't show up.

115
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.390
Matthew Montano: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

116
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.580
Matthew Montano: Oh, I didn't show up to those weapons. Yeah.

117
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me so. So here's the thing. Let's see if right now feels different. Do you feel really honest, or is there something you kind of want to say just one more piece and then we're done with this. Is there anything still charge that maybe you want to

118
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about you're saying like her. I was like that. Right. And you were being nice.

119
00:14:45.330 --> 00:15:02.190
Matthew Montano: Yeah, well, okay, I want to say sorry for any appointments. I've missed. I want to say sorry for Miss wasting your time. I now see that you're on. How do you, it's a, what do you say on call, or whatever you get paid by commission or whatever.

120
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I did. I am an independent contractor. So for example, this hour is set aside for a client, I had a cancellation. So I offer a you are on my on call list this week.

121
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So I checked in and this worked out, but otherwise I would have had no one in here. I would have done something else.

122
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So that worked out all the independent contractor. If you ever decided to do something on your own your own thing. There was this thing we want for for anybody. You just pay. It's a paid for service thing and that's it.

123
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:39.060
Matthew Montano: Yeah, you only get paid. If someone comes through yeah and and I feel like that is a huge waste of your time so I

124
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:48.180
Matthew Montano: Suppose I am sorry and want to apologize for wasting those times in the past when I said I all I have, or

125
00:15:48.540 --> 00:16:01.080
Matthew Montano: I was being selfish, because I was thinking like, oh, my work is more important than this and not really realizing that this is your work and I was kind of wasting your time and your time.

126
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You see how it's and you're not alone. A lot of people can't quite make that connection because you know I gotta work well. So why

127
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I didn't knock on your door going hey

Gwenevere Abriel: Y'all y'all came to us.

130
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.030
Yeah.

131
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think you get it was he accepted and I'm sorry I was such a stubborn little shit last

132
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.000
Matthew Montano: Okay, yes. I truly am sorry I get it now.

133
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.560
Matthew Montano: I didn't know why.

134
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:54.900
Matthew Montano: I couldn't get why you were so frustrated and I was kind of like I nervous laugh when you kind of like I see frustrated because I don't know you personally I died. You know, I am so I'm like, so like, but now I get it. It's, it's

135
00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but notice how I actually, I didn't go unconscious. I wasn't so mad. What I was doing was seeing if you could figure it out on your own and I get some more.

136
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Basic therapeutic things like reviewed treatment plan, which is still therapeutic and I did this thing that got us here today, it means that you had to sit with that confusion and sit in it sit and I knew what was going on. The whole time, but

137
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing like experiencing something to really know

138
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That is so I am happy to. I'm dying, actually, to know how you came about with this solution. How this is your solution to do this sex video thinking that he would stop contacting you, I mean really. You really think that or

139
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.090
Matthew Montano: What, what I really wanted to do is

140
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.530
Matthew Montano: Hit the way, hear me.

141
00:17:50.160 --> 00:18:03.990
Matthew Montano: Okay, so we have I since January since are pretty I've given him an ultimatum. I think I've told you about this that you have two weeks to picture act of the things I've been saying that I've

142
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:11.670
Matthew Montano: been bothering me. Are you got to get done my place. He never changed anything. So the beginning of February. He pays rent moved out.

143
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:25.890
Matthew Montano: Throughout February we we went a whole month, not to be together throughout February. I'm very secretive he hide stuff throughout the relationship. I always have that gut feeling to reply things

144
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.090
Matthew Montano: He's really good at it. Yes. No.

145
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:44.580
Matthew Montano: Like okay, I'll go into that later. But anyway. Okay, so after February and cheaper, more broken up march comes along and then we start he CONTACTS ME. And we start trying to make it work out.

146
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:57.480
Matthew Montano: We go straight back into the same shifts, you know, he comes, he over to my apartment. He stresses me out. So the only way. Well, I'm really able to now with them is, if I have a

147
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.340
Matthew Montano: You know,

148
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:10.590
Matthew Montano: Bought the tonic or something if I have some whiskey. You know, just to chill out and be able to talk to him because getting so frustrated if I'm sober will not complete. So

149
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:22.290
Matthew Montano: Take my medicine or whatever. But I'm okay so what the things are going good. He is. He knows I'm going to work one day, so he was when he started saying here again.

150
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:35.010
Matthew Montano: I go to work. He says, Hey, babe. I'm going to take your lunch so it goes and takes me lunch he meets my boss. I'm like, hey, is my boyfriend introduced him to everyone. I work with and then he

151
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:41.820
Matthew Montano: I say, Can you go back to the house clean the apartment Space Jam, nothing to do, because it's not working right now. So he

152
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:59.520
Matthew Montano: Says no I can't. Because I'm going to the grocery store for my mom and and run some errands for her and she's going to pay me dollars a month right now it's not working because of the whole Cogan and then okay so later on that he and then he calls me later on. And he says, Hey, babe.

153
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.550
Matthew Montano: I'm gonna buy. I'm going to buy us a little bit of cocaine and

154
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:22.770
Matthew Montano: Really for him and some liquor, so we can just hang out later on tonight. It was a Saturday. So he bought he. Okay, so I'm happy, I'm cool. I'm like, whatever. Let us theme and then by the time he gets off for

155
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:36.060
Matthew Montano: Some I get off work. I called him. And I'm like, hey, is everything going okay I'm getting off work now and he's all I'm not gonna lie to you. He's all either I'm already off but he's logged I

156
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:47.250
Matthew Montano: Did a lot of that cocaine and I'm drink a lot. He thought he still I'm going to come over and I was like, wow, that's kind of frustrating, but I guess, make it make up your mind. You can decide it through and come over and not

157
00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:57.000
Matthew Montano: So he does come over, but four hours after that. And then he comes. He's even more right so it comes in right he

158
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:11.040
Matthew Montano: He starts are started arguing visa, you can for every damn thing I can do nothing without you get mad and I was like, dude, we have this plan. We are just going to hang out, you actually were.

159
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:25.110
Matthew Montano: Supposed to put food in my fridge, because you eat all my down food smoke so much we've you all my food. That's what the money was actually for it. I didn't mind if you bought your little thing or whatever. So, and then he walks up and slaps me

160
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:38.520
Matthew Montano: I've noticed that this is something that has happened in the past I there's been the first hit ever in our relationship. I hit him first, but then he would start hitting he I had stopped since we've done this Council.

161
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:57.600
Matthew Montano: But I noticed he would always hit me because he knew I would hit him back. And what I have what clicked in that moment is he's doing something bad. So he hits me so that I hear back and then he'll play drums up from the floor play the big

162
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:13.650
Matthew Montano: Hill Hill refused to leave my house off totally drag them out and then he'll be like, you hit you hit me and then him doing all that cocaine and all that drugs turns into me being abusive so okay anyway.

163
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:23.460
Matthew Montano: To few days go by, I think about the situation, I think, hey, in our one year and four months together his mom has never just given him money.

164
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:35.130
Matthew Montano: And if she has given him money. It's to pay one of his loans pay one of his car payments to pay a bill. She has never given him straight up cash. So I tell them I'm going to ask

165
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:43.530
Matthew Montano: I was like that's fishy two texts. I was like, That's fishy. I'm going to ask your mom. He's like, go ahead and ask my mom. I don't care which which you do

166
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:55.590
Matthew Montano: And so I didn't think I would. So I call his mom up and I said hey did Ryan, go to the store for you. Did you give them $100 did he run errands for you, she said, No, I did. He did, or the surf.

167
00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:05.760
Matthew Montano: errands for me and I didn't give them $100 so I kind of put two and two together. And I don't know if he

168
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.990
Matthew Montano: Is sleep sleeping around if he's selling his ass, to be honest.

169
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right.

170
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.940
Matthew Montano: Yeah. And because stuff like this has come up in the past.

171
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:26.760
Matthew Montano: Where he's come up with money, but like I asked him once. How'd you get that money and he's, he said he'll like mumble something. Well, I did this.

172
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:34.560
Matthew Montano: And I was like, what, and he's like, I fucking hate repeating myself and where he won't repeat himself and that's his excuse

173
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:51.750
Matthew Montano: And so what and they're in the past. There's just one thing. We also did like there's a site called. It's where you get on webcam and people watch you, and say like me and him were having sex, and they asked us to kiss or or use a

174
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Mouse and they pay us this week, someone else. The heck is it called

175
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:09.360
Matthew Montano: Chatter bait there. So it's called chatter made the one that we've grown and actually show actually showed it to him. And we just did it for fun and it was we were thinking we're going to make a little extra money off of it.

176
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:16.500
Matthew Montano: Because we did, we made like maybe 100 $200 a month just and we, it's not just us having sex, you know,

177
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.070
People

178
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.200
Matthew Montano: People watch and they tip you if they want you to kiss or whatever.

179
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

180
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.040
Matthew Montano: Yeah, so

181
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:37.410
Matthew Montano: Either you he was selling his ass or he was on that website and ok so the website would have been that bad, but he was doing it in my house.

182
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Without

183
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:48.660
Matthew Montano: My permission or he was out there selling is but exact you know are given a blow job or something because there's no I know him. There's no other way you would have made money could have made that money.

184
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:59.370
Matthew Montano: And then, okay, so he decided one more time. I call him over and I'm said, I'm gonna I'm gonna bring this up. He don't know I contacted this month. So I call him over.

185
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:07.140
Matthew Montano: And then I asked him, I was like I did, contact your mom. And he's like, what, what does she say what does she say I don't care what she said, whatever.

186
00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:16.230
Matthew Montano: She told me none of that was true, and she and then and then you know how to use the bags to stay refuses to leave and

187
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:29.850
Matthew Montano: He's like, what are you going to do about it. He started getting like that he wants. I said that he's like, I need time I need time. I can't talk about this right now, and he runs out the door. Bam. I've caught him in his life.

188
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:35.430
Matthew Montano: I've caught. I don't know how long he's been doing this ship, but it is this gross to me.

189
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.290
Matthew Montano: Out fucking growth.

190
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, okay.

191
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:47.580
Matthew Montano: Yes, it is gross just yeah I'm disgusted in him. And I don't know if he's been doing this on and off through our relationship or what

192
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.560
Matthew Montano: I feel like I'm and then I also going back

193
00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:02.820
Matthew Montano: things we've talked about. He, um, he talked about when I told you guys. He said I HIV. Right.

194
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.190
Matthew Montano: I don't, I don't have a TV. I'm

195
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:15.480
Matthew Montano: On I'm on PrEP. And I will use production. I don't have HIV or anything. I was pretty educated on that. So, and he told me since the beginning.

196
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:30.780
Matthew Montano: That he had that. And I do have tech myself but anyways. Okay, so he said when he found out he had HIV that his mom told him that his dad was molested by an uncle or something like that. And then I kind of

197
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:40.620
Matthew Montano: Put that in my brain and kept it in there and I always thought that was so weird that he, why would she tell him the dad was molested

198
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:56.670
Matthew Montano: That when he guy Jovi what, how does that connect and I started to the maybe Ryan was molested by his dad, and that's why he is such a good liar. But maybe that's why he Hide. Hide stuff so well.

199
00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

200
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That line is a little abrupt but

201
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that we're continuing dysfunctional sexual relationships that we have this sort of unhealthy.

202
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of relationship with with sexuality and and it's like a throwaway

203
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: persona that we front with this is who I am. But really, we're not that that could be that part. Makes sense. That's my population. Those are the people I'm working with.

204
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that line user. Well, that's why he's a good liar. That's a little, a little abbreviated um

205
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:54.030
Matthew Montano: But there's also a lot of puzzle pieces I put together throughout the relationship like he. There was one time he told me his sister, one of his sisters lives here in Roswell. The other to live in Houston.

206
00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:17.760
Matthew Montano: He told me that his sister's husband told him that he was molested as a child, too, but he never told Ryan sister his own life and then it clicked with me. I was like, why would he tell you that and not he's old white. So we're like,

207
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In a conversation or there seemed like there was some sort of alliance in some way that

208
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, would understand and I wonder why because maybe he'd experienced it. Yeah.

209
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.340
I could see that.

210
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Work.

211
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

212
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.320
Matthew Montano: Yes. Yeah, I'm a, I'm a good detective and I always

213
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.570
Matthew Montano: Scorpio thing. I'm always like watching people, you know,

214
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back for just a second. All of that detective work is going on out here.

215
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Around someone you don't want in your life anymore.

216
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:56.820
No.

217
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot of work for someone you don't want in your life anymore. It also takes a lot of energy that

218
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.570
Matthew Montano: I think I

219
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:24.600
Matthew Montano: Was sorry to interrupt you, but I think the reason I did do it for so long is because I could never catch him in a lie, and he would tell me he loved me. And the first time I caught him in a lie. It was like it's out and I did something bad to myself something I wouldn't do

220
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.610
Matthew Montano: I had sex with his ex just to

221
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.240
Matthew Montano: Just tell him I had sex, sex.

222
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's slow down a little bit.

223
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your typical

224
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Justification

225
00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Or when you win an argument, so that's that's the framework.

226
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Your typical justification is when

227
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You're fat check

228
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a an incongruent. See you fact checked called mom fact check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check. OK, OK, OK, OK, gotcha. Okay.

229
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But the thing that I'm inviting is something very different. And that is

230
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: When you feel disgusted.

231
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Check to these different where you're all that detective work is external and what I'm inviting and that's what psychotherapy does is it says look inward. Pay attention to

232
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of drama is this. He's like, Oh, how could you help me and he's laying on the floor and then you're literally like, get the fuck out. You're pulling them out.

233
00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: fact check inside you rewind that you go inside and you say, Could I caught a sign that this is someone who's not speaking their truth they're playing a head game they're playing

234
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: They're playing out some drama, but they're not using words communication to communicate what's going on. Could I have caught this earlier. And then you read detective work you rewind the tape back back back a yes. I said,

235
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I talked to your mom.

236
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there cash that one.

237
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in there. He has a choice. You can be an honest person and he can say

238
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't man alive.

239
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.190
Matthew Montano: It's

240
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Not even. It's not about the line. It's about what he decides to do, he can either be honest with himself and you or he can be a lot in authentic will call it

241
00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: He can play out this little drama and you know I don't even want to talk about it anymore. How could you even do a little bit, and he

242
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.470
Matthew Montano: Needs.

243
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.880
Matthew Montano: I need space.

244
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So that, so that is a distraction that has we're going to label that distraction. Because guess what it does, it gets you

245
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: To be the persecutor you're coming at me and I'm already overwhelmed and leave me alone. Oh, it's too much for me. You're such a bully.

246
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so puts you in the position of a perpetrator and he's the victim and you're like, what just happened. I just told you.

247
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I called your mom, you said you got money from her yet. Y'all need to make up your mind on the story here one of y'all is lying to me. I don't like it. So you have a choice right in that moment.

248
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You can play detective continuing to watch what he's doing, or you can turn that detective work inward and you can say

249
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How's my body feeling about this man's response. Hmm. I detect tension somewhere in the body.

250
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: My stomach's turning my chest short fast for us, maybe it's in the jaw somewhere in there you go. I don't like this feeling. I don't know what the label is

251
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But something's up my body's me right

252
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this over the hedge movie with this little turtle and and his tail would tingle.

253
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So cute. He's like my tail is is tingling. There's something off and he would just know right

254
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I need. Hello. He's got some weren't like they'd be something up. So there's some kind of sign of you that's detective work turning it this way.

255
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So do in to the early signs when someone's being inauthentic around you and pay attention to how that feels. Not only how it feels in the body, but then take a few minutes, five minutes 10 minutes and label it.

256
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I think someone's lying to me. I think Ryan's lane. I'm could be wrong. I feel it like someone's being inauthentic and

257
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:12.630
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

258
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:28.500
Matthew Montano: And I'm, I, I have I have that strong gut feeling. And usually it's right, you write about people you know when they're being authentic with me and that was happening throughout the relationship, but he was just such a liar that I

259
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.190
Have

260
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, no, no. So here's the problem. We're almost there, go back to this one.

261
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a gut feeling I'm usually so good. I'm so good at knowing, notice that

262
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, actually, I think there's something else he would either so attractive to or something tip the scale. I really want a healthy relationship. I want it to be this man.

263
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That you betrayed your gut feeling because you're doing the other one which is I'm looking for evidence is nothing to do with it. If you're telling me your gut had a response. You betrayed it

264
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You look outside for evidence you waited too long.

265
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:20.760
To

266
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Get you to come back in here. Get back to the gut, get back to the gut feeling when you register something. Sometimes it will be off. So what we oftentimes we have a first impression of someone I get them all the time on a daily and

267
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know my intention, so I know I'm in check. But I have to sit through it. I have to kind of Wade my way through it, but I know that we're capable of having a first impression we sit back

268
00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch again. How do I feel, and then we can get new information and maybe we can change your opinion. I want you to go back to gut feeling. How many, how, what was the earliest sign you had about Ryan.

269
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The he was in authentic.

270
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: First

271
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The first person.

272
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:30.360
Matthew Montano: The first he moved into this apartment with me the first month I moved in pretty much she was saved with me every day. And that was this January. That was a year ago, so a year and what

273
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.590
Matthew Montano: A year and three months ago.

274
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:46.440
Matthew Montano: We had some of his friends over. We were all sitting back there. My kitchen table and it was his first one that came over, was his friend zone and one of his best girlfriend.

275
00:36:46.920 --> 00:37:04.080
Matthew Montano: Okay, so this girl brings over this guy that she's supposedly dating and before he got there. We were all kind of chitchat were were like kind of drew Kuma like hey, a lot of these street guys are like by like by furious and stuff and

276
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:13.830
Matthew Montano: So one of the girls like I think he's kind of gay. And I was like, I don't think he's he's when I think he's just like you have like good

277
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:27.960
Matthew Montano: Friends around you, and you might if he's staring at them. It's just like probably like, whoa, this is different. This is weird or whatever. But anyway. Okay, so we get to drinking, Ryan.

278
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:42.750
Matthew Montano: Is I'm sitting extra Ryan that guys across the table from Ryan Ryan is staring him giving him like staring into a soul just non stop just staring at him.

279
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:53.130
Matthew Montano: And I'm sitting next Brian and I'm kind of like shaking his head and he was just staring at him completely zone me out. And then all of a sudden music starts playing. He gets up.

280
00:37:53.430 --> 00:38:03.390
Matthew Montano: He picks up his shirt. He starts showing his nipple and staring at that guy and dancing and then I when I was like I slammed the table and I was like, Dude, what are you doing

281
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:14.310
Matthew Montano: And he's like, Hey, I'm just dancing and then so I tell I was like, Dude, you gotta leave you got to get out of my house so NEED YOU TO GET MY HOUSE AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT AFTERWARD. And I did.

282
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:21.690
Matthew Montano: I'm at the point where I want to get married and have kids and I and I saw the good qualities in him and stuff and

283
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:45.720
Matthew Montano: So I tried to forget this. But it stuck in my head I was like, That is weird. He and he was just like, I'm just free. I just like the waiver. See, I like be free. I, I come home to. You always come home to you. I was just dancing, but he was straight on focus on that guy.

284
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.280
Matthew Montano: That was the straight

285
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.550
Matthew Montano: Ever, ever seen

286
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: label it. What was he doing label it.

287
00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.370
Matthew Montano: He was, he was flirting with that guy.

288
00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And he and you were looking at this man as a potential long term partner, not just this short term attraction relationship.

289
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That he that's not how typically we act in a in a in a group setting when there are long term, right. We're not listening at

290
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:26.700
Matthew Montano: The same at the same time he was telling me all this stuff that he wanted long term heat he initiated the relationship

291
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:40.500
Matthew Montano: I kept telling him. No, you're a few years younger than me. You're not mature enough. I don't want this relationship to be hooked up buddies. I told him multiple times. He would cry bag he would, he would, he would

292
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:57.630
Matthew Montano: He would say, I can't just be your friend. If we can't, if we can't be together forever. I can just be your friend. He would ball. You know, he would put these things into my head. It wasn't my decision to go into the relationship. I thought week and I fell for it.

293
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:00.600
Matthew Montano: So you

294
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.680
Matthew Montano: See what

295
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Master. Okay. We know but that still your part, your part was wanting to believe. So what is it about him. Is it hit. What is he so attractive.

296
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Would like what is it that tip the scale that she said, I want to believe what he's saying versus what your gut is telling you you wanted to believe his words versus his actions and your gut. What was it about Ryan Just see if you can name it, but

297
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:48.990
Matthew Montano: The main thing is is hard. I could see his heart and all the hurt. He had been through, and we both have been through many hardships and hurts and we could relate in that and he was he was very attractive. Okay.

298
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So those are

299
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.550
Matthew Montano: The main thing though I don't just chase after

300
00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Be ashamed of it, for goodness sake, we're visual people so okay we got a name that otherwise it's just will be dancing around wasted.

301
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:23.400
Matthew Montano: Yeah, but at the same time, he was like, definitely attracted to me to like it was real feminine feminine, I was real masculine. He had the greatest sex like we were so attracted to each other. He was all over me all the time and I loved that he

302
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.340
Matthew Montano: was obsessed with me also was another team.

303
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.560
Matthew Montano: It was, it wasn't

304
00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready.

305
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We have we related and sort of that we both were hurt in the same way I might board it differently, but we're going to go with that. We were hurt. We related on that level, he is super hot attractive. I felt wanted. I felt really wanted

306
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: We had

307
00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.850
Matthew Montano: Right, we had a strong, strong connection.

308
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.850
Matthew Montano: Strong sexual sexual connection, both of us.

309
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So those things right there. But you got to look at them. Otherwise you're going to end up in this exact same relationship again.

310
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you pay attention to if you can see that your gut is going to say, this does not look like long term family to do it. It's good. Listen around right and your

311
00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Fuck you. He's hot. He wants me. This looks like fun. I want to do.

312
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So that could happen again. Oh, that's what I'm saying is

313
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Your intuition that gut feeling is going to message you and if you decide to ignore it. Well, then don't blame anybody else don't blame him for being manipulative

314
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm saying, is this the tricky bit and I know nobody likes to hear this. But we all participate in the denial, like, Well, I want to believe what you're saying.

315
00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll believe your words, but every other action of years has been the opposite of your words which are so hot, and I like this part I want it to be true and wanted to be true.

316
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Only you are going to learn over time. There's no amount of me going, standing near yada yada yada. You're going to find out that

317
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: People will do

318
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll do, do you watch this month they did what they said they follow through this month. They didn't said that they felt that

319
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: They could reasonably expect over these three, six months and they're going to do and say exactly what they didn't said three and six months ago. I'm going to share some of my stories with them a little more. I will let them stay overnight right it's slow

320
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It we watch, are you trustworthy.

321
00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: He said, I wonder about you. Matt is because of the early start with you, like the denial of who you were.

322
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Those Miss years of enjoying this stuff you're doing right now like we do that and no school like that's you know I'm saying you didn't get to do that.

323
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:15.900
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

324
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:18.570
Matthew Montano: Okay, that happens.

325
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because you were just like, oh, he likes me so much. And we're just like over heartbroken and we go through all through. But you are in a long denial. Right. You were headed to pretend to your friends that that

326
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: He couldn't go through it the same you had you had this sort of keep that quiet and you didn't get that normal, typical developmental part that

327
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.820
Matthew Montano: At girlfriends, but it was always speaking superficial there's now if

328
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.510
Matthew Montano: There was ever a

329
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:54.660
Matthew Montano: Sex. It was forced yeah with a lot. Yeah, exactly. And I'm dealing dealing with that stuff you

330
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.020
Matthew Montano: Know, like so.

331
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be gentle with that just don't miss label it. Don't say all never have mature love don't miss label it. Try my hypothesis on and say, I'm doing this developmental piece where I'm feeling out that line between will I follow my gut instinct.

332
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Around my core values, which is, I do want you know great sex but

333
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it at a cost of these other morals like hard work and good communication and

334
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Authenticity. Oh, you're going to figure that out. But you had a missed developmental milestone. So maybe you're up to it now and I'll wait it out with you.

335
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But I, I won't blame all the Ryan's because it's not it's not all their fault. If they are you saw him standing at the table all getting hoochie up there.

336
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.870
He was good.

337
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But once you turn all that hot towards me. Why don't you give you some of that hot. You know, so

338
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.830
Matthew Montano: When I was in

339
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

340
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.580
Matthew Montano: And what it was.

341
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:07.920
Matthew Montano: And I try and make excuses for it, but that because I broke up with him for two months of that time.

342
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.240
Matthew Montano: I was, I never

343
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:18.480
Matthew Montano: Seen that I've been to parties, I have boyfriends. We were around a bunch of gay guys and I never seen that happen, and there was only there was a straight news a straight guy.

344
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:28.230
Matthew Montano: And his girlfriend and did that I can only imagine what he would do if we were like at when I when I lived in Albuquerque. You go to the clubs like you know

345
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.480
Matthew Montano: It's just

346
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: He needs individual therapy. He needs a pain in the ass like me. He needs somebody will call him out, pull out if there's that you know if there's molestation stuff in his history. He's got to do some some healing around it.

347
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that that's gonna mess with him for quite a while he's not going to trust.

348
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:53.460
Matthew Montano: That

349
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:54.660
Matthew Montano: If he was

350
00:46:54.810 --> 00:47:03.150
Matthew Montano: If he was molested, and he he hit it, hit it for his dad or whatever, is that

351
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:10.080
Matthew Montano: Will that's what's that just teach us into lie or what does that do

352
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's so funny, you do that you do this line. It's like this direct line.

353
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It teaches in July.

354
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:18.000
Matthew Montano: Right now.

355
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's all the I remember I said it's not a direct line we're not like that. I have plenty of clients that have suffered through these things survivors these things and I would never think of them as a liar.

356
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.150
Matthew Montano: Yeah, okay.

357
00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's too simplified way too simple.

358
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:56.220
Matthew Montano: It's because it's because I know him as an adult and I was in a relationship with him. So like, I'm not, like, Oh, I like I feel bad that that happened to him, but he never he never explained it to me. He never he never and I was hoping

359
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.630
Matthew Montano: To get trust.

360
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So Matt, you're doing it right now. It is so much more pleasurable for you to think about the Ryan's and analysis analyze them. It's so much more enjoyable for you, then, to turn that analysis inward.

361
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you will opt for that one, nine out of 10 times

362
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus hmm

363
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I did it. You talked about middle school talked about a possible developmental milestone, you missed out on, we need to talk about your mother. You haven't talked about, you know, I mean, we haven't talked about dynamics, like that. It is just so much more interesting for you to talk about

364
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside outside that of turning that introspection introspection inward and it'll probably continue to be that way. But it is kind of like, like a 13 year old.

365
00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.410
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I know what you mean it. I know exactly

366
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also have in my memory and we're gonna we've got five minutes. So I want to make sure we have just a few minutes to process what today was okay. So I just want to say one more.

367
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I know so. But I want to talk about one more thing. I also have in my mind.

368
00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, maybe that's what Matt needs to do, where he sits on the couch with therapist. When a beer we sit here and talk

369
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We talk about boyfriends of the day, we talked about my heartache, right. Maybe that's what we're up to maybe on that and you're sitting there and we're talking as if right it's middle school and

370
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What else. Oh yeah, he's an asshole. We hate him. Okay. Who do we like now hair and we, you know what I mean.

371
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's what we're up to. If that's going to be healing. If that's the hypothesis. I'm down for that too. It's a little harder for me cries, right. I'm like,

372
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be productive and it's hard for me to just be this listener, but I'll work through that if it means we sit on that couch right

373
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That missed opportunity where you and your mama sat on that couch and you could go to her, and you could tell her about how hard your day was

374
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't do it. I'll do it. I'll work it out. Okay. Okay.

375
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.840
Matthew Montano: And I also want to talk about maybe next time how

376
00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:37.050
Matthew Montano: I have to have in the past. This time I only hooked up with the only person that hooked up since we've broken up is

377
00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:54.330
Matthew Montano: His ex McKinsey which he's also good looking guy and I feel like in the past I've when I've had these breakups I've abused myself like I went out there and had a lot of promiscuous sex, just to kind of make get my mind off things

378
00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this rough right now because you can't go to the gym and I know you were, you were able to channel that energy to the gym and I know it's inconvenient. But you got to find other things to do with that mind of yours, and with the body, whether it's

379
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what, what can you be physically doing that could feel cathartic where you could say, Okay, I'm still working on on my body. It's this physical exercise.

380
00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, it's not so self destructive.

381
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:28.230
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

382
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Running

383
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Sign up commit to some sort of yoga competition something where you are invested in it and it's got your focus and attention.

384
00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you had this you were going to the gym. Now you can't go to the gym. Is there stuff you could get a set in your in your apartment or something. Can you do something like that or to work out or no.

385
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.300
Matthew Montano: Um, I can start going to run up the track is what a start.

386
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:13.080
Matthew Montano: And I have, I have my friends that come over and we have like movie nights and my girlfriends and we had and they teach an art class. Maybe I could take up in our class.

387
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I like that but but I will tell you.

388
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It does take effort and you think, well, this is this is stupid. Um, I get so much more reward by healing attractive. I'll just go do that that's a quick fix, but it's got a hangover and what is

389
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually

390
00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:35.880
Matthew Montano: On health. It's not making it

391
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:37.500
Matthew Montano: More

392
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing it to a close now bring it down. Bringing it down, look at the time being down. We got to be mindful of time. Yeah. So you're bringing up an entire topic be covered in four minutes and it's not fair to the topic. Okay, so

393
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Another time to meet

394
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:56.790
