Bianca Garcia: Without any treatment or anything.

108

Bianca Garcia: I've done just the outpatient. Mm hmm. Yes.

110
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.300
Chris Alliman MD: And what did you find helpful in that

111
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:24.030
Bianca Garcia: Of the counseling, a way when the doctor, he was my last doctor, he was really

112
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.870
Bianca Garcia: Good with his patients like he had individual care like really good on all of us and

113
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:45.240
Bianca Garcia: And we had to do the counseling and stuff like that. They're at the program. So I felt like that how what obviously did for those four years, it really good. Yeah.

114
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.620
Chris Alliman MD: Have you been doing counseling. Since then, since those four years in Santa Fe.

115
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:58.320

116
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.690
Bianca Garcia: Find anywhere to

117
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:11.430
Bianca Garcia: Go, what would they give you the medication. And you also do it. It's like you have to get to a case of somewhere and then go to counseling somewhere else. So I was a little difficult. Sure, yeah.

118
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.380
I understand.

119
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.690

Bianca Garcia: Five and 11 months.

125
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:47.280
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. The reason I ask is because I'm sure as you know medications like sub you texts and Suboxone can be the just the crumbs, or the residue that's left over is enough to cause kids to stop breathing.

126
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.960
Chris Alliman MD: So we always make

127
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:57.960
Chris Alliman MD: Sure we make sure our patients have Narcan the nasal spray at home, just in case something happens, right. We want you to be prepared for that.

128
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:13.440
Bianca Garcia: Well, I definitely have that I also keep my medications and the Lockbox I don't carry them around. I just take them when I'm supposed to and put them away my kids don't have reached to it, you do not see it. Okay.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.300
Chris Alliman MD: Good. All right. We're going to run through a list of questions here.

156
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.750
Chris Alliman MD: Just kind of yes or no questions, thinking back to the time five years ago when you were using the oxycodone

157
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.150
Chris Alliman MD: It's not really about. More recently, it's more back then.

158
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:34.830
Chris Alliman MD: If you don't understand the questions we happy to repeat them for you. Just or rephrase them if you need to just let me know.

159
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.630
Bianca Garcia: Okay, good.

160
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:44.400
Chris Alliman MD: So we're the was the opiates taken in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than initially intended

161
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.170
Bianca Garcia: And larger amounts like mania is taking more

162
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.920
Bianca Garcia: Yep. Yeah, okay, and

163
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.550
Chris Alliman MD: I forgot to ask you this, when did you get started using the oxy codeine

164
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:15.000
Bianca Garcia: Um, let's see. Five years ago, I probably like 2013 14 okay. It was a little bit after like a little bit before or a while, a few years before I started the program.

165
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.190
Chris Alliman MD: Maybe two years of being on the pills.

166
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.810
Bianca Garcia: But yes, okay, roughly around there, somewhere around there.

167
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.000
Alright.

168
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:36.930
Chris Alliman MD: So going back to these questions. Was there a persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to cut down or control the use of the oxy Cotto

169
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.180
Bianca Garcia: Some more like it did. I want to cut down on it.

170
00:14:42.450 --> 00:15:03.420
Bianca Garcia: Yeah. Yes. Um, well I pregnancy changes you and you want to do better. So that was number one priority. And going through that I just realized that I was overdoing it and and and it was a good star to stop so it helped me a lot. Good.

171
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:10.920
Chris Alliman MD: Very good. Did you have to spend a lot of time trying to get the oxycodone, use the oxycodone or recover from the oxy codeine

172
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.320
Bianca Garcia: Definitely

173
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.670
Bianca Garcia: Using and finding them. Yes. Okay.

174
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.910
Chris Alliman MD: Where their cravings, or a strong desire to use them.

175
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:22.710
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

176
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.690
Chris Alliman MD: Did they cause failure to fulfill roles at work at school or at home.

177
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:44.670
Bianca Garcia: And not too much because I was a student, but it was obviously after a while it does start expecting when you start realizing, yeah. When you start overdoing it. So I'm glad I kind of realized by then.

178
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.590
Bianca Garcia: But yes, yes.

179
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:55.800
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And did you continue using despite there being social or relationship problems worsened by the the oxy cotton.

180
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.910
Yes.

181
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:05.220
Chris Alliman MD: Did you have to give up important social, occupational or recreational activities because of the oxy codeine

182
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.800
Bianca Garcia: Um,

183
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:09.660
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

184
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.120
Chris Alliman MD: Did you continue to use the oxy codeine in situations that were physically hazardous like driving

185
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.930
Bianca Garcia: I'm sorry rephrase

186
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:30.720
Chris Alliman MD: So did you still use them in dangerous situations like a motor vehicles driving. Oh.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:41.370
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

190
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:50.340
Chris Alliman MD: Did you notice that this. So these two questions are very similar. Did you notice if you took the same amount. The same dose. They didn't work as well.

191
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.730
Bianca Garcia: After a while. Yes. Yep.

192
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:59.250

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:03.840
Chris Alliman MD: Now it's a goal of our group to get people off the medication. That's what we want to have happen. We don't want to necessarily keep them on long term.

315
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:16.350
Chris Alliman MD: Or I guess I should say forever. It may take a long time to come off. But the goal is to have people be able to wean off. So the medications, just a patch for the short acting opiates.

316
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:25.860
Chris Alliman MD: Like the oxy codeine, of course subtext and Suboxone or long acting opiates, they just act like a patch or replacement. It's

317
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:34.020
Chris Alliman MD: Therapy part of things that people actually get better. They changed the mindset of how to deal with issues and they get better.

318
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:53.760
Chris Alliman MD: Through that so along with those weekly group visits. We also have weekly individual therapy sessions and that's where person meets one on one through zoom also with the counselor or with the therapist, so two appointments, a week, each of them are about an hour long

319
00:24:54.990 --> 00:25:01.260
Chris Alliman MD: All through the convenience of the phone and the medication, typically we send them a prescription

320
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:09.300
Chris Alliman MD: Like at the group visit to get a person to their therapy visit and then we hear back that they've attended therapies. So, then another

321
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:20.760
Chris Alliman MD: Prescription goes back into get them to group time so initially for the first bout a month. There's two prescriptions each week to help keep a person tight in

322
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.260
Chris Alliman MD: Eventually that extends out to like the weeklies

323
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.010
Chris Alliman MD: From there, and then we then we work it as we need to, from there.

324
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.700
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Does that sound doable for you.

325
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.190
Bianca Garcia: Yes. Okay.

326
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:48.210
Chris Alliman MD: That sounds good. There's a group that I have currently that I think you would connect really well with um it's it's at Friday at 12 noon. Okay. Would that work out for you.

327
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.030
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, that's fine. Okay.

328
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.600
Good.

Chris Alliman MD: So you've been taking Suboxone pretty regular the the sub you text pretty regularly. Is that right,

337
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.950
Chris Alliman MD: Yes. Okay. And how many do you typically take a day.

338
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.720
Bianca Garcia: 16 milligrams eight milligrams

339
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.720
Bianca Garcia: In the morning, and eight milligrams at the evening. Okay.

340
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.060
Chris Alliman MD: All right.

341
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.270
Chris Alliman MD: Good, so

342
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.690
Chris Alliman MD: How much do you still have at this point.

343
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.880
Bianca Garcia: Uh, none.

344
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.710
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. When did you run out.

345
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.570
Bianca Garcia: This morning

346
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.550
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, gotcha, gotcha. So any withdrawal symptoms or problems at this point with it.

347
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:08.400
Bianca Garcia: I'm a little bit. It's not too bad is since I it was this morning, but I usually take one now so

348
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.150
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

349
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.320
Are you gonna

350
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.770
Chris Alliman MD: Are you going to be able to get to the pharmacy this evening.

351
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.050
Bianca Garcia: That's my goal.

352
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:17.460
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, good.

353
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.270
Chris Alliman MD: So we'll get it sent in for you, so we can get that worked out.

354
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:33.330
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, absolutely. No. Usually, you know, the as you mentioned subtext is used when a person is pregnant because it is missing that in the locks own component where

355
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:51.150
Chris Alliman MD: Which helps prevent or deter a person as other people from using it or abusing it in appropriately without that we get a little more touchy about it now. I hear what you were saying about the the allergy and the swelling of the tongue. You had to the lock zone.

356
00:27:52.380 --> 00:28:00.690
Chris Alliman MD: We just want to be really careful with this, of course, just to be blatant about it. The medication is for you. It's not for anybody else. Right.

357
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.610
Chris Alliman MD: Right selling it not giving it away to friends or anyone like that.

358
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.850
Bianca Garcia: Oh no, I need it. I cannot do. Good, good.

359
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:22.050
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so we'll get that worked out and I'll get that sent into your pharmacy today. I'm also going to send a send you an email with the information about our group on Friday.

360
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.230
Chris Alliman MD: That goes from 12 to one now.

361
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.980
Chris Alliman MD: It goes from 12 to one. But you need to check in ahead of time through the virtual clinic.

362
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.560
Chris Alliman MD: About 20 to 30 minutes ahead of time.

363
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:35.550
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

364
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:48.240
Chris Alliman MD: The virtual clinic is like going in the front door of a, of an office. It's like calling on the phone. There's always a line and there is always paperwork to get done right.

365
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.140
Bianca Garcia: The second

366
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:59.850
Chris Alliman MD: The check in. Exactly, exactly. So we don't want you calling in at 1155 thinking that you're going to make it to group on time, because it's just not going to happen.

367
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:10.410
Chris Alliman MD: So calling in that 20 to 30 minutes ahead of time allows you to get stuff done when it's available, they will send you the zoom room number like they did today.

368
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.700
Bianca Garcia: And then you'll be able to get into group. Okay.

369
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.440
Chris Alliman MD: Does that sound okay to you.

370
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.910
Bianca Garcia: Yes. Good.

371
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:36.570
Chris Alliman MD: We definitely want you to be present, the whole time. So I know I hear what you said. You've got the kids at home. Right. And so we understand that but trying to be sitting to be quiet. No hat. No smoking, we often recommend having a notebook and a pen readily available like a recovery journal

372
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:44.100
Chris Alliman MD: Because sometimes things need to be written down so that can be that's I would encourage you to have that ready for this Friday also

373
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.690
Bianca Garcia: Okay, well, do

374
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:55.740
Chris Alliman MD: The therapist. Her name is Glenn, she's, she's really good. She does a great job with people. She lives in Miami, Florida.

375
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:56.880
Bianca Garcia: Now,

376
00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.500
Chris Alliman MD: So her timeframe is a little bit ahead of our head of New Mexico's

377
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.820
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

378
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:11.010
Chris Alliman MD: But she does a wonderful job with people and I think she'll be a good therapist for you. She really pushes people to help them along with the recovery and she's

379
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:20.010
Chris Alliman MD: Definitely encourages people also to work towards getting off the medication at the appropriate time. We don't rush it. But we do kind of would push it.

380
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.860
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, that's, that's probably what I mean.

381
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.040
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, it sounds like you've been on it here for a few years.

382
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:35.400
Chris Alliman MD: And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But learning to get off of it and we can help you through the process. Everyone gets concerned about the withdrawals like

383
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:36.810
Chris Alliman MD: That

384
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.230
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

385
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:42.210
Chris Alliman MD: Afraid of that. But we decrease it by a very small amount each time. So,

386
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:47.520
Bianca Garcia: The weenie. Yeah, meaning it's very doable. Yeah. All right, good.

387
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.520
Chris Alliman MD: What questions do you have Bianca.

388
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:58.530
Bianca Garcia: I don't have a question right now, but I do want to say that I'm breastfeeding an infant right now.

389
00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.220
As well.

390
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.710
Bianca Garcia: You know that

391
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.180
Bianca Garcia: Yeah yeah

392
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:11.370
Chris Alliman MD: That sounds good. I'll, I'll look at that. But obviously, you've been taking the sub you text I think not having the no oxygen is a good idea and

393
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:29.970
Bianca Garcia: It has helped me like I have not done Suboxone like an a program and but throughout the whole time. It's helped me stay sober clean and more functional. So it has helped a lot.

394
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:45.360
Bianca Garcia: And also a Friday is perfect. My kids will be in school, they get out at two, so I'll just have the baby, but I can have my spouse help with the baby. Well, I do the meeting. So that works perfect

395
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.930
Bianca Garcia: I'm not sure if you have anything else.

396
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.450
Bianca Garcia: I don't

397
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:59.250
Chris Alliman MD: I don't think so, basically, what I'm going to do is send in the prescription for today. So what's today Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

398
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:08.490
Chris Alliman MD: So four days of medication, so that you've got the medication during the group time and you're not worried or going through withdrawals while we're meeting as a group, so

399
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.010
Bianca Garcia: Want to make sure you're stable and

400
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:21.150
Chris Alliman MD: That's the time that you'll meet Gwen, for the first time she's not going to be in touch with you before, then I will work at scheduling a therapy session with you at that point.

401
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:30.690
Chris Alliman MD: Most of her availability is in the morning, because again, she's a few hours ahead of us. So think about what you have available in the morning and what

402
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.860
Bianca Garcia: Will work for you.

403
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:39.420
Bianca Garcia: Okay, so after I go to the class Friday, then it's once a week or twice a week.

404
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:45.030
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, it'll be twice a week for the first month basically as we kind of get you settled.

405
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:45.870
Chris Alliman MD: Into the program.

406
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.980
Chris Alliman MD: If you show up.

407
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:55.890
Chris Alliman MD: To all of the groups and you show up to all of your therapy sessions, there shouldn't be a difficulty in pushing that out to weeklies to make it more convenient.

408
00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.470
Bianca Garcia: Okay. Alrighty. That's

409
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.920
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, sounds good. Bianca, thank you very much for your time and I'm excited for you. I think this will work out pretty well.
