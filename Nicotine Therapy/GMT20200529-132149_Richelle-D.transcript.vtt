Richelle Direny: Did you say that you they went to the hot tub and you just kind of stayed in the room with the little

83
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:45.450
Donita McClintic: And I talked to him the other day. His mother at and talk to him over a month and she was worried about him and she did so I am blocked them and

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:57.390
Donita McClintic: After I am blocked. He was, he actually talked to her, but I couldn't blocking back again because you have to wait 48 hours but I blocked him back. But I told him.

85
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.670
Donita McClintic: Did he we need to start with the boards process.

86
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.590
Richelle Direny: So,

87
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.220
Richelle Direny: Also, you told him worse.

88
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.780
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

89
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.410
Donita McClintic: Yeah, cuz he's not gonna change, he's still doing the same things.

90
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.240
Richelle Direny: So,

91
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:28.200
Donita McClintic: Yeah. Oh, he told me that he needs it cuz he's still doing stuff he needs my support and whatever. And I told him what I didn't have yours makes you any different.

92
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.330
Donita McClintic: So yeah, but I told him.

93
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.970
Richelle Direny: So his response to the divorce was that he needed your support to change.

94
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.470
Yes.

95
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.270
Yeah.

96
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.910
Donita McClintic: But it's not it's not going to work. You are beautiful.

97
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.070
Richelle Direny: Place where you say, you're done.

98
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.530
Donita McClintic: I'm done. Yeah.

99
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.720
Yep.

100
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.510
Richelle Direny: And how did

101
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.620
That

102
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.160
Richelle Direny: Make you feel when just tell me, because that's the first time you've ever said to him that you

103
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.600
Richelle Direny: Need to turn it

104
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:14.820
Donita McClintic: On at first I was really nervous and whatever. But after I said it and the way he acted

105
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.760
Donita McClintic: confirmed to me that. Yeah.

106
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.920
Donita McClintic: We need to do that.

107
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:29.460
Donita McClintic: I got I don't miss him. I don't miss top down. Now, in the beginning, like how it was in the beginning, but it's not ever going to be that so

108
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.080
Donita McClintic: So yeah, I wanted a divorce.

109
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.580
Donita McClintic: So,

110
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:46.950
Donita McClintic: And you'll continue to do the things that he's doing because if we was to get back together and whatever he's just gonna hide or do and I'm not stupid because I'm an addict. I know what he's doing.

111
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.360
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

112
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:55.680
Donita McClintic: He forgets that I keep trying to lie to me and tell me he's not doing anything. But then other sentence or whatever.

113
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.380
Donita McClintic: He would tell them, Oh,

114
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:05.880
Donita McClintic: Mama, he thought he overdosed or something. I don't remember how he said it now. Now, it's like, see what I mean like, no.

115
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.810
Donita McClintic: I must have been high when he was telling me about

116
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.720
Donita McClintic: Him almost overdose. And has he forgot that he told me anyone don't know that. I don't know.

117
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.250
Richelle Direny: For

118
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.650
Richelle Direny: Sure.

119
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:36.600
Richelle Direny: And, you know, and they'd be end of the day, it all comes down to, you know, this concept of choosing you defining who are like, I think in group when we talked about the arm. The I am like

120
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:47.940
Richelle Direny: Defining yeah like you know you have a purpose you you're choosing you you love yourself in, you know, you have to, you know, you're a strong woman, and it's just to find that strength in you again.

121
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:48.960
Richelle Direny: It right

122
00:09:49.230 --> 00:10:00.720
Richelle Direny: Yes, a lot of those internal qualities that you have that somewhat got suppressed because of you know your addiction or the relationship that you've worked in

123
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:10.950
Richelle Direny: And, and, you know, it talks about your loyalty, because in this case, it shows your loyalty to the relationship. But then you have to really

124
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:24.600
Richelle Direny: I'm pretty much review and just kind of say hey you know what my voice is my loyalty, just to him, or do I is my loyalty first comes to me. And so, and what's

125
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.340
Richelle Direny: Your loyalty to you.

126
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:33.690
Richelle Direny: And loving yourself and remembering who you were, because you somewhat got lost in this relationship with him that you were slowly dying.

127
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:45.720
Richelle Direny: I'm mentally, emotionally, physically, you were still trying. You're killing yourself because of your loyalty to him and that type of love is not healthy love

128
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.890
That type

129
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.270
Richelle Direny: You know love is really not healthy because

130
00:10:52.380 --> 00:11:04.350
Richelle Direny: You know the commandment says love others as you love yourself, but then you were loving him way more than you are loving yourself. Right. The challenge here now is

131
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:19.830
Richelle Direny: We're learning how to love yourself again I'm putting yourself first being loyal to you, taking care of you and doing what's best for you. And once you find that in a healthy tone. If you once you find, you know,

132
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:27.030
Richelle Direny: Once you're able to capitalize on that, once you're able to you know hone in on that and

133
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:37.620
Richelle Direny: You know, make it a solid foundation under you, you will be able to love someone else in a much healthier way and you're able to identify from

134
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:47.070
Richelle Direny: You know what's, what does it mean to love myself to love others, like myself, I'm going to love you the way I love myself, which means that

135
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:54.570
Richelle Direny: I am going to be loyal to you the way I'm loyal to myself. I'm going to care for you. The way I care for myself in a healthy way.

136
00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:06.510
Richelle Direny: But I've took that time to learn what that looks like and what that means. So therefore, now that I completely understand what that means in looks like now I can do that for you in a much healthier way.

137
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:07.830
Until

138
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:18.060
Richelle Direny: Whatever he, you know, and there is some degree of manipulation there because what I love what you said that when he saying, Okay, well, I want your support.

139
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:24.870
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like, I'm going to play on your heart and I'm gonna play on words because I know you're going to fall for it. I've been with you long enough to know how to kind of

140
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:33.720
Richelle Direny: Throw the food, the than the fish hook out and to reel you back in. And if I'm able to

141
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.950
Richelle Direny: Based on the time that we've been together. He's been able to bring you back quicker. And so at this point.

142
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.300
Richelle Direny: You shocked him when you said no I'm not coming back there.

143
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.350
Richelle Direny: I think you subscribe.

144
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:57.570
Richelle Direny: said no, you need to figure out your thing. And so there's still be those persistence ways of trying to get you back. But again, you have to remember

145
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.430
Richelle Direny: That that promise you made to yourself. I'm choosing me

146
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:03.960
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

147
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:11.340
Donita McClintic: Yeah, yeah, he didn't. I mean, when he's not supported me, if anything, he has

148
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:21.480
Donita McClintic: Because I mean, when I was with him until I mean because I've been doing this for this referral for over 18 months. I mean, November will be two years.

149
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:42.420
Donita McClintic: And he still would come around me, and he would do things and then that's tempting to me to want to do it. So he didn't support me, even this whole time. He's not supported me so I just had to be strong and not fall down back down the hill or whatever but

150
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.940
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so when he said that no, you still get more support at all.

151
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.280
Donita McClintic: Yeah, he didn't give me any

152
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.880
Donita McClintic: So that's what I told him, I said, Mark, you have to do.

153
00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:07.860
Donita McClintic: You have to do for yourself. Not for me. I can't do for you. You can't do it for me. You gotta do it for you. I'm doing it for me. That's what I told him, but

154
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.990
Richelle Direny: And you know what the reality.

155
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:30.720
Richelle Direny: You are supporting him. You're just not supporting him in the way he wants you. Or he thinks you should surprise, you're supporting him by saying I need to work on me and you need to work on you. Together we're each other's trigger together. We're not helping each other. So then

156
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.020
Richelle Direny: Support my decision.

157
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:45.360
Richelle Direny: To walk away from this relationship why I support you in your efforts to go and get help. Just like how are you, I'm getting the help so

158
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.120
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes we listen know oftentimes we all have

159
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:52.500
Richelle Direny: We

160
00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:03.030
Richelle Direny: All have expected. Yeah, we have expectations I have exceeded expectations we create we say, okay, I want to do this when we want to do something we have created in our head.

161
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:16.650
Richelle Direny: How we think it should play out how it should look before, during and after the process and in our minds, we have confirmed that this is how the outcome should look

162
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:28.560
Richelle Direny: And if it doesn't look like that oftentimes we get really depressed, we get really we're really sad. We feel defeated. We get hopeless and it's all because we have created in our heads.

163
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:40.680
Richelle Direny: These expectations of how we want things to be not only do we can't create expectations. We elevate these expectations and oftentimes beyond what we're even able to do

164
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:42.810
Richelle Direny: And so

165
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.900
Richelle Direny: Are you hearing me

166
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.250

199
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.170
Richelle Direny: I'm sure being upset and nervous is contributed to some of it.

200
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.310
Donita M: Some of. Yeah.

201
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.250

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:02.490
Donita M: I had a room than a minute yeah room at the other house.

219
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:09.510
Donita M: Yeah, and he always comes to sleep in the same bed with me and like they're not going to happen.

But

223
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.060
Richelle Direny: Got a little beside himself. He got a little beside himself there.

224
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.160
Donita M: Yeah. Sure did.

225
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.800
Donita M: And then another thing is, um,

226
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:38.550
Donita M: My son's dad which he's actually I just got him in prior to her health games Curtis. Okay, that's my son's bad

227
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:54.060
Donita M: He's another one that I'm is getting on my nerves like he always trying to since I'm not with Mark he's thinking he's gonna cut my own back in. And I'm like, Nope, the socket and either the mean Jimmy or but like we've been best friends.

228
00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:06.330
Donita M: Forever even know we're not together anymore we're not together because he cheated on me, so I'm like I don't I don't forget that and i'm not i'm not i'm not good either. But

229
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.430
Donita M: I just got him in the program and I had to help him do some stuff like

230
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:21.870
Donita M: I hope he did his stuff was like I wasn't able to do it. But, so I got him in there and hopefully he does well.

231
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.520
Donita M: But

232
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.320
Donita M: Um, no.

233
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:34.410
Richelle Direny: I'm just and i think i think like at this point you know it's with confidence. You know, gaining your own self confidence.

234
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:47.370
Richelle Direny: It's making those those boundaries is very, very clear between your yeah YOUR SON'S FATHER. And this guy that you know making those boundaries boundaries very clear, so they can respect.

235
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.870
Richelle Direny: Who you are

236
00:25:49.080 --> 00:26:06.390
Richelle Direny: As a person what you're doing for yourself and where you're heading and just making that very clear. And if it means that you know with love, you kind of have to keep somewhat of a distance from them. If that's what you have to do while you are working on you. That's what you sometimes

237
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:16.350
Richelle Direny: By no means. Am I suggesting this are saying that this is what they're thinking about, but just keep in mind that sometimes people would want to make changes and kind of like

238
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.560
Richelle Direny: What they're they're doing is like maybe if I do this, she'll take me back.

239
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.850
Richelle Direny: Yes. Hey, you have to do it for yourself. You can't do it.

240
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.420
Donita M: Right.

241
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.340
Richelle Direny: Can get back in a relationship with you.

242
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:29.790
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but

243
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:40.740
Richelle Direny: It's not gonna live long. It's that that purpose. It's not gonna, it's not gonna last, it's going to be just temporary just so I could get you kind of like I'm trying to get you back in my web

244
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:49.230
Richelle Direny: Right, so, you know, you have to be very clear, making them very clear and just letting them know, don't you just

245
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:58.440
Richelle Direny: Do what you're doing. Are you get, but, um, you need to, we're on our own journeys each other.
