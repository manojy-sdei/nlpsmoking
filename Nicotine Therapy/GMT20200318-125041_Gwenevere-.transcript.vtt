6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you've got a good place you're set there. Let me get a note started for us.

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.900

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in Florida, there's a two hour time difference. I'm always talking your time zone, unless I don't, but it would be a mistake and you can call me out and say that sounded funny.

10
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And I I'll catch myself but don't ever have to say is that mountain standard. You don't have to do that I'm

11
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.310
Ariel Mirabal: A text in

12
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking scheduling is always going to be in your time zone. So you don't have to think about it. I've already made the adjustment. Everything is in your time zone. Okay. Okay.

13
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.810
Ariel Mirabal: Thank you that

14
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.560
Um,

15
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your last name over time. Is it men.

16
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.990
Ariel Mirabal: In the mirror ball. Yes. Okay. All right.

17
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm little intro I'm moving fast because we've gotta cram in about a two hour assessment into an hour.

18
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah so

19
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I am a licensed marriage and family therapist. I've been

20
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.600
Ariel Mirabal: Licensed

21
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: For over 20 years

22
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: In Florida license in New Mexico, it'll be three this coming June I think June, I'm got it, yeah I got it specifically to work with bright heart.

23
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But have been working with folks in struggling with addiction, most of my career. Almost immediately, I noticed that

24
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: There was some sort of addictive behavior, right next to whatever my identified client. Was it just seemed like there was almost always some kind of compulsion or addiction and I was very curious about it and never left. I've worked in

25
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of felony drug court residential outpatient more executive roles as a gap just really like it. I'm like, you guys.

26
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that there's no one answer. I like that it's a challenging population. So I'm not saying to be difficult, but I know

27
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to let you know it may seem odd that as a marriage and family therapist that would be something I'd be drawn to. But there it is.

28
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:56.340
Ariel Mirabal: You're a lot different than and this is a good thing. You're a lot different than I mean the place that I came from the counselors were really nice. Don't get me wrong there. They're very sweet, but I always have felt

29
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:11.760
Ariel Mirabal: And I think I might have told you guys this before I was actually an intake supervisor at it was saved neuroscientists, the biggest outpatient mental health clinic in Albuquerque that we have here. So five years and working alongside of a lot of the therapist that were there.

30
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.330
Ariel Mirabal: You know, as you. I know you know this as well as I do. Some people should not be therapists.

31
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

32
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.210
Ariel Mirabal: Nice, but

33
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.950
Ariel Mirabal: You know,

34
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

35
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.010
Ariel Mirabal: You're already a lot different. So I appreciate that.

36
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

37
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm very

38
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you'll find out it in time that

39
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people are surprised. I mean, it's such a you know it's telemedicine. You think you get somebody that like

40
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't experienced or something. But actually, you're going to be getting real psychotherapy in here with me.

41
00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I will tell you I'm treating alcohol you guys, I've got a few of you, where you identify as alcohol your primary substance of choice. That's a tough one.

42
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.160
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

43
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Love when you got a tough one. Okay, but I'm in it with you. I am seeing success. I'm in it. I'm with you. We can do this, but

44
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to take some effort on your part. We're going to have to, when I say hey let's let's do some experiments. Let's try some new things. Let's do it. It's not a metaphor.

45
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but I'm in it. Okay. And I do. Even the treatment.

46
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of what I do a great deal of it is evidence based and some of it's a little cutting edge.

47
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, some of it might seem kind of silly and kooky and you can laugh at me I'm I don't take anything personally. I'll never make it about me. You won't hear my story stuff. It's all going to be about you. I've never seen that get in the way of rapport.

48
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what everyone ends up coming away with and then we got to go into the assessment is is that that really is about you that

49
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of times what therapists don't really get is that you can establish rapport and trust and be professional without having to share

50
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And and so what ends up happening is you never have to take care of me.

51
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You never have to protect me from me getting irritated or frustrated or anything. Now, most people have that sort of people pleasing kind of thing in them.

52
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll keep an eye out for that. A lot of my clients do on all name and I'll say is that getting in the way of you being really transparent right now trying to protect me. I'm pretty I'm pretty quickly catching those things.

53
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

54
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But for a lot of especially young therapist, they they're uncomfortable about just diving right in and trusting and i i i really believe in the work so

55
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:56.760
Ariel Mirabal: So I'm not worried. I can tell right away in the group counseling. When I saw you, you were just so enthusiastic about it like you can just tell you're very you're not the person that goes home and says, I hate my job.

56
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not that. Oh my gosh.

57
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.490
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know that. But it just does

58
00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.880
All

59
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really lucky I'm really lucky. I hope I can you know there's not a lot of reimbursement. So I don't know that. I'll stay here forever.

60
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is definitely instead of working in administration which I was doing a great deal before I like that too. I'm a good boss, because I understand systems, but this this is this is the good stuff, working with you guys and being a part of your, your journey, it's a real privilege, so

61
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It is exciting. Okay, but this is so I'm glad. I made a good first impression before because this one's going to feel uncomfortable. I think okay so

62
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.720
Ariel Mirabal: Something called

63
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Sizing in advance. There might be me interrupting you, and saying things like this. Okay.

64
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's share that later. I need to know age of onset. What was the frequency. What was the amount

65
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the progression. When was your last shoes. Okay, next one. Then, next one. Then, next one. You're going to want to tell the story. This is just for me and to need

66
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: An accreditation standard. So we want the one sentence answer the paragraph ones. That's the one I want. When you and I are chill and we're meeting the next time and we can really sit and gently go over your stories. Okay. But this one's just fill in the blank.

67
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. All right, age of your first short. We're going to start with opiates. OKAY. SO SHORT ACTING opiates. Those are percocet oxy heroin fentanyl

68
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Age of first shoes could have been a root canal don't know when was the first first use just we're looking for a number in age.

69
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.770
Ariel Mirabal: 27. Thank you.

70
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the progression after that.

71
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.720
Ariel Mirabal: Um, it was very slow.

72
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.400
Ariel Mirabal: My doctor had kept me on the medication for a couple of years, and I think after about a year been on it is when I started to get stuck.

73
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And was for surgery, what was the prescription for

74
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.770
Ariel Mirabal: After I had my daughter. I

75
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:06.270
Ariel Mirabal: When I my doctors, it was, it was in there, a lot longer, but they just didn't know until I went to go get an ultrasound finding out I was pregnant, they found a bunch of cysts in there. So I had Cystic Ovarian Syndrome.

76
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.360
Ariel Mirabal: So after I had my daughter, it just continued so they were treating it after I had her. Okay.

77
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So it puts us at 27. A year later, you develop a chemical dependence. Okay, so, you know, now you have tolerance and if you stop using it. You're going to go through withdrawal. So that's pretty unpleasant. How did it progressed from there.

78
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.970
Ariel Mirabal: Did you start living on the

79
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Streets. Did you steal from other people right in there. What, how did it progress.

80
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.800
Ariel Mirabal: I began to start buying

81
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:44.700
Ariel Mirabal: Them from just people that I knew. After I started to realize I was getting addicted. I actually took myself off of the medication with my doctor but then

82
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.600
Ariel Mirabal: Shortly after realizing I was addicted. I asked him I didn't. Of course I didn't tell him I was addicted. But I asked him to put me back on it, I said that I was still going through pain. And so he put me back on the medication trying to help.

83
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:06.390
Ariel Mirabal: And I stayed on it, probably for about another eight months. And then I asked him again to take me off. And at that point, I told him that I was I was having trouble. And then I was addicted and

84
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:18.570
Ariel Mirabal: So that he would help me to not be able to do that, you know. So knowing that I couldn't go back to that is when I just kind of hit the ground running. And I started buying pills from any friend I could find that had anything

85
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's get that timeframe. So put your about let's say 28 during what you just said right here, this time frame. How much were you using right in there.

86
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:42.360
Ariel Mirabal: How much was I using um it was still really I was trying to keep it under control. I was only using about so they were five milligram oxy code owns

87
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:49.080
Ariel Mirabal: A gun and I was doing about two a day, morning and night, and then it progressed to three a day.

88
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And three a day.

89
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.550
Ariel Mirabal: And then after the three a day.

90
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:05.910
Ariel Mirabal: That was for a very long. That was at least for 2829 that was probably for a year and a half, even I would probably say till I was about 30 am

91
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then about

92
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:22.620
Ariel Mirabal: 31 now. So for the last year, I've been I got off of the pills. Sadly, I found a person. I couldn't find anybody. Nobody had OBS anymore. So then I started doing fentanyl people were selling fentanyl

93
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.460
Ariel Mirabal: So the fentanyl was so bad.

94
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:38.370
Ariel Mirabal: I was like, I wouldn't take a whole one I would have to break them in such tiny pieces to eat them that I started to snort them. I was snorting the fentanyl okay

95
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: How many milligrams a day at its worse.

96
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.740
Ariel Mirabal: 30 milligrams a day at least

97
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the most you've ever done have a short acting up yet.

98
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.950
Ariel Mirabal: Absolutely. Okay. Okay.

99
00:10:50.160 --> 00:11:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I was gonna ask about the fentanyl it's on my list. It's a very specific one. I usually say was this intentional or accidental because of the fake he's out there. So now, thank you for getting right into it. And the last use of the fentanyl was when like you

100
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:06.840
Ariel Mirabal: Know,

101
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Three days ago.

102
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.650
Ariel Mirabal: About a year it's been almost a year.

103
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.600
Ariel Mirabal: Last summer, okay, was the last time.

104
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you have been getting sets off the street or from a medical provider.

105
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:35.580
Ariel Mirabal: I STARTED DOING THE WHEN I spent not scared me. I got really sick. I think I had took too much at one some point. So it scared me. I know the dangers of that. So I decided this is dumb. Obviously, I'm not going to do this anymore.

106
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.110
Ariel Mirabal: My depression started getting a lot worse me

107
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where it gets hard this is, I know I want to hear about the depression.

108
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.720
Ariel Mirabal: pronto. Kick, kick to it. Okay.

109
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:52.140
Ariel Mirabal: Um, I just started to get really bad with that realized I needed to stop. So I started buying some boxes off of the street.

110
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:58.560
Ariel Mirabal: When I'm about when I about a year ago when I stopped doing the fentanyl so around the same time.

111
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: About how many milligrams

112
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:12.270
Ariel Mirabal: I started with, because I was coming from pet and also it was a lot. I actually am still at the same, it's three I was trying to do three a day. Sometimes I wasn't able to do that much. Sometimes I couldn't afford it or

113
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: four milligrams 20 milligrams of morphine. Is that right,

114
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:25.020
Ariel Mirabal: I believe I'm not sure how much they have in them, but it was three strips. It was the strikers did the strips there eight milligrams strips, I believe. Mm hmm.

115
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:39.240
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, I think so. So just do those and it was three and then it was, I have a daughter and I was extremely disappointed myself for the way that I quickly kind of snowballs downhill. So I decided, like

116
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:55.410
Ariel Mirabal: This is crazy. You know, I began as this really awesome mom and excited and I wanted to be that again. So I decided I need to stop. So that's when I went to get help from the place that referred me to you guys and I've only been with them for about two months before

117
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to get into treatment. I haven't noticed, I'm going to get into that in a moment. Take a deep breath with me.

118

Gwenevere Abriel: Any use

127
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Of cradle, yes or no, no.

128
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: This has been transcribed. So that's why you're gonna hear me talk kind of weird.

129
00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm talking to, just in case, because we're having some zoom issues of recording Asia first use of tobacco and progression place.

130
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.530
Ariel Mirabal: Tobacco i was about

131
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.030
Ariel Mirabal: When I actually started smoking and I wasn't really pretending it was like

132
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.110
Ariel Mirabal: 2020 years old.

133
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How much you smoke now.

134
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:23.610
Ariel Mirabal: So I quit for a long time. So when I was 20 I started smoking. I was smoking at the time, I was like, maybe one or two a day.

135
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:34.110
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, kind of made me sick. So I wouldn't smoke very much but then after a couple years I stopped. So I quit smoking for like gosh years I just started smoking. Again, one year ago.

136
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how much

137
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How much she's living

138
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.900
Ariel Mirabal: Now I'm smoking more I'm smoking like nine or 10 a day looking like half a pack a day.

139
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. Is your first use of alcohol.

140
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.130
I'm

141
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.110
Ariel Mirabal: 16

142
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the progression through there every weekend with friends became daily had DTS passing out blackouts Asia first use. You think it's 16

143
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:08.430
Ariel Mirabal: Think it's 16 and I would say probably like once every couple of months at that time, it was just out with friends, you know, staying the night at a friend's sneak in some stuff, you know, whatever.

144
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:20.730
Ariel Mirabal: Progression is getting a little bit older, it was like that for a few years and then when I was about 18 moved out of my mom's house. I was so excited. And when I was 18 then it became

145
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:32.580
Ariel Mirabal: It was every weekend and then it was multiple times a week for the drinking and then that's kind of as far as it went for that for the time being, then when I was eight.

146
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Until one was that way until

147
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.570
About

148
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:53.670
Ariel Mirabal: Until about 20 I would say about 20 years old and then I kind of started to slow down a little bit. When I was 21 and of course I was old enough to start going to the bars and things that wasn't even very often. I didn't take too much advantage of that. I would go every once in a while.

149
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: To have a journal at once in a while, is that every weekend.

150
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.050
Ariel Mirabal: Where you once a month.

151
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's slow down. I need to know amounts. Now, deep breath is the substance. So it's kind of hard. So it just, it's okay. That's why you're near getting help.

152
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to go backwards for a moment because I have no idea how much at this point.

153
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.910
Ariel Mirabal: We've hit

154
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You hit the ages so far. And we're not up to current and I understand that. So 16 you were drinking once a month were you drinking

155
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: A six pack passing out. What were you doing at age 16

156
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.940
Ariel Mirabal: So 16 was just more of the blank fun once in a while, kind of thing. And it wasn't

157
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Much we're at the how much right now.

158
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.200
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, so I would I would drink.

159
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:48.960
Ariel Mirabal: I would say maybe like two beers two or three beers and maybe like two shots when at, you know, in a night.

160
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Would you black out

161
00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:53.280
Know,

162
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Pass out

163
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.540
Ariel Mirabal: Know, passing out. Okay.

164
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we're at age 18 move out of house about how much were you drinking them.

165
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.620
Ariel Mirabal: Quite a bit when I was about 18 the heavy set partying, I would say started, but I was drinking about

166
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.020
Ariel Mirabal: A

167
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:19.110
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, not by myself with friends, we would like to other people. We had clear a 30 pack of beer.

168
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I need you don't care about friends love love that you have

169
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.710
Ariel Mirabal: Back and how much out of that I would drink myself. I would say about out of the 30 pack, I would probably myself drink about

170
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.810
Ariel Mirabal: Like 10 like 10 beers nine or 10 beers.

171
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Young right when it became a few times a week.

172
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:47.700
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, and I also at the time it was alcohol as well. It wasn't just the beer I would drink, probably about a half half a book says by myself. That's really bad. I was drinking so much

173
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's okay. So beer is alcohol. What we'll do is we'll call it liquor. OK.

174
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.030
Ariel Mirabal: OK. OK. Yeah.

175
00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So, got it. And then a half of a fifth of of partner. Okay, excellent. Then it became a few times a week. Yes. And how much then

176
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:17.310
Ariel Mirabal: The few times a week. That was no beer that was basically just, hey, let's go get a bottle and have a few shots kind of thing. And for the few times it. That's what it kind of turned into. So I would say the liquor.

177
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:25.590
Ariel Mirabal: About, about three or four shots in one day for the few times a week. Okay.

178
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then at age 20 I slow down age 21 you're able to go to the bar. You're saying once I can't. I didn't write it down once

179
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.480
Ariel Mirabal: With occasional I would say about once a month, I would go, okay.

180
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And how much were you drinking between, you know, age 21 maybe now.

181
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:54.630
Ariel Mirabal: So I got pregnant be in that time frame. I had stopped drinking when I was 21 I started doing really well.

182
00:18:54.990 --> 00:19:02.850
Ariel Mirabal: I was able to kind of minimize things I would say that that was one of the happiest times in my life. My dad was still alive, all this stuff. I know I'm not getting into that right now but

183
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:14.400
Ariel Mirabal: It was just happier time I was doing better with the drinking. I was, you know, it was, it was occasional for a couple of years, and then I I got pregnant with my daughter. And of course, there was no drinking for the year.

184
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.160
Ariel Mirabal: My dad died the day I found out I was pregnant with my daughter, the same day.

185
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.260
Ariel Mirabal: August eight

186
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.440
Ariel Mirabal: I was so excited and obviously so sad. At the same time, that kind of

187
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:40.770
Ariel Mirabal: So after I have my daughter. It took me a couple months to start drinking again. But I did, I began drinking and then I think it's become now the worst that it's ever been in my entire life.

188
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right here. Well 12 months later, we're out we're somewhere in 2016

189
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something right in their

190
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst I want to hear about the worst. How much should be doing.

191
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.230
Ariel Mirabal: So,

192
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.390
Ariel Mirabal: Sorry, my daughters toys are to be were so the worst right now.

193
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:12.090
Ariel Mirabal: I am drinking at one point I was drinking a whole fifth of Jamison by myself, there would be like one little drink left in the bottle.

194
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:20.700
Ariel Mirabal: Extra six. The next day, but a whole fifth of James a whole fifth of whiskey. I myself.

195
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.610
Ariel Mirabal: That's when I knew that I had a problem. I truly have a problem. Okay.

196
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have you ever had.

197
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever had the need to have an eye opener. In the morning so that you maybe don't go out into the DTS.

198
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.040
Ariel Mirabal: Like wake up and drink. Uh huh.

199
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.980
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, I've had you absolutely

200
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So client endorsing eye opener. You ever had any friends say, you know what, honey. I love you and I want the best for you. But you really need to come back.

201
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:54.210
Um,

202
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.420
Ariel Mirabal: Once or twice. Yes. Okay.

203
00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Client endorsing. And how about you look at yourself and you're like, I got this. I can do this. I got this. I'm going to cut back and you really, really, really tried, but couldn't

204
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:19.260
Ariel Mirabal: I'm most recently, and I'll tell you about that in a minute. I'm actually doing very good. But yes, I have. I've tried and have failed. A couple of times. Yes. Okay.

205
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so client endorsing unable to stop. Okay. And how many times lifetime. Sometimes it's 50. Sometimes it's even more. It's okay. How many times have you blacked out in your lifetime. Would you said you don't have to be exactly as it's just for me.

206
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:43.170
Ariel Mirabal: I'm probably like once or twice. I know it's happened, but it's not very often, it's never been

207
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a pretty high tolerance. It's yes okay um no DTS, and never got the shakes. If you didn't drink.

208
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.960
Ariel Mirabal: Never felt the shakes. I just always felt like an uneasy stomach or something.

209
00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.370
Okay.

210
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The last sip of alcohol was when was it this morning.

211
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.070
Ariel Mirabal: THE 27th. Okay.

212
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.860
Ariel Mirabal: I'm very proud of myself actually

213
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and which group are you. You're in my set. You're in my 70 and

214
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.850
Ariel Mirabal: I'm, I'm in the, I think it's 11am tomorrow you're in Thursday's. Okay. Yeah. All right.

215
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.530
Hmm, OK.

216
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.230
To zero 20

217
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, have you ever been on an abuse or any kind of a medicine to address the alcohol.

218
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.260
Ariel Mirabal: No. Okay.

219
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Client denies history event abuse buprenorphine has an anti craving phenomenon to it. So this is good timing while you're on it. So that's a positive, let's move over to THC AG first use

220
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.820
Ariel Mirabal: Say that one more time THC, um,

221
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.630
Ariel Mirabal: I was, I would say 18 probably 17 actually 17

222
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, every weekend or three bowls, a weekend and

223
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: How bad did we get. And when was last us

224
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.880
Ariel Mirabal: I was extremely paranoid when I was younger I that was one of the things I didn't really like to do

225
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:35.700
Ariel Mirabal: So it was like once God probably like once every couple of months once every two months when I first started with THC 18 then that was probably for a few years 1819 2021 even till I was like

226
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.400
Ariel Mirabal: I would say like 23 is when I started smoking a little bit more. Teach me

227
00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How much

228
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.130
Ariel Mirabal: I would say about

229
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.320
Ariel Mirabal: It was like every morning.

230
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.370
I'm on

231
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.710
Ariel Mirabal: One like one bowl.

232
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know this is hard.

233
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.570
Ariel Mirabal: I know it's just, um,

234
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.260
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, it's

235
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. This is hard, hard

236
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. Okay.

237
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Every morning, got it. I'm a mama morning. Yep. Okay. And

238
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that at its most amount was every morning one goal.

239
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:22.050
Ariel Mirabal: Um, no. That was at the time, I would say. Shortly after, like when the drinking started getting worse after I had my daughter. I did start smoking a little bit more to

240
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:30.540
Ariel Mirabal: It did help with different things. So it was like morning and morning, afternoon, and night. So it was more like three times a day.

241
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Repo and I learned, fine.

242
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.020
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah. Yes.

243
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And that puts it, when's your daughter's birthday.

244
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.210
Ariel Mirabal: her birthday is February, the fourth

245
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's ready when it started getting couple

246
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.970
Ariel Mirabal: 2016 I'm sorry 2016

247
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So February when it started getting the worst was a couple months after that I thought

248
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.190
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, so, um,

249
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:04.620
Ariel Mirabal: Because it took me a couple months to start drinking. Also, and I think it's the smoking picked up to when I began drinking again. So it was probably like

250
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.170
Ariel Mirabal: By around May, May.

251
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.930
Ariel Mirabal: The end of May I think 16

252
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, drinking started getting worse and smoking three calls a day got it last use

253
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.900
Ariel Mirabal: Gosh, the day before yesterday. Did you smoke.

254
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.390
Ariel Mirabal: Or in just one just one bowl, actually.

255
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright and ever used spice in lifetime.

256
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.890
Ariel Mirabal: Um, no, I don't think so.

257
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Denies Lifetime uses spice is your first use of powder coat cocaine.

258
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.080
Ariel Mirabal: 19

259
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there a progression through this

260
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.240
Ariel Mirabal: No, I didn't like it. Okay.

261
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.100

317
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.340
Ariel Mirabal: I was a supervisor at a outpatient mental health clinic and I was kind of embarrassed. I was really embarrassed. I didn't want to go get help, so I hid for a really long time from that.

333
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I am going to be following their format with a little bit more fidelity here, that one was all me.

334
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:14.820
Okay.

335
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, is it safe to say that you experience upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, the pretty typical withdrawal symptoms if you're not taking an opiate

336
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:29.820
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's push through there. So, Louise just

338
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll just make note of pretty standard withdrawal symptoms from opiate. All right, let's go here. So when God's sake symptoms got alcohol mentioned depression.

339
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any compulsion around food. Sometimes we control it, we restricted over eat it binge and purge it is that a part of your history, ever.

340
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.400
Ariel Mirabal: I actually went through a time

341
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:21.900
Ariel Mirabal: When I was really young, where I thought that I needed to stop eating completely and my dad had to like feed me iron and stuff because he was scared that I was losing too much weight. He thought that I was like anorexic. I don't know what you call that when

342
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You and for how long did that last

343
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.910
Ariel Mirabal: I probably lasted about three months.

344
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.240
Ariel Mirabal: And I was like, Oh my gosh, I was like 12 I was like 11 or 12

345
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.620
Ariel Mirabal: I was just going through this little stage. I don't know what what was going on.

346
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:44.400
Okay.

347
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you attempt to control weight by restricting calories or purging. Have you ever done that.

348
00:33:54.810 --> 00:34:00.390
Ariel Mirabal: I've never done that in my adult years. I think that was just something when I was young. I've always been very

349
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.090
Ariel Mirabal: Like I do care about my, my parents, my health, my body, things like that. I've always been really

350
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.430
Ariel Mirabal: Caring with those things.

351
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:18.120
Ariel Mirabal: But I've never done anything like that bingeing purging it's never my eating activity as an adult has never been anything weird

352
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: In your family history. Any schizophrenia or suicide attempts, or completed suicides on Mother's side father, son.

353
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:34.650
Ariel Mirabal: On my mother's. My mom actually she is very she suffers very, very severe depression.

354
00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:41.610
Ariel Mirabal: Even before my dad died she actually did attempt suicide more than I can count on one hand

355
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK.

356
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.330
OK.

357
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

358
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.010
Back in here.

359
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been hospitalized for suicidal ideation attempt

360
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:10.800
Ariel Mirabal: Know I called an ambulance on myself from that, from a suicide attempt. And I obviously was not willing to die.

361
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:20.130
Ariel Mirabal: It's one of those feelings, and I'm sure you know this to somebody does that they don't necessarily want to die, they just don't want to live anymore. You know, so

362
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:28.590
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, I called on myself. But when they came and they just took vitals and things. And I guess my vitals weren't too bad. It just literally felt like

363
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.290
Ariel Mirabal: So I just I pretty much just sent them away. I didn't, I didn't go

364
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when was this

365
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.770
Ariel Mirabal: This was about four months ago.

366
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: December.

367
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:50.490
Ariel Mirabal: Yes.

368
00:35:54.600 --> 00:36:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did you attempt or start or take action, you know, leaf away. What did you do

369
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.980
Ariel Mirabal: I took a lot of medication.

370
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.670
Ariel Mirabal: Medication. I don't even know exactly what it all was

371
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:19.740
Ariel Mirabal: I know that I had at some point that morning taken a Suboxone I was that's at the point that I was getting them from friends and things so I probably had it Suboxone in my

372
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:33.570
Ariel Mirabal: System as well no food. I didn't eat anything that day I drank a lot of alcohol. I was just downing alcohol on an empty stomach with the Suboxone and trying to take anything I can find any kept which I don't know exactly what they were, they were just

373
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.700
Ariel Mirabal: Medication prescription medication up there. I know some of them were like

374
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.920
Ariel Mirabal: Like muscle relaxers or something. I can't. I just can't remember what they were called

375
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: At the time,

376
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:57.510
Ariel Mirabal: And nobody was with me. I was alone my or my daughter was with her grandmother that day, my boyfriend was at work.

377
00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.580
Ariel Mirabal: I was just home alone.

378
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

379
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be. I'm going to be getting into that very shortly. And I do distinguish suicidal.

380
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Intent with self interest behavior. So I'll be asking about that too. So no hospitalizations.

381
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.400
Ariel Mirabal: Never. Okay.

382
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to

383
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to the history of the suicidal ideation, um,

384
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: How early in your lifetime. Do you remember having those thoughts.

385
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:43.830
Ariel Mirabal: Um,

386
00:37:48.990 --> 00:38:01.260
Ariel Mirabal: Definitely after high school I was well into my adulthood. When I first started, I mean you get sad and things, but no suicidal thoughts. Ever happened until I probably until after I lost my dad. I was

387
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.030
Ariel Mirabal: Let's see, that was

388
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.580
Ariel Mirabal: August of 2015

389
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:20.070
Ariel Mirabal: But I was also pregnant. So when I found out I was pregnant. It was like no option. So it had to have been after I had my daughter. And when I started drinking and the depression got really bad. So I would say in 2016

390
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:28.770
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, about may 2016 yeah I started just tumbling down tumbling downhill, it just

391
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's one you have a thought you have intent, you have a plan in action. So right around May. So we have tumbling down metaphor.

392
00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:53.370
Ariel Mirabal: I would say maybe just thoughts at that time. At that point it was never like Oh, I'm going to do it, you know, nothing like that was just

393
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This time denies intent plan and action.

394
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there ever a time where you

395
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: took action. Much like you did that other incident.

396
00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.300
Ariel Mirabal: Never, never before that.

397
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Since that

398
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You take an action. In other words, how many times have you either. And this is why the you can piece it apart. It's one thing to have a thought and it's gone, it's another thing to have a plot a thought to want to die.

399
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: To think of lethal means and then to take action. So

400
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times, sort of, has there been a i i i started to plan and put together lethal means

401
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:59.070

Gwenevere Abriel: You know your future. What you want to invest your time in your spirituality, your recovery your marriage, like, because there was a moment where we were going to meet

696
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to give just introduced her to this concept of what couples counseling might look like demystify any biases. Maybe she had

697
01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And now it's something else.

698
01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you today. Well,

699
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:43.530
Nick Graham: She's definitely not going for that. It just kind of he's not any I don't believe she's a place to, you know, do anything. So I'm not trying that stuff so much mainly I've been like

700
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.840
Nick Graham: I've been feeling like overwhelmingly like ashamed of, like,

701
01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:53.490
Nick Graham: Basically I got like

702
01:05:54.660 --> 01:06:12.510
Nick Graham: I relapsed and that's why I like less than 80 because I failed a drug test one time and seven like my past has really been like digging me like why like messed up like a really, really, really good opportunity, you know, and so that's been a thing that's been the kind of

703
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:21.900
Nick Graham: Getting me down trying to separate between, you know, shame and guilt, you know, but shame is all there is. Yep.

704
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're starting to dip into the past. I don't know why I have it in my head that

705
01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The fit with you in the Navy wasn't a good one. Like, I don't know.

706
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But

707
01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.020
Nick Graham: Well, you're because

708
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.170
Nick Graham: Well, it's a complicated one. Like that's generally like what I go with, you know, but

709
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.600
Nick Graham: I think that like

710
01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:59.700
Nick Graham: It was kinda. I mean, it was like hard like No one loves it. Like it sucked. But the thing is that

711
01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:06.570
Nick Graham: Pretty early on, like within about a year and a half of being in I started like I found a guy who like

712
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:16.350
Nick Graham: told me he had Viking in. And so I started buying regularly hydrocodone for like months and months and months until like

713
01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:19.680
Nick Graham: Yeah, I say like the Navy was a bad fit but

714
01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:35.940
Nick Graham: I was also in the beginning of like what turned into be really bad relapse. So, of course, it's not going to be good, especially when I'm using, you know, drugs while like you know working. How many hours on like dangerous equipment and stuff like that, you know, so

715
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:41.250
Nick Graham: It wasn't a great fit but I get I was good at it, you know, and I

716
01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:45.630
Nick Graham: Enjoyed what I was doing, somewhat

717
01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember I remember just this real

718
01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:55.740
Nick Graham: Yeah, I don't really say that but

719
01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.420
Nick Graham: Yeah I don't cuz it's like

720
01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:04.830
Nick Graham: So like buried down inside. You know, like, like I don't I don't bring that up and you know the weird thing.

721
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:08.100
Nick Graham: I failed a drug test.

722
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:25.080
Nick Graham: But I used fake your and like I bought urine from like a like a head shop. You know, like a smoke shop been like the other drug test with fake urine. So it was like some weird universe telling me, like, hey,

723
01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.580
Nick Graham: You shouldn't be doing drugs he shouldn't be in the military, one of the two

724
01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:32.760
Nick Graham: Okay, now

725
01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:33.720
Let me just

726
01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know which part is the part I don't tell, is it the

727
01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it is the part that I don't, I don't want to be in the Navy. This isn't, this isn't for me. It's not the part you don't tell or that what you're doing right now, which is the truth is when a new year.

728
01:08:54.180 --> 01:09:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, my running story is, it wasn't a good fit, but, um, I was using

729
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.620
Yeah.

730
01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one.

731
01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:10.440
Nick Graham: Yeah. And then that's that's the one that I don't bring up generally cuz you know

732
01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:12.510
Nick Graham: Who wants to

733
01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:23.580
Nick Graham: Hear that, who wants to say that. So it's pretty kind of a shame for peace in my life a little bit. Okay.

734
01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're saying it now.

735
01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.610
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah

736
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I would invite you to not miss the momentum of getting it out.

737
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.260
Is

738
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Ugly and what you might label just just, you know, I would call shadow side.

739
01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Call shameful. You might identify as just being disgusted with yourself, you might as well get it all out. Now, while the momentum is there.

740
01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

741
01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:57.390
Nick Graham: Yeah, so

742
01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:07.590
Nick Graham: Well, I found that the joke destino and no one believed it, because like that wasn't my character that you know so they thought they don't know what that means and

743
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:16.950
Nick Graham: I like went on for a legal battle for like a year and a half, so I was like telling them, like what because I did use I use fake here and it's truly

744
01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:35.160
Nick Graham: Like a mystery to me for how I popped Roxy code. And when I got a bottle and I squirted it into a cup. I don't know if like I was sweating and it like dripped in or like some tiny trace amount, but it was like point 2.0242 microgram some really tiny amount

745
01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:46.140
Nick Graham: I don't know what happened in it when I'm so I was in like legal battle for like a year and a half, where I was trying to explain to them that, oh, it must have been

746
01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:54.060
Nick Graham: Some supplement as using. And so during that time I was in limbo, and it really that was like the part that really like made my

747
01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:03.810
Nick Graham: Like probably my depression, the worst was like I was sitting around. First off, they put me on a ship and I was like locked up for 60 days on a ship.

748
01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:12.990
Nick Graham: And like the whole time. Like, you have to wear like a Red Badge or everyone like where you're like, restricted, you know, like you're the one who's in trouble and

749
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:23.280
Nick Graham: The whole time, like the entire year and a half. I was getting people like would say like we say stuff and then I would say to like pick up late because like

750
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:33.060
Nick Graham: I'm, you know, going through it. And so it's basically like a circle of torment for like a solid year and a half. That's like where the negative associations come from.

751
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:35.310
Nick Graham: Because of like the

752
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:38.910
Nick Graham: Torment like of like people just like

753
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:49.140
Nick Graham: Being in the military and talking shit, you know, but when you're not on that wavelength that they are it kind of messes with you a little bit so

754
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:51.660
Nick Graham: That was bad.

755
01:11:54.090 --> 01:12:00.570
Nick Graham: Yeah 30 to 60 days is pretty like traumatic almost in some ways, not really, but it has been that

756
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

757
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So anything else that you are ashamed of around now.

758
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:19.650
Nick Graham: Probably like the circumstances of my departure, like everything I do in life. I'm like really hard working, but there was a certain point where I just like like

759
01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:27.780
Nick Graham: Did nothing. I was like, fuck this. I don't care. Like, I'm in limbo, and I just like stopped.

760
01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:36.270
Nick Graham: I just like stopped working. Like, honestly. And I was like, what are you going to do about it kicked me out. Oh wait, I'm already getting kicked out so

761
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.060
Nick Graham: That's pretty shameful.

762
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:56.880
Nick Graham: Yeah, just like remembering like the way people look at you when you're that guy who's always like that guy. There's always a few of you on the ship, who are getting kicked out for either bad conduct or something like that or and so being that guy was like pretty

763
01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:58.740
Nick Graham: Shitty

764
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Were using during those 60 days in isolation.

765
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.540
Nick Graham: Oh yeah so

766
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:07.770
Nick Graham: He was

767
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.980
Nick Graham: Smuggling me smuggling me drugs in because I told her I told her.

768
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:19.500
Nick Graham: Hey, like this. The only way I can get. I was really you know many people, of course, to manipulate

769
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain.

770
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.440
Nick Graham: Yeah. Well, she didn't know I was like addicted. I just told her.

771
01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:38.550
Nick Graham: I need to pass this time because it's really shitty and I need you to meet this guy by this and bring it to me and on Sunday, she would bring me like like one time a week, she'll bring me citizen. I wasn't like

772
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:46.590
Nick Graham: Like, I mean, I was addicted, obviously, but not like to the point where I would be like dead without it without work.

773
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:49.320
Nick Graham: So,

774
01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:52.470
Nick Graham: It was never fun

775
01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.000
Nick Graham: Okay.

776
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And

777
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you remember the context of why he relapsed. In other words, what some of the triggers.

778
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.310
Nick Graham: Yeah, so

779
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:16.440
Nick Graham: I remember the first time I relapses around hurricane Irma my friend just like

780
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:25.860
Nick Graham: Was like, when we were in. We were a ship was basically going through like repairs and renovations and it was like really hard time like you'd have to

781
01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.430
Nick Graham: work a lot in I remember

782
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:39.900
Nick Graham: Kind of when you first start out the military people like it's just like the pecking order, you know, and people just treat you like shit. Basically, and

783
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:48.750
Nick Graham: I always felt like I kind of liked what I was doing. But my ideals were like my values weren't completely lined up with what they were doing.

784
01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:52.650
Nick Graham: And I wasn't like finding friends. Very well.

785
01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:55.800
In there.

786
01:14:56.970 --> 01:15:06.750
Nick Graham: And so generally when I'm socially isolated is when I like move towards in finding a friend, which is always the, you know, getting high.

787
01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.190
Nick Graham: And

788
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:23.430
Nick Graham: Yeah, I just knew a guy that I was falling ironically I volunteered. I was volunteering a lot during that time because I was like really wanting to start out nonprofit work and I just wanted to make the world a better place. I worked at a thrift store.

789
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:29.940
Nick Graham: Basically assistance place where they give people healthy food and

790
01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:36.240
Nick Graham: Interest free loans and things like that. And I worked with a guy who ended up getting me

791
01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:44.160
Nick Graham: Like some kind of oxy when I went on vacation for hurricane Irma we like took leave to get away.

792
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:45.660
Nick Graham: The

793
01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:48.600
Nick Graham: Guys, certainly.

794
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:57.390
Nick Graham: After that I use once and then I asked him, like every day. I remember asking him every day, like, hey, can you get mine. He's like, No, dude. That was like a one time thing.

795
01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:11.100
Nick Graham: And I asked him every single day and he finally hooked me up with a friend who got me the hydra code and then I was getting those regularly for months and then I got Sydney to ask a friend that are work to I knew or you can just tell when people are

796
01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:24.870
Nick Graham: Using it as that grow to get me drugs. And then I started getting like the higher strength like oxy kind of stuff. And then it was literally completely down hill and a few months after that.

797
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's what I heard was, I wasn't able to connect with people that share my values.

798
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.910
Nick Graham: Yeah.

799
01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there boredom know there was working really hard. That's it. How many hours were you working

800
01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And this was in render

801
01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:03.240
Nick Graham: Is in renovation. Yeah, sometimes like 9090

802
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: hour weeks.

803
01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:10.290
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah we're blessed or more, it just depended like sometimes I've worked really really long days.

804
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:15.000
Nick Graham: But yeah, I was working a lot like a lot, a lot, a lot.

805
01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:22.500
Nick Graham: And not everyone just gets drunk to blow off steam, you know, and I'm not a drinker, so

806
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:27.000
Nick Graham: Not, not really. And so that was kind of

807
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Key thing. There are people

808
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:44.520
That can work like

809
01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And blow off steam in other ways besides substances are a way to do it.

810
01:17:53.100 --> 01:18:04.260
Nick Graham: I mean, there's got to be like, I know some people who do yoga or some guys who just, like, go to the gym, like every single day like that they have time to do it. But really, like,

811
01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:10.350
Nick Graham: In the military, like, specifically the ship that I was on the culture was like

812
01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:21.810
Nick Graham: Hey, like let's all make suicide jokes until we go home and I, you know, because it's on. It's on everyone's mind.

813
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:24.120
Nick Graham: It's on everyone's mind.

814
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.370
Nick Graham: Yeah, like

815
01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.060
Nick Graham: There are, there must be other ways to cope

816
01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:40.290
Nick Graham: A certain point, you just adapt to things, you know, it's normally like with dark like really dark means

817
01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:49.920
Nick Graham: So I was just starting to you like when I failed my drug test is like, I guess I say that, but I was using a lot. So that was why

818
01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:51.510
Nick Graham: Yeah.

819
01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:53.730
Okay.

820
01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.650
So,

821
01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you just remind me why you entered the Navy. What was the incentive maybe one or two reasons. Maybe there's only one. I don't know.

822
01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:08.790
I'm

823
01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:20.190
Nick Graham: Not knowing what I wanted to do. I like billboard sometimes and do something drastic without thinking about it.

824
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.530
Nick Graham: I made it a scene in like two days was just on my way to boot camp.

825
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice was bored, anxious, didn't know what I want to do with my life that that

826
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.710
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

827
01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were using

828
01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you went into the Navy.

829
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:54.690
Nick Graham: Now, I was clean for like two years I was doing really well.

830
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: motivated you to get clean for those two years.

831
01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:06.540
Nick Graham: I'm

832
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:15.900
Nick Graham: I was. Oh, yeah. So I was in, I was living in Ohio at that time in like there's just not my life was not going anywhere, and

833
01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:31.500
Nick Graham: I just got like a marijuana charge and I lost my license and then I got it. Just driving under suspension, because I was driving without a license. And so I was like on a bad trajectory and

834
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:41.340
Nick Graham: I was like my dad was just moving it back out to New Mexico. And so I was like, I'll go. And so I went out there and I really embracing

835
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:44.670
Nick Graham: Physical health and I got in school and

836
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:48.690
Nick Graham: Like a 4.0 and then some reason I just like left

837
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.330
Nick Graham: I just left.

838
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:55.350
Nick Graham: To the Navy because his girlfriend and I broke up.

839
01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:57.330
Nick Graham: And so I just

840
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.570
Nick Graham: joined the Navy.

841
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me see if I go to this correctly.

842
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm self destructive or

843
01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The trajectory. I'll just use your wording bad trajectory move to New Mexico with dad got into school got 4.0

844
01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: bad breakup with a girlfriend. Enter navy, I get that right.

845
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:34.710
Nick Graham: Yeah. And right before bad breakup. I was going to join like reserves or national guard so that I could do like really part time but then once we broke up. I said, well,

846
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:40.260
Nick Graham: Why was I gonna stay around just through some girl. I'm just going to go and then I just left.

847
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is the part that you're ashamed of

848
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.350
Nick Graham: The part that I'm ashamed of is

849
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:02.490
Nick Graham: Relapse upon three in like upon entry and

850
01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.200
Nick Graham: How

851
01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:20.040
Nick Graham: I basically left you know cuz like I don't get different veterans, like I get some veterans benefits. I don't. It's not like dishonorable but it's not honorable discharge. So it's like I don't even get like certain veteran benefits like

852
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:34.170
Nick Graham: I don't get school paid for, which is the reason I joined. So I just devoted like like a lot of my life to this site really hard thing I did it. Of course I gained skills along the way but I just don't get most of the benefits and that's

853
01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:48.600
Nick Graham: Bad. You know, I feel like in my life right now. I can't even apply for government jobs, like, I don't know if this is true, but I just think like look someone saw like, you know, General, other than honorable discharge like

854
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:59.160
Nick Graham: They don't know how that would look for, you know, for drug abuse. So I feel like it impacts my life today, which is why it carries

855
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:02.040
Nick Graham: I guess so much weight right now.

856
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So why do you think that um I spend time helping people distinguish between those two.

857
01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: philosophies of remorse and how to ingest them. Why do you think I do that.

858
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.340
Nick Graham: I think that if people you know like

859
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:33.090
Nick Graham: Do it. I guess like because there's a healthy way to processes in an unhealthy way. And I think that like

860
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:46.440
Nick Graham: You know you can let that kind of stuff. Destroy you like hopelessness. That's like the reason anyone uses anyway. So if you look back to an event that messes up your

861
01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.780
Nick Graham: Future potentially

862
01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:51.990
Nick Graham: Then that can lead to relapse, maybe I don't have

863
01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Distinguishing between the two. So let's revisit it

864
01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them. What I am a proponent of is accountability, responsibility, learning, our lesson in its simplest fundamental terms keeps us civilized keeps us from not taking advantage of others and exploiting others we can live together and not kill each other right I have empathy.

865
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It keeps us civilized

866
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Without it,

867
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We will not be we have to care about our effect on others.

868
01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we'll just take, take, take, take, take, take

869
01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that the addict. When you were in addiction took

870
01:24:45.150 --> 01:24:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Took took took took took

871
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see the use unless you tell me the only thing the only

872
01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Product that I can use to motivate myself or to remember

873
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I've got a shame myself if that is that's what you're teaching me is only way I could get myself from not self sabotaging is I gotta force myself. I've got to call myself these terrible names in order to not make that mistake again.

874
01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But I have a hard time sitting with that, I'll join you there because I get the logic. I just said it.

875
01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But the problem is is unbearable.

876
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it doesn't just say your

877
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: temporary situation it

878
01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't distinguish between your actions and who you are. It doesn't distinguish it attacks you

879
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's escape.

880
01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Or death.

881
01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm exaggerating a little bit but not by much. Yeah. Escape in a permanent way or through a mood alternative. So the reason why I like guilt is it can still function to remind you

882
01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To slow you down to say, Okay, right now I have an immediate gratification. Need I want security. I want attention. I want this pretty shiny thing I do want that. Yes.

883
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But I can think ahead, and I can say, you know what, in the past, I made a decision based on a short term interest and I didn't think through at least three or four steps that are consistent with a more core value I

884
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.960
Have

885
01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all we need.

886
01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But you saying whatever it is that you're saying yourself and I'm going to wait to hear it from you, cuz I want to know what you're saying yourself.

887
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't

888
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: serve you.

889
01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to bring us back to substance use.

890
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:00.840
Yeah.

891
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't join you.

892
01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: With the, you know, what would an employer think

893
01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's so much substance use out there.

894
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, what are you going to do, you literally it sometimes it can come down to just these two paths. I can either spend my mental energy given saying I'm a shit.

895
01:27:25.290 --> 01:27:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Look what I did. You can spend time just there's so much evidence. Look at this. And then you know what you did this and then you did this. Look what you did. Look what you did. You could spend time doing that and say, Look, it's hopeless.

896
01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you can force yourself to think about other things which are go find out.

897
01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Go find out the truth, let life tell you

898
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

899
01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you go well I don't accept that. Now I'm gonna go over here.

900
01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It can almost come down to two those two roads which are you going to do

901
01:28:05.190 --> 01:28:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And Shane doesn't let you do the one where you go into your life. It won't let you call anyone. Well, let's, you're right. Anyone wants you let you knock on that door that someone said no to you. Hi, it's me again.

902
01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wonderful I belong here. I feel very strongly. I'm fantastic just ignore this. This is, this is the way used to be this way. And today. Hi I'm Karen, Dan. Hi, shame on let you do that. But guilt does responsibility does it allows you to say it.

903
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I had this addictive behavior that really happened. It's why I didn't follow my belief system. I'm actually an incredibly hard worker. But addiction took over and that isn't who I am.

904
01:28:46.740 --> 01:29:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Who I am today is I work hard. I care deeply about my environment. This is the right place for me. Don't get distracted by that I will show you over time that this is who I am. That's not who I am. That's not who I am. That was the substance use.

905
01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That's responsibility. That's accountability. That means you're moving into the things you care about.

906
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to find out in real time not hypothetical whether life's going to say no or not. Now, or not here maybe over there, but you won't know if you keep trying to project into the future about what the limitations are

907
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:44.700
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think that's pretty accurate summary, because that's where I'm at, is like, I want to, you know, be a witness firefighter but like I want to apply. I will not do it because I don't want to be rejected. Like, like I yeah and so

908
01:29:46.230 --> 01:29:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me again, you want to be, which kind of firefighter.

909
01:29:49.380 --> 01:30:00.660
Nick Graham: I think it'd be cool to be a woodlands firefighter like people who tackle you know forest fires and things like that jump off the helicopter and cut down trees and take up trenches. I think that'd be cool.

910
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you don't want the I'm going to apply. I'm going to get my hopes up.

911
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Write a letter comes back or you sit in an interview and they say, I'm sorry, sir, we did a background check, and I'd like to understand why this chart this this discharge status.

912
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're willing to

913
01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay where you are in this job.

914
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly because you've suicide hasn't been that too far away, by the way. Yeah, it's not that far right there.

915
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That that hearing about what you've done, owning it is so terrifying to you. I mean, to sit with it.

916
01:30:50.610 --> 01:31:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That you won't go find out if maybe you're wrong, and maybe you'll have a six month probation. Maybe I'll have a two month probation period, maybe last for that and said, I get it. And part of this process is I've got on. This is what I did.

917
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Put me on a two year probation. You can drug test me every week.

918
01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Please. This is my calling. I didn't pay attention to it. When I was a young man, it was a lot more impulsivity. I'm seeing a professional I trust somebody underlying issues.

919
01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my calling. I will do what it takes to show it to you and show up anyway you knock on the door. Anyway, look at your alternative your alternative is just

920
01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you don't know is what the response from that door is you don't know if someone will say, I can't get past this piece, but did you think about this.

921
01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know what the next person is going to say or do I don't know either.

922
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do your best to think it through, but you're being able to say, that's why I asked you earlier. What is the ugly, ugly, ugly stuff that you did.

923
01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the more that you can articulate it in here and it can settle in the body in the mind and you don't run from it and you can answer back to me. This is how I'm accountable. This is what I'm doing. And it's hard.

924
01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I deserve a happy life one that I feel that I can earn a living.

925
01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And do something I got the skill set for it. Okay. That's amazing. This year you're perfect for that.

926
01:32:37.290 --> 01:32:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I do have this other history and I imagine you sir you ma'am are afraid that I'll show up like this and I want to find a way to show you that I will not

927
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will, I will. I'll do something pretty creative in order to show it to you if it's putting putting me on this probation for a period of time or whatever you need to do.

928
01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and I can play with language about how to install an idea into someone's head and maybe they'll say yes to you. We can play with that. But when you are in shame.

929
01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to spend your free time feeling sad.

930
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And hopeless. I'm guessing.

931
01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:29.160
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean because government is like where a lot of the jobs. I want to do are and I just feel like that's a door that's just like not even there. And I kind of

932
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:36.660
Nick Graham: You know, I think being a force, you know, either a firefighter or, you know, later on a forest ranger something Forrester like

933
01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:44.190
Nick Graham: That would be so cool. But, you know, yeah, kind of close it feels so

934
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:46.680
Nick Graham: Yeah, well, the

935
01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst thing is that a person that you may never see it.

936
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Says something

937
01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.360
Nick Graham: Actually gives you the limitation.

938
01:33:55.350 --> 01:34:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what, you don't have to hypothesize and make all these stories up then you turn towards some other ideas, some other interesting doors.

939
01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:14.130
Nick Graham: Yeah, I got I got turned down for a job before this one. I don't know if it, if it was because

940
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:20.160
Nick Graham: Of my because I didn't even he didn't like look, there was no check like

941
01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:31.170
Nick Graham: But it was, I was asking about school a lot. And as I don't know if it was because I was asking too much about their, their higher education programs and they thought it wasn't a good investment or if it was because

942
01:34:32.010 --> 01:34:40.620
Nick Graham: He was some douche bag army guy like former Army guy, he's kept talking to me about a wall of veterans and they like take your pictures and do all this weird stupid stuff and

943
01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.440
Nick Graham: I got denied that job.

944
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:54.330
Nick Graham: And so that kind of like, put it like I don't know why. I mean, I've never been denied a job before I was interviewed super well and that was the first one I've ever been like

945
01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.550
Nick Graham: They said no so

946
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: He never went back and asked

947
01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yeah. Hi. Yeah, I want to understand how how

948
01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This was not a good fit for you. It really helped me moving forward really want to understand it. Please don't be shy. Just if you could just let that tipping point was for you.

949
01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It does take a lot of courage to do that but it helps you. Because now you are in mystery land story.

950
01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and you'll know, wouldn't you know if you were talking with him. He might start to

951
01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Worry about some random story and you'll go, oh, it's about, you know, the dude that's keeping me from It's him. This has nothing to do with you it's

952
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't, you know, sit right say the right thing, Baba BA, nothing to do with your ability to the job. I had to do with the filter that this guy has you might have picked up on that. Have you checked in.

953
01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:57.450
Nick Graham: Yeah.

954
01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I want you to tell me what has Shane been doing for you. It's been doing something. What has it helped you do over these last couple weeks.

955
01:36:19.230 --> 01:36:20.220
Nick Graham: Have been really like

956
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:22.080
Nick Graham: It just

957
01:36:23.190 --> 01:36:28.680
Nick Graham: Because same spills over into like relationship stuff to you know like I feel like

958
01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:36.930
Nick Graham: You know, like it's obvious that the reason that like my marriage situation is how it is because I

959
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:42.630
Nick Graham: Chose this up since over a person soda Mac. But, you know,

960
01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.580
Nick Graham: Like got physically not well.

961
01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:54.300
Nick Graham: You know, add in. So that's, I guess, like, all of that kind of spills over because like

962
01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:08.490
Nick Graham: It is a fact that that happened and it is a fact it's negatively impacted my life and it's like harder not to feel shame like about that. Like it's it's hard not to. And it's something that is negative, like every day for you, you know,

963
01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:09.870
Know,

964
01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What

965
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You up the altar as an alternative instead of shame is being enraged at the addict.

966
01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's stopping the relationship is cutting him off its FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER. You fuck my life. It's not. I'm a bad person. You still think it's you go

967
01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:40.560
Nick Graham: Do, and I don't feel that

968
01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:41.790
Nick Graham: Anger. Like, I don't

969
01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I can. I wish I did.

970
01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:45.090
Nick Graham: Yes. That would be nice.

971
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I watched it all the time I watch it when I do my, my little

972
01:37:51.930 --> 01:38:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: angel and devil sort of debate in my groups. I have one side be. Come on, baby, come on over to my side and the other side fights for sobriety and yes into itself. And you can hear it and they're like, well, I'll talk to you later.

973
01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That sweet talk that keeping the door open to the addict inside

974
01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:17.760
Nick Graham: Us. I think that's where I am right now that's that's like truly

975
01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:22.290
Nick Graham: Where I think and I think like if I can't figure something out like

976
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.210
Nick Graham: I will relapse.

977
01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.370
It will happen like

978
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But look, but see you know what the difference is. It's this. You could take all of this. I'll call it regret.

979
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To motivate you to say if I don't cut this man off.

980
01:38:44.820 --> 01:39:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: He's going to mess with me again I have to cut ties. He doesn't care about me. He doesn't care about me doesn't care about me, instead of being angry and say, Look what you've done to me you've screwed me out of benefits the Navy, and even underneath that

981
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: anger towards your caregiver. How could you not have protected me how anger. When you turn it into shame. It's no no no no no.

982
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: No, let's get angry, let's protect the self.

983
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's, let's turn it to where it belongs, addiction someone that screwed with you.

984
01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The substance doesn't care. This life.

985
01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Will still be there when you wake up.

986
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's hard but you're a good man.

987
01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have something really important to give

988
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't do what you have to give you're here to do something really special. I can't do what you have to give. That's what's amazing about when we find our place.

989
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference. Right. You go, I'm a bad person.

990
01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of getting pissed off at the substance.

991
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:13.470
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah I think like

992
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:19.530
Nick Graham: I had that the last time I was, I got you know like last time I got cleanly.

993
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:27.840
Nick Graham: I had that, you know, like a head of passion and I had and I can't tell what has changed since then, like,

994
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:35.760
Nick Graham: Part of me always wants to blame the Suboxone like maybe I'm not feeling like the same like little things that I felt before like

995
01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:39.690
Nick Graham: Or maybe it was because I quit cold turkey before like

996
01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:49.980
Nick Graham: I was sacrificing something like physical well being sleep like things like that. And it made me like, appreciate it. Like I like try to believe that maybe that's

997
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:59.370
Nick Graham: The difference like but I guess like the difference that I don't want to address is like what if I'm just changed. Like, what if either my brain is changed or

998
01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:12.210
Nick Graham: Trauma things that have happened have changed me like in that it's like almost like irredeemable like that person who was like happy to fucking wave. Hi, to a stranger is like

999
01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:22.260
Nick Graham: not there anymore. You know adulthood. Is it your brain changes you get older, or is it just fucking Suboxone is it. No, no, that's what I'm concerned about

1000
01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want feedback for me.

1001
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:26.670
Nick Graham: Yeah, that'd be good.

1002
01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a combination of probably some

1003
01:41:31.410 --> 01:41:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Big influencers one. You weren't done growing you you got started in this process. You know, when did you enter the Navy when

1004
01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:41.670
Nick Graham: Are you going, yeah.

1005
01:41:41.730 --> 01:41:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't done girl, your brain wasn't done

1006
01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Functioning wasn't on board completely grown to

1007
01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: About 827 28 okay come on number one brain wasn't done growing

1008
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Number two, we do have a disposition. We do have personalities. I'm pretty much

1009
01:42:08.130 --> 01:42:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Same person that I was when I was little.

1010
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

1011
01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to make people laugh I care about people. I have a very analytical mind. I understand systems have a grasp on language kind of don't want to do the math portion. I'll do it. If you make me, but I really want to see what people are talking about and I want to pay attention to people.

1012
01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pretty much been that way the whole time. Now it's showing up in different ways. Some of it has been adaptive maladaptive but it's, it is so I am. It's a personality and you know that

1013
01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: My team. I mean, that's what they call it, they say, okay, by about age 18, you know, then we can start to say, this is someone's personality.

1014
01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's there.

1015
01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That wave to a stranger. I think you're going to get back to that, that, that sense of whatever those other pieces are that's pervasive personality, doesn't it doesn't change much.

1016
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's your personality for you.

1017
01:43:20.130 --> 01:43:20.550
Nick Graham: Yeah, like

1018
01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:22.320
Nick Graham: That was like

1019
01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:25.740
Nick Graham: Definitely like

1020
01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:32.340
Nick Graham: Always been able to like maintain you know positivity and a shitty situation like

1021
01:43:34.650 --> 01:43:47.970
Nick Graham: Positive like I would always be the one of the debates of, like, what's the nature of, like, man, are we negative or positive. As always, like, You're fucking stupid and depressed and hopeless, like we're positive by nature and

1022
01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:48.600
Nick Graham: Like like

1023
01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Analytical okay what else

1024
01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.330
Nick Graham: I was always like

1025
01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:01.740
Nick Graham: Always make really good jokes.

1026
01:44:06.450 --> 01:44:07.050
Nick Graham: And

1027
01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:12.540
Nick Graham: I think like living out like

1028
01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.740
Nick Graham: I guess my part of my identity also is like

1029
01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:21.900
Nick Graham: Enjoying like outdoors and hiking, camping, and like

1030
01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:33.960
Nick Graham: Even that's like significantly damper lately like significantly. Like, it's still, it's still enjoyment, but it's like 10% what it used to be.

1031
01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that now we're getting into the Brain Stuff.

1032
01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:41.130
Nick Graham: Yeah.

1033
01:44:41.730 --> 01:44:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Just assume it's true that taking the buprenorphine dampens the production of serotonin period just

1034
01:44:54.180 --> 01:45:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Take it in don't overanalyze it just say I'm going to operate on that until I hear that it's untrue that's affecting my baseline sense of being able to reach the sense of happiness.

1035
01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But see, you could go with that and say, Yeah, I'm a bad person. Look what I did. Or you could say this all the more reason to aggressively taper. I'm going to kick

1036
01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Its ass, you could go that way, which is right. That's an anger. That's that. Oh, I want you out of my life. And this is how I'm going to do it. I want to no longer be chemically dependent on something. I need my brain back

1037
01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can remember who I am. I can get that vitality back and I can get back into my life that the things I care about. I can be positive and be charming and funny.

1038
01:45:43.740 --> 01:46:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You could go that way. Or you could say, I don't want to find out what's there afterwards. I'm going to just stay on the subs and not taper and live in fear. And I mean, I'm sorry. You do have an existential dilemma here. It's either you get into it get to live in.

1039
01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hate to burden you with that. But we're all burdened with it if we have any level of consciousness and a weakness and you do you have it, you're awake.

1040
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So we do get to decide, and I want you here. I think you've got a lot to contribute and I'm excited. I'm glad to have met you and I can't wait to hear about each new story and each new step and I want to be a part of this journey.

1041
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll take it by tiny little chunks will take one application one call at a time, one internet search at a time. I'm happy to go there with you.

1042
01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Because each one and it won't take long. It'll be one little step and then probably very quickly. A quick, rapid step forward when you see it's

1043
01:46:49.800 --> 01:47:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: A Shoo, shoo, shoo, you're there you're a good person, you're, you're someone who right is analytical and knows how to see the sunny side and and that's a beautiful thing to be able to take something that's kind of daunting and be able to see its potential for growth.

1044
01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't forget you're going through really difficult moment right now. Multiple moments at the same time. And now. Hello. We have an environmental political thing also on top of us okay so

1045
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.760
Yeah.

1046
01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:28.470
Nick Graham: Yeah, that's

1047
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:31.590
Nick Graham: The thing that's getting a lot of people down to

1048
01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:35.310
Nick Graham: coronavirus things like

1049
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:40.770
Nick Graham: Not good for anyone. I don't think a contributor to like

1050
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.700
Nick Graham: I don't even know if it's like it's like background stress.

1051
01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It is not even like

1052
01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:48.600
Nick Graham: Think about consciously, but

1053
01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's there. Yeah. Well, it depends on whether you let it stay background or some of its it's really right in front

1054
01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You focus on what what would feel exciting for you.

1055
01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What would feel like you get to find out in real time.

1056
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What would feel like one step. And we'll go. I'll hold your hand as much or as little as you need it. A call an internet search a letter. What would feel like not risking it all but stretching yourself a little bit

1057
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But exciting.

1058
01:48:27.630 --> 01:48:28.110
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think.

1059
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.730
Nick Graham: But I think it's generally like career oriented.

1060
01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:51.390
Nick Graham: But first, I would be exciting to go in a freakin backpacking trip. Now, that'd be exciting.

1061
01:48:52.410 --> 01:48:53.460
Nick Graham: I think, but

1062
01:48:55.110 --> 01:48:56.910
Nick Graham: I think for a job like it'll be nice to

1063
01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:05.100
Nick Graham: Get like an interview some, like, like a park rangers like

1064
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:09.780
Nick Graham: Something like that. I think that'd be pretty cool.

1065
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now that's a goal.

1066
01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1067
01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, they get you there. And it's the steps that I'm talking about today.

1068
01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:22.230
Nick Graham: Yeah, um,

1069
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: First tiny step would be what

1070
01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:33.420
Nick Graham: I guess search it, look for the Christian

1071
01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm search

1072
01:49:39.210 --> 01:49:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Park Ranger opportunities.

1073
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can journal it you can text me. You can email me or write me. You can talk to a friend about what

1074
01:49:52.770 --> 01:50:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Search for some people it's this well since I already know I'll probably be prone to talk myself out of doing it. I'm just, I'll just work instead I'll distract myself with sadness.

1075
01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I could spend time feeling sad instead right that's been your option before. Remember I was asking you what it did for you.

1076
01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It kept you busy. Now I'm having to do this to understand that.

1077
01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Time limit who walk over

1078
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a little pompadour or whatever. These things are these little timers on your phone or whatever you got. And you hit

1079
01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 minutes hit Start sit and search and when it goes off, lift your hands and walk away. That's it. No time for analysis. Just hit a timer and then you see how you do.

1080
01:50:48.900 --> 01:51:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: This no other agenda. No other outcome measure. It's just did I sit there for those 1015 whatever you want to set it for don't go an hour. Don't go half hour just this is early, early, early just

1081
01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: 1015 minutes of search you look and assess afterwards, what that was like.

1082
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd be curious to see what comes up.

1083
01:51:13.290 --> 01:51:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's it don't overanalyze that just just that. Do you think that you could do 10 minutes of a search

1084
01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:22.050
Nick Graham: I could do that.

1085
01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean, any right we can look for 10 minutes we could just, oh, I don't, you know, you just talk through it.

1086
01:51:30.570 --> 01:51:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And before you know it, those tenants will be over and then come back. That's all you gotta do is you come back and you tell me, or someone what it was like.

1087
01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that exciting at all to think I can do it for 10 minutes I'm going to search for 10 minutes

1088
01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.960
Nick Graham: Yeah, a little bit.

1089
01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:00.900
Nick Graham: I'm just trying to think like

1090
01:52:02.730 --> 01:52:03.900
Nick Graham: What is exciting.

1091
01:52:05.250 --> 01:52:05.460
Nick Graham: Like

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:08.430
Nick Graham: anymore. I don't know.

1093
01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:10.560
Nick Graham: Like I'm trying to think.

1094
01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:12.270
Nick Graham: If that

1095
01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:23.160
Nick Graham: Emotion like exists, like really like within like the current my current state like does that emotion exist. I don't even know.

1096
01:52:24.930 --> 01:52:29.100
Nick Graham: I think I was about to go to Hawaii. And I felt exciting, but then I didn't

1097
01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, until you get there so

1098
01:52:33.150 --> 01:52:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting ahead of the actual lived experience.

1099
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where I'm

1100
01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to send it just for 10 minutes so you're because you're getting ahead of it trying to decide what if, what if I don't actually feel excited when I get there. This is a therapeutic interventions, you just if you need to just say, I'ma do for one of their

1101
01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:49.830
Yeah.

1102
01:52:51.930 --> 01:52:59.940
Nick Graham: Yeah, I mean I definitely do it because it's it's been a tough. It's been like coming at me like, how can you you don't know

1103
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:01.980
Nick Graham: The classic

1104
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:04.890
Nick Graham: You know cliche Wayne Gretzky

1105
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:09.600
Nick Graham: You'd miss 100% of the shots you don't take, you know, I mean like

1106
01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:15.420
Nick Graham: Yeah, that that exists.

1107
01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Although this analytical mind of yours can be an asset.

1108
01:53:24.210 --> 01:53:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You can also be a barrier to it can really

1109
01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, lucky winner.

1110
01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Cyclone of overthinking. So that's why I'm asking today that you just do a very tangible task. It's time limited time limited and then stop and walk away, come back and tell me

1111
01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how you felt emotionally. Tell me how your body felt, tell me where your mind wandered in here about whether Shane was activated in here whether guilt was activated. I can hear, whatever you want. This is there's no place can't go.

1112
01:53:58.230 --> 01:54:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So not going or if you can't do it for 10 minutes then set it for five don't care.

1113
01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an experiment. It's a behavioral experiment. Let's go see

1114
01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pick another time to meet

1115
01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:38.310
Nick Graham: Probably

1116
01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:44.280
Nick Graham: Think I'd like $200 a month that I could spend on this stuff, so

1117
01:54:45.570 --> 01:54:46.530
Nick Graham: Probably

1118
01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:51.090
Nick Graham: Next,

1119
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:54.510

1124
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be to do. Now this is assuming. Oh, wait a minute on Nokia on my Saturday. Oh, my 70 answer books right now if I get a cancellation i can i can text you and say, hey, something just opened up. Otherwise, how about we need more like

1125
01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Nine o'clock Mountain Standard on March 28

1126
01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be, oh

1127
01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:42.960
Nick Graham: Let me think, um,

1128
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:49.320
Nick Graham: I actually have an event that I have to host that day.

1129
01:55:50.850 --> 01:55:51.780
Nick Graham: So need to

1130
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:56.250
Nick Graham: Yeah, I gotta prep for that actually on that Saturday.

1131
01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I can

1132
01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see

1133
01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's any cancellations for any of my 7am appointments. Um, there's, I suppose there's a

1134
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Lot of people are working from home. It's true.

1135
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Many people are there, you know,

1136
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know that there'll be any cancellations. But I guess there could be

1137
01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:30.960
Nick Graham: If there are any if not maybe like that, following Monday, if you have anything like like around the 30th or whatever that they would be

1138
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Since you're working from home. You can't just sort of jump out. No.

1139
01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:44.790
Nick Graham: Well, I have a pretty strict schedule that I have to adhere to like to wear my days are planned out for me, you know,

1140
01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.050
Nick Graham: But I mean I guess I could

1141
01:56:51.090 --> 01:56:56.880
Nick Graham: I could see them moving something around. It's just like any hour that I missed as an hour. Like I don't make money.

1142
01:57:00.810 --> 01:57:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, so it's okay. We'll just, we're just in

1143
01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:03.720
Nick Graham: Yeah, but

1144
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:10.350
Nick Graham: I could I could probably do like near lunch. Let me think. So my lunches are normally

1145
01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.060
Nick Graham: I mean, if you have something around like noon ish

1146
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:18.630
Nick Graham: I could probably just do a longer lunch.

1147
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be 12 on March 26

1148
01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.400

1154
01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But it should work out just fine there and

1155
01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:12.510
