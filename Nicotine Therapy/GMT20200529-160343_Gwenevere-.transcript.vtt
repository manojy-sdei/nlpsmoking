00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.820
Nicole Roybal: Can you hear me.

2
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Hi, good morning.

3
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.820
Nicole Roybal: Hi, good morning. Sorry, I was checking to see if these headphones work better for like the audio.

4
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you'd like me can you hear and see me okay you want to stick with these headphones, you have

5
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.980
Nicole Roybal: As long as you can hear me better

6
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you. Great.

7
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.570
Nicole Roybal: Okay, awesome. I'll start using the headphones.

8
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: These are really good. Okay, so I'm going to open up a note. Um, do you want to. Is there anything kind of going on for you within the last like 48 hours anything kind of intense going on.

9
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:53.580
Nicole Roybal: No not really, it's kind of been kind of boring. Honestly, I got boring but like since my boyfriend took that two weeks off. We've just kind of just lost track of time, honestly.

10
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.770
Nicole Roybal: But I've just been going to my grandma's and stuff.

11
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.380
Nicole Roybal: Will not actually something did happen. My grandpa, he fell again a day before yesterday.

12
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened to him. Like, where did you get injured.

13
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:22.170
Nicole Roybal: He well he was getting up from the couch and he has his Walker and I guess he stood up and he like turns his Walker, to the right to like go around the couch and also he has got all dizzy and just like fell down to the side.

14
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.580
Nicole Roybal: He made it. Oh my god. But when it happened that day and we got there, like, five minutes after it happened.

15
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:41.580
Nicole Roybal: But he made it seem like he fell backwards and his head or something. But he was fine. He over exaggerated, but it just scared because he got dizzy, out of nowhere. But I think that's just because he's getting older and maybe his medications.

16
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We just say I'm going to grab grab something. I'll be right there.

17
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.940
Nicole Roybal: My grandma and grandpa. They're always okay so it's like super slow

18
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

19
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, test, test, test, how's audio and video. Now, test, test, test,

20
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.420
Nicole Roybal: How we do the audio is fine but

21
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.130
Nicole Roybal: The video just keeps like

22
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.110
Nicole Roybal: So short

23
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.550
Nicole Roybal: Okay. I mean, sorry, like flagging so

24
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We just rely on what I'm saying, and less about video, I guess.

25
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you were your grandpa exaggerated.

26
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Did some exaggeration.

27
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.090
Nicole Roybal: I guess it is kind of cutting out

28
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Test test test test test test.

29
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.660
Nicole Roybal: Okay, that that every time you do the test. It works.

30
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cute.

31
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when I started

32
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: messes up when I start talking

33
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.260
Nicole Roybal: Exactly. I wonder if I should just start try to restart my phone.

34
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well now I'm in Santa Fe. So, and I'm in a zone and I want I'm telling everyone that my

35
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: My cell service is

36
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Poor at best, which means sometimes

37
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not

38
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: In my text. So you can't rely on the

39
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Reminders the day before.

40
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I was in Albuquerque yesterday, which allowed me to send a reminder

41
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm even frozen.

42
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.940
Nicole Roybal: I'm just gonna turn this off for just a

43
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Second, so I was in Albuquerque yesterday and it allowed me to send a reminder

44
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't mean I'm going to be doing that in the future because I don't think you guys are going to get them. So once we schedule something definitely you want to set your own alarms because I may not be able to send those reminders.

45
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hear that information about the

46
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.440
Texting

47
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, um, let's have you log out and come back. Let's see what happens with that.

48
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you, like, get out and come back out.

49
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me.

50
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Test, test.

51
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So, did you hear anything about the reminders.

52
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.340
Nicole Roybal: Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear me.

53
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I can. I'm going to. So I'm going to say

54
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: purple, red, blue, what did I just say

55
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.480
Nicole Roybal: render an Albuquerque or something like that.

56
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll start over. So I'm in a really bad Wi Fi zone. So I won't be able to send those Wi Fi. I'm sorry, those

57
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.860
Nicole Roybal: Texture will read blue

58
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I won't be able to send those reminders, the day before. If I do, that's great. But I wouldn't rely on them. If I were you because

59
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.960
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. No, it's fine. I know, I know. When we have therapy.

60
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Alright, cool.

61
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.240
Nicole Roybal: I have an alarm. That's it. Every Friday and then every Tuesday.

62
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.430
Nicole Roybal: Uh huh. So it just goes off, so I know

63
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.900
That's perfect.

64
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so the connections, a little better with me on video. Correct.

65
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.150
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

66
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it is a little weird.

67
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We could do it the other way around, where you

68
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Can make one up. We could flip it and see if you prefer it where I can see you and

69
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And

70
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Or rather, I can't see you. We could flip it around where your videos off. Do you wanna try it that way. What would you prefer.

71
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.160
Nicole Roybal: As long as if that helps.

72
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's try. We'll just do our picture to picture.

73
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.930
Nicole Roybal: It doesn't, it doesn't matter to me, honestly, whichever way.

74
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.110
Nicole Roybal: Okay, so I don't mind looking at your picture.

75
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of a fun one. Um, I did Photoshopped it a little bit. So, okay.

76
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.110
Nicole Roybal: Yes, I think it was working better when I had my picture on there.

77
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so go back to that for a minute, and then I'll pull up your note.

78
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me

79
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.280
Nicole Roybal: Try talking

80
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to review your notes.

81
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: From last time, because we got pretty pretty into some goal setting. So I want to get into

82
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what that session was like for you.

83
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It was research classes on business and accounting. So after that appointment last Friday.

84
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What were your thoughts after that.

85
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think you heard that question I was asking you, after last session when you set yourself a goal to research classes on business and accounting kind of wanted to know what your thoughts were about it. Oh, hey, wait, did you. You bet you didn't hear any of that.

86
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's start over. Can you hear me.

87
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Test, test 121212 test test test test test test test test.

88
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.860
Nicole Roybal: I can hear you. It's like cutting out really bad.

89
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird

90
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm gonna go

91
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.470
Nicole Roybal: Let me go right there.

92
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.040
Nicole Roybal: It's working. Now it's working. Now the last thing I heard was thoughts about it.

93
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I wanted to know, after we met last week and you said, I want to research classes on business and accounting what

94
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened.

95
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.900
Nicole Roybal: See like here you

96
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.400
Nicole Roybal: Um, I had kind of looked into it and

97
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:24.150
Nicole Roybal: I was talking to my mom about it. And sure, like she reminded me that when I did work at a desk. Can you hear me.

98
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I can hear you.

99
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:36.720
Nicole Roybal: Okay, when I did work at a desk. I was like I was always like super tired like I'd be sitting there in the morning, and I'd like get like all like, just like

100
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:48.840
Nicole Roybal: Like my eyes would be closing and I'd get so tired, just because I like I'd be so bored I guess just like doing the same tedious work and just being in front of the computer screen and it hurts my eyes, I guess, I don't know, but I would always like

101
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.460
Nicole Roybal: Literally be like felt like falling over because I'd be so tired in the mornings and you so boring.

102
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.700
Nicole Roybal: Way. And so I don't like guesswork.

103
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I hear you but analyze whether you had been

104
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.990
Nicole Roybal: Dressed I do

105
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a hangover present

106
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.920
Nicole Roybal: Oh, that's true.

107
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really different.

108
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: From when we are feeling sharp so

109
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, like, we're not too sure what you're going to know because you're going to take these classes and you'll be like, oh, this is kind of interesting, you know, one desk.

110
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.400
Nicole Roybal: Is that i don't i don't want to

111
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.750
Nicole Roybal: Well, I don't want to

112
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:38.160
Nicole Roybal: spend more money and take classes or something. I don't like. Again, I don't want to waste my time and money. Again, that's what I'm scared of you.

113
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole.

114
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The misinformation is that if anything you learn is a waste. I'm telling you, as a 50 year old woman, the things you learn today are not a waste.

115
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know what you're saying, I want a degree. I want to spend my money on an education that gets me a degree that gets me a job that's well paying I understand what you're saying. But to say that it's a waste of your time.

116
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't already know what you want. Part of this is investing in getting clear about what you want and maybe it means taking a class.

117
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That you won't use this year, but you may use the information you learn in a class 10 years from now, we don't know that where you're where you're going to end up but you're worth it, Nicole.

118
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:45.450
Nicole Roybal: Just like it's just like, especially like the money part the time fine now. I don't mind if I waste my time, but the money is like school is so freaking expensive. Why can't it be free, like all those other countries.

119
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.690
Nicole Roybal: But

120
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.400
Nicole Roybal: Business is definitely still something I want to look into. It's just the accounting is

121
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it is boring.

122
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's boring. I would never do it.

123
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but that isn't but businesses offices entrepreneurship business is this massively open

124
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Topic profession. It's not just

125
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Accounting

126
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.870
Nicole Roybal: Okay, yeah. So we still thinking business but do they go hand in hand.

127
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.830
Yes.

128
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So look at this you know what you would be really I think you'd be awesome at is, is, um,

129
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me show you.

130
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: There's actually someone in

131
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In one of the groups.

132
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.960
Nicole Roybal: I asked this person some questions.

133
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you would be great. Look at this human resources.

134
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what that is.

135
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:55.980
Nicole Roybal: No.

136
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so in a company, it's the, it's the entity that hires you that interviews and hires you and they make sure everybody's trained. They make sure they're human the resources is a staff. And so what they do is they make sure that everyone

137
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

138
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's both. You're interacting with people sometimes, and other times, you're

139
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're just doing record keeping.

140
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a real common like

141
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.560
Nicole Roybal: Everyone is like following like the rules and stuff. Right.

142
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:41.760
