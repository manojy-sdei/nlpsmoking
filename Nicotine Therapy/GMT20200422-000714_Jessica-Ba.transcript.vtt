00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I didn't know that was the extent of

43
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It landscape camping or it's

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.530
Just about everything.

45
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.810
Robert hammond: Again, today I was helping somebody that got her window broken in. I'll tell them they're making a window.

46
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.910
Robert hammond: And she was on her.

47
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.810
So,

48
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.510
Robert hammond: For trash bag and stuff.

49
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.140
Yeah.

50
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.840
Robert hammond: I got so excited about bringing in this in this crap.

51
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:51.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. But the fact that it will still make some income during this time is good because there's a lot of people that don't have that experience.

52
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.100
Robert hammond: Right.

53
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.130
Robert hammond: And I'm wondering now everybody's doing it because the team is struggling, even with money coming in. Oh.

54
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah, very hard.

55
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm

56
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Here.

57
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:22.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A video that I wanted to show we started to see so off. I'm just, I was really thinking I was gonna log off because I say I guess all my patients stood me up and you were here, so

58
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Figure out where the bob i

59
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Want to show I'm

60
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Talking about emotional safety. I know in the past, we've had discussions about what relationships have look like for you.

61
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, and the last time we talked, you know, we talked about what you would expect in a relationship, what you're going to require

62
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you use the rules of imagery about like a grocery store aisle and not just picking off whatever's left on the shelf.

63
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:12.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But really realizing the options that you have and helping you to make wiser choices. So I watched this video and I thought it would be interesting for you to look at this is stead of always hearing from Me, you can hear it and watch it.

64
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:38.760
Your work environment feel so stressful to be come home from a meeting feeling like no one's understanding you are everyone's out to get you.

65
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:52.500
Or does your home feel like there's a lot of tension. Maybe you want your teenager to feel comfortable talking with you, but it's just not working. If any of these are the case for you. You might have a problem with emotional safety.

66
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:08.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: creating an environment of emotional safety is essential for a productive workplace a healthy home and positive relationships.

67
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:16.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you feel tense or like you're being judged all the time. Or if you create an environment where people don't feel listened to, or understood

68
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:23.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then your environment is not emotionally safe. Today we're going to talk about a few ways you can increase emotional safety in your environment.

69
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:35.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Emotional safety is when people feel appreciated valued worthwhile when they feel like they can trust their environment to be fair and consistent and kind

70
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In an emotionally safe environment people feel like they can share

71
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:54.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Their vulnerable and sensitive feelings without being mocked blamed or judged feedback and correction can be given in a calm safe and loving manner, people take accountability for their own actions without blame or defensiveness differences of opinion can be shared.

72
00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:02.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And also accepted, people don't feel like they have to change to be okay in emotionally safe environments. There's a feeling of honesty.

73
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:10.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there's a feeling of clear and safe expectations, some of the indicators of an emotionally safe environment or you feel comfortable around each other.

74
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People don't feel like they're going to be attacked.

75
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:25.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There tends to be open and clear communication when someone messes up repairs are made quickly, you'll see an increase in Vulnerability and openness, where people are sharing their really sensitive feelings.

76
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:36.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And people feel connected. Now, if you'd like to create an environment like this. You have to focus 95% of your effort on changing yourself feel we are responsible for our environment.

77
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what we what we put out there and what we allow to come into our environment.

78
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:53.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So most of your effort should be focusing on yourself. I say this because when I talk about emotional safety. I get a lot of people say, Oh yeah, the people around me. They're so dangerous. They're so mean there's attacking there so judgmental de de de de

79
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they don't realize that by saying that and thinking that they're actually creating an emotionally unsafe environment.

80
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:09.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or perhaps the people around them actually are attacking and dangerous, but they aren't taking any steps to create safety for themselves by setting healthy boundaries.

81
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:20.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when it comes to emotional safety focus on yourself. What can you do to create this the opposite of emotional safety is judgment blame attacking

82
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:29.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a lot of closed off emotions so people use anger instead of sadness or they express frustration.

83
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:35.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Instead of, you know, expressing that they feel discouraged some other indicators. I'm an emotionally unsafe environment.

84
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:43.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is people are constantly giving advice. Instead of listening or constantly judging someone else or trying to change them if they don't agree with them.

85
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:53.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In emotionally unsafe environments. People feel a sense of conditional love that means well i love you if you change or I love you when you're good.

86
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:59.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But not when you're bad and that creates this constant sense of insecurity now on the receiving end of that.

87
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People who are constantly feeling like they aren't good enough or questioning their own so forth are going to project that on other people.

88
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:16.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's something that needs to be worked on in order to create a feeling of emotional safety other indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment are yelling

89
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:28.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Threatening or obviously any physical violence that creates, you know, a completely unsafe environment defensiveness blame using voice tone or a lot of attitude.

90
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: also contribute to negative environment, as do passive aggressive statements.

91
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:46.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of the most common indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment are using things like personal attacks. So instead of saying, I don't like it when you forget to do your tour. You think you are the laziest person in the world.

92
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, attacking their character just calling them a lazy sob. The other thing that's a big indicator of emotionally unsafe environments.

93
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is when the rules or boundaries or standards are constantly changing. People don't know what to expect.

94
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or when there's a feeling of walking on eggshells like if you say the wrong thing, that person is going to blow up. Or if you

95
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:11.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you do the wrong thing, that person is going to be offended. So those are all indicators of emotionally unsafe environments.

96
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:18.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We can actively create an environment of emotional safety by working on ourselves, we create an environment of love.

97
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:24.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where we aren't trying to change other people, but rather we put our focus on trying to understand them and listen to them.

98
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:31.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When the time comes for correction. We are consistent firm clear and fair we're honest with people.

99
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:41.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we share our vulnerable emotions like Sadness or hurt instead of only expressing secondary emotions like frustration and anger.

100
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:50.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We create internal safety by building ourselves up and you know standing on offended not taking offense by what other people say.

101
00:11:50.610 --> 00:12:00.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We also got to make sure never to use the word emotional safety as a way to badger or try and change someone else so going up someone's in you're creating an emotionally unsafe environment.

102
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:07.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is not going to be helpful if the environment is actually unsafe, then what we need to do is set boundaries around other people

103
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:16.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ask for change. Invite change and when necessary leap to create emotional safety we always have to focus on what's within our own realm of control.

104
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:26.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we focus on changing ourselves instead of trying to change other people, if we're in an emotionally unsafe environment we're less likely to create change by asking someone else to change.

105
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:37.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then we are by setting clear, consistent and firm boundaries. It is fair to ask other people to change to make requests and to, you know, tell them how they're affecting you.

106
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:45.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it is rarely fair or helpful to expect that someone change or to demand that they change in order for you to accept them.

107
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This creates a feeling of powerless in yourself because you're demanding that someone else change in order for you to feel okay

108
00:12:52.440 --> 00:13:01.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We can take back our emotional safety by focusing on our own actions and creating clear, firm and consistent boundaries with others. Thanks for watching. I hope that was helpful and take care

109
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.880
Robert hammond: eggshells and separate them.

110
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.700
Robert hammond: That someone told me that before.

111
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They feel with you.

112
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:21.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right.

113
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.660
Robert hammond: And I never understood why

114
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which relationship with this.

115
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.130
Robert hammond: Person was like

116
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.960
Robert hammond: I guess the second relationship prior to this one.

117
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Player what what made her

118
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Dad, did you ask for clarification.

119
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:53.790
Robert hammond: I was asking her, but she would never tell me like it was weird to actually try to commit suicide like twice.

120
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.090
Robert hammond: It was all dramatic and everything so

121
00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.430
Robert hammond: Attention.

122
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.510
Yeah.

123
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:11.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I remember you said that on the people that were sober that you are in relationships worthy appeared more unstable. The band, the ones that were actually added

124
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:21.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so I'm wondering if the attics appear more stable to you because it was a commonality between you to

125
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:36.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You all had lived experiences. So it seemed like it was an environment that you were accustomed to versus being WITH someone that was it. So, you know, what was the difference in that relationship.

126
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.230
As we're

127
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.240
Robert hammond: Not sure is. It was like the the sober ones, they were like more demanding and more needy.

128
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.610
Robert hammond: It was like they were more controlling and things like that, like they always had no one's

129
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.590
Robert hammond: Doing things like that. Like, who I'm talking

130
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:56.880
Robert hammond: Going on.

131
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:02.550
Robert hammond: Whereas the other ones were more relaxed and like you know

132
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.190
Robert hammond: Like it wasn't like the constant bombardment of target you are going

133
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.850
Robert hammond: To bed.

134
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:25.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I could be wrong, this is just me. This is what therapists do the question and try to see all sides. So is it possible that the social relationships. You were in their question. And he said, What should proceed as control was establishing their boundaries.

135
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:34.290
Robert hammond: I don't. Sure. Because if it was like I couldn't even use the restroom like there would be peeking into the doors and stuff like

136
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That, oh no, Robert that's

137
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:36.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's very

138
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.010
Yeah.

139
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Very excessive yeah okay

166
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.300
Robert hammond: Just from one of my other friends actually

167
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.900
Robert hammond: Let me know about them that they needed some work done.

168

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And sure enough, when I got here like there was all kinds of stuff that

173
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:28.260

174
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:38.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Something that breaks anything should think, let me call Robert and then if somebody in her family or anyone else she knows as similar challenges or issues she would refer you

175
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.170
Robert hammond: Right, it's

176
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.720
Robert hammond: Just start out with a garbage disposal and then next, you know, I was doing the backyard tree trimming and all that.

177
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:53.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's awesome. That just from that one experience, you were able to get multiple opportunities to get income.

178
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.450
Right.

179
00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:07.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you ever. Um, I know you said you were thinking about developing your, your brand your business more so you entertainers, creating a website, what's been going on for you do business cards, how you market.

180
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.740
Robert hammond: Actually, it's all word of mouth right now, but I was starting to look into that development about

181
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.930
Robert hammond: Doing the business cards and all that.

182
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.320
Robert hammond: You said now everything's all closed so I'm gonna have to do it myself.

183
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:20.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

184
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.230
Robert hammond: The name yet.

185
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.440
Robert hammond: But I'm still looking. I've been trying to find a place to move to another place.

186
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To live with your father. Right.

187
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:35.850
Right.

188
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.120
Robert hammond: And he's getting all like weirded out with the, the whole coronavirus and all that.

189
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.930
Jesus

190
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

191
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.340
Robert hammond: So he just going in and out and stuff.

192
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:58.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and it sense I get nervous to I get very nervous. With that, too. It's hard because you want to function used to make the income.

193
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:15.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But, um, I understand the concern for certain extent, but I also see your viewpoint, you need to make income and because you're self employed beyond the income is only going to get around it, you're actually working. So I made sense.

194
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I'm

195
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the relationship with your father you consider that in the Muslim safe environment.

196
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.810
Robert hammond: Yeah, for the most part.

197
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.000
Robert hammond: Like I can, I can talk, talk to him about anything.

198
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:31.890
Robert hammond: No, but it's like

199
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.220
Robert hammond: At the same time, you still keep a distance and stuff.

200
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:35.760
So,

201
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:45.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How does that work, it's a safe place to live together, but you guys keep your distance. What's the reason for keeping this

202
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.160
Robert hammond: Right. Is it

203
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:55.440
Robert hammond: I know it's weird. It's just like we just know each other's boundaries, like we don't just get in there and you know talk and no conversation like

204
00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.090
Robert hammond: Usually when I get home from work. I'll go in there and I'll talk to him a little bit real quick.

205
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.170
Robert hammond: That's about it.

206
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Primarily or see out and about as well know.

207
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What else, what else that out for you in that video.

208
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:32.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Were you thinking of a relationships as they talked about, you know, either what looks like an emotional safe environment versus the ones that aren't

209
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.150
Robert hammond: Right. I've seen about like my roles in some of them.

210
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.680
Robert hammond: Don't my relationships. My

211
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Will be your role in relationship.

212
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:47.100
Robert hammond: And so I thought, I thought I was like sometimes that'd be judgmental and stuff like that, instead of being encouraging.

213
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

214
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.040
Robert hammond: I know I was being an ass.

215
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.570
Robert hammond: Especially when I was still

216
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.320
Robert hammond: Still using

217
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

218
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.900
Robert hammond: I got the big time.

219
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:08.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where do you think that came up was just the addiction that kept you in that judgmental phase or was there something else because he was. It was more of

220
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.270
I wasn't

221
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.760
Robert hammond: too concerned about what they were feeling or what they know what their thoughts were

222
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.960
Why they did something

223
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.510
Robert hammond: As I am now like I can

224
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.380
Robert hammond: You know,

225
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:26.280
Robert hammond: At the time to understand, you know, what is causing them to do these things and be more building with them, then just to judge him.

226
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.250
Robert hammond: I got more inquisitive to why they're doing something rather than just

227
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.760
Robert hammond: You know, flat out getting all pissed off about it.

228
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

229
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What what I liked is that they also said that

230
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:56.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: express your vulnerable emotions versus the secondary emotions because typically people tend to express the secondary emotions anger and frustration are secondary emotion.

231
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:05.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think of any time that I've been angry about something. It's a result of something else. There's a cause.

232
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:20.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then, the fact is my anger to have everyone frustrated. It's always been something else that really is. It's not like someone just walks up and I'm in the pressures. It's the dog was accountants.

233
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:36.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It, you know, I thought that was good because I'm oftentimes if we're not into will miss out on really exploring what what that secondary emotion is really all about.

234
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:46.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So How comfortable do you feel and expressing vulnerable emotions. And do you think they know what some of the emotions are

235
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.830
Robert hammond: Currently, I've been doing pretty good actually.

236
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.040
Robert hammond: I already know like

237
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.270
Robert hammond: I'm not really angry because the key or, you know, I have an eight or something.

238
00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.260
Okay.

239
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What about frustration. Have you been frustrated lately.

240
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.720
Robert hammond: Yeah, so like right now. I'll be attacked by the dog. Oh.

241
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.040
Robert hammond: I already know he's he's got he's been cooped up over here, tied up to the truck. So

242
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.130
Robert hammond: He's just trying to get

243
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:26.970
Robert hammond: Get out and play.

244
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let me share another screen with you.

245
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because emotions aren't things that we're all very aware of

246
00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:04.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know we just pick up the typical happy, sad, angry, but there's various emotions that we experience day to day

247
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Happens that silliness scared worried surprise.

248
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There are some range of motions. You've been experiencing this week. Yes.

249
00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.100
Robert hammond: Recently, when I was talking with the customer.

250
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.140
Robert hammond: Something came up. Where's about my son.

251
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.910
Robert hammond: I just started

252
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.320
Robert hammond: Started missing.

253
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.700
Robert hammond: And I know right away you know cuz I mean I changed my whole attitude and everything.

254
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.850
Robert hammond: Because I didn't want her to be all freaked out.

255
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.830
Robert hammond: So I just knew right away that I was

256
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:40.980
Robert hammond: Just feeling a little bit depressed.

257
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Get in touch with the phone.

258
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And communicating that not

259
00:25:51.780 --> 00:26:00.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not allowing and and what I liked is that you were aware that your disposition change and rather than saying, well, yeah.

260
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:12.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No. No questions. All my business and you know you allow yourself to go even further past the I'm aware that my mood is change and probably acting differently to her.

261
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:26.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to create this emotional safe environment so that I can tell her this is what's going on with me so that she'll understand and not feel that this has anything to do with

262
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:37.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That modeling that modeling is key. And it's an important skill in relationships friendships work relationships, romantic relationships.

263
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:48.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even familial relationships. So that's what I would want you to do, you know, moving forward, just really being in tune with the emotion that you're feeling

264
00:26:48.900 --> 00:27:01.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even exploring it more. Is this really good question because we don't want to generalize that, you know, dig deeper is what I'm feeling when it comes to my son, you know, was it

265
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:15.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Worried that you know I may not see them again, you know, was there any shame attached to. Well, I don't have any environment what my son right now. Um,

266
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

267
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

268
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:34.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What what emotion. Do you think it was that you couldn't use depression as a word for what emotion really resonated with you and that one is

269
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.850
Robert hammond: A lot, a lot more of a burden.

270
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:36.600
And Shane.

271
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.510
Robert hammond: disappointed in myself.

272
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.120
Robert hammond: You know, I feel like I should have done.

273
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.620
Robert hammond: Done a lot more than I did. And

274
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.620
Robert hammond: I just about just about everything.

275
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.540
Robert hammond: Short of what I

276
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.560
Robert hammond: Wanted to do

277
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.850
Robert hammond: That would have been the wrong step.

278
00:27:54.150 --> 00:28:06.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Itself. Yeah. And that awareness, but now in that, you know, you can say, all right, when I'm feeling away that doesn't appear as happiness. I won't say that it's depression.

279
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:29.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know, I'm going to give it more main tool more context to it, what I'm feeling is, you know, some bill so like I should have done more okay analysis to where I am today. Why am today is I'm doing the best that I can. There's a pandemic out there and I still found a way to make income.

280
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:41.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Improving the relationship with my father and becoming a better person by expressing my vulnerabilities and I'm feeling so good at my job that I'm getting more referrals.

281
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That allows

282
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:59.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Other thoughts to challenge depression takes over so much emotion labeling it doesn't give you opportunity to challenge. What's really going on with you and also to highlight some of your successes.

283
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:14.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just something to think of, you know, the next time you feel bad and not not allowing depression, to be the word that's going to summarize that you're feeling even more contact

284
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.260
Robert hammond: Right, just generalizing

285
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, Jim.

286
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's your thoughts about the video we watch and this emotion chart that I shared with you.

287
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:41.250
Robert hammond: And just make you in tune with like what all I went through like just recently, even just does everything that hit me like I went through like 20 different emotions that I would have just generalized is one thing.

288
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

289
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:54.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's that scapegoat. That's that mind that does it want to allow you to connect and be vulnerable. That's what the addiction was masking

290
00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:07.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was saying I want to feel the pressure, Robert. So call us, but now the sober mind is challenging saying this is bigger than you know this is more, this is a little more involved.

291
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:25.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And really connecting with yourself to create that emotional safety because like the fair percent in the video, you have to create that emotional safety for yourself first, before you can establish the terms and conditions of what emotional safety will look like for others.

292
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:40.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So allow yourself to feel that you know that, hey, I do have some Gil, I do have some shame in regards to that. But then once you feel that challenge it and think of everything that you've accomplished in this moment. Okay.

293
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because sometimes these thoughts can he get stuck in your mind, again, you're not allowing yourself to see what's really going on right now.

294
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't want that for you.

295
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.790
Robert hammond: I noticed that I noticed. So I can

296
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.860
Robert hammond: I can easily spiral down. Keep on going.

297
00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

298
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:09.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is good, this is good. I'm sorry you had to wait. I was it again. My apologies. I didn't know what was going on. But I'm thinking about that. But the next time we meet

299
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which will be

300
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Work for you or six o'clock.

301
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.380
Robert hammond: Can we do six

302
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:35.250
All right.

303
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'll see you Tuesday, May 5 at six o'clock.

304
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, take care.
