You know,

6
00:07:52.170 --> 00:08:05.040

7
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.790

Mike: So I'm glad about that part.

9
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.150
Mike: Is cabin fever, for the most part, you know, but I'm done with it.

10
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:34.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is a good opportunity to take good care of yourself and having had that that affordability in the past. So now this is a time to just focus on you and take good care of yourself. I'm

11
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going to get right back, get right into the bio psychosocial because Mike. I've seen clients, back to back. I

12
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.410
Mike: Got that. Yeah, it was.

13
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My 845 so I'm tired but

14
00:08:48.660 --> 00:09:01.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to get this done. So, um, let's start because I don't know your history, what brings you to break our health, BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN IN OUR PROGRAM FOR ABOUT HOW LONG. Now is it close to

15
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Three weeks. Right.

16
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.340
Mike: Up to maybe three weeks.

17
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.440
Mike: I think I've had three meetings total

18
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:14.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so about three weeks. So three weeks ago. What made you decide to roll it out program what was going on it.

19
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.440
Mike: I'm just

20
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.750
Mike: just tired of the whole cycle of everything you know

21
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.110
Mike: The financial costs of it. The

22
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:42.060
Mike: The just the whole headache of all of it just really got into me i've i've i've had the idea in my head, and in my desire and wanted to

23
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:51.750
Mike: Do this. I've been talking about doing it for some period of time about, you know, but he's think that for six

24
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:59.970
Mike: Know, probably longer. It's probably been about a year that I've been talking about, actually, you know, taking the steps that I need to to get help.

25
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:15.060
Mike: I'm trying a lot of stuff on my own. I'm just like, oh, just try to taper off and try to just do this or just do that, of course, none of which really work. Um,

26
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:39.720
Mike: It would always in with the meeting lapsing on and or giving in and not starting. I'm not taking the first step was where I realized my biggest problem kind of was, um, I was unable to kind of hold myself accountable to doing me, you know,

27
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:47.010
Mike: Starting so I'm enrolling in a program or something that I really thought was

28
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:56.790
Mike: Something to hold me accountable more so and encouraged me and motivate me to continue on. Once I took that first step.

29
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.250
Mike: Um, I realized that was something that I personally was going to need because

30
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.120
Mike: trying it on my own was just not not cutting it. So I had to

31
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.450
Mike: That's, that's what brought me to the program.

32
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're happy to have you here.

33
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, before joining our program.

34
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was your drug history. Like, when did you first start

35
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.350
Mike: Well, originally, I began

36
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.720
Mike: began taking

37
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.330
Mike: prescribed medication that's how all of this originated

38
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.230
Mike: Were you injured. I was injured back in

39
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.320
Mike: 2012 I'm

40
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:58.800
Mike: And when I finally got everything I it was a big ol it happened at work. And so it was a big old dispute with the employer I'm finally I was able to get everything lined up.

41
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:07.920
Mike: To where actually I ended up getting Medicaid and started going under Medicaid and then they were able to get everything kind of switched over at a later date.

42
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.530
Mike: Lawyers and and

43
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:20.370
Mike: legal avenues. However, my doctor at that point began prescribing me a medication and

44
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.810
Mike: That was ongoing for quite some time.

45
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:36.840
Mike: I mean, and up until real recently, maybe a month or so, a month or two before joining the program. I was still being prescribed medication.

46
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.050
Mike: I was being prescribed pain medication, of course, which was off.

47
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:54.180
Mike: Now, it started out with me taking my prescribed dose and I stayed on my tribe ghosts or

48
00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.080
Mike: I'm a year and a half or so and then I had

49
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:20.190
Mike: I had it. I just my body's tolerance had built up I was I was starting to fill a lot of the same pains that I was originally feeling so I told my doctor of what was kind of going on. I mean, of course, we were trying other other avenues of medicine.

50
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:38.670
Mike: Such as getting trigger point injections. I'm doing physical therapy, we, we tried a lot of other things as well. Um, however, at that time I had mentioned to her that my medication just really wasn't doing the same as it had

51
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:47.040
Mike: Before. Um, so we we gradually continued moving it up.

52
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.320
Mike: At that point,

53
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.220
Mike: Then I got to the point where I kind of

54
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:12.360
Mike: I was taking all my medication and I still had, you know, a week or so left of my before I would get my next prescription. So at that point, it started out with.

55
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:36.450
Mike: You know me borrowing a few pills from other relatives that were injured and we're prescribing medication on friends, things like that yet later moved to me. I'm buying them off of the street, um, you know, to supplement the difference of what I was not getting from my doctor

56
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:54.960
Mike: You know, and I wouldn't have probably asked my doctor to just give me something that was going to be more adequate. But the way that the medical field has gone and has made it extremely difficult to be honest with your doctor at this point.

57
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.620
Mike: You know that complicated so much more because at the at the moment that you

58
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:11.880
Mike: Give the slightest inclination that you want more medication, they automatically beam you oh he's drug seeking behavior.

59
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.460
Mike: And that wasn't the case at the time.

60
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:21.840
Mike: Um, and so, instead of going that route, be that I had already gone in.

61
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.940
Mike: A higher dosage or a higher quantity

62
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.640
Mike: I really was was scared to even ask, you know,

63
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.370
Mike: And so instead of asking my doctor

64
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:53.400
Mike: I would find them where I was able to um once that was the case. A lot of the lot of the pills that I was able to find important they were stronger than what I was being prescribed

65
00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:08.850
Mike: Where I was already at a tolerance of of for my medication. And so the higher medication or the higher milligram medication that I was buying or whatever was

66
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:28.110
Mike: was just, it was just, it made my color and sound much worse. You know, it just compounded the problem, um, that continued for a long duration. I mean, you know, four years or so, probably, I would say.

67
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.930
Mike: And

68
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:40.380
Mike: It was if I mean I couldn't even tell you the amount of money that I have lost due to this.

69
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.600
Mike: Is

70
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:49.200
Mike: It was, what kind of was one of the things that kind of

71
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.260
Mike: Got me to the point where I was wanting to just stop.

72
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.710
Mike: The times that I would try to do that. I would end up getting really sick.

73
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.910
Mike: And I would back out, you know,

74
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just try a detoxing. Did you ever go to

75
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any type of rehab facilities or was

76
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.040
Mike: By our health know I had

77
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:23.490
Mike: I did a I did try to get you into a program at one point in time. It was a

78
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.860
Mike: an inpatient program. I was there for

79
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.190
Mike: I think, three or four days.

80
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:43.680
Mike: It was a week long program. I was there for three days in which I was able to abstain throughout that duration with help of

81
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:57.030
Mike: They were giving me Suboxone in the in the treatment facility. Um, we, the thing that happened at that time I had a family emergency and

82
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:09.180
Mike: I I got called like right halfway through my my treatment and was aware of the situation and had to leave the program.

83
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:17.850
Mike: To go and take care of what was taking place. Um, I had left under, you know, and

84
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:33.150
Mike: We asked, you know, prior to leaving if it was something I would be able to maybe re enroll or get back into the program time and they were like, Oh, well, we don't know. We be there was a lot of uncertainty and seeing like because

85
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:55.830
Mike: Because I left the program or whatever. So I in my head I was like, well, I'm out. I there's I'm just not going to be able to do it. Um, so I left without any after care or any medication at that time. So, it led me back to just doing what I was able to do

86
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:56.760
You know,

87
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.950
Mike: I'm

88
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.400
Mike: A boy the painful financial bear

89
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:28.020
Mike: I'm sorry, the financial bearing got really hard when I got, I went through a period of a layoff of with my job. Um, it was a period of about seven months and got behind on bills pretty heavily on was, you know, scratching everything together just to be able to cover my costs on bills.

90
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.870
Mike: That I wasn't no longer really able to

91
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:40.080
Mike: afford the cost of what it was costing me to buy medication off the street. Um, and so, at that time, I

92
00:19:41.220 --> 00:20:05.610
Mike: I got introduced to to Aaron at that time and began using that as a supplement instead of using medication. At that point I pretty much stopped going and getting treatment from my doctor I'm be that i i was i was wasn't clean. You know, I was

93
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.010
Mike: I was going to end up getting cut off.

94
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.360
Mike: At my doctors anyway because I was taking another substance.

95
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.380
Mike: And so I instead

96
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:38.130
Mike: Of doing that. I just stopped going to my doctor, um, that had been the onset of of that and you know I hadn't taken. Um, I really didn't take really much pills after that it was pretty much just the other substance.

97
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.370
Mike: Being at. It was a lot cheaper and easier for me to find

98
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.200
Mike: And so that was my

99
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.970
Mike: My THICK OF MINE being resourceful.

100
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.480
Mike: And, you know, um, and it's

101
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.920
Mike: Unfortunate that sometimes when when you do have, you know,

102
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.620
Mike: The same attitude.

103
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:16.710
Mike: That you're you're addicted mind will talk you into these things and find other resources have been able to do that. And so that's basically what

104
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:37.470
Mike: Got me going on that, um, I stayed and at continue doing that for years and I mean the quantities just, you know, got higher and higher. I'm almost to the extent know where I was spending almost the same amount

105
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.360
Mike: That I was on pills on the other stuff, you know, and

106
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.220
Mike: Which

107
00:21:45.420 --> 00:22:01.680
Mike: Was just crazy to me. I mean, now it's like okay this is gotten completely out of control. Of course I got back to work. I'm hand so money started coming back in. And that's when the increase kind of began I'm abusing

108
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:12.720
Mike: higher quantity of that, um, it just worked out in that the more I bought the cheaper. It was kind of

109
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Buy more of it.

110
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.150
Mike: I would, yeah, I would buy a bulk

111
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:24.150
Mike: Amount. Instead, and it would cost me less in the long run.

112
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.930
Mike: You know, and

113
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.710
Mike: That was another avenue that my addictive.

114
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:38.250
Mike: Mind pound to continue using and to be able to financially afford the, the cost

115
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Before that. Before the

116
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The injury at work and the pain pills to

117
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Experiment with any other drugs are used to smoke pot.

118
00:22:49.140 --> 00:23:02.040
Mike: Before um I experimented with hot back when I was in high school. Um, I would have probably my Junior. Junior year, I would say.

119
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.580
Mike: I smoked for

120
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:14.280
Mike: You know quite, I will my junior year I only did it a few times my senior year I smoked more

121
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:21.510
Mike: Not to where I would have really considered myself like the habitual type of a pot smoker.

122
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:40.770
Mike: After graduation, um, I went down to New Mexico State and Las Cruces um and I began smoking more during that period of time. I'm just college friends and parties and whatnot. I know.

123
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:51.300
Mike: You know, it was more of a social kind of a thing, but it was more frequent because there were just so many more things going on, more frequently. So

124
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.370
Mike: That was kind of how that began on

125
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:09.780
Mike: Then I stopped for, you know, about two years, three years and then I started smoking again when I turned about 24

126
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:11.280
And

127
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:21.300
Mike: I smoked a lot more at that point in time. I mean, I didn't really drink as much. I, I would drink more socially, but I would smoke.

128
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:35.820
Mike: Instead of during most of the time. And so I would have called myself a habitual smoker. At that point, and not continued until my

129
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:45.300
Mike: Probably till I was about 36 or so but 35 or right around there about 3536 years old.

130
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.100
Mike: I it was

131
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:55.050
Mike: Just a common thing all day and night, man. You know, there wasn't really much time that I was

132
00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.450
Mike: Awake that I wasn't under the influence of marijuana

133
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.810
Mike: This journal other

134
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Go ahead.

135
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.360
Mike: No, no, but

136
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: throughout this journey. Did you ever see a therapist.

137
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:21.870
Mike: No, no, I never you're really the first therapist that I've ever really seen um I think I spoke with one at a, at a

138
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.300
Mike: Interview, I think.

139
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.770
Mike: For when I was getting a lot of different

140
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.410
Mike: Medical care.

141
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.630
Mike: Um, and

142
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:38.490
Mike: The reason for that was I was dealing with depression.

143
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.330
Mike: Being awful work, not being able to make money.

144
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.960
Mike: And not having money. I mean, everything was just compounded at that time.

145
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.420
Mike: It was a real rough time

146
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.140
And

147
00:25:53.850 --> 00:26:04.560
Mike: After being at home for like six or seven months. I started feeling a lot of depression and feeling of like hopelessness and

148
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.800
Mike: You know, my, my self worth at that time was, I felt low

149
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.080
Mike: And so I

150
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:21.810
Mike: Did tell my doctor about it and she set up a meeting with a therapist. I think it was just a counselor or not.

151
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.210
Mike: But

152
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.390
Mike: That never really went anywhere. I kind of

153
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:35.100
Mike: Like you know i i just pushed through, um, you know, that was kind of how

154
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.830
Mike: I learned how to deal with things since kind of a younger age is

155
00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:41.670
Mike: You know it.

156
00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.770
Mike: You know, kind of tough it up and

157
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.300
Mike: Get through it.

158
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:59.340
Mike: You know, we weren't really much to go to a hospital for very many things, you know, we couldn't stop the bleeding. Then we were going to the hospital and or even with some broken okay but

159
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.040
Mike: Other than that, our culture was not

160
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:07.410
Mike: Going to get any kind of medical care, especially mental health.

161
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:09.600
Mike: Care.

162
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:20.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let me ask this question, and I want to go into what you mentioned about culture because it's very significant. Um, were you ever hospitalized because you made an attempt to harm yourself.

163
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:26.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No. Okay. Um, do you have any current thoughts to harm yourself or to harm anyone else.

164
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

165
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.920
Mike: None whatsoever.

166
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. Are you up to date on your flow meningitis and pneumonia vaccine.

167
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:41.400
Mike: We had pneumonia vaccine. Um, no. I, I suppose, I suppose I'm not then

168
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.080
Mike: Okay, I

169
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:52.050
Mike: Am I think on my flu vaccine. I believe I did get the most. The last one I think that I got.

170
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.440
Mike: With last season.

171
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.100
I guess. Yeah.

172
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:06.870
Mike: But, and then I don't know if they included meningitis or whatever other

173
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:14.640
Mike: Typical seizures, they do. I don't know if that was something included or not, I'm not really aware of that.

174
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's fine. It's something that the accident bio psychosocial um

175
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You mentioned depression. Are you diagnosed with any other diagnosis.

176
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.500
Mike: Um, as far as like neck pain, things like

177
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That mental health. They have a mental health. I'm no

178
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:39.600
Mike: No, no, actually technically I never was really

179
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.510
Mike: I don't know if I ever fully got diagnosed

180
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.560
Mike: You know what I mean, has been

181
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.780
Mike: clinically depressed.

182
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.620
Mike: So as I mentioned, I kind of

183
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.140
Mike: It just wasn't something

184
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know that I was used to

185
00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.010
Mike: I was like,

186
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:13.260
Mike: You know, this is a waste of my time. I can you know I'm I can get through this kind of, you know, Dale and you know I felt like I wasn't as bad as some of the people that I had seen that before me.

187
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.600
Mike: Medical care or

188
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:21.180
Mike: Depression, I did not want to be on any other medications.

189
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.620
Mike: At one point it was offered to me.

190
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.480
Mike: To have

191
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.510
Mike: Benzodiazepines

192
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As

193
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:44.850
Mike: As an assistant for those themes or also they had talked about possibly being able to give me

194
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.360
Mike: I'm anti

195
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.180
Mike: I guess stuff for like depression.

196
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:51.930
So like

197
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.570
Mike: I don't know exactly what

198
00:29:54.690 --> 00:30:11.970
Mike: Type of medications. Those are what, but I knew I didn't want to be on any of those kind of medications and I was already. I was already. I mean, prior to being prescribed any of the medication. I, I never liked me. I didn't like it at all, or anything.

199
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:36.540
Mike: So it was something that really just threw my world for a loop. I totally did not expect any of the things to take place that that had and it changed my it changed my whole life in in a negative fashion for for what you know I consider you know my life partner prior to that.

200
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have a medical diagnosis night.

201
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.840
Mike: Which was

00:30:42.960 --> 00:31:09.330
Mike: For my injury. Yes. Um, I had some issues in my between my see seven and c six. Um, there were, there was some damage there. Um, and in which it was causing a pinch, going all the way down to my fingers, they would go my hands would go totally non

203
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:20.970
Mike: All the time. I also had a back problem in my lower and thoracic region.

204
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:27.480
Mike: They diagnosed me with sciatica, or something like that.

205
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:41.910
Mike: And then I don't know what they called the other the other stuff. But there were there were a few a few medical diagnosis that that we're all related to a neck and back injury.

206
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:59.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to go back to let you mention culture and that you know the try to stop the bleeding. And then if you could have stopped the bleeding fast food that's in the hospital to tell me about your upbringing culture family. Tell me about that.

207
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.010
Mike: Well, I grew up.

208
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.290
Mike: And I'm in a single parent household for

209
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:23.160
Mike: The beginning portion of my life. My mom met my step dad when I was about four or five years old or so. And they were together and and married

210
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.730
Mike: All through my

211
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:38.160
Mike: My schooling through my high school years. Anyhow, I'm a divorced after 17 years I have two younger brothers.

212
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.390
Mike: A lot of cousins.

213
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.420
Mike: The extended family.

214
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.870
Mike: Was very large and we were all fairly close

215
00:32:53.070 --> 00:33:02.400
Mike: For the majority of my young, young life. We were very close. There was a rep that took place about

216
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:17.580
Mike: 12 years old or so on, in which it kind of divided the family, to a certain extent. So there was some parts of my family as far as aunts and uncles that

217
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.340
Mike: And cousins that I didn't see I'm all that often.

218
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:35.280
Mike: My aunt had an affair. I'm with a family friend, um, and

219
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:50.610
Mike: The way my grandparents, kind of, what are like it was that was like a shame will kind of thing to do. And so they really they kind of like may stop talking. They got into a big bite and they stop talking.

220
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.190
Mike: They didn't speak for

221
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.200
Mike: Like five to seven years vegan.

222
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sweet.

223
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.000
Mike: Yeah, with a long

224
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.490
Mike: Long opinion of thing and

225
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:13.770
Mike: But throughout that time there were there were, you know, my grandparents were always there I was, I grew up really close with my grandparents, they helped do a lot of

226
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:31.800
Mike: You know, raising and and and we're always they were always there. You know, I grew up really close with them. Um, and in which they stayed I stayed close to them throughout, you know, the remainder of their lives they passed.

227
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:41.460
Mike: My grandfather passed. About five years ago actually been longer than that. It's been about seven years.

228
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:56.940
Mike: My grandmother passed. About five years ago and year almost two years ago now in May, it will be two years that my mother has passed.

229
00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.580
Mike: She passed fairly young

230
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.010
Mike: She was

231
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:09.360
Mike: She had been an alcoholic and complications with her liver

232
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.120
Mike: She didn't die.

233
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:19.890
Mike: Of cirrhosis, but cirrhosis had already onset, um, she had

234
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:33.600
Mike: Think liver failure and some of those complications that come along with alcoholism that were mainly prevalent in in her cause. Okay.

235
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.060
Mike: Um, and

236
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.180
Mike: Yeah, that was about two years ago, pretty close to about 10 years ago.

237
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That that had like to, I would like to address more of that dynamic of growing up with the alcoholic mother.

238
00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:00.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the RNC in our individual sessions, since I have to do the bio psychosocial and gather all the information at the

239
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:09.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Schedule. Yeah, I want to schedule another individual session. So we could process, this, this is me just gathering information as necessary.

240
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:16.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I definitely want to process because this is a lot. I'm seeing connections already as to why you know

241
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:38.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have been already predisposed and, you know, having this injury and then it was this almost like it was inevitable. You know, mom has addiction history there's traumatic upbringing experiences in effective communication styles you have an injury that's painful get pain medication.

242
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's going to smile into addiction.

243
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.910
Mike: Again exactly happen.

244
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.720
Mike: Just like that. Prior to that, I was

245
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:55.650
Mike: The only thing I was really, I would say I would have any addiction to was smoking cigarettes.

246
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um,

247
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:05.430
Mike: I started tobacco use. When I was in high school. I'm probably my sophomore year.

248
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.700
Mike: Was probably my freshman year and experimented with it, my sophomore year, I was

249
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.630
Mike: I was constantly using tobacco.

250
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:34.170
Mike: And started out with using smokeless tobacco. Um, and then I stopped the smokeless tobacco and began smoking cigarettes, but that was really the only thing I felt like I was addicted to I mean I trained

251
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:41.580
Mike: But I never to this day have ever felt the need for it. I've never woke up.

252
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:50.880
Mike: Craving it or, you know, shaking or any of the any of the typical signs of an

253
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.380
Mike: Alcohol problem.

254
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was your relationship like with your mom.

255
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.810
Mike: When we were close

256
00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:07.110
Mike: Mum. She was a very present in my life, she began drinking when I was about

257
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.400
Mike: 13 or 14 years old on

258
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:27.420
Mike: It was mainly a social theme for the majority of time of up to about right about that year about my 14th birthday or so, um, then she had

259
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.990
Mike: She had developed epilepsy. She had a seizure.

260
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.820
Mike: And after she had that

261
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.600
Seizure

262
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:55.320
Mike: Like she never was really quite the same, like, you know, like she was like started kind of acting like younger like just some of the decision making stuff that was the norm for my mom wasn't like

263
00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.000
Mike: quite the same, you know, where

264
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:04.140
Mike: As before, um, you know, that would wouldn't have been an everyday occurrence. I'm

265
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:19.500
Mike: Drinking and or, you know, just the responsibility of all of it, you know, um, and, um, you know, it just seemed like that's kind of when things kind of changed with her and she started drinking

266
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:31.230
Mike: Mainly drink beer for the majority of time up on to the last probably four years of her life.

267
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:41.550
Mike: At that point is when she started drinking hard liquor, she began drinking vodka at that time and

268
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:48.000
Mike: Drank that pretty much up until the day she died almost, you know,

269
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:56.790
Mike: She the last probably three, four weeks or so survive. She was in

270
00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.690
Mike: Like a hospice type of care.

271
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.730
Mike: And

272
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:10.680
Mike: About the last two weeks or so or last week of her life.

273
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:20.580
Mike: her sisters moved her into their home so that she wasn't going to be able to be close to her with more family and whatnot but

274
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.120
Mike: She, her health was declining rapidly by that point and so

275
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.740
Mike: It was kind of already

276
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.510
Mike: Being expected or not to make it

277
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.320
Mike: Much longer and so

278
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:38.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That

279
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:38.640
Mike: That way.

280
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:46.530
Mike: Why the decision was made from over from the hospice care to to the home.

281
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And about just simply which relationship like that then

282
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.670
Mike: We were me and my

283
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:58.380
Mike: Middle brother were very close for the majority of

284
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:10.620
Mike: Time we just were more athletic and my youngest brother. Okay, so my middle brother three years younger than me and my youngest brother is

285
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:31.620
Mike: Six years younger than me. And so the age spread was we had a friend with my youngest brother and so me and my middle brother were a bit closer on being that we were closer in age so we we played a lot of sports for, you know, the majority of our childhood.

286
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.570
Mike: And

287
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:35.610
Mike: We had

288
00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:41.640
Mike: remained fairly close through our adulthood.

289
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:45.570
Mike: Up until

290
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.380
Mike: My. Let's see. I was probably about

291
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.300
Mike: Pretty close to about 30 years old, we

292

293
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:23.850
Mike: Prior to my mom's passing. Um, maybe about a year prior to we kind of

294
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:49.650
Mike: Kind of just drifted apart a bit. Um, my youngest brother, um, there was a period in time when he was in high school, like the last two years of his high school. Um, he actually came to live with me. I'm in in my home where I was in Las Cruces

295
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um,

296
00:42:51.120 --> 00:43:14.700
Mike: And so once he graduated. He actually moved and join the military and he was. It was pretty, pretty much gone out of state for the majority of time on. And so I mean we've we've talked when he is in town and whatnot but

297
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:31.740
Mike: He suffered a couple of incidents while he was at war on he was originally driving a tank for the Army in where he ran over IE be an explosive device.

300
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.750
Mike: He stayed in unless dad, he recovered from that state.

301
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:46.500
Mike: Enlisted and then a couple years later was shot a couple of times.

302
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.560

303
00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:58.770

304
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.930

307
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:33.960
Mike: My middle aged brother or my middle brother. He had a difficult time with with pills, also, um, he had an injury, in which he got hurt. I don't know exactly how but he started taking pain medications and

308
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:53.790
Mike: He got hooked on the beam medication. And actually, that's where I learned about the medication Suboxone was from him because he got off of the pain medication and began getting on a program for for Suboxone

309
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.940
Mike: And that's when

310
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:04.020
Mike: You know, when I talked to him about me feeling like I was in, you know, over my head.

311
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:13.140
Mike: On you know he had mentioned you know that that medication has been something that was like a miracle drug and it really helped him significantly and

312
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:33.840
Mike: You know, told me I should look into it and whatnot and which I didn't for a long time, you know, but, um, the seed was planted in my head and I finally got to the point you know where I was ready to stop and just

313
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:34.800
Mike: Try to get

314
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:36.810
Mike: Back in order in my life.

315
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.600

317
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:54.480
Mike: Two daughters, um, both of which are living right now with their mothers. One of them is actually living out of state.

318
00:45:55.290 --> 00:46:08.880
Mike: She lives in Texas. Um, and I haven't. I see her during the breaks the school breaks or during summer break, and during winter break, um, other

319
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:25.080
Mike: Than that we keep in touch through the phone. I'm pretty regularly, my youngest daughter I she lives here in state i had full custody of her up until recently.

320
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:31.170
Mike: In the past, probably, probably been about two years.

321
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.880
Mike: Since since my custody has

322
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:51.030
Mike: I haven't lost custody or any of that, but we we made a decision that it was best that you know, right now, until I get myself better that she be cared for.

323
00:46:52.140 --> 00:47:00.180
Mike: With her grandmother and so they are a we went through a kinship guardianship.

Mike: Plan and she is currently with them.

325
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:16.440

351
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:05.130
Mike: I'm currently. Actually, I do have a issue. I'm trying to get resolved, and it's

352
00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:11.820
Mike: Not helping at this time that I'm kind of, you know, trying to get myself straight at

353
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.210
Mike: Wayne pretty heavy on me. Um,

354
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:15.990
And

355
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:17.610
Mike: It's

356
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:25.740
Mike: It's, it's something that I've got to constantly stop myself from going to

357
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.540
Mike: Just to to my addictive mind.

358
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.420
Issue about

359
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:35.580
Mike: I've got a

360
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.430
Mike: Revoked license.

361
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.770
Mike: And so I

362
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.290
Mike: got pulled over for

363
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.330
Mike: The registration had lapsed by

364
00:49:49.740 --> 00:50:00.270
Mike: Me mean, I guess it was like a day or two. I'm that it was out of registration and so I got pulled over for that and

365
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:27.510
Mike: At that point I you know I didn't my license revoked. I did not actually realize my license was revoked. I didn't know that there was. I thought temporary suspension on it, but it was actually coming back as revoked, and it is I'm coming from a long time ago.

366
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:52.920
Mike: That I did not actually know that took place and had it never gotten fixed on, I do not actually know that I went and got my license and had my license and I didn't receive any, anything that really let me know that it was under revoked status, all of a sudden, so

367
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When I got pulled over, I found that out.

368
00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:05.340
Mike: And now I've got a upcoming court case on me fear.

369
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.920
Mike: In which I've got to address that and so

370
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:16.800
Mike: That's been pretty heavy on the on the ad

371
00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Saying positive spirit that it'll work out.

372
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:23.490
Mike: I hope so.

373
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.000
Mike: I

374
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: really needed to I

375
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.060
Mike: Mean I gotta get my license back

376
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:28.770
Mike: It's

377
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:35.430
Mike: It's, it's really imperative, even to my job that I have my driver's license and so

378
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.300
Mike: It's I gotta do whatever it takes.

379
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.850
Mike: A girlfriend.

380
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:47.970
Mike: We've been together for

381
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:52.140
Mike: About seven, eight years now.

382
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.640

Mike: Good her. She has she does have children who are living now on their own already um we the dog that I had

385
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:15.150
Mike: Was all already older in age and

386
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:18.210
Mike: He actually had died.

387
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.380
Mike: I'm about five years ago.

388
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:41.220
Mike: And so I haven't really gotten any other animals, since we're located in in in a subdivision, and there's not like a whole lot of room available for you know what I've grown up.

389
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:57.270
Mike: Knowing like pets need, you know, we always had a lot of land and so we haven't really had that. And I just, you know, don't want to introduce a path to like an enclosed type of an area, you know,

390
00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.370
Mike: I just

391
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.140
Mike: You know, I was, I was close with the dog that I get out

392
00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:11.430
Mike: He was a he was a pet that actually had or

393
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:15.480
Mike: Pretty significant time I had him.

394
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.740
Mike: Probably. Probably about 13 years old or so we had him.

395
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:29.430
Mike: Um, he was actually puppy from one of our other

396
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:49.020
Mike: For a long duration as well. His mother. Um, and, yeah, so when my grandparents passed away. I brought him with me to live with me and my own here and he just passed from old age.

397
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:58.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, let's get into your treatment plan and see what are some goals that you want, while being in the program.

398
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:17.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in our program to attend group every week. Make your individual sessions. If you miss more than three below your, your participation in the program is going to be compromised and there's a possibility for discharge.

399
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.600
Mike: Okay, I'm so sorry about that. I

400
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:27.600
Mike: I, I was. I actually had was on the phone with the virtual clinic.

401
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: At

402
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:38.340
Mike: I think it was 430 I was like all prepped to do it and everything. And I had the computer out. I sat in bed where I usually do my session.

403
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:45.060
Mike: Um, and I was getting ready. Um, I didn't have any of the lights on yet.

404
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.320
Mike: Or anything like that.

405
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:58.530
Mike: I was kind of just sitting there, and all of a sudden, I was out, and I was like, I woke up at about eight o'clock, and I was like oh my god I don't believe what happened. I woke up like in a panic.

406
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.930
Mike: And immediately got called

407
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:07.890
Mike: Bright heart health, to try to get a message to let everybody kind of know what took place.

408
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.280
Yeah.

409
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:13.110
Mike: You know, I, that was, I'm so sorry about that.

410
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:21.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in the program, we're going to work on some relapse prevention skills. So I'm thinking of that what

411
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:28.890
Mike: Guys, I mean like that's not really like anything that I had asked the doctor,

412
00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:33.720
Mike: Mom, and it really hasn't come up in group or anything, but like

413
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:38.250
Mike: What happens if like somebody does get to the point

414
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.790
Mike: Where every laps, or they're about to

415
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:43.290
Mike: Is there, like,

416
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.970
Mike: Can we call somebody

417
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or yeah

418
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:51.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That. And that's a good question. So you're not discharge, if you

419
00:55:51.570 --> 00:56:02.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relapse we want you to tell us if you relax because that gives myself. The doctor the clinical team a way to figure out how to better support you.

420
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:16.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That might mean increasing accountability through individual sessions or more QA screens, we just we we help you with it because we know that relapse is a process of addiction.

421
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we just work on the clinical team you're part of that to figure out the best way to support you.

422
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:24.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Group will we

423
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.560

424
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.090
Mike: concerned and worried about

428
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:58.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're always working around the clock. I would encourage you, virtual clinic because it's I check my email and as a time difference. You might email me while I'm sleeping or something and I would hate for you to feel that I've been to connect with you so much.

429

Mike: Yeah, no, I totally know or have the time differential are dealing with. And so

435
00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:41.640
Mike: Make it to where the, you know, I wanted you to know that the the appointment was was of importance to me and

436
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:43.710

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:53.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: move on from that you showed up, you're here. I'm so we'll, we'll work on those relapse prevention skills and that looks like what we talked about it.

438
00:57:53.880 --> 00:58:00.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whereas the addictive brain versus to sober brain finding those connections in aware of thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

439
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:17.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: every topic that I bring up is connected to better emotional well being. So, that in turn that supports your long term sobriety. Then there's a spirituality component. I'm connecting with whatever spiritual practice that you connect with

440
00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you have a spirituality connection.

441
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.670
Mike: Yeah, I do.

442
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.130
Mike: Um, I grew up.

443
00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:38.730
Mike: In a pretty religious home. Um, I would say above average. We were really involved with the Christian church.

444
00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:51.750
Mike: For a fairly long duration. In fact, that's kind of the rift that went and took place with the family. Um, part of that was

445
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:54.330
Mike: Was

446
00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:14.340
Mike: Was he, my aunt who actually had the affair having an affair with somebody from the church. And so when that took place we kind of stopped going there and things changed in that in that aspect of it for a while.

447
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:15.900
Mike: Um, and

448
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:17.370
Mike: I

449
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.110
Mike: Wasn't as

450
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.030
Mike: Religious

451
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.780
Mike: For a period of time in my life.

452
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:32.070
Mike: And got back into, you know, religion, you know, right around my

453
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:41.700
Mike: Early 20s, I that's when I kind of started getting back into into the church and whatnot.

454
00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:56.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we'll also so you tap into that spirituality component, just as an additional support an anchor will help you and identifying over time. Most what triggers relationship triggers.

455
00:59:56.670 --> 01:00:03.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'll talk about that more when we meet next time, have an make this appointment. Now with us and we'll have it on schedule.

456
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:14.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, to just go a little more in depth, and then the long term goals, it's helping you to understand how the disease model works and and ways to get you to long term sobriety.

457
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:30.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the event that you're discharged because you know there's not a participation, you're out of compliance plug back into the program. We always set people. There's been people that's been in and out of this program. We don't turn you away unless we really

458
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:34.650
Mike: Believe that you wouldn't get like kick out like

459
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:36.180
Mike: Permanently or not.

460
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.260
Mike: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You

461
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:50.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wouldn't get kicked out permanently. The only reason why we would say, Hey, Mike can't be admitted would be if we feel that telemedicine is not enough support if we feel like Mike needs to be in residential treatment.

462
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:52.440
Mike: Yeah, like if I was having

463
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:53.790
Mike: Face to relaxing.

464
01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On down in

465
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:56.250
Mike: Like that I

466
01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:02.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would say, yeah, that's when we say for his best will be in three

467
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or four yeah and that's when we recommend you somewhere else.

468
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so, um, let me look at my calendar.

469
01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:12.510

479
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:48.930
Mike: Yes.

480
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:50.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.

481
01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you have any questions about your treatment plan.

482
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:05.610
Mike: I do actually have one question. I don't know if it's

483
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.410
Mike: My

484
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.300
Mike: Treatment plan or not, but

485
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.640
Mike: I got an email.

486
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:28.620
Mike: From bright heart health virtual clinic that they had sent me a package um I have got a notorious mailman here that sticks are male in the wrong places. We have a community mailbox.

487
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.320
Mike: And my mail goes to the neighbors.

488
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:45.360
Mike: All the time. We've spoken with postmaster about it, and according to him, he's talked to the person and this and that. But our mail still gets brought by our neighbors sometimes

489
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:58.920
Mike: On sometimes we don't receive stuff and it's gotta get recent um I've had issues. And so I don't know if I should have received that package yet or not, but

490
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:01.710
Mike: I have yet to receive it. I don't

491
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.370
Know,

492
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Virtual clinic, they handle all of that.

493
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:08.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, yeah, you can

494
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:14.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reach out to one and see what's going on. Other than that, that was really the only question that I

495
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:23.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have, did you want to add any short term or long term goals to your treatment plan and then you mentioned getting your driver's license thing legal issues fix anything else.

496
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.380
Mike: Um, yeah, a painting my journeymen license for

497
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.010
Work.

498
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.470
Mike: Is another one.

499
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:34.560
Mike: That's

500
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:43.710
Mike: Made. I guess it would be like the mid to long range goal because I'm about a year and a half, two years out from that.

501
01:03:46.920 --> 01:04:03.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it was nice meeting you and look forward to practicing some stuff looking more into what triggers could possibly be and find some chocolate connections to present situation to help you be aware of this cycle. And can I get out of it.

502
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right.

503
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So have a good night. Thank you do the same. Thank you for everything.

504
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:10.080
