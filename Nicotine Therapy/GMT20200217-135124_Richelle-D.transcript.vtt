4
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.410
Alyse: Because they don't see what our budget. It's so hard for me to get up at

5
00:00:44.130 --> 00:01:00.540
Alyse: Whatever. Time is of the morning in a bed that I'm not used to being in anymore and feed babies. You know, I mean, and not drop them because you know that's what I like to do. I'm just joking. I don't like to do that. But, you know, like it happen, so it's easier for me to like just

9
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:15.090

10
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.120
Alyse: And then up know they robbed maybe before that it wasn't too bad. But still, like what you have in it, sleeping so long that should I mean that's still sucks.

11
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.680
Alyse: Like I could sleep right life away for about, like, a week and probably still not be caught up on sleep.

Richelle Direny: When I asked your worker who Paul, so I thought you know she, the case is closed and who is she said no, she went on, I thought she said maternity leave, but I guess I could be wrong.

48
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.690
Alyse: I'm so she came by the house the other day.

49
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.550
Alyse: And

50
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.620
Alyse: It so happened that well i think a lot of this summer's I can't talk about

51
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.470
Alyse: What

52
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.260
Alyse: put her down for a minute, not that big of a deal then put her down.

53
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.240
Alyse: So much pain.

54
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:06.510
Alyse: So when this all like transpired with the hospital and everything I had been a lot of in my system. So she told me she said

55
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:16.950
Alyse: Just get medical marijuana card, you know, late to the state because you have to have documented documented pain problems or whatever in my back so screwed up that

56
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:30.780
Alyse: I can just go get all my papers from my doctor and take them to the doctor there and I get a card, you know, automatically, and she's like, well, we want you to just to have one on record, just in case anything. You know what I mean, like,

57
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:43.620
Alyse: In case there's ever a time way down the road where something was to happen when the case was over there and you had in your system. We could say you are prescribed by a doctor and I thought, you know what I mean.

58
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.520
Alyse: So I was like okay well I guess that's what I needed to get to do

59
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.420
Richelle Direny: But how does that relate to what you're taking now. No.

60
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.650
Alyse: No, that's nothing. That's this is not a problem that's not a problem. Either there's really not a problem.

61
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.110
Alyse: Oh, but because the case.

62
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:08.790
Alyse: Open prior. Yeah, because there was a prior remove this is why this all happened like this one have been like this if it was

63
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:21.330
Alyse: If I never had a prior prior removal before like a couple of years back when I started taking my, I have to try to talk a certain way because the kids around, you know, sorry.

64
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:36.690
Alyse: When I decided to take the turn the right turn down the right road years back, while my parents didn't at the time and they so decided to do what they were going to do was so while I was in soberly. My mother lead

65
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:49.770
Alyse: And they went to the state was going to take us to the of my son from them and that's when they decided to take the right road.

66
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.830
Alyse: You know, I mean, so

67
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.270
Richelle Direny: You're that you have now.

68
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.470

73
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:21.960
Alyse: I guess. Yeah. Like we broke up and he kept him and then told me that he had moved way far away where I couldn't find him, you know, and get to him, but they didn't. They move like three blocks from where they used to live.

74
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.660
Alyse: And then he sent all of the papers for our divorce to the wrong address, even though it's documented, you know, even though. Like, I've had

75
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.190
Alyse: Like, like he knows how to find me. He knew where my parents live

76
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.240
Alyse: I

77
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.650
Richelle Direny: See that some at all.

78
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.090
Alyse: What

79
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.920
Richelle Direny: You don't see that son at all.

80
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.300
Alyse: No, not, not right now.

81
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.580
Alyse: Not right now. And a lawyer. I used to get all this custody stuff done.

82
00:07:50.430 --> 00:08:04.890
Alyse: With Xavier. I don't know what happened to him or show. I don't know if he passed away. I don't know because I've tried to contact and called the times he's number like contact me back like we sold him money from like the case with my son, and he's never like in

83
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.840
Alyse: There's not an office that I know we just met him down like at the juvenile center.

84
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:16.890
Alyse: Like cannot find this way. And so I don't know if he stopped practicing. I don't know what happened.

85
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.260
Richelle Direny: I mean, but if you owe him money and he's all he can do. Then

86
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.670
Alyse: Yeah, that yeah and that's like $500 so if he was alive.

87
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.380
Alyse: But I don't mean it like that. So if something has happened to him.

88
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.640
Alyse: You know, God bless your soul, but at the same time, it's like, well, I'm not going to chase after you no longer because

89
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:46.410
Richelle Direny: You want your money. You don't want your money, you know, so, so how is the How did everything

90
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.970
Richelle Direny: How is everything going with the school.

91
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.500
Alyse: Oh, so

92
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.940
Alyse: Let's see. Where do we start that had to bounce back and forth between school and school

93
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.320
Did you go

94
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.790
Richelle Direny: To

95
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.090
Alyse: When you attend yeah yeah and and and and with her. It's not a problem. It's, it's Xavier that I'm having a problem with

96
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:30.870
Alyse: We kind of like we we talked, and we did what we did was with her and kind of did like a scary thing like Bader thought she was going to get like suspended for like two weeks.

97
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.390
Alyse: Because she was very close with that principle, you know, they mean she's very close with

98
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.300
Richelle Direny: You said that she got in a fight.

99
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:52.950
Alyse: So it started off that she's on $20 and traded and then scroll wanted to trade their credit card that her mom gives her for some reason for this $20. So she comes home with a credit card.

100
00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:06.600
Alyse: That is used whatever she takes, you know, we get it all figured out to the school, whatever. And then she started posting things on Tick tock like Connor pitch.

101
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.290
Alyse: And stuff like that. And it was like

102
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:20.940
Alyse: Okay, now we have new United mean I was going to afford far because even though it's outside of school that's so boring. You know what I mean. So that should that a joke.

103
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.980
Alyse: So,

104
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:32.370
Alyse: You know I assistant principal that deals with these kids like she's very close both so you know basically

105
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:41.670
Alyse: Like he you know he had her understand that. Listen, you've lost my trash kind of thing and so on and so forth.

106
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:51.600
Alyse: But ever since then she's been doing better. She has been doing great, great, you know, I mean, I've had sit down with a teacher and a counselor about a class and other than their things good

107
00:10:51.990 --> 00:11:07.530
Alyse: It's mine said I'm having a problem with and I just don't understand anymore, Rochelle. He's at the state where he's like he's a miserable little boy. He really is. He it's like I i feel like he thinks I owe him something in life. You know what I mean, like,

108
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:20.610
Alyse: He's so miserable because I he says I don't love him because I guess his understanding is, we don't leave and go places and do things together. So that means I don't love him, of course.

109
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:40.320
Alyse: But he, but, you know, last week, he was like I said something about. He said, I'm gonna kill myself. And I'm thinking, first of all, part of me is like second of us like because like suicide. I mean, I guess can say runs in my family. I've had numerous family members.

110
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.760
Richelle Direny: cry for attention.

111
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.860
Alyse: Yeah. Did you

112
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:49.320
Richelle Direny: Notice that it became more where he started acting out more after the babies were born.

113
00:11:50.040 --> 00:12:00.330
Alyse: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the thing is, it's like, I mean he's always had this mouth, and he always decides he wants to talk to me like I'm a piece of shit constantly. This is a horrible thing.

114
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.640
Alyse: That hasn't changed. It's just this outlook in this attitude and he's like, you know, Oh, I hate people. I don't want to be around people so that

115
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:19.740
Alyse: Lead to them to act. However, in school. I've had to sit down with teachers because He's disrespectful and he's not getting worked on these honestly if he sees that and it's like

116
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:29.190
Alyse: I, I tried to like I'm, I'm actually going to send him the school tomorrow with his social and his information. Um, so you can do counseling.

117
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.010
Richelle Direny: Does the counseling come to the house where they meet with you.

118
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:50.520
Alyse: Well they I can. It's a school, which is like a couple shoots away from me. So I basically I go there and talk to her, you know, I mean, I've talked to her on the phone, a couple times it's through like Ohio guides, though, which is its own

119
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:58.110
Alyse: Its own like thing around here. You know, it's like a service for people

120
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:08.520
Alyse: And I'm gonna let him do that. It makes me nervous because it's like, oh God was going to come out of his mouth. You know, I mean like

121
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:21.360
Alyse: 11 years old, he doesn't understand that some things can get people in trouble that that I would think you would try to get in trouble. And I don't know what his perspective is of things sometimes, you know, but like

122
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:33.540
Richelle Direny: But like I said, remember, even when you were going through what you were going through with your fiance and the babies. You have to, I mean you can be fearful of what because I mean children.

123
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.400
Richelle Direny: Children will say whatever you understand, especially when they're frustrated

124
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:47.190
Richelle Direny: When they don't they don't understand the repercussions of the things that they say and how we can impact their people. And so sometimes

125
00:13:47.910 --> 00:14:01.740
Richelle Direny: I mean, if you were supposed to live your life in fear of what they're going to say, then you, you become a hermit, you will never want to send them anywhere because you're fearful I'm children are smart to children, they will say things

126
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:11.490
Richelle Direny: Because they want some type of drama in their own way of what they see us sometimes they will do that.

127
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:19.020
Alyse: Yeah, he ever been to that was her he did the counseling with her and she went to school and told them all kinds of stuff.

128
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.050
Alyse: And, uh, however, would have already happened to be called TPS I remember something

129
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:34.890
Alyse: But that I've already talked to her. And they're like, Listen, we go through this like a grain of salt. Like we understand it's coming out of 11 year old smile. You know what I mean. We kind of dig into things, and I'll be sure to let them know

130
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:42.930
Alyse: You know beforehand life for him and what it was like in that the, you know what I mean. And let them understand he's not well my child.

131
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.900
Richelle Direny: Will always have to look at it, it's like it. Sometimes it

132
00:14:47.910 --> 00:15:00.480
Richelle Direny: And I think it's just kind of like the misconception that people have and just kind of the negative part of once he gets involved in your life. Everybody just looks at the negative part and not necessarily the positive part because

133
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:11.490
Richelle Direny: I'm you know i've been i've had families. I've worked with families who the kid like will say, you know, like that show that used to call on yours go keep. Say the Darndest Things

134
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.570
Alyse: Oh, yeah.

135
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:19.260
Richelle Direny: Well, I think it still does it. Now with with Tiffany had ish but but it's just like the kids will say things and

136
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.540
Richelle Direny: They are truth there. There's some with some children there is truth to it because then

137
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:32.130
Richelle Direny: They open up and it's nice and then you find out way more than then every that everybody was trying to cover up for that was going on with the child.

138
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:49.320
Richelle Direny: But then there are other times where it is a cry for help and I worked with a family where it was like that. Um, so you just have to kind of meet the child, where they're at and with your son, a lot of it seems like more of attention behavior.

139
00:15:49.860 --> 00:16:00.330
Richelle Direny: And I talked about it in the past about giving his history with you for your time with action being removed from you live them with grandma and grandpa.

140
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:17.070
Richelle Direny: Their own on addiction and just so he has a lot of pent up frustration and anger and he's just using it now as a way, because that's what they will do you will kind of use it to some degree as a way to try to get away with his behavior.

141
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.340
Richelle Direny: And just to just say, Hey, listen, you

142
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:34.800
Richelle Direny: Know you can, you know, it's one thing that we've had our history, and we've had it. But if we work through it. You're not going to try to use it. We tried to get away with the things that you want to get away with not

143
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.920
Richelle Direny: And even if he goes to counsel and I think that it would. It's nice for him to go to counseling.

144
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:52.980
Richelle Direny: Um, and you to kind of do like a drop in here and there. But remember, you're doing your own thing. So even if he said something in you know somebody wants to get real Gideon call CPS again.

145
00:16:53.610 --> 00:17:03.510
Richelle Direny: They are oftentimes, like I said, it can be open and shut case, they'll come in, they'll do their investigation and they'll be like, Okay, well, there's nothing here to continue because like you said.

146
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:18.870
Richelle Direny: The real thorough ones they go through all the time. And the problem is on honestly Elise and I know we're on a borderline and everything. But the problem is, I mean, I think, as a society, we've given children way to autonomy.

147
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.660
Richelle Direny: Were any little thing that is said and done it.

148
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.350
Richelle Direny: All oh my god like they're bringing in the Calvary.

149
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:29.310
Alyse: And

150
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:42.180
Richelle Direny: Know that, and this is what you have to contend with. I mean, I have children of my own, and having an open dialogue with your children is very important to some degree open dialogue that you're not gonna

151
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:51.930
Richelle Direny: You know, have adult conversations with them, but having an open dialogue, because you'll be surprised what they teach them in

152
00:17:54.390 --> 00:18:09.480
Richelle Direny: You'll be surprised what the into the what they they empower them with in school and I noticed because my children come home in the town. So, you know, that is, you know, can see one little work. Oh, my teachers. And you can see that because then

153
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.050
Alyse: Oh, yeah.

154
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:22.770
Alyse: Yeah, it is all big thing is talent to be challenged you guys gonna be like, I'm gonna be like, you know, I like I'm about to bust your ass. But, you know, I've never

155
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:35.040
Alyse: They can never known. What I heard is other, other than HIM HURTING himself. You know what I mean. But it's always been my thing. Like, just how it wasn't my parents probably that's how they used to get me scare the shit out of me. All time with their words.

156
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:49.770
Alyse: And he's like, That's child abuse. Unlike child abuse is locking you in a in a closet for, you know, a month with no light and little food mean within your ass is not child abuse. You're my son B.

157
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:57.060
Richelle Direny: And C and but see the thing is, again, they're they're taught that in school, but then it's like you said, it's

158
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.950
Richelle Direny: having that conversation.

159
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.870
Richelle Direny: And educating them.

160
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.010
About certain

161
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:11.340
Richelle Direny: Music As trigger words to say, Oh, you can't speak to me or you can't say, A, B, or C to me because it's always kind of like a miss.

162
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:22.050
Richelle Direny: Misguided words and just just not having real understanding of this one. Again, not to say that there are not children that's out there, abuse, and when the light is shining

163
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:30.810
Richelle Direny: Then really find out there is a whole lot more to the story. Now with all of that said with the children accident, which is what I alluded to.

164
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.700
Richelle Direny: When he told me about what was going on with your, your daughter, your daughter.

165
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:52.800
Richelle Direny: It's also remember you and like, how is you inherit relationship now because I know like he goes out and drinking them her mom is doing her own thing. So it's just kind of like a whole so convoluted situation that's going on. Like how is the relationship between you and him now and

166
00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:07.560
Alyse: It was somewhat okay and then they got bad again and I I don't even know. I don't keep track anymore. I'm just miserable because I'm in the house all the time with kids. I don't go anywhere. I don't do anything like

167
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.810
Alyse: Weeks and weeks been told, or no do something. Never happens like

168
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:25.050
Alyse: sorry if I sound like I'm like selfish or whatever but like I need some goddamn time to myself like this isn't okay anymore. And I'm starting to lose my piano solo

169
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.950
Alyse: Like, and then I have all this other shit going on. It's just like, Come on, man. When do I get a goddamn break

170
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:42.780
Alyse: Like, I know that it's not like mothers get breaks all the time was, whatever. But like, I'm taking care of to the Barbies on top of for their children. And you do nothing but sit down. Sit down. Do time

171
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.340
Alyse: Today, so I have to watch right

172
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.630

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:07.740
Alyse: Yeah, but they've been handfuls during the day, like they're getting to the point we're not sleeping, you know, all time anymore. They're up

176
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:19.890

Alyse: I don't care anymore when people start to care about at least. And I'll start to care get until then everybody can go to hell.

182
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.670
Alyse: I'll be selfish. So this time.

216
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.910
Richelle Direny: A hard to see the appreciation. When you're exhausted.

217
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:59.730
Richelle Direny: They're kind of everything. It is. It is hard to see the appreciation and value appreciation. Yeah, you're, you're one

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.610
Alyse: You know, I mean,

Richelle Direny: I got it.

228
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.170

Alyse: I mean, to me it's like we get to get our, you know, you can get away when you don't come home for eight hours or whatever it is that

232
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.290
Alyse: I

233
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:21.180
Alyse: Don't want

234
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.100
Richelle Direny: To say it isn't.

235
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:36.720
Richelle Direny: It's like, don't feel bad about how you feel right now. Don't feel bad about you know the feeling of wanting some time alone because the reality is

236
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:54.390
Richelle Direny: We do whether we have one kid to kid. I mean, you have six it is that is that that is a lot of mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, I mean, hey, I don't have six kids book one saying, money, money, money, money, money, it's just like, oh my god.

Richelle Direny: Like you shouldn't feel that way or thinking that way.

241
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:11.370
Richelle Direny: But again,

242
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.390
Richelle Direny: It's being intentional about finding and saying, Hey, listen.

243

Richelle Direny: I have to get out of here. I have to. However, it is you keep the kids and I'm leaving, I'm leaving for whether it's a few hours or half a day just to be able to breathe.

Alyse: Sorry.

250
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.910
Alyse: Sorry, I didn't hear. Whatever you just said.

251
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:19.380
Richelle Direny: No, I was saying, I definitely get it and I was saying that after I had my last child. I remember going back to work and someone asking me, How do you feel. And I said, I'm on vacation.

Alyse: You know, you can take everybody likes to act like I don't do anything around here or I nothing but you'll see when I can't move and can do nothing for everybody, how much I'm really worth that people

268
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:47.010
Alyse: And she luckily for the first time in her life found somebody who seems to be a pretty decent guy when she was working there. And they've been going out for a little bit.

269
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:54.390
Alyse: And they both got fired at the same time, you know, like they let everybody go so um she

270
00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.060
Alyse: We have something called the human arc around here on. It's like a company that does like

271

Alyse: I don't know, they help you whenever shall cry. Listen, Mackenzie crying isn't going to make anything better. Okay. You haven't felt good for days.

272
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.610
Alyse: Take you need some time on on your system. You haven't taken Tylenol sent yesterday.

273
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.340
Alyse: Now what do you take Tylenol.

274
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.770
Alyse: In the morning, yeah that's yesterday, for the most part, so

275
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.530
Alyse: Please take some Tylenol.

276
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:39.210
Alyse: She's that she's had a fever and Saturday. So she's Tylenol on break it. I'm in town. I would break it. But it comes right back so

277
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.190
Richelle Direny: Because you're supposed to. Are you are you doing every four hours Tao Nolan motion.

278
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.900
Alyse: No, I'm just doing it on

279
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.250
Richelle Direny: That's what breaks it. It's so let's say she takes the like the monitoring is

280
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.650
Alyse: Eight hours right yeah yeah so you can

281
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.420
Alyse: You can overlap them.

282
00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:07.020
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so you have, if you take the multi now four hours from now you will take the Tylenol. And then at the end of the eight hours, which would be the next four hours, you will take the motoring. So that's what I learned when

283
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:15.180
Richelle Direny: I think one of my kids. And that's what the doctor told me, you, you, you, you switch them up motoring Tyler Hamilton. Turns out, and that's what breaks it

284
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.160
Richelle Direny: taking a little break it.

285
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.540
Alyse: Yeah, because I'm like

286
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.530
Alyse: She's been taking Tylenol for too long. Now I. To me, this is

287
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.840
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And how long has it been going on.

288
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.460
Alyse: She got sick Saturday.

289
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.410
Alyse: And today's Monday. So, Saturday, Sunday today, then

290
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:36.600
Richelle Direny: So I mean after today if it's like if it's still things for high, then you'll take it to the doctor.

291
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.100
Alyse: Lot. Maybe I should go. I'm gonna go with the motor and then and then start doing that, then

292
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.990
Alyse: So I've ever Tylenol right now.

293
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.100
Alyse: Because I I like at the hospital, they'll give you Tylenol motoring the same time.

294
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:57.210
Richelle Direny: They know they give it to you. And I think that's where I learned to it's from the hospital. Listen, I paid for the biggest bill for a motor in one year. My child was sick.

295
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:06.600
Richelle Direny: And I remember it because I went to the hospital because my just the same thing you were going through with the, the high fever.

296
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:21.990
Richelle Direny: My son, he, he would. That's how he can see he just has a very high fever, and it wasn't breaking it was going on, continuously and I was doing the same exact thing. And I gave the Pete, I went to the emergency room. They gave them Voltron. And all of a sudden people went away.

297
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.280
Richelle Direny: Really

298
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:28.800
Alyse: I'm like I'm you know I'm aware of some old generally click done because I can't, I can't.

299
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:37.620
Richelle Direny: And that's what they told me from there it was from then was that you do it every four hours Moultrie time on and that breaks it

300
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.880
Alyse: Okay, well I guess that'll be my thing to do, once I get off the phone with you.

301
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:53.430
Alyse: Because I i know i know that they give you like I've always even in the hospital for whatever they give you like town all the giving motor and whatever back right so screwed up.

302
00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:55.590
Alyse: Sorry.

303
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.800
Alyse: Ridiculous.

304
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:00.990
Alyse: Yeah.

305
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:08.010
Alyse: I know about the town hall emotional thing. I just didn't think that it was. You know what I mean, like, whatever. So

306
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:08.820
Alyse: I think

307
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:15.750
Richelle Direny: If the fever persist after three days I think of you doing that, then you have to take them so

308
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.510
Alyse: I'll make sure I programs.

309
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:24.420
Alyse: Because, because, like, if I give a Tylenol now within an hour that fever won't be a fever. It'll break. It's good.

310
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.980
Richelle Direny: But then it comes back.

311
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:26.820
Alyse: Yep. Yeah.

312
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.140
Richelle Direny: So and so

313
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:37.200
Richelle Direny: The same thing because I'm like, oh, it's gone. But then it comes right back. And if you'll notice that it seems like at night. It's when the fever coming back and it's

314
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.460
Alyse: It so whatever

315
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:42.270
Richelle Direny: When you're if you notice when you're sick. When do you feel worst

316
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.800
Alyse: Of the worst in the morning and at night.

317
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:44.730
Alyse: At night.

318
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:59.910
Richelle Direny: I don't know what is it about the barometric pressure or whatever they say, but it's something at night that makes you feel worse. But, um, but you have to do the town on Voltron every four hours each until the end. Then you'll notice that it will completely break

319
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:14.910
Alyse: Okay, well, I'll make sure I go with Simone turn after that's done so by by tonight. Hopefully it'll break, break, I mean, because it's a low grade temperature. Now, I mean, she was at 103 like Saturday night, you know, but she just got the bathtub to so that didn't help.

320
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.140
Richelle Direny: Of course not.

321
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:23.130
Alyse: I mean, the highest had been like 102.1 and then last night. It was at 100 100 points something

322
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.600
Alyse: You can do you can do. And of course,

323
00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:34.200
Alyse: Those 100.3 Saturday night when you go out the bathtub. It has not been that high.

324
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:36.810
Alyse: Oh,

325
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.230
Alyse: Hundred point three.

326
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.380
Alyse: Characteristic or not just done.

327
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:56.730
Richelle Direny: Like sometimes like in some. One of the things like you know kind of all was killed. What, when they're really, really warm at night. I've done, um, the more I mean I'm the biggest fan of mo trend.

328
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.700
Richelle Direny: But then if you get like they're really, really warm. I feel like you're really, really warm. You get a rag.

329
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:10.050
Richelle Direny: I did rag and if you put it on them and for whatever reason, it sucks because then to drag the regulars dry.

330
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.460
Alyse: Yeah yeah

331
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.140
Richelle Direny: Whatever reason, it pulls the heat out how it doesn't. I don't know, or

332
00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.880
Richelle Direny: Or you could use vixen rub them down before they go to bed.

333

354
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.290
Richelle Direny: So when you're in and it's not good to feel that way because

355
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:26.340
Richelle Direny: The more it builds up the more eventually without you even realizing it unintentionally. It's kind of like

356
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:42.960
Richelle Direny: You have a soda bottle you keep shaking it up. You keep shaking up it's building up all that pressure and without you popping the cover or whatever it was going to explode because it needs to release that pressure, it needs to release all of that and so

357
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:48.120
Richelle Direny: You will to sit him down and just letting always

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:57.870
Richelle Direny: I'm not saying I don't want to be here for the kids. But right now I need a break.

361
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:24.300
Richelle Direny: When the kids are sick, they are really just going to go to you for whatever that naturally everybody kind of gravitates to mom mom is the healer. The fixer she figured everything out. She knows exactly what's wrong. She has the right touch. She has the right

362
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:31.620
Richelle Direny: I remember when my daughter was younger and she would have stomach cramps literally Elise, you know what I would do.

363
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.190
Richelle Direny: would raise my hand and personally and the pain is gone. Seriously, we mean

364
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.220
Alyse: Jesus

365
00:39:42.720 --> 00:40:00.240
Richelle Direny: What do you mean, she was like, just, just put your hand there. That's it. And now it's gone, it's gone. You move the hand, it comes back, but you put your hand back there. You understand in their mind, everything is okay because you are there. And so in the family plays such an important role.

366
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:18.870
Richelle Direny: And they they want you for everything you are the answer to everything. And so, it pulls your and it pulls everything out of you. But what you're saying, which all women who are mothers in a relationship to I need to go and kind of recuperate

367
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:37.080
Richelle Direny: I need some time to kind of unwind and we strengthen get that my energy everything, but they don't see them. They just see is your the I'm hungry, I'm hungry. Okay I step out there. There's nothing to eat. Okay, that is sitting right there wire.

368
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:37.590
Alyse: Yeah.

369
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:42.300

Richelle Direny: Find my socks are go look in the dry looked. What do you mean, what is sitting right there, baby, see you as

371
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.900
Alyse: Cancer to

372
00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:07.920
Richelle Direny: To have the event. If you go in and it's being mindful of your presentation because then he taken on the defense and he saying, Well, I never told them to go to. You are never told him to do this.

373
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:15.150
Richelle Direny: But then you're not necessarily presenting that you can help. And if they're coming to me for everything in your city right there.

374
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:25.860
Richelle Direny: You're not redirecting them in saying, but I'm right here, why are you calling me. Why are you going to hurt you can come to me. I am sitting right here, but you have to, you have to

375
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:33.660
Richelle Direny: Let him know. Listen, this is really true, how I am feeling that is in this is the thing.

376
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.230
Richelle Direny: If we ever really truly stop.

377
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.950
Richelle Direny: To understand when you hear women out there.

378
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:51.570
Richelle Direny: Let the script and they go in, they hurt, everybody. We just like how she felt horrible why she this and why she has anybody ever stopped to say

379
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:52.890
Who was there.

380
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.250
Richelle Direny: When she kept saying, I need help. I'm

381
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.040
Alyse: Although what happened that made her do that like

382
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:01.950
Alyse: What I do, I can, I can understand because

383
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.220
Alyse: It's like I know what it feels like at this point.

384
00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.640
Richelle Direny: So there was years ago your

385
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.170
Alyse: There was this

386
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:10.980
Richelle Direny: Woman who

387
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:20.310
Richelle Direny: She had I think she had five children, and he was five children and you know she killed them.

388
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:35.700
Richelle Direny: But then, you know, everybody was looking at her, like, How dare she does that, that's a horrible. Why would she do that to all these children. So because of, you know, being in the counseling profession. Sometimes they make you go to the seminar when you set and you listen to the backstory.

389
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.100
Richelle Direny: What led up to that day.

390
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:48.930
Richelle Direny: You realize how many people are held accountable, because there were the signs. There were the who was there. It was mom.

391
00:42:49.560 --> 00:43:09.930
Richelle Direny: Dad, who worked was always out of the house. She always with the children then you had mom would come in very seldom then you had Dr. All of this information was here and there. Just say old take this medication, but who was truly there to say, Mom.

392
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.200
Richelle Direny: Why don't you go take a nap. I will keep the kids.

393
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:21.150
Richelle Direny: Especially in it and it makes it even that much harder when you are a stay at home mom taking care of all these children with zero break

394
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:33.690
Richelle Direny: You. It's almost like you like you go blank and then not because now you are just so overwhelmed, you're so tired, you're so exhausted. You see nothing else, like you said,

395
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:42.810
Richelle Direny: You are so angry on the inside your soul over everything that's going on. Eventually, it's kind of like a blank out and now you act.

396
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:53.190
Richelle Direny: So then you have to sit and you have to say hey listen tell the children. Hey, you guys go do whatever find something to do. Take your sisters

397
00:43:53.490 --> 00:44:01.980
Richelle Direny: They're fed if they're asleep or even put the babies to sleep. Tell everybody to do their own thing and you have a heart to heart with peril and let me know.

398
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:23.130
Richelle Direny: I need a break. I appreciate that you give me all these gifts. I appreciate the $200 Alta car. But you know what that $200 could have been paid at a hotel for me to just go and stay for two days. I need some time away I need if you want me to be my best self.

399
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:27.360
Richelle Direny: To you are the children. I need to get away.

400
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:35.370
Alyse: Yeah, like it didn't at the end of all this, and I feel like I'm the bad guy because I'm the one that needs to be that because

401
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.260
Alyse: What kind of mother needs to get away from their kids. What kind of mother needs a break from their house. What kind of

402
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.990
Alyse: Like you know i mean like nobody understands

403
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:54.480
Richelle Direny: But then you put it back. Okay, well, what kind of father who just okay you leave, you go to work and you come home and the minute they say that that that that do run away. Why would you run away.

404
00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:11.460
Richelle Direny: My the point of the matter is, you cannot feel guilty, the kind of mother loves her kids to know when she has gotten to the point where she's no longer effective and she needs some time away to just breathe.

405
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:21.120
Alyse: Yeah, that's, I feel like I feel like I'm not worth anything right now because I'm just so in such a dark place because I was so angry and so overwhelmed.

406
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.300
Richelle Direny: And that's just

407
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:40.020
Richelle Direny: If that question is asked you answer it. HONESTLY THE KIND OF MOTHER THAT LOVES her family enough to say I need to step away how I am feeling inside. It's no good for me or for anybody else I need

408
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:51.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and that's the reality of it. There is the same, that it takes a village to raise children. There is a reason why they have that same. Yeah.

409
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.290
Alyse: It's true.

410
00:45:52.650 --> 00:46:01.800
Richelle Direny: We can't one person just cannot do it effectively you need someone to come and say hey you know what go

411
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:11.610
Richelle Direny: I remember when as a first time mom, a friend of mine came over and she was just going to sleep, and I will keep the baby.

412
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:25.170
Richelle Direny: The same way you feel you feel guilty, you don't necessarily enjoy it. So then you sit and you hang out because you feel bad. I mean, if I knew then what I know now, I would have been like here, now I'm

413
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.720
Richelle Direny: Out of fear.

414
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:41.250
Richelle Direny: Is because the person is giving you the opportunity to say, go take a long shower, if that's what you

415
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:48.690
Richelle Direny: Do whatever it is that should do. Just relax. Yeah.

416
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:58.560
Richelle Direny: If you have to just be intentional, I hear you talk a lot about your mom and your sister. Does he have family members that can come in and help

417
00:46:59.100 --> 00:46:59.520
Know,

418
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.060
Richelle Direny: You the only child.

419
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.000
Alyse: No, he has other ones, one that just doesn't

420
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.010
Alyse: But no.

421
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:21.600
Alyse: Thank you, his family. Well, I mean I my family's not like his name was not like my family, my family like his family and I say family, but I'm really me, my mom and my sister, like I'm not talking about like cousins and aunts and stuff like that. You know what I mean.

422
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:25.920
Alyse: To know he has like some media. No, no, no.

423
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:44.430
Richelle Direny: And and like even like on a time like this. I know the kids are home it's thinking about what it has been a good idea. Do you guys like a Boys and Girls Club or something that the kids could have gone to for the day.

424
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.140
Alyse: Yeah, like, I mean,

425
00:47:47.400 --> 00:48:00.870
Alyse: I wish I was a mother. Again, like I was really good, like a couple like a year back or so like during the summertime, at least everyday taking them somewhere or going to the park or going to hear their, things like that. You don't need

426
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:11.520
Alyse: And most things still would involve one of us having to go anyways. It was him being under the weather, but the other one. I mean, he's sick, I guess.

427
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:25.320
Alyse: You know, and then me I am it's we still have snow out here. So I'm not, you know, like the beans only been out like one other time other than to get their ears beers like out in public. They never

428
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:34.170
Alyse: In three months. They've been out like four times. You know, so I don't take them out and things like that. I know you know i'm i'm getting here, whatever, and then

429
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:38.760
Alyse: I don't know. I mean, I guess it would be nice to probably take them.

430
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:44.070
Alyse: Even if I was like, hey, love to go. We're going to go across the street to the rec center that we have here.

431
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:54.360
Alyse: But a little one would be able to go because he has to have a parent with them, you know, and then go swim, and then you know the probably other two would go just to want to go because I'm going or something, you know,

432
00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:09.180
Alyse: I mean, that's like the type of, like, like I think I might have like I at least want to try to do it right. The best I can, as a parent, with these two girls because I never did it right with my two boys, you know, I mean,

433
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:11.040
Alyse: And it's like,

434
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:19.590
Alyse: I want to be that mom that it's like has all this stuff planned to do every day or throughout the week and

435
00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:26.340
Alyse: This that or whatever in that way. And then it's like, Come on, at least let's get practical. You know what you mean.

436
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.410
Richelle Direny: To say, okay, real

437
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.300
Alyse: Yeah, like like this isn't how it's really going to be in life you know I mean by at least

438
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.030
Richelle Direny: Not for you. It's not because I tell you I'm not

439
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:40.590
Richelle Direny: Sure.

440
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.210
Alyse: If

441
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.990
Richelle Direny: You will have to what is your like work within

442
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.650
Richelle Direny: The within your own way. There are people out there that they have like everything down to

443
00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.090
Richelle Direny: When they have this plan and that plan, they're going to go to the table and they're going to do this and they're going to do that.

444
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:07.050
Richelle Direny: Alarm for people like that. That's just their personality. Number one, that's just feel personality that's just, they are even there like that rigid in life for themselves.

445
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:15.810
Richelle Direny: What is reality for you and work within. And remember, at least we've talked about, you're an amazing

446
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:24.630
Richelle Direny: Mom now in everything that you're doing. You're amazing. Mom, not just to your first children, but to your stepchildren

447
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:37.890
Richelle Direny: You're doing a whole world of things to the children that you have and you're keeping it together and you're consistent and you're there, they wake up and they see you. They go on come home from school, they see you the school call you, you're there.

448
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:43.200
Alyse: You understand. Yeah, you know. Yeah. Like, that's how I tried it on like like Xavier. Oh, I don't love you.

449
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:53.430
Alyse: You are you don't let me I don't love you. I'm sitting here on a freezing cold, snowy day you don't. I mean, trying to talk to these people.

450
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:59.790
Alyse: And try to talk to you and help you understand. I guess I told her, I said, I don't want you to think is a banshee and such. And because it's not

451
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:08.520
Alyse: You're a beautiful little boy, you don't mean you're smart, you know what I mean like tried a lot of know even I didn't crying because I was like, I know you can do so much better. You know what I mean.

452
00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:17.430
Alyse: Like I don't love you guys. I don't care about you guys, but I do that like I'm there if you need me. You know, I mean, I might not take you to the store because you want this right now.

453
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:30.540
Alyse: But, you know, we get there, or I'm into school vouching for you, or I'm there to back you up when you're having a hard time with this friend, or I'm there to listen to you when you feel sad because she doesn't come. You know what I mean.

454
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:44.790
Alyse: Like, I'm sure. No, not the best I could be better, but I think I do a pretty dang good job. At least I try my ball short just like everybody else bullying me let me find those perfect fairy tale woman out here, they can do it all.

455
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.070
Alyse: Again, either.

456
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.780
Richelle Direny: They only exist or two.

457
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.900
Richelle Direny: And that's not even real. So it's it's you're doing the best you can.

458
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.830
Richelle Direny: And you have to be mindful that face.

459
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:04.020
Alyse: This, this girl on I wait, what do you need me for

460
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:10.320
Alyse: You to cook breakfast. Is that what you want with what just bacon, because that's all that there is there's no eggs.

461
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:18.720
Alyse: You want to get all the dishes out of there so I can get that done with kitchen can be cleaned before we cook. Sorry.

462
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:22.140
Richelle Direny: So,

463
00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:28.770
Richelle Direny: You're doing and also be mindful that you're not setting the bar too high for yourself.

464
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:39.780
Richelle Direny: Because we all do we all set the bar super high for ourselves. And then when we don't reach those goals. Then we start becoming very hard in ourselves.

465
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.270
Alyse: So just be mindful, you know,

466
00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:43.320
Richelle Direny: Be mindful, like what

467
00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:45.210
Alyse: Future that you have created

468
00:52:45.240 --> 00:53:00.690
Richelle Direny: Your mind of how life should look like for your family. What do you think of great mom. It's for a good mom because right now I'm telling you, think about your history where you were a few years ago to where you were, you were last

469
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:01.710
Year.

470
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:07.260
Richelle Direny: You're doing a phenomenal job you're doing better than most.

471
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:25.320
Richelle Direny: Knowing your history, knowing especially that you're in a relationship that is very rocky, you, you, you're going through it. You're doing a great job you're fighting to keep your family together you're fighting to do the things that you're doing, you're doing an amazing job and but you

472
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.740
Richelle Direny: You can't feel guilty when you don't

473
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:34.260
Richelle Direny: do certain things, or if you feel like know what I need to get away. You can't feel guilty for that.

474
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.560
Richelle Direny: The best of us feel that way.

475
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:40.410
Richelle Direny: The best of them.

476
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.340
Alyse: Was feel that way.

477
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:57.000
Richelle Direny: You just have to do you have to just give yourself credit for what you've done and just say, you know what, in order for me to be better at what it is that I'm doing. I really just

478
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.410
Richelle Direny: And what that time looks like even if it's just a half a day or a day.

479
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:09.720
Richelle Direny: And in the end, in that time that you're awake. Don't feel guilty that you are away.

480
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:16.290
Richelle Direny: Because we all do we all feel guilty. Once we I want the time I want the time and when you get it, you're like,

481
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.580
Alyse: Yeah.

482
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.370
Richelle Direny: I should I shouldn't be here. What do I need to go back home to the know you know you need to relax.

483
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:32.370
Richelle Direny: What is waiting for you will be a next set of problems that once you enter it. You're going to be like, Oh, I should have a

484
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.140
Richelle Direny: Day that I had a way

485
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.200
Alyse: Yeah, right. So,

486
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.390
Richelle Direny: I'm just be mindful of it.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:44.970

602
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.390
Richelle Direny: You don't. You don't take any kind of medication for

603
01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:56.370
Donita McClintic: Now know everything that they tried me on nothing nothing worked. I was on Klonopin which I can't take that with the Suboxone with this medicine.

604
01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.120
Donita McClintic: Which I could with methadone. That doesn't make any sense. But

605
01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:17.730
Donita McClintic: But anyway, so the with the medicine that they tried me on like for the bipolar and nothing work they tried me on Seroquel like 300 milligrams start now and I that it kept me up for days like it. I don't know, it's weird. It does the awesome

606
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.870

608
01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:43.800

01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:12.390
Donita McClintic: See you in the thought about it gives me anxiety. Really something not all the time, but

733
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:25.560
Donita McClintic: I worry I worried, my whole entire life about. I mean, I, you know, when I was a kid, probably for kindergarten. I was worrying and I wish I could turn it off, but I can't.

734
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:36.750
Donita McClintic: So, in my mind, you know, I don't play down all the things that can happen on your trip to town to the grocery store to where I don't want to go.

735
01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:44.970
Donita McClintic: Or if I do go, I'll go like two or three o'clock in the morning because there's you know Walmart whether there's hardly anybody there because

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:47.250
Donita McClintic: I can't do all the people

737
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.820
Donita McClintic: So, I mean,

738
01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.050
Donita McClintic: But I feel like I want to get a job. So

739
01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.230

746
01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:18.720
Donita McClintic: Because I said I, you know, this part of his life was going to be home with them and whatever. But really, I think, that hurt myself. I hurt myself. By doing that, but

747
01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:27.570
Donita McClintic: I don't know. There were spoiled brats. And then they reminded me of things they didn't couldn't wasn't getting any more slow kids wouldn't do that.

01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:56.910
Donita McClintic: Um, she because before this baby was born, they were on Facebook. And they said, Austin was a deadbeat dad. And this is all I said

762
01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:06.690
Donita McClintic: I said, How do you know that when the baby isn't here yet. I said, you're probably right. I mean I agreed with them because I mean his dad was

763
01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:17.370
Donita McClintic: I wish you wouldn't like that. But I mean, Austin. I knew he was going to be there because often as ANXIETY HE REALLY CAN'T leave the house like he's worse than I am and I'm bad, but um

01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:23.280
Donita McClintic: I already knew what it was going to be when he told me that she was pregnant, and I wish it wasn't like that for him but

765
01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:34.710
Donita McClintic: She got pregnant on purpose, like she was trying to get pregnant, she didn't. They didn't know each other like you should have learned that he doesn't go nowhere before you try to

Donita McClintic: Kind of US I've taught. I've talked to my mom about

818
01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:53.280
Donita McClintic: Things when we're by ourselves. My, my step dad, he's who I consider my dad. I mean, my real dad passed away, but my step dad, he's my dad, you know, he raised me

819
01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:56.370
Donita McClintic: He has

820
01:25:57.390 --> 01:26:10.110
Donita McClintic: He does the reverse psychology. He thinks that he can be mean to you is, you know, go to make you be not go do whatever I like that that that doesn't work like that. It's like, I think.

821
01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:28.170
Donita McClintic: Like maybe it's gonna make me cry. Like I told my mom like, I don't feel like a man. I know they're embarrassed to me and and I mean my the second my my next sister Mark Marquis de she had

823
01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:52.830
Donita McClintic: He just he so mean to us and I take everything to heart. He sarcastic been he's been that way. My whole life, and I still. I know. He's kidding on something. Don't make some SHY, HUH.

824
01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:55.200
Richelle Direny: This is your biological father or your

825
01:26:56.130 --> 01:26:59.730
Donita McClintic: Mother my step dad, my step. Yeah, my step dad.

826
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:06.540
Donita McClintic: He but but I look at him like he is my you know that's he raised me

827
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:10.650
Donita McClintic: My road that passed away in 2002

828
01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:12.690
But

829
01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.180
Donita McClintic: But it's like I tell my mom.

830
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:28.410
Donita McClintic: Like I just want him to love me and but i mean i know that he does, but I know that he looks at me different it bothers me. It really bothers me.

831
01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:31.410
Donita McClintic: I'm

832
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:45.720
Donita McClintic: Like I've tried to talk to them before and it just turns into a big argument. So it's better. And then I put pressure on my mom and whatever side is try to

833
01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:48.390
Donita McClintic: Let it go.

834
01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:51.240
Donita McClintic: But

835
01:27:53.970 --> 01:27:56.820
Donita McClintic: Like I've looked at this. I mean, he is the reason

836
01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:03.750
Donita McClintic: Why I mean you he made me who I kept my family, you know, we're from

837
01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:10.560
Donita McClintic: We could be the first one to graduate high school out of there were 14 cousins older than me.

838
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:22.950
Donita McClintic: I don't know. I've always tried to do everything by the book, like I still to this day, I just turned 42 years old and I still am afraid of being getting in trouble.

839
01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:32.400
Donita McClintic: With my parents like I'm gonna be in trouble with my mom and dad because of whatever like I'm scared to death. Like, I'm gonna get grounded or something.

840
01:28:33.210 --> 01:28:51.420
Donita McClintic: I don't understand. Well, that's how I feel. Still today. I've never told no. Shut up. Nothing like nothing like that ever ever done with my parents, but it's like in my mind, I'm still I still try to do everything right by by him and

841
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:55.080
Donita McClintic: Then I'm did really, really wrong.

842
01:28:58.110 --> 01:29:07.710
Donita McClintic: Like, I can't even imagine like I have, I have two kids. I can't imagine what that phone call must have been like for my mom.

843
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:20.970
Donita McClintic: Because, I mean, I was doing good. I quit methadone i had i mean cold turkey acquitted cold turkey for two or three months I had. And you know, I was doing great. And then one day.

853
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:59.160
Donita McClintic: Yeah, yeah, we have alone. I mean, yeah, we was we talked about everything. My mom was my best friend, but

854
01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:04.290
Donita McClintic: Then when it came because how I got started with was

855
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:11.520
Donita McClintic: With a doctor prescribing medicine. I had endometriosis and had to have a hysterectomy. When I was 24

856
01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:22.860
Donita McClintic: And at that time, this was like all in the beginning where no you didn't hear about, you know, stuff like that. So I done what my doctor said to do because that's how we know that's how I thought that you done

857
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:40.800
Donita McClintic: It and then my dad. I mean, he started calling us like showing off in front of like other family members is how I said he would call us Viking queens or Percocet, whatever. Just little stuff like that, um,

858
01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:53.970
Donita McClintic: It's like okay, you don't want me doing stuff and you keep turning into my face, which makes me think about it. So I'm gonna go do a like he got it wrong. He was just not good at that stuff.

859
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.850
Donita McClintic: But

860
01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:58.590
Donita McClintic: I'm

861
01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.850
Sure what some degree.

862
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:02.670
Or mental

863
01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:04.080
Donita McClintic: Going

864
01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:20.670
Donita McClintic: No, no. Now he corrected us if we don't send me one supposed to do we, I mean, we got weapon. We didn't clean the house, you know, do our chores, whatever. But other than that, no, I have to time I thought that was abuse.

865
01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.650
Donita McClintic: But it wasn't

866
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:29.130
Donita McClintic: It was not abuse. I'm glad that he that we was raised, like that because

867
01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:37.800
Donita McClintic: I have a clean house. You know, I have respected morals and I mean I'm a mess up here and there, but

868
01:31:38.850 --> 01:31:39.690
Donita McClintic: I still

869
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:43.410
Donita McClintic: I know what I'm supposed to be doing anyway.

870
01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:59.910
Donita McClintic: I don't know, I just, I got a big heart like I just stuff just bothers me. It always, I don't know, like I'm a people pleaser. Forget about my cell.

871
01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:01.650
Donita McClintic: And

872
01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.770
Donita McClintic: I asked one like my grandma, my mom, my mom's mother.

873
01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.160
Donita McClintic: She was like,

874
01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:14.580
Donita McClintic: She was my

875
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:22.710
Donita McClintic: When she passed away. That was like when I like I felt like I didn't have anybody to

876
01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:40.710
Donita McClintic: Make proud, you know, some be proud of me like I wanted my grandma and she was. But when she passed away. I felt like I didn't have them wanting, even though I did you know I got my parents. I got my own kids. But my mind was, I was very close with my grandma and

877
01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.260
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

878
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:46.410
Donita McClintic: I don't like it.

879
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:48.750
Richelle Direny: So when did your grandmother

880
01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.450
Donita McClintic: 2009

881
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.840
Donita McClintic: JUNE JUNE 12 2009

882
01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.510
Donita McClintic: She had a

883
01:32:58.650 --> 01:33:06.960
Donita McClintic: General well she had severe kidney disease. But what God or was lung cancer chatter for like three months.

884
01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:15.810
Donita McClintic: Um, so, and I have bad kidneys to runs in the fight. My mom does I've got them.

885
01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:22.740
Donita McClintic: Kidney stones. Oh, they're horrible. I just had. I think I have one now.

886
01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:32.640
Donita McClintic: It's I hate it. I've had like 20 some surgeries, because they have to go in and scoop the stone out or put a stent in or something and

887
01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:38.130
Donita McClintic: Where I'd rather have babies. Then can you soon ever again.

888
01:33:40.050 --> 01:33:44.220
Donita McClintic: And that's, you know, like my mom told me the other day. She's like, go the doctor. I was like, no.

889
01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.730
Donita McClintic: I don't want to go the doctor because I don't

890
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:53.490
Donita McClintic: I mean I, it's not that because they don't give you medicine anymore.

891
01:33:54.840 --> 01:34:03.300
Donita McClintic: When you go into a doctor's office. You are looked at automatically like you're just there for medicine and they

892
01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:16.680
Donita McClintic: To me they don't do their job trying to find out what's wrong. So if I go in and say, I think I have a kidney stone and they tell me that I don't instead of them trying to figure out what's wrong. You know what I mean, like they just

893
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:23.970
Donita McClintic: So I just go go unless you know it's really about I'll go but

894
01:34:25.890 --> 01:34:29.670
Donita McClintic: I just hate the how we're looked at

895
01:34:31.410 --> 01:34:34.500
Donita McClintic: And I mean done it to herself. I mean, I know that.

896
01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.240
Donita McClintic: Probably, yeah.

897
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.510
Are you pretty cool.

898
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:55.410
Donita McClintic: Yeah, well, we used to be. We should be really close. I mean, we still we have Sunday dinner every Sunday.

899
01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.010
Donita McClintic: But here's the thing with the hat, um,

900
01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:06.540
Donita McClintic: I can't be in a room with like more than five people and all the kids running around and screaming

901
01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:22.800
Donita McClintic: It's like, yeah, so I have to like excuse myself go somewhere where it's quiet for a minute and like I can only do it for so long because it makes me crazy. Like it drives me it's just all the noise.

902
01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:24.510
Donita McClintic: Is

903
01:35:26.370 --> 01:35:27.510
Donita McClintic: I have a big family.

904
01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:34.140
Donita McClintic: But when we started having kids and stuff. I told my

905
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:42.120
Donita McClintic: Parents like we're going to start having Sunday dinner in your house, you got to cook and they've been doing that since 2000 so

906
01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.400
Donita McClintic: We still do it.

907
01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.860
Donita McClintic: Not everybody comes but

908
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:50.310
Richelle Direny: Everybody doesn't come

909
01:35:51.360 --> 01:36:02.310
Donita McClintic: Up sometimes like my one sister. She lives in West Virginia, and she will make it out my other sister this some sometimes we're all not there together.

910
01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:10.590
Donita McClintic: The last time we were all together was on Christmas, but it wasn't for very long because you know they have to run

911
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.520
Donita McClintic: Take their kids to other grandparents and stuff like that but

912
01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:27.690
Donita McClintic: I've always been a big family person. I mean, which I got from my grandma. Like, I mean, I don't mean just my immediate family. I mean, like the whole family like, you know, playing in the family reunions and

913
01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:36.330
Donita McClintic: All that and since my grandma passed away. We don't do any we've had like two family reunions. I think since she passed away, but

914
01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:43.500
Donita McClintic: It's i don't know i i tried to, you know, keep everybody together and it

915
01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.820
Donita McClintic: Doesn't always pan out

916
01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.500
Richelle Direny: I mean, it seems like very there.

Richelle Direny: And I

1134
01:45:13.530 --> 01:45:14.100
Think about

1135
01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:17.910
Richelle Direny: Not allowing

1136
01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:22.890
Donita McClintic: The emotion Thracian doing is taking

1137
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:24.660
Richelle Direny: Because if I am not in

1138
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.890

Out of frustration.

1144
01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:38.370
Richelle Direny: When I

1145
01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:40.350
Donita McClintic: Got home now.

1146
01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:43.470
It's going to create

1147
01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.460
Donita McClintic: Things like alignment and you're gonna have to a lot

1148
01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:52.620
A lot

1149
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:57.960
Donita McClintic: Doesn't make sense.

1150
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.530
For me,

01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:01.500

Donita McClintic: You get a new car, a new

1167

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:40.830
Richelle Direny: And it's going to

1169
01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:44.730
Richelle Direny: Bathroom when you're out. But I have to do something with. Now I have to use

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.950
Donita McClintic: And more and more perspiration.

01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:02.430

01:51:20.370 --> 01:51:20.730
Time as

Donita McClintic: You can see

1254
01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.140
Donita McClintic: Is that

1255
01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:26.820
Richelle Direny: Think about the example.

1256
01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:27.390

1257
01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:30.870

01:51:32.850 --> 01:51:33.210
Donita McClintic: Right.

Donita McClintic: You have

1261
01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:35.910
Donita McClintic: So there was a major

1262
01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:37.470
Donita McClintic: Role

1263
01:51:38.370 --> 01:51:38.790
Richelle Direny: And I will

1264
01:51:41.370 --> 01:51:41.880
Richelle Direny: If I

1265
01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:43.770
Richelle Direny: Sound frustration.

1269
01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:49.530
Right.

1270
01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.900
Donita McClintic: This pothole has slowed me down.

1271
01:51:59.040 --> 01:51:59.400
Richelle Direny: If

1272
01:51:59.490 --> 01:52:00.540
Richelle Direny: I allow a

1273
01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:04.320
Donita McClintic: Person to get ahold of me and told me

1274
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:06.510

01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:18.030
Richelle Direny: Then

1279
01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:20.160
Donita McClintic: It's not going to set me back.

1280
01:52:21.210 --> 01:52:23.760
