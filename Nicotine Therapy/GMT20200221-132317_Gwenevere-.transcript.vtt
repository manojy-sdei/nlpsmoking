00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So what can you do because I get nauseous. I do this all day long I end up getting nauseous want to move it around.

8
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.450
Bryanna Terry: Um, I don't know. My fiance sleeping so I can go in the room.

9
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.270
Bryanna Terry: I don't really see anything.

10
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so use your creativity. Look around, see what you can do.

11
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.450
Bryanna Terry: Why buy armor rest of my leg. I'm not moving.

12
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.500
Bryanna Terry: A tired this morning and

13
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.550
Bryanna Terry: Long hectic day for me yesterday.

14
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you eat when you have Breakfast or dinner.

15
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.410
Bryanna Terry: I'm usually on our bed.

16
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.180
Okay.

17
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was this a sudden move relocation.

18
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.410
Bryanna Terry: Um, well, we moved from my fiance's house to downtown nannies house.

19
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.940
Bryanna Terry: Oh,

20
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.680
Bryanna Terry: Kind of was unexpected, because it was up to his mother.

21
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that mean,

22
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.140
Bryanna Terry: Well, like the house was his values when she passed away and like his mother had control over who lived in

23
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of the dynamics between those two that you guys would be asked to leave. What's going on with that.

24
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.170
Bryanna Terry: Um,

25
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.600
Bryanna Terry: I mean, we haven't been asked to leave or anything like that. It's just, we're just getting settled in. But like

26
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.990
Bryanna Terry: Nobody lived in this house for a year and like you know she

27
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.090
Bryanna Terry: We don't mind helping with bills, you know, and stuff. And when we will read the House really belongs to his grandfather

28
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:40.920
Bryanna Terry: And so I'm like, you know, his grandfather's so we can move in. No problem, and didn't say we had to pay rent or anything. But then the other day, you know, and before I started working on this new job. I was only working with one client for they're going

29
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.960
Bryanna Terry: To pay $300 plus $70 for the electric

30
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.290
Bryanna Terry: See like why can't you just take $70 out of the 300 that we pay you, or you know, say, hey, I need help with the electric

31
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's something going on. There's some history there.

32
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Between your fiance and his mother.

33
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so unexpected. It was became unaffordable and what's your rent where you are now.

34
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:24.900
Bryanna Terry: Oh, it's while we're here. Um, so, like, like the other day. We gave 115, you know, till they will help her out, like, what, what we can, what we, you know, can afford all that

35
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.000
Bryanna Terry: And plus, his grandfather never said we'd be right, you know,

36
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's owned, which means there's still taxes that have to be paid on a property.

37
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there's electricity. Sometimes there's water gas.

38
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.860
Bryanna Terry: Electric

39
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.710
Bryanna Terry: Like that. Where are the dresses are ours, and as long as I was around a well

40
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:59.700
Bryanna Terry: Electric well that's included with the electric. Amen. We live in a rural areas. We don't have to pay trash.

41
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:17.730
Bryanna Terry: And so it's just electric I think just oh and probing, YOU KNOW, WE PUT WE PUT MY FIANCE paid about like 200 and something dollars just for them to complete propane before we moved in, because there's almost empty. If we had no hot water.

42
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what the taxes are out there. I know the property. I'm in is around $7,000 a year.

43
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.710
Well,

44
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.530
Bryanna Terry: I'm not too sure.

45
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.790
Bryanna Terry: Why they

46
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.130
Bryanna Terry: I know they own the land.

47
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.340
Bryanna Terry: Um, I think. And they built this house, the one that we live in.

48
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.830
Bryanna Terry: I don't know.

49
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.360
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

50
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But, you know, if you've never been a homeowner. It's not something people really are conscious of innocence and there's also homeowners insurance and minus 5000

51
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So, right. You think there's nothing going on.

52
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nobody there. There's things going on.

53
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, no, I mean, you don't you want to have an insured property. Most people do in case there's a fire or something were to happen.

54
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: When there's property tax to so something you want to ask

55
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You to understand in case you're thinking, This isn't fair. Where's this money going

56
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you ever wanted to own your own home.

57
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.220
Bryanna Terry: Yeah. Eventually, but I don't know or want to settle down. Yeah, I don't

58
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.980
Bryanna Terry: Want to stay in New Mexico.

59
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.150
Mm hmm.

60
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a short term.

61
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.870
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

62
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your Fiance's

63
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Recovery going

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.060
Bryanna Terry: Broke that he's doing real well. He just got a job as a cook, or one of our folks here.

65
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.240
Bryanna Terry: Okay, okay.

66
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take some time and review your goals. One of the things you identified was

67
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to function without substances. That's a very broad sweep.

68
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Word function, I might say functioning looks like this. Your neighbor, your mother you your fiance, a friend or cousin might say functioning looks like this.

69
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna share with me how you measure

70
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What functioning is

71
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.930
Well, like

72
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.640
Bryanna Terry: For me I couldn't like when I'm still doing drugs mixing meth and heroin couldn't go you know to

73
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:43.410
Bryanna Terry: Public places like shopping or doctor's visits or, you know, even to just the grocery store for long periods of time. I just freaked out. I'm doing everybody's trying to kill me or somebody was trying to kidnap me

74
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:51.150
Bryanna Terry: Right. And so I just have breakdowns and freak out and so functioning to me looks like, you know,

75
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.660
Bryanna Terry: Being able to live a normal day to day life without that paranoia.

76
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you noticing. Um, how long has it been since you last year's math.

77
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.720
Bryanna Terry: Um, it was

78
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.640
Bryanna Terry: Since July of 2019

79
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And any residual paranoia left

80
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.300
Bryanna Terry: No. No. Okay.

81
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're measuring function.

82
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: He the absence of paranoia, the ability to go to a store and not

83
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Break down or freak out. You're saying

84
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.850
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, like I just run out.

85
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. All right. And have you been going to the store. Have you been going to medical appointments or is that still stolen out

86
00:08:49.620 --> 00:09:05.520
Bryanna Terry: Oh no, yeah i i love shopping. Now, like I'm always like, we need to go to Walmart. Oh, you know, I'm like why or because we live far from it but, or, you know, like doctor's visits i'm i'm make no I go easily I don't you know ever leave

87
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.640
Bryanna Terry: I stayed there for the whole thing, you know, with so it's been good.

88
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It was the last doctor's visit you went to

89
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.050
Bryanna Terry: School yesterday.

90
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of doctor, whether you don't sound to it.

91
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.690
Bryanna Terry: Um,

92
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.240
Bryanna Terry: I think I worlds.

93
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see, I see a band on your arm.

94
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.070
Yeah.

95
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do they think that's coming from

96
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.900
Bryanna Terry: They can't do anything right now. They need a stool culture.

97
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:48.810
Bryanna Terry: And once that school culture than it takes 72 hours for them to, you know, cold dries it or whatever.

98
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.730
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, and then they have to

99
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.130
Bryanna Terry: Like, find out what kind of warm it is to treat it.

100
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it that you weren't gaining weight or something.

101
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:13.890
Bryanna Terry: No. Well, like, um, I started seeing like real street things in my poop. Like, I thought I told my mom, you know, I'm looking at my mom's a registered nurse, she's actually

102
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.930
Bryanna Terry: Director when the hospitals at where I'm from, and I asked her, and like center picture, you know, the K. What's this, you know,

103
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:35.910
Bryanna Terry: And like she's like, You are what you eat. LOL. So I was like, okay, you know, cool. Nothing I, you know, whatever. And I have hepatitis C, so I thought you know my liver wasn't you know processing functionally

104
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:54.240
Bryanna Terry: Like it should, you know, and then yesterday while I was at work. Actually, I went to the restroom. And I looked down and I mean it was just all like a sack like this big with like a bunch of white dots in my poop. And then I'll full warm in there.

105
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my. That must have been

106
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:56.820
Bryanna Terry: Or

107
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:15.270
Bryanna Terry: I was, I instantly freaked out FRIED MY cried called My fiance called my mom, you know, called my dad and then yeah, and like, and then yesterday, you know, like, just for them to tell me you know I wait this long. I just feel so disgusting. You know,

108
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no no no no no no no worries about that. That's not you, that's not you. That's all. It's just those you've got this little bite that those critters are like, oh, I want to hang out here.

109
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know.

110
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you do any reading to see where they come from, what, what

111
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:40.680
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, well, um, we just recently discovered one of our dogs have the worms.

112
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.730
Bryanna Terry: Oh,

113
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.960
Bryanna Terry: We treated her and she's not. We look like we only noticed because one was like hanging out over but you know

114
00:11:49.500 --> 00:12:01.260
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, well I freaked out at the NAB, and so we've been treating her you know we did three day treatment do warmer for her and she seems does not have any in her poop anymore, but it's just like

115
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:07.950
Bryanna Terry: Because I think the warm that I have is around room because the picture I have and what it looks like. Online looks

116
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.160
Bryanna Terry: And like they don't really have any symptoms you said coming out your, you know,

117
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:24.000
Bryanna Terry: Okay, so, and I think she had reforms to because it didn't look like a tapeworm, but it looks in online, it said it looks like a spaghetti. What you didn't look like hanging out.

118
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:30.960
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, but it says like, they can be transmitted through like even the dog licking you

119
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

120
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:40.560
Bryanna Terry: My god yeah them being in bed with you and having them, you know, and I sleep naked so so that wasn't a good idea, like

121
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.150
Bryanna Terry: Just her just being in bed or, you know, like us, like

122
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:54.780
Bryanna Terry: She's pooped inside once or twice, you know, so I've cleaned it up and you know like contaminated feces even just like breathing it in

123
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

124
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.360
Bryanna Terry: Okay. Oh, yeah.

125
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.920
Bryanna Terry: Bailey was like when you wear a mask glove it up.

126
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:02.760
Yeah.

127
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta think about that to

128
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.540
Bryanna Terry: That's great.

129
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.220
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, I'm trying to train

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: My, my dog to just to sort of stay on this P pad. He's pretty good.

131
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's a lot of picking up and now I'm thinking, I gotta be. I gotta be careful of that too.

132
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:31.080
Bryanna Terry: Yeah yeah cuz they're like the doctors like, Are you sure did you have any foreign countries last three months, you know, and he's like, do you have any contact with people from China, like, no.

133
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:40.230
Bryanna Terry: Like, are you sure and then like, Well, you know, he told me the whole process. And he's like, is that okay. I was like, well, I asked you mean. Oh, I guess there's nothing else you can do.

134
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:48.810
Bryanna Terry: Um, but he was like, can I see the picture and all that. Yeah. Here you go. Because, like, if I have any questions, I'm like, I take a picture automatically

135
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.230
Bryanna Terry: smart girl. And so I showed him and he's like yeah for sure looks like worms.

136
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:04.740
Bryanna Terry: So, last night I spend all bleaching, you know, washing her she, you know, just trying to clean as much as I can.

137
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:06.990
Bryanna Terry: Oh,

138
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.390

Gwenevere Abriel: I keep looking through this. This was very helpful. So to me, understanding what a regular sort of functional life might be for you. I am hearing in the background that maybe this event that just happened.

224
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Some stinking thinking came in them. Some cravings. I want to get out. I'm thinking of using is that what came up for you.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:24.600
Bryanna Terry: Well, it's caused me a lot of damage you with my relationships with my family, you know that it's just not even something I think of anymore. Honestly,

230
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you were speaking consoling from your fiance. I thought I heard that that was part of it like feeling like

231
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:41.310
Bryanna Terry: Oh, no, no, I just whenever like I found out I had, I was like, oh, you know, just freaked out like just more worried that, you know, other things, living in my intestines.

235
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:02.580

236
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Watching list those for me. Again, this will be useful. I always keep this running piece for the relapse prevention.

237
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: emotional triggers relapse relationship triggers events situations healthy coping skills people I can call self soothing and care behaviors.

238
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to put a little category here of negative consequences. They can be really helpful. Tell me what damage it did to relationship just quick I'll put damage relationship, but sometimes it's nice to hear a specific thing that happened that really broke your heart.

239
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:45.750
Bryanna Terry: Like with my parents like they always supported me no matter what. But I'm like, you know, one time I chose to take off with this guy. Well, my grandfather was in town from Texas.

240
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:54.660
Bryanna Terry: So like, you know, my parents are wanting and it was a guy like some past with anyways. Long story short, he ended up ditching me in a hotel.

241
00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:06.630
Bryanna Terry: And I had to stay with some creepy dude. And I just couldn't take, you know, the paranoia anymore. So I called my parents, you know, and my mom, my dad was not going to come get me.

242
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:17.730
Bryanna Terry: But my mom forced him, and when he picked me up. I thought he was gonna hurt me. So, um, I ended up kicking him six times in the face.

243
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that you are still. Now, I know there's some some some pretty intense history with that in and of itself, but also the paranoia. On top of that, you ended up kicking your dad.

244
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.210
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, sometimes in the face. Yeah.

245
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.870

247
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:50.790
Bryanna Terry: I had really like like soft boots on. So luckily, but it's still. I know it hurt him. And it hurt me. Yeah, okay.

248
00:25:50.940 --> 00:26:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's, that's a good reminder of negative consequence that you were basically out of your mind right you were not you, your attic was running the show.

249
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Your whole brain wasn't working at that time.

250
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.650
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

251
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:11.340

Bryanna Terry: Yeah, I do. I know exactly we're remind you

268
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just I it's interesting that like you didn't mention that part just now.

269
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.220
Bryanna Terry: Right.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.890
Bryanna Terry: Oh yeah, right. Yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because it's all big

272
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a negative consequence don't think

273
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:25.920
Bryanna Terry: Oh yeah, definitely like well I know exactly where it can remove came from them. Fucking asshole well okay cuz

274
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:33.870
Bryanna Terry: I've used method, you know, heroin before but I only use like starting or no smoking and then I met this

275
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:44.700
Bryanna Terry: This guy who had huge negative consequences in my life. But like he gets everybody you try to, to try to shoot up like tried to use it needle like

276
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.440
Bryanna Terry: He lost everything and his life. So he just wanted everybody to lose. Theirs. And like

277
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:55.230
Bryanna Terry: Basically what he told me is like, I don't have enough for you to do a line or I don't have a pipe for you to smoke.

278
00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:08.160
Bryanna Terry: There's not enough. You know, there's nothing for you to do a hot rail and but I do have this so I did make the decision. You know, to allow him to stick a needle in my arm but for the first year or so I couldn't even stick a needle in my own or

279
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.250
Bryanna Terry: He was the one doing it for me.

280
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other physical conditions as a consequence of substance use.

281
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.230
I'm

282
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.800
Bryanna Terry: still just a hippie.

283
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:35.700
Bryanna Terry: And while he was in prison and he was shooting up in prison and we share. Well, I tried to keep our needle separate all the time, but he would just make some. And I know that's where, that's where it came from.

284
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What about financial negative consequence.

285
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:55.320
Bryanna Terry: Well yeah like I lost a lot of jobs today because I was, you know, getting high on the job or

286
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.210
Bryanna Terry: Or didn't show up because I was, you know, having a paranoia attack.

287
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't lose one that you're really disappointed about

288
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:41.790
Bryanna Terry: Which was, um, well it was out my very first job at a nursing home, and I was assuming I was making. I was making like my largest checkers 1200 dollars, you know. And then one day I combined spice in the math and I spilled a glass of lemonade on my leg. And they're like,

289
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:43.980
Bryanna Terry: Nice.

290
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right well

291
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The connection got bad there for a second. So something I was made. I got a 1200 dollar I still lemonade on my leg. Then what happened.

292
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:14.670
Bryanna Terry: And then they called me in the office who did your desk those was your favorite everything under the sun.

293
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:31.740
Bryanna Terry: And they wanted me like they told me to come back the next, you know, they sent me home. And then they told me, come back the next morning, but I just couldn't face like these, the reality of what I've done. You know like what was going to happen. So I just I just didn't ever go back

294
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about maybe long term career goals. Do you see if your substance use has has prohibited view from kind of having that

295
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.840
Bryanna Terry: Career the EVO med

296
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:58.230
Bryanna Terry: Well, definitely, like when I dropped out of college was right when I started to use, you know, well not right when I started, but I was already had been using for a little bit. But what was it, I had more freedom to

297
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.810
Bryanna Terry: Go to college. You know, I lost my CNA know I'm

298
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:18.450
Bryanna Terry: Like I just wasn't on the path to do what I wanted to do in life. And I know I have passion for, you know, which is you're giving healthcare and so like I just felt like why, you know, okay.

299
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what came before the socket, because that's a pretty common phenomenon, what was going on before that I in college when it happened.

300
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:32.460
Bryanna Terry: Well, like, well, here in New Mexico if like you don't get

301
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:44.490
Bryanna Terry: Tuition paid for until you have your second semester college. So the first semester I was full time, I was thinking about 18 hours credit hours you

302
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of work.

303
00:32:46.110 --> 00:33:03.900
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, oh my god was supposed to been paying making payments you know $500 payments to get me to with the next semester when it's called the lottery scholarship will begin. Um, and when I would you register for the next semester I found out he had agreed a single payment.

304
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:20.940
Bryanna Terry: Oh, you have to have it on your balance to be able to register for next next venture, you have to up your balance hundred thousand dollars. Well, I didn't couldn't pull 5000 I was that graduated high school at 1622 college credit. And so I was 17

305
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:28.980
Bryanna Terry: And full time student in college. So, you know, I wasn't working at the time so grateful $5,000 on my out

306
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How disappointing, you know,

307
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You hold some resentment towards your dad about that.

308
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I imagine.

309
00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Those broken promises they hurt. Don't they

310
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:55.770
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, so I you know I wanted to, I wanted to school. I wanted, you know, but I just had no, there was no way

311
00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now it's it's not too late now.

312
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you really, it seems like you're still, you're still in that field right

313
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So is there something within the next few years that you're kind of in the distance, like this is still something I want to do like out in the distance.

314
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:25.590
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, all well in April. I'll be taking the Sunni classes to get my seen a back on. We didn't

315
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me write a little goal for that. That's pretty cool. So you said in April. What are you doing,

316
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:36.540
Bryanna Terry: I'm gonna take this in a course in so we can get my teammates or station, but

317
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What tell me what

318
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.100

319
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.090
For nurses

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so April's right around the corner.

323
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've got the money for that one.

324
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.080
Bryanna Terry: Well, the, the place I worked at they're going to pay for it.

325
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so great.

326
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:08.400
Bryanna Terry: Yeah. And then I mean I want to check out you know options for school and stuff and see what I can do to get back into school. Okay.

327
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:21.690
Bryanna Terry: Because at the time, you know, I was under my motto for financial aid, I was under my mom's in Korea, and my mom, she just made too much money are we got like $250 and financially.

328
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.010
Bryanna Terry: Now I'm in my my under my own income so

329
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I wrote a little goal you want to get your CNA

330
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: reinstated. Is that kind of how you and said, How would you say it.

331
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.660
It sounds like

332
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Something happens I can come back to this one, and you, you know, we can remember because sometimes life can really throw you off course.

333
00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But is it already a scheduled like you're already enrolled or something or you can just walk in anytime

334
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.000
Bryanna Terry: Get this time. Well,

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.600
Okay.

337
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. That's exciting. Get back into the plan.

338
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.320
Yeah.

339
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

340
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you'd mentioned when we first met that you received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. And where does that show up for you, like, where do you say, oh, that's what this is, this is, this is that disorder or like where does it show up in your life.

341
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:43.980
Bryanna Terry: Well,

342
00:36:50.160 --> 00:37:09.210
Bryanna Terry: I snap at people like my fiance really more or less I snapped him like, I'm like, I guess like doesn't do something I like, or you know something my way or you're arguing, like, then I can snap. Really, I can get real mean like

343
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.300
Bryanna Terry: It's I try to control it.

344
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.430
Bryanna Terry: Words trying to let more times or none. No, just like

345
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like you have this impulse this response. This I don't like this and there's no time between the stimulus. Right. And the response. It happens immediate

346
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, get you get snippy or mean you'd say right away.

347
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:38.640
Bryanna Terry: Okay.

348
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:39.480
Oh,

349
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:43.710
Bryanna Terry: And what

350
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What else tell me

351
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.450
Bryanna Terry: I'm like,

352
00:37:52.140 --> 00:38:03.870
Bryanna Terry: Like I know like when things like are going good. Instead of like, well, well, I guess. Yeah, I had to get up yesterday. Very well, I tried it all, but like

353
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:18.690
Bryanna Terry: When I think, you know, these are gonna. It's a long story but like I just instead of like thinking of other possibilities. You know, I just freaked out. I think it's one thing and just like get all mad or cry or

354
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So an example would you say a recent one.

355
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.500
Bryanna Terry: Um, well, like okay so

356
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.800
Bryanna Terry: We have a sheet on our futon because you know the dogs get on it.

357
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:43.320
Bryanna Terry: Like his mom would come into our house, you know, and like to take some of our blankets, you know, she comes to put ice in our freezer.

358
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:56.880
Bryanna Terry: You know, while we're not hearing this different things so I couldn't find my white sheet elbows on my futon and I looked everywhere. I looked all throughout the house, you know, maybe a bag. I would have thrown it in and it wasn't there.

359
00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.650
Bryanna Terry: What, though,

360
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

361
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.630
Bryanna Terry: So,

362
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got it. So the, the immediate response is really intense.

363
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.400
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, okay.

364
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how do you distinguish that from from modeling behavior. In other words, was that how you're a caregiver, a mother, a father, a grandparent, whoever was there sort of in your formative years

365
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what was modeled for you.

366
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:41.910
Bryanna Terry: My god.

367
00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish it was your dad.

368
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.400
Bryanna Terry: Oh yeah, like anything like

369
00:39:49.260 --> 00:40:01.920
Bryanna Terry: Would like anything just bothered him instead of like talking foods you know your screen, three more America like three minutes long, like yell at us and threaten us you know are toxic to us and

370
00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.840
Bryanna Terry: That's still how you sustain my mother.

371
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:20.400
Bryanna Terry: So that's why I can't be around him, like, ever since. Like I turned 18 like I would just any like anybody's I could run. I would you know like I moved out with boyfriends or, you know,

372
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:39.210
Bryanna Terry: He like or I moved boyfriends in because we all use nicer around them. He wouldn't yell at me as much, you know, or, you know, so I just much like get away from him. I did and I had the opportunity even being 20 years i did i we can be around. Yeah.

373
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the last part, I lost the audio. Did you say you got in this space with them.

374
00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I caught. I'm not

375
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't hear. I can't hear you right now.

376
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:54.300
Bryanna Terry: Weird

377
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:56.430
Bryanna Terry: Will start

378
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll start fighting

379
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The audio is going really sideways. Right now I can't hear you.

380
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly or your hands going over the place, maybe

381
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.460
Bryanna Terry: Maybe let me see.

382
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right now, I just heard that maybe let me

383
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Say that clean

384
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.290
Oh, yeah.

385
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

386
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:30.000
Bryanna Terry: We'll start finding really bad, like we feel driving me by my hair, you know, or like all

387
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:36.810
Bryanna Terry: Like punch ROOM IS JOHN AND I WANT US TO GET between us is pretty bad.

388
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:42.720
Bryanna Terry: Oh, well now like our relationships, a lot better. But like like

389
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.030
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, he's like, he sent me to the hospital couple time

390
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:54.480
Okay.

391
00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.310
So,

392
00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed today that and maybe you noticed it to maybe some reservation about sharing, but somewhere along the line, you'd let it happen a little bit you know you opened up and kind of just let it out just a little

393
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I am here for that. I'm here to hear those stories and not only hear those stories. I want to talk to you about

394
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing some trauma work because

395
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We, you know how you're sitting now you're at home, you're nice and quiet. We had pretty good reception. I think we would be able to do it if we could get set up where

396
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What I've been doing with people if they don't have a laptop and most people don't

397
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I get. I get their phone.

398
00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And we get we get to items like about this high, and we do this desensitization process, but I do need the bilateral movement of your eyes like this.

399
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: See how we move back and forth, not really far where it hurts, but just a little bit. And that's only one piece of it. There's a you know quite a few sessions where there's lots of preparation and resourcing for you first before we would do.

400
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.320
Bryanna Terry: Something like that.

401
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But so over the next, let's say, two weeks, if you could start to maybe secondhand store something garage sale getting some sort of setup. We're in front of you, you could kind of prop your phone up, put some books or something.

402
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, you know, dollar store jaws here Dollar Store vas here so that we can have something to create about shoulder width apart. So, you know, shoulder width and we put those right next to the phone and then your eyes are able to do this.

403
00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And we just this CMDR work because as I start to listen to you. I'm guessing you've got quite a bit of trauma back there and and

404
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, if you want to have a different experience of it. So it's not sort of stuck inside and sort of, you know, not letting it get you like short tempered

405
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is this is a good way to do it. Yeah. OK.

406
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:23.310
Bryanna Terry: So the counselor. I had in rehab offered it but I love to soon. I love before you can do it on me. Yeah.

407
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's do it. So why don't we do, we'll do one tiny little piece. And we're not going to do the movement piece, but we're going to do the preparation part which again takes some some time, and we'll we're going to be developing

408
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Quite a few things. I'm going to share my screen with you so you can kind of see what I'm, what I'm up to. Okay.

409
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So see right here.

410
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: These the blue.

411
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: These are some things that I want to be doing with you. So right here you see develop subjective unit up distress. So a thermometer.

412
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get a temperature reading. So for example, you, you just said something to me and I put it here, but I'm going to move at once. You tell me too. I dad drove me by the hair and my mom would need to get in between us. He had sent me one time to the hospital. Right.

413
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: How, when you have that thought how distressing. Is it so. Watch. See how it's zero to 100

414
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing. Is it of the worst thing that's ever happened to you.

415
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I randomly just threw it there, but um how distressing. When you think about it now.

416
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.350
Bryanna Terry: It's a worry about where it was.

417
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: A really okay so right about there.

418
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the emotion when you bring this imagery up of him pulling your hair, perhaps, or maybe the worst incident and you don't even have to tell me what it is. But when you think about it.

419
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Um, what's the emotion you have. What's that word.

420
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.580
Bryanna Terry: What's the word

421
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:27.330
Bryanna Terry: Like angry because every time, like, well, most of our big boys was me trying to protect my mom you know him yelling and my mom screaming at my mom and I i would intervene, because I don't like my mom worked so hard, you know, and doesn't deserve to be treated like that.

422
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:33.600
Bryanna Terry: She was, she was living off my mom, you know, and just treating her like her. Okay.

423
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: They're still together.

424
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:37.590
You

425
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.910
Bryanna Terry: Still do anything. Yeah.

426
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Still does the same thing.

427
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So you you recognize the anger.

428
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you're putting in about a 70 and you can always change that later if we revisit this this memory. So this, this next part.

429
00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Brianna is a little harder to get to. So just for a second.

430
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can, I'm closing my eyes to see if you can pull that memory up one of those worst pieces. The Worst Picture you have that type of behavior where you're angry. Sounds like you're protecting your mother and your father's being violent

431
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to see if you can identify what your belief about yourself is

432
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So difficult thing to get to some time. So maybe just free associated and tell me the thoughts that you're having. And let's see if I can help get you there. So when you pull this up in your mind. What are some of your beliefs and thoughts coming up.

433
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.520
Bryanna Terry: Are you ready, never

434
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:51.720
Bryanna Terry: Wanted to be like him, or no, I kind of you catch myself when I get angry.

435
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like him.

436
00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay that is that like the worst negative thought right there about yourself. I'm kind of like

437
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.340
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, cuz like

438
00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:18.240
Bryanna Terry: Here's a lot that I have in common with him like your to the way that I get mad when I'm angry, you know, to the way I thought people would agree. You know how easy I snap, I get it from him.

439
00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:20.610
Bryanna Terry: Like

440
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:30.690
Bryanna Terry: No way, like, you know, the like words like call people and I'm mad, you know, again, angry, like Johnny my dimples.

441
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.470
Bryanna Terry: I mean, I like just like me and my mom.

442
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:41.010
Bryanna Terry: I like I have these personality, not my mom's you okay

443
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And

444
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know so let's just picture that WORST piece right that Worst Picture that negative belief that's a negative belief you have about yourself. I'm like him.

445
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like my dad and all of that behavior aggression, violence, personality addiction to. Am I right, yeah. Is he he's

446
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A cocaine addict, I think, okay, I picked up on that and group so and so that's there. Now this one also difficult to get to. But this one, you got to pretty easily.

447
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to believe about yourself.

448
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.920
Bryanna Terry: I'm nothing like him and

449
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:39.060
Bryanna Terry: I kind of made my own choices. You know, like our

450
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.900
Bryanna Terry: Well, yeah, I'm not like him in that

451
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.300
Bryanna Terry: I'm

452
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.080
Bryanna Terry: Totally different person. But I know

453
00:49:54.330 --> 00:50:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and this is an interesting thing. Many people can identify what they don't want to be don't, I'm not like that.

454
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: They have a harder time identifying what they want.

455
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: In the absence of that, what would you be, what would you believe of yourself. I am NOT WHAT I'M NOT I am

456
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be a delicious thing to think of yourself.

457
00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Harder to get to, isn't it.

458
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and so we'll, we'll work on that will come up with that positive cognition, but I wanted to give you just a tiny little

459
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Moment of, you know, because we were looking at some treatment goals and talking about a lot of things today, but I wanted to start to develop not only that

460
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Some I only need like three or four things in there, maybe even to sort of to understand

461
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: When I see you. And if I check in. And I say, well, sort of, what's your subjective unit of discharge, what, how are you feeling. How you doing it. If you give me a 90

462
00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say, Okay, let's let's do some emotional regulation. Let's bring ourselves down. So this is really good for me to understand how much you can tolerate and still be productive in

463
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: In the end, or work. I don't want you so activated that you're not going to learn anything. I don't want to reach traumatize so I kind of need to learn where you are with that.

464
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there's a lot to do. And I don't know if you saw in there, but I want to develop

465
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Some imagery around a protective figure and nurturing figure wise for your one develop a container with the next time and the anchor room sometimes can take many sessions so that in and of itself can be a therapeutic intervention.

466
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And along the way, we'll be doing everything else, too. So a lot to do.

467
00:51:53.970 --> 00:52:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't don't give up on this program. I know that there might be times where it might feel inconvenient.

468
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think you've got some good care going on here, these are these are these two

469
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: All women are good very caring doctors. They really want the best for you. And while you're in this program. The, the MIT piece really keep showing up with therapy with me because

470
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this is affordable. It isn't going to you know it's it's not available all the time. So people this is pretty pretty accessible right in your home and all you need to do is

471
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Worship set up in front of you.

472
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to drive anywhere. So I really encourage you to take advantage of it while it's here. Okay.

473
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm happy to work with you. Looking forward to it. Actually, today, felt really different. It

474
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: felt really like genuine

475
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you were really here.

476
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:54.090
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

477
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's scary. It's like, what's this I don't know this lady, but she didn't say to me.

478
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And it takes time, you know, and you've had some people really let you down.

479
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And hurt you. And I'm not going to be another one of those people. Okay, I do my best to show up to schedule appointments, keep my part of the commitment and already showing you some of the ideas that I have about a direction. We can go

480
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.460
Bryanna Terry: So then that

481
00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That short temper piece we can get some time in there so that you can feel like you have a choice on how you want to respond.

482
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:28.590
Yeah.

483
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right.

484
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This point, it's probably all just the amygdala and it's just the the unconscious running the show.

485
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

486
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.150
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

487
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need me to send a message to Dr. Solomon.

488
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get that up here. All right, and your next group is when

489
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:10.890
Bryanna Terry: I'm not too sure I do work, or I'm off this weekend. So all all work Monday and I'll be off Thursday for all coordinate with him.

490
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if you're going to coordinate with me.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:15.960
Bryanna Terry: Okay, yeah.

492
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.980
So,

493
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Why one the if you want to speak with after all. And then once your normal group is it typically the nine o'clock on Monday or Friday.

494
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.880
Bryanna Terry: Or whoa my normal, normal group is Fridays.

495
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can't do that today. Right.

496
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've got this whole thing going on.

497
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And plus, we

498
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:43.140
Bryanna Terry: Always. Well, I mean, I'm sure I could do it with

499
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, right now, they don't want it on the same day. So um yes when it comes to going to a makeup group, you're going to want to coordinate with me.

500
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: He manages the medication that's basically it.

501
00:54:58.590 --> 00:54:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

502
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the one that says let's I was expecting you in group. All right. These are the times that are available. When can you sort of set up this this next group so people can visit some of my other groups that I run

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to remember all that

525
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.110
Yes.

526
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then you're going to go Monday for group on three two.

527
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: at 9am So the problem is finding time for us.

528
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What time do you typically go into work. We're going to, I guess, carve out something early

529
00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:31.410
Bryanna Terry: When I go into a or I mean sorry going to leave my house around 830 sorry 45

530
00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What time can you meet because we need a fat 45 to 60 minutes to be productive.

531
00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:46.050
Bryanna Terry: Hours on my lunch, but

532
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is, it's on you. You've got to make this decision I've told you so get into the solution. What can you do

533
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me when you're available. I mean lunch is fine, except I don't know whether you're going to be sitting in a bathroom stall. I mean, I have no idea what you mean I lunch. Are you going to make sure no one's around good lighting.

534
00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:15.330
Bryanna Terry: Your have your will. Yeah, I mean, we have benches outside. I could sit out or

535
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But

536
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember the setup. How are you going to have the setup for for doing this work on a bench. You see,

537
00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:30.780
Bryanna Terry: I mean I one day I could wake up early, but my days are pretty cool.

538
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you want to do.

539
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:40.680
Bryanna Terry: I mean I guess I could wake up earlier me other than that my schedule is going to die.

540
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what time and what day

541
00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:49.110
Bryanna Terry: Um, I don't know what time. No, no, no, no, you're available.

542
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Propose it

Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to come, you're, you're not giving me any information for me to say, Oh, I already have someone booked for that time or how I felt great. I don't have any information to work with.

546
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:28.380
Bryanna Terry: Well, I don't know what days. I mean, cuz my groups alternate so I don't know you know my groups are gonna have to alternate so I don't know what days. I can't get no

547
00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:30.060
Bryanna Terry: Individual

548
00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I think grabbing a piece of paper would work. Let's go grab a piece of paper. Let's write this out.

549
01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So which early morning, can you meet and then I'll look at my calendar.

Bryanna Terry: Sorry, I'm

556
01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I have a set person there, I would say there's more flexibility on a

557
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: There's more flexibility on a Friday or Thursday or Monday that kind of is a little bit more flexible. There's some there's people that I see, at that time, but it moves you don't. I mean, maybe I'm there at the point I'm seeing them a bi weekly so there's a little bit more flexibility.

558
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.010
Bryanna Terry: On

Gwenevere Abriel: breathing techniques. Maybe we won't be able to do. Well, you know, it will still, we can still do some preparation, actually we don't we don't need to set up just yet. So that should be fine. Okay. So real quick, I'm sending a message. Do you need anything besides the buprenorphine.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:04.230
Erica Valdez: And I have a doctor's appointment that I need to be at by 915 so we're going to have to make sure that we're done with that.

593
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But what does that mean, it means

594
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:14.700
Erica Valdez: We're gonna have to make sure we're done with our group by nine like we're supposed to, because I have an appointment for my newborn baby by

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah no I don't go over an hour.

597
01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:26.880
Erica Valdez: Okay, yeah, just because we're checking in a little bit late, and I've been on since 715

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So, oh, no, no, you're fine, you're

Erica Valdez: Thank you.

603
01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, come on screen. So I can take a look at

604
01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:55.680
Your money.

605
01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you're

606
01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling better in a new place.

607
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:04.650
Erica Valdez: I'm sorry.

608
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling better than a new place.

609
01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:08.850
Erica Valdez: I don't know what that means.

610
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you live,

611
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:26.190
Erica Valdez: Where I had bought a new house. Yes. Just recently, but I, we had a fire from our last member we missed a meeting we had a fire in December, they took us out of our house. Now we're back home. So yes, I feel better to be back home shape. That's what your regarding to

612
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:34.860
Erica Valdez: You okay you know what doctor didn't call my prescription in

613
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:39.090
Erica Valdez: So I was without a prescription for a day and a half. Yeah, so

614
01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go see

615
01:08:41.190 --> 01:08:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Go see what's going on with that.

616
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:54.030
Erica Valdez: And it's weird because he went from a week to four days, and then he called it in the day after our group and then he posted it for the 21st. So that's super weird.

617
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so, um,

618
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:59.460
Erica Valdez: But I called the virtual clinic.

619
01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.400
Erica Valdez: What are we today Friday.

620
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.740
Erica Valdez: Wednesday. Wednesday, it was

621
01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:10.260
Erica Valdez: Ma. I'm sorry. My stupid phone. It's a new iPhone. So I'm trying to work it to

622
01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:17.610
Erica Valdez: The I they said they took care of it. So I picked them up yesterday, but I was without them for two days. So I feel super sick.

623
01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

624
01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's probably

625
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Some irritability to going on.

626
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah. OK, so I'm

627
01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to work around that.

628
01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.710
Erica Valdez: I'm going to choose. Sorry.

629
01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:33.150
February's

630
01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:42.390
Erica Valdez: So I drew from our group is when he called it in and it was from a week to four days and then

631
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.460
Erica Valdez: He put like I said he posted it for the 21st. So that was super weird.

632
01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe the part that is new for you, although it's been ongoing is your

633
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.380
Erica Valdez: I'm sorry.

634
01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're being bridged and that what that word means is you go to group. This is individual therapy, there's

635
01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: No one else

636
01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:12.090
Erica Valdez: Correct. Right. And then we go to the whole group with everybody. Sorry, I turned you sideways.

637
01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.530
Erica Valdez: Right, I wasn't holding

638
01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:15.450
Erica Valdez: So what happens is

639
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll get a prescription in group.

640
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just instantly in it depends on what you do. But most people, what happens is we do it for a month.

641
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It goes from

642
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.310
Erica Valdez: Group to individual

643
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You show up as you are now.

644
01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously had that fire and that and

645
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.320
Erica Valdez: I said to. So this is my second time. Correct. This is

646
01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.360
Erica Valdez: My second time being with you alone.

647
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so there was a miss.

648
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: One last time. Yes, higher

649
01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.390
Erica Valdez: So,

650
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What doesn't sound like was December but

651
01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:52.590
Erica Valdez: No our fire was in December, but they came out and started doing the ritual repairs.

652
01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

653
01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:58.290
Erica Valdez: They're still not even done you know my carpet still full with fire. I'm a master. So, yeah.

654
01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so just explain

655
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like when you mentioned those numbers.

656
01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:04.260
Erica Valdez: 17th.

657
01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And the 21st. That looks like a bridge. Now what I don't know what all he

658
01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Does all I do is send him a message.

659
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.090
Erica Valdez: Programs slack.

660
01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And let him know hey Erica showed up for her.

661
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Individual therapy, what he does. After that, I don't

662
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:20.730
Erica Valdez: Know for sure. I know that I don't monitor it.

663
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's clear. So, but what I don't get is why you are so you should never be without medicine.

664
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:30.570
Erica Valdez: That's what I said. That's confusing.

665
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:38.820
Erica Valdez: And then they like post dated it for the 21st was I couldn't pick up till the 21st. So that was the weird thing.

666
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I don't understand.

667
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:44.790
Erica Valdez: You said you've been

668
01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of medicine for for two days.

669
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:57.000
Erica Valdez: But it would have been chewed it would have been two days if I didn't pick it up last night. If the pharmacy didn't call me and tell me last night. So it's been like a day and a half, okay, Dan. Yeah.

670
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe when you I invite next time you're with him. See if you can

671
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's right at the end of group or if no one's there right in the beginning. See if you can understand sometimes it's a pharmacy and they do this. Eat prescription thing.

672
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not really calling in order. Sometimes it can go sideways there sometimes medicine. It gets pretty complicated. Sometimes there's only a an off label not brand name. I mean, there's so many variables that go on but it'd be nice to know

673
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.130
Erica Valdez: What what happens

674
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because

675
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.480
Erica Valdez: To be without it it's it's really hard.

676
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:34.980
Erica Valdez: That's why.

677
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We're here is to not

678
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.770
Erica Valdez: Go into y'all, so yes.

679
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So sorry that happened.

680
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So we are all independent

681
01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Contractors. So we're kind of we don't always know what what what the other person is doing.

682
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.250
Erica Valdez: Yeah, because you guys are at a different stage. Correct. But wait a week.

683
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know we connecting group and

684
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.910
Erica Valdez: Sometimes whole process cases of. Yeah.

685
01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.090
Erica Valdez: All right. Don't don't learn today. I'm on the horn. Please stop.

686
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:09.990
Erica Valdez: Ask your dad. Sorry, my kids don't go to school, till nine so they're like, Yeah, okay. And they're 12 and they're asking you what choose to where I'm like,

687
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:13.080
Erica Valdez: value your opinion.

688
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so actually we. This might be the

689
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: After the bio psychosocial. I think this is our first one so we really haven't had a chance to actually talk

690
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:28.920
Erica Valdez: Oh yes, because we didn't have all those questions. The last yeah that

691
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

692
01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, and now you're let's be honest, you're probably in distress, you're probably not feeling great right now.

693
01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

694
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: There's not going to be a lot of

695
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.340
Erica Valdez: Therapeutic gain from

696
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, either.

697
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

698
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of keep that in mind.

699
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.820
Erica Valdez: Because you're not feeling great. And I'm not feeling good. Yeah.

700
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. So don't it's this

701
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.080
Erica Valdez: The emotion that you're feeling is

702
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to pass this will pass, you're going to

703
01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel better

704
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: When the medicine gets in your blood stream.

705
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I know you've got a lot

706
01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So today.

Erica Valdez: All right, and she's like foster baby so

710
01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. How is that

711
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:35.700
Erica Valdez: It's actually going really good. I just talked to my attorney yesterday, and he gave us good news, which is really good. He's like, I'm actually going to just be permanent with you guys and we would have court March nine, so

712
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:44.460
Erica Valdez: Really yeah yeah she six she'll be six months when we go to court. But I've had her son since September 18 and she was one. Yeah.

713
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's still must feel

714
01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:47.400
Erica Valdez: Like

715
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All the pressure of having to

716
01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Get the house ready and you know all these people investigating asking questions and

717
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of pressure.

718
01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:57.870
Yeah.

719
01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So glad

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:16.500
Yeah.

725
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:31.950
Erica Valdez: Maybe a dad taking you

726
01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:37.170
Erica Valdez: Okay, Texas. Dad Army when you get to the bus stop.

727
01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see. So this is our first session and let's first take a look at what your original goals are.

728
01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.180
Erica Valdez: Come off of opiates.

729
01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:04.560
Erica Valdez: Well, even the Suboxone actually I'm off of this opiate Samina nice, I have a withdraw, you know,

730
01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're on an opiate now.

731
01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:23.610
Erica Valdez: I took when and honestly I don't even think I did anything because I have this inbox, me, me. You get what I'm saying my so I know it's like a 24 but with everything and my body the way it was. I took an opiate. Yes. Okay.

732
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, how much did you take

733
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: 10

734
01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:32.490
Erica Valdez: No, I took like a 2020

735
01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Milligrams. Was it a

736
01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Percocet and I couldn't

737
01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.890
Erica Valdez: It was an oxy cotton.

738
01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so right because

739
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: buprenorphine so sticky it on those opiate receptors.

740
01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

741
01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how much effect, like you said, you've probably been

742
01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:59.430
Erica Valdez: Nothing I didn't sleep. I was

743
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.930
Erica Valdez: Pretty bad

744
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so well now you kind of know firsthand. Once you're on the

745
01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing you really want to stay on it so

746
01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to review if something

747
01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: goes sideways like that literally log into virtual clinic, you can call bride her and health.

748
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And just let them know something's going on here. I know my dog say I know my doctor's office this

749
01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:30.900
Erica Valdez: Sure, I did call and the lady said, Well, the best thing for you can do right now because everybody's out of the clinic is go to the hospital and they'll give you your medication is what she told me

750
01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know who said that

751
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:34.440
Erica Valdez: Um,

752
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.750
Erica Valdez: That doesn't sound like such me

753
01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:44.010
Erica Valdez: Was the lip maybe five for tiny little Vietnamese yeah she wasn't

754
01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:55.770
Erica Valdez: Try seen her maybe twice on the virtual clinic when I log in. Usually it's like a Hispanic girl that answers, but the last two times it was like a little Vietnamese girl.

755
01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just so we're clear, um, you have had given morphine today.

756
01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:04.590
Erica Valdez: This morning, correct.

757
01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And how many milligrams

758
01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:08.070
Erica Valdez: Eight milligram

759
01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what time like I'm trying to see if it's in your system yet.

760
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:17.610
Erica Valdez: What to me right now 820 or woke up at salmon.

761
01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:20.340
Erica Valdez: At like 715

762
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Yes. Should be. You should start to feel it pretty like now.

763
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:37.230
Erica Valdez: Yeah, I mean, I kind of failure actually getting here and then I feel like a little bit more, you know, like I can't breathe, you know, but I still feel really irritable. Okay.

764
01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:37.980
Well,

765
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you, I got you. Alright, so just checking in the goal, the large goal here the overarching goal when it comes to the medicated assisted therapy. When you originally came in was, I want to come

766
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: On opiates and eventually off of marijuana

767
01:18:57.930 --> 01:19:05.310
Erica Valdez: Well, and it's the Suboxone actually that I really want to come off of a marijuana might just always be something man. I have to do it. You know, it's

768
01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:17.790
Erica Valdez: It's medicated it's from a doctor. So, you know, it's not that I do it legally. So yes, that'll probably be either long term or if I do decide to stop. Yes. That'll be something to no longer be

769
01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So modified the goal, based on what you just said. Let me just show you what I just did.

770
01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:26.100
Erica Valdez: Okay.

771
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:27.750
I put

772
01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I put opiates and I put a slash Suboxone so heroin.

773
01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: percocet Viking autopsies.

774
01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:41.970
Erica Valdez: Or something. Yes, I'm listening to

775
01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Our all short acting opiates.

776
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay buprenorphine is a opiate it's an analgesic

777
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a strong analgesic. It is a pain reliever.

778
01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's just, it is a long acting so it stays on those opiate receptors about 24 to 36 hours. Okay, that's why you can just take that one dose to take it in the morning and it lasts you all the way through. For some people they wake up and they notice a little bit of sweating or they

779
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.130
Erica Valdez: Might have been noticing that

780
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

781
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's normal.

782
01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:37.470
Erica Valdez: And I told Dr. At our last visit that I actually even been having to open another one and take a little piece of the night because I and I said it when we were on our last virtual meeting to with all of us that I've been having such a hard time falling asleep.

783
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:51.570
Erica Valdez: I've been so sweaty. I feel nauseated. I just feel like I feel right. Yeah, we, you know, without the medication. That's how I was feeling so I that doctor. No, he said he was going to give me a call and after our last visit he didn't give me a call.

784
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so something still hasn't settled.

785
01:20:54.690 --> 01:21:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Correct. And it's a very rare client that

786
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, after the first month, unless there's been sort of

787
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How it's hard to put this. Let me phrase it a different way. When you take

788
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That additional medicine on your own. That's in a treatment. Consider self medicating because it's against the doctor's

789
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:22.260
Erica Valdez: Orders, right, you got it.

790
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A prescription that it's this. Now your situation. Right.

791
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.100
Erica Valdez: Now,

792
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Is still unstable you we had a missing prescription you ended up taking

793
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A SHORT ACTING opiate here's your you're still feeling some withdrawal is still haven't settled in a good, a good stable a moment yet so that right now. I would say, Let's not even worry about that. Let's just get your stable.

794
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But in the future we'll take a look at, you're going to run out.

795
01:21:54.810 --> 01:22:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If you end up self medicating you'll run out of medicine, you won't have a little bits that you're going to need

796
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:00.630
Erica Valdez: Correct.

797
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's going to be super inconvenience for you.

798
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:03.900
Erica Valdez: Yes, so

799
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll go into

800
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:08.610
Erica Valdez: Bits of list this ya know okay so

801
01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: The other goal that you had mentioned when we very first met was be outside more talking with people.

802
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And now we have time. And I know you're irritable.

803
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see if I can have a little better understanding of what that means. What does that mean,

804
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.890
Erica Valdez: Just to be outdoors work usually either side.

805
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.720
Okay.

806
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but it's the West people. I'm curious about

807
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.580
Erica Valdez: Just talking more to keep blow. I usually just talked to my family. Okay.

808
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many months or years, have you just been doing up

809
01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.320
Erica Valdez: Maybe a year.

810
01:22:57.810 --> 01:22:59.640
Erica Valdez: Maybe a year and a half, probably

811
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:02.430
Erica Valdez: Been aware right

812
01:23:02.730 --> 01:23:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you think that became a habit like during the drug use, like you got used to kind of withdrawing for people

813
01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:12.480
Erica Valdez: Yeah. Um, I think you had to do with a lot with like

814
01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:17.580
Erica Valdez: Like anxiety and depression and probably yeah from the medication.

815
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so some anxiety.

816
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And some depression.

817
01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:34.590
Erica Valdez: Well just just being irritable, you know, around people. And I think maybe it was from being overly medicated on opiates, you know,

818
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:40.020
Erica Valdez: When you're not when you're not taking I guess the right amount of pills.

819
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.680
Erica Valdez: And you're

820
01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:41.610
Erica Valdez: Very like

821
01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:51.420
Erica Valdez: pissed off at people. Yes. It usually makes people happy. But it makes them also numb. You know, I don't care what anybody says like that talk. We had the other day.

822
01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:55.260
Erica Valdez: It's just like whatever ignore them, you know,

823
01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah you related to that word placating right

824
01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.450
Okay, yeah.

825
01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you.

826
01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Opiates have been. You'll have to tell me. Has it been

827
01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: An ability to ignore and be numb to things that

828
01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Are going on around you. Has that been the case.

829
01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.200
Erica Valdez: Yeah, that's okay. Pretty much, yeah. Okay.

830
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty common. Many people do that.

831
01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:36.450
Erica Valdez: Like you withdraw yourself with people, you know, been on there for someone

832
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the numbness from feelings. So if you had to say which feeling the opiate numbs you from that you like the best. Which is the feeling you really don't like feeling

833
01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:56.940
Erica Valdez: Like play Katie, like we said just ignoring everybody and just not really paying attention to them.

834
01:24:57.810 --> 01:25:06.660
Erica Valdez: That's what I gets the most because they can tell you over and over and you're just like, whatever, you know, they're like, are you listening to me. And you're like, why are we not listening to them, you know,

835
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so is there.

836
01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let me list a few of the big

837
01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotions, there's

838
01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Anger.

839
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:19.230
Erica Valdez: I had that

840
01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:23.130
Erica Valdez: Opiates anymore. That's why I came off of it because my

841
01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:29.850
Erica Valdez: Husband's like you're the devil. And I was like, and I was really noticing. I was super angry. Okay. All right.

842
01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's joy that's sort of happiness.

843
01:25:35.370 --> 01:25:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's fear which has a lot of cousins.

844
01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It has

845
01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: antsy anxiety nervous.

846
01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right concerned worried. Those are all related to fear.

847
01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And their sadness and a lot of people identify, they won't say I'm sad, but they'll say depressed.

848
01:25:59.610 --> 01:26:00.390
Erica Valdez: Or angry.

849
01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

850
01:26:03.150 --> 01:26:04.800
Erica Valdez: You've identified angry right

851
01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of other emotions, but

852
01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: These are some big ones.

853
01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were using in your addiction right which which emotion. Would you say you were trying to avoid feeling

854
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:25.050
Erica Valdez: Joyful.

855
01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:25.980
Erica Valdez: Probably

856
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.730
Erica Valdez: You didn't want

857
01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:39.390
Erica Valdez: You didn't want. Well, don't because I was always high heels. You know it either way. If I was other pills. I was so angry. You know, maybe it was just that the way it made me. I don't know.

858
01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.160
Erica Valdez: It was really like a horrible.

859
01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:45.990
Yeah.

860
01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:55.770
Erica Valdez: I mean, at first, of course, when you take them for what you're supposed to take them for that you start to abuse. And of course, that's when it all goes south, you know,

861
01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice that

862
01:26:58.590 --> 01:27:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: In your marriage, your husband said you're, you're the devil here.

863
01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:02.640
Erica Valdez: I was

864
01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:03.840
Erica Valdez: SO ANGRY. Yes.

865
01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And before that you really hadn't registered, there was any

866
01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.800
Erica Valdez: Real problem and no

867
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:15.120
Erica Valdez: It was just a normal daily daily thing, you know.

868
01:27:16.170 --> 01:27:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So that anger is a real sign that something's up

869
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:20.940
Erica Valdez: Correct. Okay.

870
01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good for us to know in here to that might be a assign a red flag that

871
01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's going on, and you've got some of that already really now, but we're going to attribute that to withdraw right now.

872
01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:49.140
Erica Valdez: Yeah, and I actually since I've been on Suboxone I've actually been out more I cooked dinner more, you know, I'm actually doing a lot more things like I'm not just love to the couch just grouchy and not wanting to do anything, you know,

873
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and took tell me what

874
01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:56.640
Erica Valdez: I mean, click a full course dinner.

875
01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.520
Erica Valdez: Feed your family, should I say

876
01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, I got you. I heard the word to okay

877
01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:03.930
Erica Valdez: But it'll cook.

878
01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot more sense. All right, got it. That's great. Alright, so once we get you stable. I mean,

879
01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta tell you, I've been doing this about

880
01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: With these guys for about two and a half years and

881
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, yes, to having such a great impact on people's lives. But we do stable so

882
01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:29.880
Erica Valdez: Where I see some of the girls that are tapering down and they talk so highly advise them like they're doing so I like yes I do see it, you know.

883
01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:41.400
Erica Valdez: In group obviously some of those guys that are on there. They just make me my very that's when I like to get irritable. I'm like, What, wait. Oh, yes.

884
01:28:42.210 --> 01:28:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So some

885
01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Of them are inspiring and there are some people in group.

886
01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me how they make you feel when when you listen to them.

887
01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:53.310
Erica Valdez: As to which one

888
01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I don't know, I just, I was listening to you, tell me.

889
01:28:56.370 --> 01:29:03.540
Erica Valdez: So listen, like the girls that are inspiring or the the gentlemen's that are like really making irritable, which one you want me to talk about

890
01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Both I like both.

891
01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:19.920
Erica Valdez: Okay, so I don't even remember her name, but she's been tape read for weeks now, she just says that she feels better. She looks like she feels better. She does say that she feels groggy, sometimes, but I like hey if she can do it. I can do it, you know.

892
01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:35.610
Erica Valdez: And then some of the gentlemen that are on there. I just like nobody really wants to hear about your surgeries are your you you know just, I like that is sickening. You know, we are all fighting their own battles and we don't want to hear yours, you know,

893
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:42.960
Erica Valdez: For I mean I know that's what were there for what I just like some of it is way too much said

894
01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so in other words you're hearing people's surgery coming up. He is talking about. It seemed like none of your business. Kind of thing like

895
01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:09.360
Erica Valdez: Well, just the way they say it. You know, it's just like you know you're on group with 20 people if that you know you're talking about your deck and surgery and your

896
01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:18.810
Erica Valdez: You need more Suboxone and I'm just like you were here to taper. We're not here to continue to go up, you know, we're like, I don't know, but

897
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.770
Erica Valdez: I got it. Sorry.

898
01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think, I think I know what you're talking about.

899
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:30.570
Erica Valdez: But I mean, other than that. The webby and and some of them in better are there that are saying that their tape or even a photo. Good. I'd like yes I got that he had no okay

900
01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so it is a

901
01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: There is both sort of

902
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe leaving into some of the things that that help support you and then also being able to hold space because a group is a really unique environment. Sometimes we're taking we're taking in information and feeling support other times we're holding space and listening for someone

903
01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And they take so

904
01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That you'll notice your role changes right when there's these gals that are like really kicking butt, you're, you're sort of being that sort of absorbing that positive inspirational.

905
01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Information and other times, you're going to be kind of just holding space because everybody's at a different stage.

906
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Of correct insight, their ability to own their truth take responsibility and so it's just sort of

907
01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding space for someone else. Maybe patience is needed at that point.

908
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:29.610
Erica Valdez: So that's when you play Kate, I guess.

909
01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:33.870
Erica Valdez: Don't

910
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that

911
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's cute though.

912
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The whole list is about really seeing that you have a choice. We can say, I think.

913
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's active listening saying I get because it would be horrible to be looking at a surgery when you're chemically dependent. Imagine you were going to go to a surgery. And now, what would you do, you're already on the subs.

914
01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:04.350
Erica Valdez: Well, how you actually get to have surgery to I get my tubes tied March.

915
01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:10.290
Erica Valdez: 17 I think so. I also need to talk with you guys and see what the heck we could do for that too.

916
01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but, but there are things we can do. And so as long as there's communication. So you. So in one sense, you could say, well, I don't really like the specific

917
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Medical discussion but and maybe it made you think, huh. This is a real concern. I'm going to need to stay in communication with my physician with my

918
01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Clinician here and get some preparation.

919
01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Around that and

920
01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And the next time you talk with them. Make sure you bring that up to

921
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.680
Erica Valdez: Okay. Okay, excellent.

922
01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

923
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.320
Well,

924
01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Pros and Cons of group.

925
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: By some of the females as they taper.

926
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.720
And then didn't really like caring about some of the medical conditions.

927
01:32:53.250 --> 01:33:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then you're aware that you're able to cook full meals and then you said something about going outside and talking to people. What's a little story we've talked to someone that feels a little

928
01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:18.750
Erica Valdez: Carrying full conversation. You know, before it was just real short. Oh, hey. Hi, you know, are you know just walk past them as they're talking to you, you don't. Nice. Now, I'm like, Okay, you don't know where you are, how you bad

929
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.480
Erica Valdez: I see. Okay.

930
01:33:22.770 --> 01:33:23.100
All right.

931
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:25.350
Excellent.

932
01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just curious about the

933
01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: oxy code on

934
01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It is that leftover from procedure.

935
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:48.930
Erica Valdez: No, actually I got that off of somebody yesterday. Okay, or the day before Tuesday. It was Tuesday.

936
01:33:49.410 --> 01:33:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't have anything left in the house to 10 I

937
01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:52.860
Erica Valdez: Don't. Okay.

938
01:33:53.280 --> 01:34:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, because, you know, let's face it, if I'm let's say trying to not be tempted by whether it's an alcohol or a substance and I still have it in my cabinet.

939
01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:05.940
Erica Valdez: We're really be

940
01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna be really hard to eat chocolate. Right.

941
01:34:09.330 --> 01:34:09.720
Erica Valdez: Yeah.

942
01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: My cover, um, um,

943
01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So we get a lot of information and our triggers are a great deal from what we see.

944
01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we at least don't have

945
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That or even the role of the sound of the bottle or the smell of something

946
01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to help us.

947
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of, hold on, and not have that craving so

948
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.020
Erica Valdez: What do they call that out of sight, out of mind.

949
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:31.710
Yeah.

950
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:33.090
Erica Valdez: Very

951
01:34:33.810 --> 01:34:35.310
Erica Valdez: Good, thanks. Okay.

952
01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's see what

953
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.730
Else.

954
01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's

955
01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another appointment.

956
01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.020
For next week.

957
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: When is your next group.

958
01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:03.870
Erica Valdez: Every Monday.

959
01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you'll be there Monday.

960
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.650
Erica Valdez: And then after, when does it start going monthly or do we always stay weekly

961
01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it'll, it'll go down. Okay.

962
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put together a month of consistent attendance because you still

963
01:35:26.670 --> 01:35:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Have it

964
01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this is hard to believe, but

965
01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.000
Erica Valdez: It's like I've been on here, five times. I'm just kidding.

966
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What this is supposed to be here. You still haven't been able to get yet because you're in so much distress.

967
01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we're not going to get much therapeutic benefit from this, you'll probably just sort of walk away, barely remembered meeting with me. It's been so so uncomfortable for you once you're stable, you're going to see that you're going to have time to really address

968
01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationships.

969
01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Asian feelings. I do trauma work with my clients. So you haven't quite been able to develop that trust and rapport with me yet.

970
01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you will once you're feeling better. So give yourself a chance. I just, I just, I feel bad for you because you're missing out today from it because we're kind of like you're on your miserable.

971
01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.930
Erica Valdez: Yeah, for sure.

972
01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So it'll get better. So the but the basic structure is let's get a consistent months together, will we look at it again. We'll move it to every other week.

973
01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And I guess.

974
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll go to

975
01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.620
Erica Valdez: To monthly. OK. OK.

976
01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But so that's that's our goal.

977
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

978
01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm struggling with right now is trying to figure out a time to meet

979
01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To meet next week I'm challenged, is there a possibility.

980
01:36:50.970 --> 01:37:07.020
Erica Valdez: I can do email. So if you have Sophie, where you want to squeeze me a little. The evening I eat dinner about 430 so I'm free anytime after that, I know you probably don't want to work after that, but they need if you need a squeeze me. Right, right, right.

981
01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a real house.

982
01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how would it be just for this next week that I call or text you on an on call basis.

983
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's a little awkward, but I

984
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:29.910
Erica Valdez: Am going to pull. Now that I have you on the phone. I'm going to pull my, to my calendar down or maybe

Gwenevere Abriel: Tuesday and Friday on call, which just means look. The reality is, I only have about a five minute window. I know that seems insane but I wait about 1015 minutes to see if people are going to show up for their appointment.

993
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And I might text you and say, hey, can you kind of free in the next hour, there's a possibility. I may have and then you just can say no I'm out shopping or no. Yeah.
