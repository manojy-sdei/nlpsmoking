Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

18
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me go over and create a little note.

19
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: For us to record open. No, we do.

20
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: How have you been feeling. I know the stress of this isolation has been quite something. How are you doing around that.

21
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.250
Lyndsey Lorett: You know that they finally opened gallop back up somewhat um

22
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.580
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just, I don't know how we go from zero cases to 1700 in a month.

23
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You have any ideas like any guesses about how that might happen just so that you can at least have a story in your mind about how it could happen.

24
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:17.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, I mean, I know a lot of it is the reservation there including the reservation with us. And I know they come here to shop, but I don't know.

25
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.440
Lyndsey Lorett: It's like a virus has gotten political which is like even worse than the virus.

26
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me what that means for you on political

27
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.900
Lyndsey Lorett: I

28
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.900
Lyndsey Lorett: Feel like there's so many factors in this besides the virus that are just as scary as getting sick.

29
00:03:49.890 --> 00:04:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is. It's a very complex. Well, it's, it's our it's our planets issue, isn't it, right, we're all talking to put our minds to it. Um, and, and what is that like for you to do that. Is this

30
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that like to do that to have it be political that it's more than just a bug.

31
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.050
Lyndsey Lorett: It makes me think that the end of times is near.

32
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.730
Lyndsey Lorett: And I just don't know who to trust and believe anymore in our government

33
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Not that there was a lot of that before but there were somewhat of it and now it's just

34
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All politics is a difficult thing, much like religion. Is there anything. Is that something you want to spend some time talking about in here today.

35
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

36
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.280
Lyndsey Lorett: That might actually be good.

37
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

38
00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:06.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Because I'm, I'm just afraid to say my opinions out loud because of the of the way I believe and that my in laws don't believe the same and I'm

39
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.570
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know, I just wish there was someone that could guide us through this and

40
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:30.030
Lyndsey Lorett: And it damn it has to be an election year, and all this other stuff and stupid Bill Gates and there's so much information out there. It's like what that can't be true.

41
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, notice how if you're if you're feeling like you're holding back also in here I'm just sort of tune into that and see. Do you have want to create safety, somehow, do you want to test me in some way.

42
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so that you can feel safe, so you can get it all out, because it's not safe to really let your opinions out elsewhere. So, see what you need to do to feel even safer in here with me.

43
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, I do feel pretty safe with you.

44
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let me hear all about how stupid Bill Gates's

45
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But

46
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.160
I just

47
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:20.400
Lyndsey Lorett: I know that the Christianity has said for years that there's going to be the mark of the beast in

48
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.110
Lyndsey Lorett: You know, just all the stuff. It says in Revelations and it's just

49
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:44.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Mind blowing to me that just, you know, just last year. Bill Gates was predicting this just a few months ago. He is predicting this like I don't understand why people would want to be so evil to control the population.

50
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so who's evil in this. This scenario is Bill, the evil one. And he get he predicted it

51
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.210
Lyndsey Lorett: He predicted the pandemic. Yes.

52
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And he calls it

53
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.950
Lyndsey Lorett: I i'm i don't want to place like that's a huge accusation.

54
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but did you, but just watch your own words, did you just now, though.

55
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.030
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

56
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just asking because to protect it. So I was just asking if they because great

57
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So he caused it. You think he caused it.

58
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

59
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.560
What else

60
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:38.520
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, I think that Dr. G is setting setting us up for more the virus to spread and I'm

61
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.320
Lyndsey Lorett: He's

62
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.820
Lyndsey Lorett: The President just listening to a few people.

63
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So Dr felt she is setting us up for it to spread

64
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.700
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah. Yes.

65
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.870
Okay.

66
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And the President is is once

67
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:08.280
Lyndsey Lorett: The fact that we're so close to closing or the economy just being over from being closed for a month.

68
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's responsible to

69
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The economy being closed who's responsible for that.

70
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.270
Lyndsey Lorett: I, I don't think any one person is responsible. I think it's the virus.

71
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Which Bill Gates caused

72
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

73
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said something about what the President is up to.

74
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:48.630
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, he's only listening to the people on the task force, you would think he would listen to, you know, as many doctors as possible or or many scientists as possible.

75
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

76
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

77
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.950
Lyndsey Lorett: The fact that it's spreading and children in such an extreme way.

78
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Is

79
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.770
Lyndsey Lorett: Like it just adds another layer of fear. There's so many layers of fear, Gwen.

80
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So many

81
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:39.720
Lyndsey Lorett: I one last thing. I feel like the generations before us, that worked so hard to give their children a better life and their children a better life and

82
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:48.780
Lyndsey Lorett: You know this thing that we're trying to do as generations. It's just all been taken away in a month.

83
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

84
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.700
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, was that one.

85
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I didn't say anything, but I can, I can say what took years to build you know in in one month can be destroyed.

86
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.360
Lyndsey Lorett: It's not how it's supposed to be.

87
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.510
Lyndsey Lorett: You're supposed to build on top of, you know,

88
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:30.840
Lyndsey Lorett: And then the cuckoo who's out there that they're spreading it you don't know if they're like, is it just depends.

89
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.660
Lyndsey Lorett: But I got out what I need to

90
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

91
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

92
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it like for you in a day to day life to to still be living with people that maybe you can't share openly just sort of continue to process layer after layer of fear.

93
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your current life like over there.

94
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

95
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.490
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm just trying to make the best of it.

96
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.270
Lyndsey Lorett: I really am. I'm not trying to take every little thing to offense.

97
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:32.100
Lyndsey Lorett: And just, you know, I get this time with my son that most people don't get when they're little, and I'm just gonna focus on enjoying that instead of all the petty stuff that was just eating at me.

98
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:35.610
Well,

99
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:43.440
Lyndsey Lorett: Not petty stuff that was eating at me. It was big stuff but

100
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you kind of have as a little memory with all in this week that was just utterly adorable.

101
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Did you say, how am I communicating with Ali when he's not really verbal

102
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Oh, that's funny. No, I

103
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, maybe we'll kind of remove video for a little while, so we can hear each other. Let me see if I can help you with that.

104
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Is it my internet connection.

105
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say turn video off for a few minutes so i i

106
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Just turn off your video off for a minute.

107
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.550
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, stop video

108
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I said was just tell me some cute that all I did.

109
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.900
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, it's so he is learning the word no.

110
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.480
Lyndsey Lorett: And

111
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:54.390
Lyndsey Lorett: There's a lot of nose in the house right now that he can't touch. So we say no. So no walk past you and shake his finger at you and say, No, no, no, like, you've done something wrong.

112
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

113
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Gosh, adorable.

114
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your mood and your, your, your emotion, Ben, most of the time.

115
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:26.550
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean I, my, my mood and emotion has been better. Um, I'm sleeping a little bit better.

116
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.610
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

117
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:45.510
Lyndsey Lorett: But just this underlying fear of when are they going to allow surgery. Again, when am I going to be able to move forward because it was just stopped. Everything, everything I was working towards stopped.

118
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything is on hold.

119
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.790
Lyndsey Lorett: It is

120
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.000
Lyndsey Lorett: No elective surgeries.

121
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And they don't deem yours as necessary because you can function with this.

122
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.640
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

123
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.160
Lyndsey Lorett: That's amazing. Yeah, I know. I was shocked to it's like what

124
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.660
Lyndsey Lorett: I have a 34 year pound

125
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.460
Lyndsey Lorett: One and a half year old and I have a hernia. How was that supposed to work.

126
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:39.300
Lyndsey Lorett: But I sitting here trying to figure out why your how're all of that. It's like wasted energy when they say yes, I will take the S and go, and I'm excited about tapering

127
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me

128
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.940
Lyndsey Lorett: I am so, so excited to taper I

129
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:56.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Just feel it. It's just a giant step forward like I when I got the phone. Yesterday I just started to cry because I didn't think it was ever possible

130
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

131
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

132
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You had originally wanted that when you first started the program. He said, I would like to be medication free

133
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. And so let me start marking where we're at and start to truck this. So how many milligrams. Did you take today.

134
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.700
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, I took 23

135
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. And so you'll keep an eye on that.

136
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, my guess is you won't really even notice anything that that's such a high dose.

137
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:42.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I don't think so. I think, yeah, I don't think that I will notice anything for quite a bit of the taper.

138
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, if you do, just make sure you're not shy about telling us. Okay.

139
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:54.480
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I, I really I think that doctor, he was interested because of the time that I've been on it.

140
00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:02.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Is going to be interesting how it works. I mean, have you treated anyone else that's been on it for this long.

141
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How long have you been on it.

142
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Night eight or nine years.

143
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I've worked with. And actually, he's a client that we taper once he went down. He had to abruptly leave the state.

144
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We actually stay in contact with him.

145
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And he tapered off.

146
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.220
Lyndsey Lorett: He did.

147
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my goodness.

148
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they didn't take her down, down, down, down. Right. And then he brought play. He did a quick he needed to rush it because he had to leave the state. So over a long weekend, he you know he did this thing where he it's a different approach. It's go down is one thing taper down to one thing

149
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

150
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's this real shift in mindset where

151
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want to be off, but they're not the same. And I really like to make that distinction. So for now, it's just taper down to, to a dose that if you have to have surgery have to have urgent care.

152
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That you could benefit from, you know, either having to take an opiate short acting or having to take additional buprenorphine for pain management.

153
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Philosophy that you and I and the doctor in right now.

154
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But you dancers. Yes.

155
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it.

156
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.620
Lyndsey Lorett: Why is a rare when for

157
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't

158
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Know rare.

159
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell you I'm

160
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It that is credit if you had a notepad, you would write down. He is not going to be one answer. So if you want to write down. Why is it rare. First of all, is it where I don't think it's rare.

161
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: All of my clients 99.9 because I have new clients that aren't tapering yet, much like you when you first came in, we didn't talk about it.

162
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, yeah, and I have some that say, I want to be on this forever. So, okay, I don't know if that mindsets going to stay the same way. I don't know if that's going to change. I don't know if what I'm dealing with is

163
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: addictive behavior. And this is someone who's still in a inactive addiction. So there's I'm in active addiction. My drug of choice has actually become buprenorphine. There's the fact that there's afraid to taper.

164
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: At a rate of one milligram at a time. Some people are tapering at point two five. So watch how long that's going to take, there might be a hyper responsive.

165
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative response to a little bit of sweating when they get, let's say down to whatever number. I'm not going to put it in your head. So then you think it's some magic number, it's not

166
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.550
Lyndsey Lorett: So they're exaggerating.

167
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're exaggerating a cold, which you and I get cold, we get sick, but they're turning that over there reacting as if it was the full 10 out of 10

168
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Withdrawal symptoms and there's I've been using it for my anxiety. I'm using it for my depression. There's just habit of self medicating behavior.

169
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: There's relapses people have

170
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a complete disconnect with they never to begin with. We're really buying in that this was treatment. It was just

171
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Were your drug dealer or illegal drug dealer. So that's just a few. I mean, why so rare. I don't think it's rare. I think I would. I can almost say all my clients are tapering

172
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I have summit or at point two five milligrams summer at point seven five milligrams

173
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.190
Lyndsey Lorett: That's amazing.

174
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And they started at

175
00:19:53.940 --> 00:20:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: They started there and they made their way. Why does it takes time. I'm here. It'll be three years in June. Why, because what you guys come back. You've been used to using this now you specifically just take it in as a y'all.

176
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, they use it for

177
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychiatric reasons. They've used it because they are upset stressed angry, sad depressed jealous, they've been using it to self medicate and getting out of that habit and instead using mindfulness practices direct communication spirituality meditation stretching

178
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: healthy coping skills is not a habit yet. Why is that

179
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:51.510
Lyndsey Lorett: It takes up. I thought the whole point of Suboxone was so that you could get those tools.

180
00:20:52.410 --> 00:21:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Well, if you could be you could be in an MIT program and not be getting a single tool. Most people you find out for eight years. Are you telling me these these people that were getting it for you before we're giving more doing the behavioral health part

181
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.270
Lyndsey Lorett: There.

182
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.900
Lyndsey Lorett: Know,

183
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.180
Lyndsey Lorett: Your health Park.

184
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That's what I'm saying. How are you going to get the chills. Where are you going to learn them.

185
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, that's true.

186
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a rare program that we're taking very seriously. I take it very seriously.

187
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Where I want people to be in here. We have specific goals. Let's look at them. How are you doing are you using them. What's working, what's not working.

188
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at life satisfaction. Let's look at the reason the underlying reason why substance use was the solution to begin with.

189
00:21:46.980 --> 00:22:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because pain is going to be in my life and you're a separate part the suffering piece is the part where behavioral health where mindset where prayer or meditation, where cognitive reframing. All of those things can have an impact.

190
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's both, it's treating and saying you have developed a chemical dependence for whatever reason, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter whether you did it because someone stuck it in your arm you know you were sex traffic doesn't matter.

191
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes opiate receptors are the same as the one that started because they had a broken goal, it doesn't it doesn't have a moral compass.

192
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:28.110
Right.

193
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So the behavioral part says okay

194
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at what you can do when that automatic thought that's that's put in place for whatever the etiology, the origin origin, whatever the origin. We've got to be able to have other automatic healthy thoughts.

195
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets you to think of other coping skills. We've got to put those in place, install them and still the practice them do them so that you think of them instead of i can self medicate.

196
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I can address whatever I'm going through with a pill. You want to get away from that. Um, but why why so rare. You say, Well, you're

197
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in the same culture. I am what is what is every doctor, do they say, here's a pill. Here's a pill for your stress. Here's a pill for your anxiety. Here's a pill for this and this and this. Everybody pushes but they never say to you.

198
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That your body already knows that you were already created with all of what you need.

199
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:33.750
Lyndsey Lorett: To like

200
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're already created to self heal. Um,

201
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.630
Yeah.

202
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We're talking about day to day stuff. I mean, I'm not trying to be awake. If I'm going to have my my gallbladder removed. I want to be a despot eyes, you know I'm saying like knock me out Gemma see all my Dummy, dummy.

203
00:23:52.410 --> 00:24:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, reason why Opiates are so amazing is because it has this analgesic effect. But that's not everyone is using it for nine out of 10 people in here have crossed over to now trying, they liked how they felt on it, they went, oh my gosh, this is the first time I've ever felt more mobile

204
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:17.820
Or this

205
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Means what just accidentally got treated was anxiety and depression. It got accidentally coincidentally treated

206
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But that is not the treatment. We don't use those what we what we want to do is change the mindset, we want to put in healthy ways of managing anxiety and stress and depression. You want to address the core issue pills don't teach skills. They don't

207
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

208
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.550
Lyndsey Lorett: And these so

209
00:24:52.080 --> 00:25:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The end. They never will. All they do is reinforce to take the pill to take a pill that you're not good enough that you're not enough. There's something broken flawed imperfect faulty and

210
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I

211
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't agree.

212
00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So why so rare so rare because, look, if you count. Let's just calculate how long it would take you. You wonder why

213
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's calculate how long it would be on a piece of paper.

214
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.670
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't at the moment.

215
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I do, I'll do it.

216
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.460
Okay.

217
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go, let's say,

218
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know the doctor, the thing. Let's just say every two weeks, okay, because that's, you can go faster than that. But you're three years and I've watched what ends up happening. So just going to put it in every two weeks. Okay.

219
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, alright, so here we go. We are at 23 and we're going to put

220
00:25:53.130 --> 00:26:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Will say may may 12. Then I'm going to go to May 16 may 26 will say 22 and we're going to go

221
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: June.

222
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: 9 that's 21 and we're going to go to

223
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess we'll be in your record. We can track it since we're putting all this work into it.

224
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I do that.

225
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone. I do this with a lot of people that are tapering okay so we can cross check how you're doing.

226
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

227
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so by June 23rd up a 20 and then

Lyndsey Lorett: I'm

276
00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I got really freaked out with my sweating or I had a little restless leg and you decided no I don't want to take the quantity or I don't know what's going to happen.

277
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This takes time, because we don't want you to go into a withdrawal where you end up saying this is too hard. I can't take her. I don't want that. That won't work. You'll end up convincing yourself. This is too hard. This is too scary, but this way. We have time

278
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to succeed, for you to come in and brag about it, share it with other people. Right. And you also in grew up, you have this additional almost like social pressure

279
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Like oh, look at me, I'm doing it and maybe you maybe you hear someone else's at a number and you're like, I want to get there, too. And you might have a bolstered sense of excitement to do it.

280
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a little bit of accountability. You guys don't do it directly. You don't say, Hey, why didn't you taper. You guys don't do it.

281
00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: In a really direct way but there's this subtle sort of social pressure also there. Hey, me too.

282
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Which can work.

283
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.140
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I would think so.

284
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So by March, you're going to be done a one milligram

285
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:16.680
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my goodness.

286
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and your head is going to clear up right your, your, your, the fuzziness and you don't even know that it's in it right now, but it's going to get sharper. Your mind will get clearer your confidence that you can do your life just like terms is just going to, you know, exponentially.

287
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Now if you decide, you know what I want to go with this more quickly. Go for it. I don't care. That's between you and I

288
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:51.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

289
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: All I'm going to do is track it. I'll just be once in a while, so I can have. Where are you at, and then I'll just kind of mark it down. Okay.

290
00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

291
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:00.600
Lyndsey Lorett: Maybe

292
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Can say, Hey, oh, I'm going faster. Oh, I'm three months behind

293
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Just know that every time you go up.

294
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to read taper back down.

295
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:27.120
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, you mean if I'm tapering tapering and then I'm like, whoa, and I take more than I have to re taper. Oh, wow.

296
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: All right back.

297
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.930
Lyndsey Lorett: That's awful.

298
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm saying it because a lot of you don't realize that it's all that work, you put in our want to say it. So you realize it's effort it takes a lot to

299
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Cut, cut these things and be precise and Murrah you're going to probably need to end up like grinding these tablets up and get a little scale. So the data.

300
00:33:50.340 --> 00:34:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can just do it so that you're not over tapering too fast. You want to do it just right so that you're not experiencing huge withdrawal and then it doesn't get confused. I wish our pharmaceutical company made half a milligram or a quarter milligram. I wish, I wish they did.

301
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't chop.

302
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.470
Lyndsey Lorett: Wow.

303
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This tapering is not, it's not a universal approach. This is new, you're doing something really new.

304
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.390
Lyndsey Lorett: That's so necessary.

305
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I, I, I am

306
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. It's tell you this field behavioral health and especially around the opiate dependence piece, the typical mindset is you get onto methadone and you do it for us to your life.

307
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just

308
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Not acceptable.

309
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Not for me.

310
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But

311
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think people took the time to say, well,

312
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not teach these people how to live their life without it.

313
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.230
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, thank you, because in reality you're replacing one drug with another

314
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.480
Lyndsey Lorett: You are still dependent on

315
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You are the pluses. You're not developing tolerance which means you're going to keep having to raise the amount you need to fill those receptors and there shouldn't be a significant euphoric. I know there is one I know when, you know, it hits your bloodstream, but

316
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, not supposed to be the same rush and euphoria that the short acting opiates, especially heroin Gibbs so

317
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the benefit of it.

318
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:51.930
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, that's true, that's, that's a good point. And you can function better on it, you can

319
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.500
Lyndsey Lorett: You can work and do normal things

320
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So today is a review how you're doing on your goals day and we just spent quite a bit of time.

321
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Developing a taper plan taper down plan.

322
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and we'll

323
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that put inside your short term goals here and maybe tuck it under the relapse prevention plan put the tape or protocol down in there. Um, let's look at

324
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This first goal, which is this is not one you said this is one that

325
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is sort of automatically offered to everyone and it's identify how spirituality and or religion affects your recovery process. So how has spirituality help support you on a day to day basis. Would you say with your, your recovery goals.

326
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:09.960
Lyndsey Lorett: You know, I just don't see another way without spirituality not yeah I mean in a they say higher power like there's

327
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.840
Lyndsey Lorett: It's that

328
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Shrunk

329
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.040
Lyndsey Lorett: Stability that you can turn to

330
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to go for a moment to those thoughts of layers upon layers of fear.

331
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about what you could do to utilize that faith.

332
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And stability.

333
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.180
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't really know how to incorporate that. With so many layers when

334
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:55.830
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean, you know, you know, in the end, it's in God's hands in it, what's you know going to happen is going to happen, but

335
00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.630
Lyndsey Lorett: There's just so many parts.

336
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.100
Lyndsey Lorett: That it's hard to see how it's going to work out, or if it's going to work out.

337
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you have the thought if it's going to work out.

338
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Well yeah, I mean, we could have like World War

339
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you could do to prepare for World War

340
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the first thing that came to your mind just now when I asked that question right but i asked it.

341
00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.350
Lyndsey Lorett: self sufficiency.

342
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, which means what

343
00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:47.820
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm

344
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.400
Lyndsey Lorett: To be able to survive when all those things are taken away that we're used to.

345
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But what would you have to do if you're going to, if it's going to

346
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn out to be a war. What do you need to do to prepare for it.

347
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:13.200
Lyndsey Lorett: I need to learn how to not be so sufficient on all of our

348
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:24.210
Lyndsey Lorett: You kinda yet yes dependent upon you know so at the gas station and eating out so many times and just

349
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Um,

350
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.100
Lyndsey Lorett: We're our generations really dependent on it.

351
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Go into the store when we need something or

352
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.400
Lyndsey Lorett: I just feel like I am not prepared.

353
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.040
Lyndsey Lorett: I do know how to can know

354
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.720
Lyndsey Lorett: And that's important.

355
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you have peach trees.

356
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: apple trees to make the

357
00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.070
Note

358
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how to garden.

359
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:06.390
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, but growing things in New Mexico. Is that really difficult.

360
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and gas. Are you gonna

361
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a bike or something to prepare

362
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:18.990
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know.

363
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.130
Lyndsey Lorett: It's like a whole list that you would have to go in and

364
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:25.140
Lyndsey Lorett: Write you

365
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Alter everything

366
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alter everything. So if you're going to hold on to this notion. And this is a Socratic dialogue Lindsay, this is just to provoke discussion. I'm not presenting any particular beliefs. This is to get you to be thinking about whether this is something you want to put your energy into

367
00:40:45.840 --> 00:41:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not sure how much energy it would take for you to change everything to prepare for this belief that is something you said earlier, which is you see if I can find it. Mark of the Beast.

368
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Its end of times. Is that what we're talking about. You're going to need to care for it. So, um, why haven't you been been preparing this whole time.

369
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:22.890
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't know. We've been comfortable and in repetitive behavior. You know that society offers

370
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Come, yeah.

371
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:36.360
Lyndsey Lorett: My biggest fear in all of this, and any type of situation. And this is sad. This is what makes me feel like I need to be off of these medicines.

372
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:48.600
Lyndsey Lorett: Is that what happens if medicine can't be shipped out what you know it's just such a fear. How will I protect my children when I can't function myself, you know,

373
00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So all of these fears.

374
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Will ultimately be

375
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A real zeroing in a narrowing of focus on to

376
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Some pretty core beliefs and values, they're gonna they're going to really get you focused

377
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And what you just said was

378
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Will I be able to have access to pain medication and will I be able to protect my children.

379
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

380
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.550
Lyndsey Lorett: without pain medication, but the subtext.

381
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is absolutely pain medication.

382
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.170
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, I don't agree with that. But it makes it sound like it.

383
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Percocet, or

384
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Some

385
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right you know that these were designed for cancer patients.

386
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.590
Lyndsey Lorett: I do know that

387
00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So notice how you're resistant to wanting to to take in data like as in facts.

388
00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:05.790
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

389
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, backed the locks on was added to mitigate

390
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Drug Abuse. So in fact you're taking the one that doesn't have the locks on on it. You're taking if you're taking subjects you are purely just taking pain medication.

391
00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:26.700
Lyndsey Lorett: That's true.

392
00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Which doesn't have any of the locks on on it. And so, but notice how you don't like it, how it's just tonic. You really don't. I don't want, I want to hear that amount of pain medicine. I don't want to hear that I noticed

393
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet

394
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Why, though, why do I fix that.

395
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know, what's your opinion about people that are addicted to pain pills.

396
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Was a really direct question. Oh,

397
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.520
Lyndsey Lorett: I just I

398
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:25.230
Lyndsey Lorett: Without overthinking it I just see someone who is addicted to something

399
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:33.000
Lyndsey Lorett: So control. That's what I picture somebody who does not have control.

400
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Okay, so let's go back to those original images that I was talking about that. There's chemical dependence chemical dependence is a neurotransmitter. It does not have spirituality

401
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.220
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

402
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: does not know right from wrong.

403
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The same person.

404
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That did IV heroin.

405
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So same opiate receptors right as you

406
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not about control.

407
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not about your belief in God.

408
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's my opinion. Anyway, just to play with this idea right just throwing something out there.

409
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.870
This is about

410
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Biology. This is chemistry, the slide here, and there's a slight variation between my chemistry and everyone else on this planet.

411
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But the mechanism. The, the existence of the opiate receptor is still the same for all of us. It's maybe this one years looks like this like mine, like that years like this, like this.

412
00:45:48.750 --> 00:46:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's still an opiate receptor. And it doesn't have a moral compass one isn't evil one isn't good unless you tell me that you got another perspective on this there your heart beats you have the same origins as everybody else on this planet.

413
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:07.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

414
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The same cellular structure. And if it's not, then we can we know because they've got, you know, you can see behavioral issues and they've got disease and we give a labels and our medical professionals, they given labels and we try to treat it when those cells.

415
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Are not

416
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A typical when they are a typical

417
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not evil.

418
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.130
Lyndsey Lorett: Wow.

419
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:42.510
Lyndsey Lorett: That yeah I get. I get it.

420
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You

421
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.810
Lyndsey Lorett: Get it, but it's a lot

422
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know, but that's why I'm very deliberate with this word. You guys are chemically dependent and then I say,

423
00:46:55.470 --> 00:47:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about what behaviors of addiction. You guys are engaging in or you'll hear me say what is your addict voice seducing you

424
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where you can kind of get into that evil notion if you wanted to, or the devil kind of trying to get you to come over to the dark side. You could. That's where that kind of moral stuff could come in, but it's not about

425
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We were made.

426
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To be self healing and we're perfect were made to take care of itself. It has a plus it has a minus as sympathetic and parasympathetic it has all of it all of what it needs. It's self contained. It's amazing.

427
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.540
Lyndsey Lorett: It's true.

428
00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But addictive behavior. And that's where you hear me talk about the voice of addiction all say, you know what

429
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it telling you to go do. What did you just tell you to do. Did it just tell you to omit

430
00:47:52.470 --> 00:48:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: To a friend to a family member did is say, well, don't tell the whole truth. Just keep some of that truth to yourself. Don't tell them they charge you, then we might have to change. We might have to look at how we've been diverting our medicine, our money, how we

431
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How we were using it to

432
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: get things done, we would do all our work this way or that way. That's the voice of addiction. That's the one where that that stuff. You were talking about up here.

433
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The face and good, bad evil. Right. That's where that stuff if you want to you can play it in with that. I'm not a fan of the voice of addiction I if I had to use your kind of language. I would say it's the devil.

434
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.530
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

435
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:39.270
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, I never heard it explained like that. Glenn.

436
00:48:44.370 --> 00:49:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not even though I can lay it out like that. Navigating which one is communicating is difficult. And so that's why I encourage as we're showing it each time when we're in group and we're together. And I'm saying, How honest are you with the people around you.

437
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, are you in shame because if their shame that means you're literally it's just a pipeline straight

438
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To the, to the addict voice saying good you don't like a big piece of who you are and that's fantastic. You don't like who you are. Well great.

439
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great because then we can hide from that and we won't tell people, and then when you really feel like feel crummy about it, you're going to want to use those self medicating

440
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, it will tell the doc. I'm not ready to take her yet yeah let's tell her that because we're not ready. We're scared you can't you can handle it.

441
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.220
Lyndsey Lorett: That's a really negative thinking, though.

442
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But there it is.

443
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: For most people, it's that

444
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm not shy.

445
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.690
Lyndsey Lorett: See everything that you just said the

446
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:56.490
Lyndsey Lorett: roadblock.

447
00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. But I'm not shy about calling it out. I don't have ambivalence about speaking to the addict voice with reproach. I can say I can shave shut the F up. I have no problem be rude to it.

448
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's not your friend. It doesn't love you. It doesn't care about your health growth happiness and it does not care about your children.

449
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.730
Lyndsey Lorett: When that is so powerful.

450
00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

451
00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:28.860
Why

452
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But Lindsay, trying to figure out was that Lindsay, or was that the voice of addiction making any given decision any given choice. It's difficult to see it as we're looking out into the world and we're driving along in our automobile and we're driving and it's like

453
00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I want. I've got my Bible my Christianity and that gives me the map, but no one said there'd be a pothole right here that's not on the map.

454
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And when and this road is is closed, and I have to go down this other thing. And, and, and my my map doesn't have that this is a brand new direction.

455
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing this building collapsed and now I have to go this way and I have to actually really divert and have a detour. I had this map, but it is not the terrain.

456
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you do it.

457
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you rely on you are in the car you're driving

458
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.370
Lyndsey Lorett: Your instinct.

459
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Instincts okay and so that's you, Lindsay when your gut. That's what you always kind of hear me come back to this body of yours that is it's off sustained little ecosystem that knows how to take care of itself. You have your gut.

460
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it tells you, something's wrong here. I don't want to let this passenger into my automobile.

461
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I want to kick this person out of my automobile keep sending me yucky information or keeps doing things that takes 20 hours.

462
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That should I was totally distracting me. Maybe I'll let this person, I'll say it was nice hanging out with you for this journey so far, but I'm going to leave you here at this hotel, and I'm going to go down and I'm going to drive without you I invite you to get out of my car.

463
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And someone else in and who do you in your automobile. Maybe you let me and sometimes maybe Dr. Overall it's there. Sometimes maybe

464
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe someone a minister or someone who who really resonates with you, you bring those words in the automobile when you're driving it. So your gun has this thing and maybe you check it out and say, well, what would you do

465
00:52:49.440 --> 00:53:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I thought about that. That's interesting. I think about it. Let me go do that. And I'm I drive this way. Oh, I did not like that. Oh, no. Okay. My gut said no I didn't like this, I may not have the words of the language or how to do it, but I have my gut.

466
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have a basic map have my spirituality to guide me right and wrong, and she moves you know people that have this what you're describing as addiction.

467
00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The voice of addiction that addict is in the car with you. My question is who's driving is that you or is it the, I mean the automobile.

468
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.880
Lyndsey Lorett: No, it's me, but the attic.

469
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Whispers in your ear.

470
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. Yeah.

471
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry. Okay. Well, why don't we, I just looked at the time, I just realized what time it was

472
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.030
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, yeah.

473
00:53:51.330 --> 00:54:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear from you a little bit, let me try and have some video here. Come on back. See if we can still hear each other and kind of just process what came up for you today, just take some time and my next clients not here yet. So just kind of talk with me about what this is like today.

474
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:18.420
Lyndsey Lorett: I think that um some core beliefs that I have about addiction have been

475
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:25.320
Lyndsey Lorett: Literally, you just like chopped it like with a machete like you chopped it

476
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:31.680
Lyndsey Lorett: It's a, it's

477
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.720
Lyndsey Lorett: A lot like I just want to say here and think about it.

478
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:37.890
Yeah.

479
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:41.760
Lyndsey Lorett: I've never looked at it that way.

480
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:51.690
Lyndsey Lorett: And I guess maybe it makes me want to be kinder to myself.

481
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. Oh, good, good. I'm so glad right because you're not a scummy addict or you

482
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Know I'm not

485
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:13.290
Lyndsey Lorett: Mm hmm. And talk. I think it will always

486
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you can put it in the backseat.

487
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:18.960
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, you can.

488
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you can turn the radio up and you can say, shush act like a statue.

489
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

490
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:28.440
Lyndsey Lorett: That's true.

Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

494
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I really invite you to sit with that that notion of, of what you just did of

495
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, pulling those apart that that's not you. That's the authentic.

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.980
