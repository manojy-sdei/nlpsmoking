00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: tiny, teeny tiny

2
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.140
Alicia Noedel: She's doing a lot better.

3
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How many hours.

4
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.280
Last night.

5
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.130
Alicia Noedel: I went to bed.

6
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.380
Alicia Noedel: And then she woke up at like two and was having a hard time but

7
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Went back at least 334 maybe five hours.

8
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.220
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

9
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.170
Alicia Noedel: I'm I'm feeling pretty good though.

10
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And it just the teething or you think she's picking up on something else.

11
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:22.110
Alicia Noedel: She has like a lot of gas and stomach problems right now. I don't know if that's because of the TV, but, um, I guess a lot of doctors don't agree with whether or not a fever is a symptom of teething. Some of them say that it is. Some of them say that it isn't.

12
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.220
Alicia Noedel: And

13
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.850
Alicia Noedel: A lot of parents confuse flu symptoms and teething.

14
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:36.930
Alicia Noedel: So, um, I mean, she was only really bad for like three days if she could have had the flu. But I see little teeth buds in her mouth so

15
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That the temperature. I thought was a little on the high side, wasn't it

16
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.890
Alicia Noedel: Oh, it was 104 and I

17
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

18
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's high fever any mom would be freaking out. Yeah.

19
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.740
Alicia Noedel: It started at 100.3

20
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:09.060
Alicia Noedel: And my mom said, you know, it can range between like 97 and 100.3 that if it goes above that, that we need to start worrying and so I got witch hazel, I had wet washcloth I had her with no clothes on, like, freaking out.

21
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I'm sorry that this week was really hard for you guys.

22
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:26.100
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I just don't want to see her suffer, you know, she's the main one. It's sad. Her eyes look so different now. Like, she looks like she views the world differently. And it's so

23
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.550
So,

24
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what

25
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.960
Alicia Noedel: He's doing a lot better.

26
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to be okay. It's, it's, it's that you were right there with her. That's what she needed is you looking back at her letting her know she's okay. Okay, that makes you there's no there's no separation of object at that age you are other self.

27
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So the fact that you're right there with her letting her know she's okay when she's crying when she scared when she's having that body experience and you look back at her with love and in the sounds of their, their everything's going to be okay that sweet tone.

28
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets in. That's how she's going to identify she's going to identify the ability to regulate the self, because you were there.

29
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So you may want to do another yeah that other story you are doing. But this is the one. This is the one that makes the difference. This is, this is what's going to create the attachment bond. This is going to be the one that

30
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say that the world is. It is, it is scary ugly horrible scary place. No, actually what she was met with with you.

31
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, it's not quite what you were saying if you

32
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Weren't there. Yeah.

33
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If you weren't there for that if you weren't when you said I will all she can all she wants is to stay in my arms. Well, all she has to cry to come

34
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Out to you and have her body take care of itself. And you to pay attention and you did.

35
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Hundred percent a plus job.

36
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.400
Alicia Noedel: Thank you.

37
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.050
Alicia Noedel: I tried. It's hard. I, I didn't know teething was going to be that are I really didn't think it was going to be better.

38
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.050
Alicia Noedel: And she's very sensitive already, you know, so like the littlest things bug her so when she was feeling like that every little thing.

39
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.590
Alicia Noedel: That would happen that she didn't like necessarily she would

40
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.730
Alicia Noedel: flip out

41
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.700
Alicia Noedel: Or daughter.

42
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you, Mom, what's this been like for you.

43
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:34.590
Alicia Noedel: Um, it's, it's been hard. I'm just seeing you are obviously I mean I had a little slip

44
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.640
Alicia Noedel: With them over taking my medication.

45
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:52.440
Alicia Noedel: It's just me really really like I feel like it's just like me reverting back to my old ways instead of like, you know, using my positive always positive, you know, tools that you've given me to not

46
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.310
Alicia Noedel: Do that.

47
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.960
Alicia Noedel: I

48
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.760
Alicia Noedel: Panicked

49
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.900
Know,

50
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys are so hard on yourself.

51
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay.

52
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really okay

53
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: All this is just a message that we gotta keep

54
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta keep getting the information we you know we we can't cram it all in.

55
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple weeks and takes time.

56
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um,

57
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So just go gently when it when it's time for you to give yourself like that that self-reproach just say, you know, it took me years to get here. It's going to take some time to get this feeling under my belt. It's going to take some time to develop the new

58
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Tissue, and

59
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I can remember.

60
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I can remember these other ways of going about how I can meet my negative emotions.

61
00:05:46.590 --> 00:06:03.630
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I miss it. I miss being the way I used to be. I feel like you know drugs have really like affected my brain. I feel so illiterate. Like I feel like I'm not the same person on the inside. Or like, I can't articulate myself as well as I used to.

62
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.650
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, I don't know if you've noticed I tried to explain myself to you with certain things and I have a really hard time

63
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.710
Alicia Noedel: My memories and what it used to be. And that's all from the drugs, it's it's really messed me up.

64
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's this really cool word neural plasticity and we're many years ago we thought that the brain was exactly

65
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly what its potential be and it doesn't your as smart as you're ever going to be, but it's not the case, we have our brain is very adaptive and it grows and that's that word Neuro plasticity. It means it stretches and grows and you're going to get your brain back

66
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.690
Alicia Noedel: That's cool. Yeah, but

67
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It does mean you have to turn on the brain. It doesn't happen passive

68
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So right, you'd think it would. Well, I want to know if you've got to be reading and learning and stretching it. So I'm wondering if you're here doing that or we benefit consumed with motherhood.

69
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:27.060
Alicia Noedel: I haven't read in a really long time. I wanted to start downloading audio books and stuff, cuz I don't really have time to sit down and read a book which is unfortunate. I love to read

70
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.460
Alicia Noedel: I mean I feel like I'm missing something in that area. I feel like something's missing.

71
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.560
Like craving.

72
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.610
Alicia Noedel: Some kind of, you know, stimulation

73
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. So yes, audio books.

74
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe including some that are

75
00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting your brain thinking. So if it's something that you could be either learning something to maybe it's a language. You could certainly do some other interest that you have

76
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.500
Alicia Noedel: On the tree learning Spanish with my daughter, because

77
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Who wouldn't that be cool.

78
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.430
Alicia Noedel: And, you know, mom knows Spanish

79
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Also, it surprised me when they're, when they're little, I think it said about you know 18 months they can start signing. You can teachers. Yeah.

80
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't really confusing.

81
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But I did it, I was like, well, this just seems impossible. And then a child that can't speak can actually say that there they want more, they, they actually can die. Yeah.

82
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be able to sign will be able to say, Mom, Dad, more where they're done, because then you'll know whether they want food.

83
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And

84
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It develops the language side of the brain earlier. So they're connecting communication with

85
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: With signing and that part of the brain gets developed even faster. So that's pretty exciting.

86
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:12.780
Alicia Noedel: So every time. Like, like, here's a scenario on how to teach that and install that in your childhood. What, like every time you, you know, go to go give them their bottle of their food do you like, Do you want more and do the sign with it.

87
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I'm I'm trying to remember how I did it. I'm not. I can't formally teach this, because it's not my skills, but

88
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna have to remember now so I'm

89
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to think. So when I put his food in, I would say.

90
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You want more.

91
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say more, one more. So all three.

92
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.200
Alicia Noedel: That's really smart and

93
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you won't believe like how you just you just look up some basic sign language for for babies.

94
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be shocked.

95
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.600
Alicia Noedel: Hey, I know a little bit of signs but that's really interesting. I didn't know that at all.

96
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.760
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. Really know they'll do it all of a sudden their little hands will like for my mom and dad.

97
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do these things. And it's just a what was exciting was just the empowerment that this little one could now directly communicate with me. I was like this just feels amazing.

98
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:15.870
Alicia Noedel: Right.

99
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:23.460
Alicia Noedel: Because I know that they've had a lot of research, there's a woman who's, who is like been studying it for like a certain amount of years.

100
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:34.260
Alicia Noedel: Of babies language and that babies. I have their own language from, you know, the minute. They're, they're able to you know make little noises or move their arms.

101
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:44.310
Alicia Noedel: And that they can you they are communicating to you what they need. You just have to know what those signs are and what the noises noise means

102
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.540
Alicia Noedel: That's super fascinating, but that's a whole different ball game.

103
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's turning into the child, though. That's what this is about. So, there

104
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are some real overlap there.

105
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So today, I do want to go over as I do every month I go over

106
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Clients folks and

107
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: One of your primary goals is never get back to where I was using heroin so

108
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the things that I asked everyone to do for this first month is I'm I asked them to attend group weekly I asked them to attend individual therapy weekly for 30 days.

109
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think overall, you've you've met that in a really meaningful way. You not only show up. Like I listened to you and you really contemplate the concepts and you emotionally appear to be just trying them on really listening and almost feeling the meeting.

110
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What is this month been like for you.

111
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.630
Alicia Noedel: Um,

112
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.940
Alicia Noedel: Overall,

113
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:27.150
Alicia Noedel: It's been hard. Yeah, just isolation has been really getting getting on hard on me a really trying to keep my cool because I'm now at this point. Like I feel like a lot of our personalities are like clashing with each other in the house.

114
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:38.250
Alicia Noedel: You know me and my mom or or we have the same star sign. We're both Leo's and so we kind of butt heads a little harder than

115
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.950
Alicia Noedel: But that only happens you know when we're really, really, you know, sick of each other.

116
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.540
Alicia Noedel: But on the other side. It's been very

117
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.530
Alicia Noedel: Hopeful that things will get better soon.

118
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.540
Alicia Noedel: With our country and the world, honestly.

119
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And to attend.

120
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: These services here. How do you think that's impacting your recovery.

121
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.900
Alicia Noedel: It's helping me a while. I think it's helping me a lot. Um,

122
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.020
Alicia Noedel: I feel, I feel like

123
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.230
Alicia Noedel: Like outside of my family. I don't have

124
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.930
Alicia Noedel: Anybody that

125
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.680
Alicia Noedel: really listens.

126
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.890
Alicia Noedel: In it, it's, it's like made a big difference for me to be heard.

127
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:40.680
Alicia Noedel: And

128
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.800
Alicia Noedel: To for for things to be acknowledged that I'm, I'm not crazy like

129
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:53.880
Alicia Noedel: everything that's going on and everything that I've done, and everything that I'm doing is justified.

130
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

131
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Last thing you want to feel like you're going insane and have that self doubt and have your reality and validated.

132
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't help but notice that

133
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're you're living with your mom right now three

134
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Times those conflicted feelings come up

135
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.550
Alicia Noedel: Um, that's why I kind of july meetings I doing meetings in a room where no one can hear me.

136
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.410
Alicia Noedel: Because I don't, I don't want it to cause you know issues, either in Illinois. I don't really think it would let them.

137
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.040
Alicia Noedel: Grow want to hurt anybody's feelings. Either you know

138
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:52.050
Alicia Noedel: But I do tell her what we talk about. And she's aware that

139
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.070
Alicia Noedel: I've been getting it off my chest and

140
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:03.210
Alicia Noedel: We have heart to hearts all the time about her, you know, showing a lot of remorse.

141
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:13.950
Alicia Noedel: And feeling really bad for all the hard years that we endured together.

142
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you have that, not, not many children have environments like what you described had a chance to heal in real time.

143
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The relationships so so that's that's a unique opportunity you have and

144
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean she knows what to do. So it might not go perfectly and and those same things that may have made you feel invalidated when you were younger might still be present.

145
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we touch on that a

146
00:15:50.490 --> 00:16:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit and see how maybe when you describe just now those personalities. Where are you noticing you might be saying something feeling something and you, you try to be heard and it doesn't it doesn't seem like you are or my dad.

147
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.890
Alicia Noedel: When I was a kid.

148
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.290
Alicia Noedel: She would do.

149
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.460
Alicia Noedel: This thing where she would ignore me so like I would

150
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:25.350
Alicia Noedel: Be trying to talk to her, you know, really hung like 678 like bitterness or something or want to play a game or whatever it was.

151
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:36.720
Alicia Noedel: And shooters ignore me and watch TV or like just a moment. And so now in present day, um,

152
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:45.510
Alicia Noedel: I want to show or something or tell her something or asked her if she remember sleeping, stuff like that. And she'll be on her phone.

153
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

154
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it.

155
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Up. Someone just texted yeah

156
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.320
Alicia Noedel: Yeah I so record collectors.

157
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:07.290
Alicia Noedel: She ignores me, and sometimes it really it bugs me a lot more than it probably would for a normal person.

158
00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do because it's moments. What do you do with those

159
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When they eat. I get really frustrated

160
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:26.130
Alicia Noedel: And I you know I say, Mom, I'm and then she doesn't, you know, hear me, I just walk away because I'm not gonna sit there and beg for attention.

161
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm adding this as a potential target for us to explore this is an important one. I think putting this in sort of this

162
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Side thermometer thing.

163
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.840
Alicia Noedel: Is currently. I don't think she does that on purpose.

164
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if she used to do it on purpose, but

165
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.990
Alicia Noedel: You know she's just so consumed in what she's doing at the time.

166
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.590
Alicia Noedel: That's a big one.

167
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.790
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I can't, I don't like to repeat myself I'm

168
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.880
Alicia Noedel: From from that experience of feeling like we normally when I was a kid.

169
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

170
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: An alternative

171
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not giving advice. I'm just saying that there's other ways to go about it if you decided to. It doesn't mean now it just means there's other ways to go about it that honors the fact that I'm

172
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.820
Alicia Noedel: If she is

173
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To just sort of healing that rupture in the relationship.

174
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: When she's off the phone. Six hours later, five hours later, a day later, you can say, hey, Mom. I'd like to talk to you about something.

175
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And being able to say, oh, my ears really bad. Sorry, you're

176
00:18:59.400 --> 00:18:59.940
Alicia Noedel: My

177
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When I when I see you

178
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I feel

179
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever it is rejected unwanted unloved dialed up. Hi, even over what normally would be a really minor

180
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Event. Have you been

181
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: On the phone.

182
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, I think that's because

183
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't get enough then and

184
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's my question to you, Lisa. This is the missing piece and all that, of course, I made up that whole story. But there are pieces of it, you just shared with the part I don't know is right in that moment when she's on the phone. See if you can catch

185
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: indulged in what you the fantasy, the absolute fantasy of what would fill the empty hole that is that right that emptiness that

186
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Lonely unwanted piece right in that moment. What if Hey mom.

187
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And just between you and me. I'm not going to tell her I'm not going to say, hey, go tell her this is between you and I want to know the fantasy.

188
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: In that moment now in current day she's busy on the phone and you come in and you try to address her you do address her. What's the fantasy. What would you like to do

189
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.680
Alicia Noedel: At least acknowledge that I said some

190
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.370
Alicia Noedel: You know, I'm not expecting her to

191
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.590
Alicia Noedel: drop everything at that moment.

192
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:41.250
Alicia Noedel: Okay, because that's, you know, unrealistic that's being a little selfish, I think. Okay.

193
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:41.790
No.

194
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.710
Alicia Noedel: Game.

195
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm asking you to do that. I'm asking you to drop into what you're labeling selfish. I don't know that you have a

196
00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Realistic, you know, I'm reference point ups.

197
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So the end here. So you did not even in here you indulge

198
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.480
Alicia Noedel: No, I wasn't finished.

199
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good.

200
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.150
Alicia Noedel: Let me is it um

201
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:21.450
Alicia Noedel: I am whether she's you know, playing a game or you know whatever because it's never her talking on the phone.

202
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:22.860
Alicia Noedel: It's, you know,

203
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:34.080
Alicia Noedel: Her you know messing around on the internet or whatever, you know, at least, just look over and be like, give me a second baby girl. I'll be, you know,

204
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:45.780
Alicia Noedel: I'll just give me one second. I'm just going to finish this or whatever, even if it's something important. You know, just hold on real quick just being acknowledged is all I want. That's all I want is just acknowledgement

205
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And when your daughter wants your attention.

206
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.430
What are you going to do

207
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.840
Alicia Noedel: I want to, you know, give it on divided her

208
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're on the phone playing a game. What would you do when they

209
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.640
Alicia Noedel: dropped my phone.

210
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Fuck yeah. So notice how you didn't do that for yourself just now.

211
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm not a kid anymore. That's what you put we are at least here we're stuck at age six

212
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: We're stuck.

213
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Even in here. You wouldn't indulge in the fantasy God for

214
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Bid she she can't wait to get off that phone to heck yeah

215
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.730
Alicia Noedel: Makes me feel like less important than a stupid like

216
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Amen sister. I gotcha. Yeah.

217
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you don't even in here, verbally.

218
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Give it that chance that stuff some in here to help. Notice I called it a fantasy.

219
00:22:53.460 --> 00:23:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but it means disappointment, but you knew you knew exactly what the truth is. Because this is what you would give your daughter where you're giving what you didn't get

220
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the piece.

221
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It is reasonable that you may be able to heal. If your mom really knew what the recipe was I don't know her capability. I truly do not if, but if she means it and what she would do. She can't get her hands off that phone fast enough. Yeah.

222
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, this is just a game go what's going on and just locked on

223
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah that's it right there. Just sit with that.

224
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:54.210
Alicia Noedel: And then her memory isn't as good as as it should be, or isn't used to because of her you know past so

225
00:23:55.290 --> 00:24:08.370
Alicia Noedel: I'm will be in a really intense conversation about, you know, my childhood and things that, you know, really affected me. Uh huh. And I'll bring something up to her. That was pretty significant.

226
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.920
Alicia Noedel: To me, and she will say that it never happened.

227
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.410
Alicia Noedel: invalidating me

228
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Out.

229
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:31.530
Alicia Noedel: She doesn't remember but you know it 100% happened you know whatever the situation is there's a few different things that happened that she will, you know, say, to this day, never happened.

230
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:50.490
Alicia Noedel: I don't know if that's her own way of blocking it out to make herself, you know, not feel horrible because I don't want her to feel like a bad mom either, you know, she was a great mom before the drug before she started to doing drugs and she's a great mom now that she doesn't do anything.

231
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.320
Alicia Noedel: So really is.

232
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So at least yet if you say

233
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What you actually are hoping went so don't make any excuses for her. She already, you already given

234
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Jobs of mess with her memory. She's a good enough, Mom. Now you've already given her all the excuses. Those are the buffers for anything to come

235
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.470
Alicia Noedel: As far as that's just how I feel, though, to, you know, it's, it's an excuse, per se.

236
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just go back to you have a reason for why you're wanting to share things with her. What are you hoping you'll get when you say this happened, Mom.

237
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want her. What do you want from her.

238
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:49.380
Alicia Noedel: I feel like I just want praise I just want someone to be proud of you.

239
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, as in you endured a lot. You're amazing for having survived. How I treated you like that.

240
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.940
Alicia Noedel: were like, oh, I didn't know we were talking about like from when I was a kid talking about it.

241
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

242
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm saying. I'm saying you're bringing up

243
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.690
Alicia Noedel: Things I just want

244
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.870
Alicia Noedel: I just want them to be acknowledged.

245
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

246
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is where you and I can do some

247
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Some specific things. OK.

248
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.460
Alicia Noedel: OK.

249
00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.790
Alicia Noedel: If you and I tissue. OK.

250
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.410
Alicia Noedel: OK.

251
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

252
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: acknowledgement from your mother.

253
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.620
Alicia Noedel: If

254
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You could just be

255
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: This would be different.

256
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But if it could just be where she listened attentively.

257
00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Nodding and saying,

258
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I validate and I acknowledge the feeling of what you remember, could that be enough if if she was able to pull that part off.

259
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it's not the memory itself. But what the residue of it. Could that be enough.

260
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.150
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

261
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's fair. Because you're really thinking about it. Yeah. So, so that line right there. And the reason why I'm proposing it like this is because a memory is so flawed and you haven't even included yes there's

262
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there's

263
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychological denial, but we haven't even included

264
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the fact that you yourself and me and everyone else when we're in a high stress high amygdala response the cortisol that covers the hippocampus messes with your memory.

265
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It corrupts it so it could be all of those things.

266
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you're going to end up having invalidation as an adult. Again, you're going to have had the trauma back then and then you're going to say it to try and be validated as an adult and now you're getting the whammy twice.

267
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't want that for you.

268
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm proposing and this is this is not going to happen. All in one day today. This is me trying to understand what your mother's capable of right now. I'm trying to get a sense of

269
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: A if you could tolerate

270
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being validated for the experience of it and not having your mother say yeah

271
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That happened. Yeah. That happened. I did that to you. I was unavailable to you. I left you alone. I didn't take care of you didn't protect

272
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: My concern is you're wanting that from her as the healing part are you might end up being let down again.

273
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And yeah, see. So, and we're not i'm not blaming her for that. Just saying. I don't want you to be traumatized. A second and third and hundreds time for that.

274
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.890
Alicia Noedel: It's, it's more just kind of like a, you know, like

275
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.610
Alicia Noedel: WTF moment like what do you mean

276
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.800
Alicia Noedel: You know, like it is obviously happen, you know, what do you mean

277
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.140
Yeah, right.

278
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So that one.

279
00:30:49.380 --> 00:31:02.490
Alicia Noedel: Like I just, I don't like I don't understand. If it's like a really like her. Don't doesn't remember or like are you just, you know, trying to save face, like, I don't know, but

280
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't, but we're just taking this into one piece at a time.

281
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, we're not talking about

282
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have to have understanding about why she did that thing. We're just trying to sit with what your mother is capable of doing that will meet your current adult need

283
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.640
Alicia Noedel: For understanding if Muslims very understanding and she's

284
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.740
Alicia Noedel: Very smart.

285
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.380
Alicia Noedel: And she she really does want this.

286
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:43.710
Alicia Noedel: You know, like the counseling and everything she really does want it to help me. And she tries to help any way she can

287
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:53.940
Alicia Noedel: Okay, so, um, if I were to go to her and discuss it with her. I'm worthy to sure that she would

288
00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:03.360
Alicia Noedel: oblige. It's just, I don't know if that's enough for me. I was gonna when you asked me, I was gonna immediately say yes.

289
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.100
Alicia Noedel: Uh huh. And then I was like, you know,

290
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.270
Alicia Noedel: Maybe not. It's not. I'm not sure. So

291
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:13.320
Okay.

292
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we won't know till we get there. Yeah, no, no time to get there. We know that right now. This isn't enough.

293
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.320
Alicia Noedel: You can't do any harm.

294
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I get worse. Right now it's not enough invalidate to say she's outwardly saying that didn't happen. So that's not that's not working. I mean, not just as hard

295
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.890
Alicia Noedel: Or she'll be like, oh, I think you're remembering that wrong, or like that never happy.

296
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So the same way.

297
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of it like this, let's say you had a positive experience with something. Let's say you're enjoying being with your, your baby.

298
00:32:55.650 --> 00:33:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, you know, on her 10th birthday you think back and you you tell her I remember when you were a baby.

299
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.810
It just

300
00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You just lit up my life. You were amazing and I

301
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You my everything. And she says, oh, I don't think you're remembering that right

302
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

303
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Your daughter can't undo how you experienced it, you have an emotional

304
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Wiring to an event.

305
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Period. It was wired it was experienced a particular way how we feel is not, it's not something that anyone can argue with us about it. It happened. I felt alone.

306
00:33:44.670 --> 00:34:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Period that whether you would have felt the same way is not what we're talking about right right now. Mom, it's. And so this is, and I still haven't quite gotten to the proposal yet. I'm sort of still sort of setting the stage for this idea that if this way isn't working, trying to feel

307
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel seen when you weren't seeing when you were little trying to be seen now.

308
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that she has a full capability. But if we shift gears and you say, well,

309
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How about

310
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a new agreement with mom and it could be something like this. Mom, I'm working through a lot of my feelings when I was younger and you and I memory is

311
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Flawed for every one every one of us. Mine too. I, I think I've got a good one. And then sure enough, someone points something out. And yeah, you're right. It was in this other room and I did say that and oh my gosh

312
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

313
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. Oh, if you say

314
00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: About a new agreement mom when I come to you and I say, oh, I want to talk to you about a feeling I had when I was younger, that's happening again. Now,

315
00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you just say the following. To me, this is what the agreement would be like there was an agreement, there was a validating statement that you could hear from her if she decides to do it. That doesn't say to herself.

316
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I failed my daughter.

317
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we don't want to think that

318
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

319
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.400
Alicia Noedel: hurt her feelings, either.

320
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't

321
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:45.090
Know,

322
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.070
Alicia Noedel: I know it's a very sensitive topic. It talked about

323
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not her feelings were talking, you just moved from yours, which I'm trying to set this up. If you want to

324
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean this time could be some other session, but just to set it in the background that there's another way to go about it which means it would look something like this. If

325
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say this, you can kind of see this couch over here. Let's say this parent figure was here, it would be something like, you know,

326
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What right now I'm noticing. I'm so resentful so angry. I don't think this is just from right now I have a feeling this is some old stuff.

327
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you just

328
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me your full attention.

329
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

330
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you let me know that you understand what the emotion of feeling unwanted dislike, you know, or that

331
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: How that makes sense to you. So there's that's only three and there's more

332
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's very different than Mom, I need you to remember it the same way I remember it. Otherwise, I'm not validated because really and truly we're doing these these things where we say, well, I need you to remember this.

333
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But what we're doing is

334
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: We're talking about emotions there what motivated us

335
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think

336
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You may not want to have that emotion anymore. Maybe it would be nice to have happy and love.

337
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It. And when we say I'm not feeling

338
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted for important when your attentions on this game.

339
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It says, I think, more to do with my past, and it does really about this game.

340
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It goes, but we can say that you see.

341
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

342
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Cuz

343
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about feeling is that about you having to notice I don't tell my story from the past. This is, I think I'm all dialed up high on Sad, really, it's a big sad.

344
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not wanted moment. But I think at that moment, I think it has more to do with the past.

345
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It would mean a lot to me if you could just just choose to kind of spend a little bit of time with me today, if not right now, maybe, could you

346
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Reach out to me more often go seek me out, go seek out my attention. AND THAT'S A VERY ADULT THING TO DO A child doesn't do that. So if you're saying, well, I'm grown up now and that was in the past. Well,

347
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom may not know how to do that. Still, and so this is where we get into being an adult and we say this is what I like.

348
00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Couple times a day. And if you have to set an alarm. Just come look for me in the room and just come by and say I need doing and there's nothing in your hand, there's no phone so crossword puzzle. There's no book. There's nothing but you just

349
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Will air to do that. And I love you, an hour to show you. And there's all this blocking right you could get ahead and and say this is what's going to be respond to as well.

350
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You stick with it and you say it's not about that. It's about how it's going to make me feel right. I'm gonna heal from how I perceived my childhood. I think this will help me heal.

351
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not debating whether this or that happened.

352
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, I think I'm finding the recipe on how to heal. Do you want to participate in it.

353
00:39:54.450 --> 00:40:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see the difference. Yeah. Yeah. And that's one approach because now. No, there's no way I would even consider this idea if she hadn't already come to you and said, right, like you described her as this person who wants you to feel better. Right.

354
00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:12.600
Yeah.

355
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was a different version.

356
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We might we might be really sort of really having to draw the line and not expect

357
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything to change on

358
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you get into content when it has to be, how can you, how can you

359
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Not remember it this way, it's it's it's shaped who I am today. And it is the reason why I'm so sad. It's

360
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, how can you, how can you, how can you undo that.

361
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're going to keep hurting, and then you're really traumatized by it. But if instead you have the courage Lucien, I'm not saying this happens overnight to ask

362
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well just play with it a little bit over time.

363
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea that I'm proposing will either come naturally over time.

364
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Not necessarily today.

365
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want to give you is that there's kind of hope.

366
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That we're destined to have to recapitulate

367
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Over again.

368
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.540
Alicia Noedel: I

369
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.250
Alicia Noedel: Do want to be happy. I'm so tired of feeling sad.

370
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And at least see let's not wait for her to do the right thing. She just doesn't know.

371
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.840
Alicia Noedel: Forgive her for ya. Yeah.

372
00:41:43.500 --> 00:42:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget for that because forgiveness is so much better on the soul. It's better on the organs in our body to just say I accept that you didn't learn how to do this and maybe you get your brain got fried from the coke or whatever meth, she was doing on what she was doing and

373
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going to own what I want

374
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. And when you're ready, and if the environments. Right. And I can certainly

375
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that with you. Also, and that's another thing if it ever comes to where you want a safe place to do a family therapy session. I'm happy to meet with both of you and create that environment where I can teach her how to validate, I can teach her how to just mirror can teach skills.

376
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.440
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I think that having a talk with her about it first.

377
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:42.150
Alicia Noedel: If we were to do that would probably the best thing because I don't want her to get defensive

378
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

379
00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:46.830
Alicia Noedel: Thinking that I'm trying to attack her because that's not what I want.

380
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.880
Alicia Noedel: I just want us both to heal.

381
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's the thing, at least, yet it heals mom.

382
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: To love you the way you need it as good for her to you see now.

383
00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:05.640
There.

384
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So in a way that is saving face. And yes, absolutely. I can create the structure and say, Listen, Mom. This is a

385
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Planet. What I like to teach, both of you, and then you both.

386
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You both be doing them.

387
00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take some time now as we're here at the end. And you've been sitting with a lot of emotion.

388
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of

389
00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. Of course you are. Oh, I absolutely know it, you're, you're feeling the feelings.

390
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes you are. Okay.

391
00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Those other longings those other disappointments are still there, too.

392
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.370
Alicia Noedel: I don't want to ruin your ears.

393
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.750
Alicia Noedel: blow my nose all out in the microphone.

394
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.740
Alicia Noedel: I feel better.

395
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:23.790
Alicia Noedel: That's been bugging me for so long.

396
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to sort of be this this listening ear.

397
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: For a little bit

398
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.310
Alicia Noedel: off me.

399
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You think that weight was

400
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You've

401
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.300
Alicia Noedel: Been holding in or so long.

402
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.320
Alicia Noedel: Like I've said for so long. Oh, it's just something that bugs me. It just bugs me.

403
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:21.360
Alicia Noedel: This is not just with her. It's an issue with everybody now so like

404
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.120
Alicia Noedel: I know if anybody ignores me,

405
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:30.870
Alicia Noedel: You know it bugs me right away. Way more than probably, you know, a normal person would, you know,

406
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll probably happen in it'll happen here too and I would invite you to catch it. I might be looking off screen or busying myself or right distracted.

407
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And in here, unlike with mom, you can say

408
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't seem to be paying attention.

409
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I'm irritated looked away what we are, what are you doing

410
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: For most people, they, they don't risk it. They don't do that. But you, you might just do that you might be able to do that, boy, he you guys grew up, you, you talked about something else. And it's like you skipped over me.

411
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to do that.

412
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You may never run across a setting like this again. Yeah. Where you going to fight. You're going to feel that vitality might be anger. It might be something inside that stirs inside and you normally habitually

413
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Push it down and walk away and say it's better to just not speak my truth, but in the therapeutic environment.

414
00:47:51.420 --> 00:48:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Just make sure you do it when I'm around don't not just with a doctor with me because I'll know what to do to take care of you and to protect you and create the space for you to get your truth out

415
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm not going to make it about me.

416
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to get defensive. I'm going to say, Yeah, I did. And I get how that would feel you you need me to be just right here.

417
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes sense.

418
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:49.410
Alicia Noedel: Come down, sometimes I was when we're having our sessions I look at, I can look at you.

419
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:55.140
Alicia Noedel: Because you're here, I can see that you care, guys.

420
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.420
Alicia Noedel: It's too much for me.

421
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You can look away and glass away.

422
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to look away. You can change the glance you get to do that. And I'll just stay right here.

423
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.530
Alicia Noedel: I've been wanting to say that, but I didn't. I knew that it was good.

424
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's risky to say

425
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that real, are you kidding.

426
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Me is that with these eyes mean is that I know the risk

427
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I could let you down. I can

428
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it is

429
00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: No it's, it's very real.

430
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: With your with your room that you developed the I

431
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I was transported there.

432
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That loneliness was a cute and sharp and visceral, I can feel that

433
00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't, I don't want to be that I want to be here with you.

434
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.900
Alicia Noedel: Can be that way knows it's clogged so

435
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I got both my ears and her congested.

436
00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:53.880
No.

437
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.210
Alicia Noedel: That's horrible.

438
00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.150
Alicia Noedel: Let's suck.

439
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's weird today. It's weird to have both. I usually have one year at a time. This time I got both

440
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.600
Alicia Noedel: The skill and your ears pop when you're driving, is that what it feels like.

441
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Like yeah like or up in an airplane or underwater.

442
00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Usually it's one year and then the other. But this morning. It's

443
00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.220
Alicia Noedel: No, that's horrible.

444
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.230
Alicia Noedel: So sorry.

445
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay.

446
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I think when I tilt back. No, I do that.

447
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Really for a second.

448
00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.520
Alicia Noedel: You have to do that all day.

449
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Today it seems like especially

450
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

451
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: share a little bit about what that was like to be in real time with me that

452
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Connection of what you were experiencing with me in the moment.

453
00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.900
Alicia Noedel: It's just, it's intense

454
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.350
Alicia Noedel: It's really intense to

455
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.230
Alicia Noedel: Sit with your thoughts like that.

456
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.840
Alicia Noedel: But, um,

457
00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.970
Alicia Noedel: It kind of makes you want a clear mind because you know

458
00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.970
Alicia Noedel: you're here, you're here, you're grounded. You're just sitting care.

459
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.370
Alicia Noedel: You to take advantage of that to just

460
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.800
Alicia Noedel: You know, the things going on. Yeah.

461
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And and that you're okay. Can you feel that part two. Yeah.

462
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You sat with the intensity. There was a lot of risk. There was a lot of stake

463
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You okay

464
00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Set your intention for kind of how you want to take this experience today and maybe meeting. Maybe it'll be your fiance, you know,

465
00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:05.670
I would

466
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it level of honesty, maybe it won't even be anything you say to him, but it will be how you'll meet how you will be with him how the eye contact me.

467
00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The presence of not walking out of the room when you touch on that tender spot of wanting giving yourself permission to want a little bit more

468
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And not saying yourself. I don't deserve this. And they'll know or they'll give it to me or I don't want to cause a conflict or I don't want to hurt someone's feelings or inconvenience someone but lingering even for a second longer having had this was me.

469
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And that you were okay and that it's okay to just sit a little longer with it that window of tolerance of

470
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to go to irritation and then short right. I'm not going to go into that, instead of just going to sit with what do I want right now.

471
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I really don't want him cutting the onion, opening the fridge. I want him just to look at. I noticing it just

472
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just being a slow little detective just picking up on sitting with just that longing, a little bit longer.

473
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may end up doing the other things after. Oh, he's not going to give it to you. They're not going to bother to ask, and I get irritated and I made the road, you may decide to go that route.

474
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But at least you sat with it a little bit longer and you're able to name it. What would feel good and delicious nurturing right now.

475
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sitting with it a little bit more

476
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

477
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're talking about fractions of a second, by no means am I saying these are seconds, back to back. These are like this glimpses oh I noticed. Oh, look at that. I really

478
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I so would have preferred and maybe it won't be intense I gaze maybe where he will break. Maybe it'll be where there's a synchronized breaking and you'll both break off.

479
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just paying attention to what feels right inside your body what feels like you're really being sort of contained emotionally

480
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:32.670
Alicia Noedel: And maybe you do need to step back and take a second. Like, like you said before getting angry because I get angry right away and I don't express that anger to anyone else. So the only person it's affecting is me because I'm keeping it inside it burning inside of me.

481
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.310
Alicia Noedel: And I don't want that. You know, I do need to just, you know, take a second.

482
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: At least yeah i think i think your, your sweetheart, let's you. I think that just as simple as turning our head.

483
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Would would do the trick or just putting something out of our hands. Just, just be a detective for a while and see what it is.

484
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then maybe journal. It may be noted this person did this. It was so subtle my stomach. I knew it was true, because I felt it here in the body. Be a little detective and write it down. Date and Time journal and come back and inform us in here and see what we do now. I do have to go

485
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:14.700
Okay.

486
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

487
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I look forward to seeing you in group.

488
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:24.150
Alicia Noedel: Me to

489
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need me. Right. Your doctor do anything. Is there any medication attached today.

490
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Richard, do you know

491
00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:38.760
Alicia Noedel: No, I still have to get my own Thursday.

492
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.720
Okay.

493
00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.270
Alicia Noedel: Have a great day. Good.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Too o'clock eastern began to you.
