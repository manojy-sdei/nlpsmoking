39
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.370

Chelcey Skubski: Pulmonary Fibrosis

53
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:24.600
Chelcey Skubski: So, I believe, according to because, of course, when he went on the ventilator. The doctors were disclosing his medical history to me.

54
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:38.610
Chelcey Skubski: And I could see a he and I had scans from prior years of his logs that looked bad. So I think he knew and just didn't play. We're very, very close. My mother is an alcoholic has been my entire life.

55
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:55.110
Chelcey Skubski: Um, she was very abusive when I was living with her, which is why I moved out when I was 17 I live with my father briefly we became very close. Then, and so he was like my, my best friend. So I took it really hard when he passed.

56
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or some some story or

57
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: What I see, and then your mom. I'm sorry to hear about her problem.

58
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.480

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.710
Chelcey Skubski: Oh no, I talked to her. I just talked to her about 30 minutes ago, she is still very much part of my life.

60
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.890
Chelcey Skubski: However, in it is a problem. She's still in her own addiction.

61
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:34.410
Chelcey Skubski: She still has we bring her alcohol, um, she still has me take care of basically I took care of most of the financial and

62
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:53.460
Chelcey Skubski: Big kid adult stuff for her. When I was younger, so she still has carried over into now it's a source of strife between my husband and I, because he knows the funk good for me. And he knows that she's still being

63
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.760
Chelcey Skubski: Abusive in in a different way.

64
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:08.100
Chelcey Skubski: In my life so that causes a lot of problems for me and him as well. And it's not something I want to keep doing but I feel obligated to because she's my mother so

65
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: So like what kind of. Is she the way she talks to you, is it her

66
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.300
Chelcey Skubski: Um,

67

Dr. Belis Aladag: She asked from you, like she

68
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:24.360
Chelcey Skubski: She asked me to take care of everything for her. She is kind of like it's kind of reversed. Like, I'm the adult

69
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.840
Chelcey Skubski: Like I paying her bills for her.

70
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.500

71
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:42.720
Chelcey Skubski: Things like that, you know, she's not as much verbally abusive. She was when I was younger, because she knows I probably won't do things for her if she talks to me know

72
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.100
Okay.

73
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.240

102
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: So he's I imagine he's been a support system for you.

103
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:13.380
Chelcey Skubski: My biggest support system as far as my addiction goes, he is Hannah, my father in law, which I don't talk to my father in law about it, but he knows

104
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:33.720
Chelcey Skubski: But the only person I've talked to you about the addiction is my husband. Of course it's caused a lot of strike a lot of arguments. It's hurt us financially. It's been a lot of damage. So, um, but he knows about it, and obviously he's the biggest supporter of the getting insane team.

105
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:44.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I think it's, yeah, it's very important that we do that how we work on it. So it's really good that you're here and that we're talking

106
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:57.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so, okay, so, so after your father died. That's when the Norco abuse started happening. And then you moved away. You, you didn't have that doctor. So you started getting it off illegally.

107
00:10:59.340 --> 00:10:59.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: And

108
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:07.080

110
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:21.180
Chelcey Skubski: You know, my husband would find out I was up to the same old thing I would stop. I would try and clean.

111
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:22.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: On your own

112
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.460
Chelcey Skubski: On my own, it's always been on my own. I've never done on

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

136
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:57.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: I believe that makes sense because I'm so being, you know, and taking care of you as your physician, now is your addiction, Doc, I have access to, like, a database.

137
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:06.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Where I don't know if you've heard of it. It's called cures and it's basically like anytime you're given a controlled substance so like Valium Advent, whatever.

138
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, or other substances, I can. It comes up on us.

139
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:20.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, so yeah, so like it showed the only thing it showed for you in the past year was you got some lorazepam on for 20

140
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.000
Chelcey Skubski: Yep.

141
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: You got like five pills or something so they

142
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:23.490
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah.

143
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: They gave that to you. So, so that makes sense if you were there, the 16th, you came out the 20th

144
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:29.460
Yeah.

145
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, and

146
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:44.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: In terms of establishing care for the so so I have good news. The good news is,

147
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:57.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: For your cravings to help you not relapse and start using nor goes or other opiates. Again, we have a very good medication, you may have. It's called Suboxone

148
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.170
Chelcey Skubski: I have heard of it is better than methadone. Correct.

149
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:14.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's better because the lifestyle, it's better. It gives you so much more freedom it Suboxone or that's the brand name, one of the brand news the actual generic is buprenorphine.

150
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:14.610
Chelcey Skubski: Okay.

151
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:21.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: So buprenorphine is a medication like any others that you can get from a doctor.

152
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:30.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: grant you, you take it, you get the prescription like you would anything else and you have that freedom and flexibility of being seen in a normal office setting.

153
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:30.720
Chelcey Skubski: Up.

154
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:41.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: The don't methadone works, but it's got a lot of restrictions around it it's it's federally controlled. So you can't access it through a regular doctor, you have to go to a

155
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.140
Chelcey Skubski: Clinic, so

156
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:51.000
Chelcey Skubski: The one I was familiar with when I called about all the outpatient stuff they kept saying, methanol methadone methadone, so

157
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and I

158
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.950
Chelcey Skubski: Heard of

159
00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:09.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: The box Suboxone. Yeah. So if we if you can get sober. If you can remain sober and do your recovery utilizing Suboxone it's just easier on you. You don't have to. So if you were to do methadone, you have to go daily to

160
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.650
Chelcey Skubski: It right

161
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.670
Chelcey Skubski: I don't want to do

162
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.530
Chelcey Skubski: That right now.

163
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:23.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: With your child and everything is just wouldn't be more of a hassle for you. So yeah, it's in your best interest to, I think, for you. This would be the best fit.

164
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.530
Chelcey Skubski: Oxygen in it.

165
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.950
Chelcey Skubski: It helps with the craving. I'm having trouble with

166
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.090
Chelcey Skubski: Exactly. OK. OK. Awesome.

167
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:40.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I mean it really, it's it's it's a partial opioid so it's still in the same family.

168
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:46.200
Chelcey Skubski: Technically, so you have to be careful. So there's certain things like we don't want you drinking alcohol.

169
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.560
Chelcey Skubski: Right, I don't drink that's never been my thing.

170
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.040
For all

171
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.980
Chelcey Skubski: Of my mom but

172
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.910
Chelcey Skubski: Yes, I decided to go a different route, apparently.

173
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:12.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Unfortunately, yes. Addiction comes in different ways. But, and sometimes, you know, it could be. It's so multifactorial it's hard to say, but we do know there could be some hereditary genetic dispositions.

174
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:20.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, but it doesn't have to determine your destiny, just because you have a tendency for this. Well now you know you do.

175
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:35.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Doesn't mean you're going to be stuck like that. It just is like, wow, it's more of a warning for you. Hey, I'm I tend to go towards this stuff. I can't be using substances or exposing myself to substances that can cause addictions.

176
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.590
Chelcey Skubski: Right. Right. You know,

177
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Whatever they may be so I'm glad you stay away from alcohol but

178
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. With this

179
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:55.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: You it slows your rest it may slow your respiration, you're breathing. Right. So you don't want to be drinking alcohol or using so so like lorazepam

180
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Caught me

181
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, I don't know if they're going to do this long term for you or one

182
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.510
Chelcey Skubski: I have to have to make an appointment with psychiatry, just after I meet with you.

183
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:15.840
Chelcey Skubski: And I'm going to go through you guys for my mental health. So because they just gave me a 30 day supply at the hospital and the lorazepam

184
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:26.190
Chelcey Skubski: It was like, take two pills every day as needed. But they gave me five pills. So that was literally just like Karen, you're out of the hospital. Here you go.

185
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah, very little.

186
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah

187
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.660
Chelcey Skubski: It was

188
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:37.890
Chelcey Skubski: It was only the the mental illness pills that they gave me a 30 day supply up so I could have time to the doctor.

189
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:48.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so, so they are not even clear yeah you you really do you should. I'm glad I'm glad I was going to suggest that that you establish here with our psychiatry team.

190
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: I have a nurse practitioner and I think we have a few doctors. Either way, right.

191
00:18:52.770 --> 00:19:00.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Established care and then really get their input, they're going to know and you can tell them hey I'm starting Suboxone for my opioid problem.

192
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, um,

193
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.380
Chelcey Skubski: And sorry, can you spell that for me, just so I have a note of it. Yeah.

194
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:15.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sure. Um, so the the brand name is Suboxone su Bo X. Oh, and he

195
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.620
Chelcey Skubski: Got it.

196
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:28.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then the generic one is the real name is Bupa buprenorphine so be up our E and o our theme.

197
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:29.850
Chelcey Skubski: You cannot it

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.270
Chelcey Skubski: Thank you.

199
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.050
Yeah.

200
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:43.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so, I think. So how much Norco so like a week ago before your hospitalization how he

201
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:43.920
Looks

202
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:54.540
Chelcey Skubski: A lot. I always got 10 milligram pills I easily in one dose take 10 to 15 of those

203
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.560
Chelcey Skubski: Know a lot. Yeah.

204
00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: 10 to 15 in one dose and you would. How many times would you do

205
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.170
Chelcey Skubski: If I could, I would

206
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.700
Chelcey Skubski: Do it twice a day.

207
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, so

208
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.560
Chelcey Skubski: Dependent on money.

209
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.660
Chelcey Skubski: And availability, honestly.

210
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay.

211
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:27.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, so you are, you're on a pretty high amount of medication there. And so we're gonna adjust the Suboxone so the Suboxone there's no real like

212
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:37.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, based on what you said you're going to be on X amount. It just really varies, person to person. Some people are okay on relatively low doses.

213
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: And some need a little bit more

214
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: So for you, I think I'm just going to start with, like, an average

215
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:55.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Dose I'm going to. So there's two milligram. They come in film in strips are you, you're probably medic cow is all right do you have medical

216
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.380
Chelcey Skubski: Now,

217
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.620
Chelcey Skubski: It's private it's a private Blue Shield of California.

218
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:05.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so maybe so. So maybe the tablet is going to be better. So

219
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:17.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: cheapest, cheapest right i think i think tablet would be cheapest because depending on insurance. It's strange, but the film is covered, but the tab is not and then the

220
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:23.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Other ones, the tab is cheaper. So if your private. I think the tablet would be more economical. Okay. Is it possible

221
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:31.860
Chelcey Skubski: To like with a prescription. I know sometimes they'll put like you can substitute for other things can you can do that just

222
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Going to do that. I'm not

223
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:44.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm going to put it on there that you know may substitute. So now that you're aware when you go in to fill it. You say, hey, can you run my insurance and let me know is the film.

224
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Suboxone I will be better.

225
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: My ugly or this other one

226
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, depending on the answer.

227
00:21:52.440 --> 00:22:08.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then say the doctor put may substitute. So they'll see that they may not honor it until they speak to us, though. So, but don't can't just tell them okay and stay there. My advice would be to stay there. If it's the hours and just call the virtual clinic.

228
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:15.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, where you call today and say, hey, is Danielle Danielle is the girl. The staff member who

236
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Fact, she probably knows by memory like which insurance covers right

237
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.000
Chelcey Skubski: Right, okay.

238
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:03.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's the phone number, but you also have the zoom number, right. The 408

Chelcey Skubski: Yes.

241
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Correct. Okay, so. Either one works for like stay there and do that.

242
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then get them to talk, but

243
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:18.540
Chelcey Skubski: Is this something that I will pick up today or. OK, cool.

244
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:29.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we can start today. I say, I'm so be coming to an eight milligrams. And I think for you. I'm going to do the eight milligram

245
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay and I'm going to suggest that we take

246
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um,

247
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Why don't we try half, okay.

248
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that would be for right so if you have the tablet, it would be half in the morning.

249
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:45.720
Chelcey Skubski: By

250
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: You have after lunch.

251
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.600
Chelcey Skubski: Okay.

252
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.140
Chelcey Skubski: And those me

253
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.970
Chelcey Skubski: That's good enough for

254
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think

255
00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:03.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: I could. I'm just wondering, Should we do it three times. But let's just see how you do with that with the money and then in the lunchtime hour

256
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: And see, and keep keep track of crazy.

257
00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.290
Chelcey Skubski: Find the hardest.

258
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.350
Chelcey Skubski: For me honestly mornings are when it

259
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.420
Chelcey Skubski: Really, it gets hard. Yeah.

260
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:22.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: So then I think maybe we'll do this. How about we do have in the morning, half around lunchtime, or whatever. And then another half before you sleep.

261
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. That way if you when you wake up, you won't hopefully be in so many

262
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.920
Chelcey Skubski: Like that, in the morning.

263
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.750
Chelcey Skubski: And that makes sense. Okay.

264
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, half, half, half, so you do one and a half total tasks daytime.

265
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.180
Chelcey Skubski: But

266
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:42.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: The pharmacist can give you a pill cutter, I suggest that you do that. So it's not uneven every time.

267
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.320
Chelcey Skubski: Right, right.

268
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:50.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: And don't get confused. There's buprenorphine and something called the lock zone in it as well.

269
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:51.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's a

270
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:52.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Humble pill.

271
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: But that combo naloxone is

272
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's almost like it's non existent. You can ignore that it's there, it's

273
00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Only a bigger

274
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: To prevent people from trying to inject it because

275
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Injected a good market.

276
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.830
Chelcey Skubski: OK, OK. That's fine.

277
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.770
Chelcey Skubski: Right, I think, but okay.

278
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Night, you're saying, which is good, but

279
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:22.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you'll see it, they'll say eight milligrams dash two milligrams. Well, the time comes in the lock so it doesn't catch it. I don't get confused. It's

280
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.940
Chelcey Skubski: Right on it.

281
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got that. Um, and let me see if I have

282
00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, let me just make sure I have the right pharmacy, so we're

283
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.140
Back.

284
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: And do you know your doses of lithium and to dawn.

285
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:46.440
Chelcey Skubski: Yes, my dose of NO, I DID. Hold on.

286
00:25:47.970 --> 00:26:01.680
Chelcey Skubski: The Geodon is 120 milligrams a day. It's 2020 milligram pills three pills in the morning three pills in the evening the lithium. Let me check really quick. Let me grab the ball.

287
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:12.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see here of 300 milligram. I think it's pulling up some pharmacy stuff.

288
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.480
Chelcey Skubski: Yes that's right 300 milligrams

289
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.070
Chelcey Skubski: Book yes 300 milligrams. The correct

290
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, awesome.

291
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, we have those things here.

292
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:33.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then we're going to add. OK, so the pharmacy. I have on file for you is the Walmart on Valley Center.

293
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.030
Chelcey Skubski: Correct Valley central way.

294
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Central

295
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:37.740
Okay, yeah.

296
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so do that. Do you have any allergies to medication.

297
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.790
Chelcey Skubski: None that I know of, no.

298
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: All right, so we'll try

299
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: So the lithium. So because you're on some other meds that can cause

300
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: So with the lithium, it's, it's a warning me that it may

301
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:10.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cause something called serotonin syndrome. I don't know if when you were started on meds and

302
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.090
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah, I've

303
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Learned

304
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:19.950
Chelcey Skubski: So many med regarding the depression. Yeah, I'm I'm super familiar with that so

305
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:32.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so you're you're aware. I mean, that basically it's a it's a weird rare thing where you get very stiff muscles you get flushed a thought confused. I mean, it looks like an emergency and it is

306
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.590
Chelcey Skubski: Go to, er, right, just look out for you.

307
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so yeah hopefully that won't happen.

308
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:42.120
Chelcey Skubski: I don't think it will. But I'll make sure I'm looking out for it.

309
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you don't have any heart issues that you know

310
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.390
No.

311
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good saying something about

312
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.440
Chelcey Skubski: Rhythm abnormality.

313
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Get you know any palpitations anything weird, you know,

314
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just get help. Don't

315
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Don't wait. You know, some people are like, oh, maybe it's nothing.

316
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and then others are like hyper as dramatic.

317
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.150
Right.

318
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:21.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: This falls under tongue as well. So the way you take this. It's very important that you dissolve it under your tongue. So it's drink water before you take your first dose.

319
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: That your mouth is moist.

320
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.500
Chelcey Skubski: And they know it's kind of like

321
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.220
Chelcey Skubski: A sound exactly like the

322
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.200
Chelcey Skubski: Date thing for nasza they gave me when I was packing.

323
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Uh huh. Yeah. So, friend.

324
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.700
Chelcey Skubski: Yes. Yes, I could. Thank you. I couldn't think of a name of it for like me. Yeah.

325
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:48.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. So, exactly. So it's like that except remember to dissolve it

326
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: under your tongue big

327
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Time. That's where it gets into the bloodstream.

328
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so yeah park it under there, let it kind of melt a few minutes.

329
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Three to five minutes. I mean, it doesn't have to be half an hour. Right.

330
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now hopefully it's melted, mostly. You don't want to chew it or swallow it without that process.

331
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because it then it won't get in your system.

332
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.050
Chelcey Skubski: Okay.

333
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. And it should take effect within 10 minutes or something.

334
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hopefully start feeling like okay

335
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, I think all that

336
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:17.970
Chelcey Skubski: Better

337
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not have these

338
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, like, hopefully.

339
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.940
Chelcey Skubski: I'm really, really excited to try

340
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:34.470
Chelcey Skubski: This because obviously when I've done it completely on my own in the past with no help. I've always relax and I cannot have that happen again. I can't

341
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, it sounds like your life is on the line.

342
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.090
Chelcey Skubski: You get

343
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.760
Chelcey Skubski: Your sanity. Yes, I saw

344
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:53.760
Chelcey Skubski: My, my family, you know, so it's just, it's really, really important and has to work this time. So that's why I'm unhappy trying something different, because clearly what I was doing was not working.

345
00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's very wise.

346
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:07.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: And the good thing is this. Let me tell you, people ask, Okay, well, how long do I have to be on this whatever the thing is. It's just like the medications for depression or something.

347
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right. Some people we get you through a hump. So like

348
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Six months a year.

349
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you're like, Hey look, Doc. Everything is really stable. I want to try slowly weaning off. Let's see how it

350
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.490
Chelcey Skubski: Down.

351
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:25.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: We can we go we get you off, and I've done that for people. That's really very photo.

352
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:31.110
Chelcey Skubski: How long do people normally stay on this, like, I mean, on average, I know everybody's different.

353
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:40.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: I would say I would say my patients, I suggest strongly suggest that you stay on it for at least a year.

354
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.700
Chelcey Skubski: Okay, okay.

355
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:49.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, but, you know, everybody's different. You know, so I'm flexible. I work with my patients.

356
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.990
Chelcey Skubski: But I don't have a preference. I was just more

357
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:59.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Curious. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would say a year. But then there's people that have been on it for many years, you know,

358
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.500
Chelcey Skubski: Right. Right. And on the person.

359
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: depends on the person. And honestly, the science shows us you know the data that they've

360
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gathered shows us the longer you're on it.

361
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: The more successful you are in staying sober.

362
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: So if it works and it's not harmful to you.

363
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:15.270
Chelcey Skubski: And

364
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Then it shouldn't be.

365
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: Then you should be okay. You know, I'm

366
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we'll see, um,

367
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:26.640
Chelcey Skubski: And it doesn't affect the liver and like the narco does correct

368
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: So the

369
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.390
Chelcey Skubski: Eat a manifest that affects

370
00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:37.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly. So it's more than acetaminophen i mean the the hydrocodone the opioids do get

371
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:44.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: processed through the light well but mostly the Tylenol acetaminophen causes most of the damage.

372
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:54.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so this because it's a partial opiate. It's a good question. It is processed through the liver. So that's why if you've had blood tests done in the hospital and stuff and you have results.

373
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.730
Chelcey Skubski: You can feel

374
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.280
Chelcey Skubski: Somewhere. When I got home I have them.

375
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:04.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe you could take pictures of them and send them to the to the staff like call the virtual clinic.

376
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.590
Chelcey Skubski: They actually told me I need to go get blood work done.

377
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:23.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, if you, if you can, that's ideal. But if he already had a lot of it, some of it done, especially the liver enzymes, then maybe you can kind of delay, going to the quest lie to you. I mean, if it's easy for you just go to the quest lab and get it.

378
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.330
Chelcey Skubski: Okay, I'll probably just do that. It's literally a mile down the street.

379
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do that, then that's

380
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because then then we won't miss anything. And what I see is a liver tests to see

381
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: If your liver is functioning as

382
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.810
Chelcey Skubski: Normal nervous, but yeah.

383
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean,

384
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:50.520
Chelcey Skubski: I mean, stuff that I haven't really looked into since I started the addiction, so I don't really know how I have affected my liver, you know,

385
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and that's been like three years now. Right. Yeah.

386
00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:04.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so we'll see what it should. So it's important for you to get that done. Then, and I'll talk to you about the results and we'll, we'll hopefully it's fine and

387
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: You can continue on the medication and

388
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: I once a year, you know, maybe we check it again.

389
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.570
Chelcey Skubski: You know, that's the kind of

390
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.530
Right.

391
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:16.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: That makes sense.

392
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:27.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yep. Okay. So, um, so the other thing I want to say is there's something called narcan nasal spray. Have you

393
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:35.130
Chelcey Skubski: Familiar with it. My husband actually had someone he found out I had the addiction. He actually obtained from just in case.

394
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, which is really good. And so

395
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:38.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

396
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.320
Chelcey Skubski: I'm very excited guy.

397
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:49.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: He's a smart guy. So I'm ordering you that as well. And you can see you know it, how much it costs if it's covered fully or whatever but

398
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: It might be good to have in the house.

399
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:56.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now the risk of overdose from Suboxone is very small compared to, you know,

400
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200
Chelcey Skubski: The hospital and fields.

401
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's still good to have and you can use it on anyone not just yourself like if somebody you know

402
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.230
Chelcey Skubski: Okay.

403
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: And he would just spray it in your nose. If you're waking up.

404
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:08.910
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah, he know

405
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:10.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Our health because it's time

406
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.110
Chelcey Skubski: Right, right. It's like 30 minutes right

407
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:19.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly, you know. Okay, perfect. Um, so do you smoke cigarettes.

408
00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.150
Chelcey Skubski: Franchise I baby.

409
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.340
Chelcey Skubski: I have a big pen. Okay.

410
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.380
Chelcey Skubski: Oh, it's as it does have nicotine.

411
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:25.620
Chelcey Skubski: In it.

412
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you're very pigmented a

413
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.520

414
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:36.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you know you know one thing at a time. But, you know, it might be something to work.

415
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.820
Chelcey Skubski: Actually switched from cigarettes.

416
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:39.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

417
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:49.110
Chelcey Skubski: I was a smoker. I went to be being I started out with a high nicotine dose I've lowered that so a goal is stopping completely

418
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:49.860
Good.

419
00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:51.870
Chelcey Skubski: I'm on the track.

420
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're on the track. Okay, good. You've already kind of down

421
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.260
Yeah.

422
00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:59.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good. So I like that. That's your projection because

423
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, it still has its risk.

424
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.370
It's not

425
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, it's not good. And, you know, they've had the whole scare with the pneumonia is now in

426
00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:09.480
Chelcey Skubski: Style right

427
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:16.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we'll work on that will attribute and you know I can always give you a nicotine laws and Jesus or God or something.

428
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Want to like stop that and try this, is that you know what I mean.

429
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:21.720
Chelcey Skubski: Okay, okay.

430
00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just let me know.

431
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:35.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, so, work on that. And then what else, what else just a review of systems. You already told me you get headaches, you have tendinitis, I'm back pain sometimes I

432
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.890
Chelcey Skubski: Pain and degenerative disc in my

433
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:51.810
Chelcey Skubski: Desk. And yet, which might be what causes my headaches but I doubt I had that when I was eight, when I was eight. I had a bunch of tests done they told me it was stress related but that's why I got reoccurring headaches that was from stress.

434
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, I see. But

435
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.980
Chelcey Skubski: That's about the time my

436
00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:09.150
Chelcey Skubski: Step father, my brother's dad left us. And so I kind of, that's when everything altered in my life when I had to step up with my mom so it the timeline makes sense for stress headaches.

437
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Interrupt so yeah that's AJ

438
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:18.930
Chelcey Skubski: And then my first migraine. I got when I was 10 and I obviously migraines and headaches completely different. So

439
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:19.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

440
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.600
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah, I haven't gotten a migraine in a while. So, okay.

441
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:32.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, so, okay, that was when you were eight

442
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do I want to say.

443
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:47.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: psychiatric history you alluded to it. You already mentioned that age 15 you were diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

444
00:36:48.210 --> 00:37:04.200
Chelcey Skubski: Yes, my grandmother passed away my maternal grandmother and she was because my mom was an alcoholic. My grandmother was the one that was my escape at the time. My dad was model around with that time actually. He was into drugs himself.

445
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.040
Chelcey Skubski: So,

446
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: He has a history as well.

447
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:11.130
Chelcey Skubski: He has a history of drug addiction. Yes. Okay. Oh, I have addiction on both sides.

448
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:32.160
Chelcey Skubski: So my grandmother passed away and my mother moved us from I'm from San Diego. She moved us to Lancaster in the middle of my sophomore year in high school. And so I got really depressed because of my grandma, actually. And because of leaving everything I knew I started self mutilation.

449
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:39.930
Chelcey Skubski: And that went on for a year, year and a half, and I was hospitalized for a week for that.

450
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:44.550
Chelcey Skubski: For when I was 16 and then I have not done that since

451
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:45.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

452
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.100
Chelcey Skubski: As I got out of the hospital.

453
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, that time.

454
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.290
Chelcey Skubski: That was that time. Yes.

455
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.120
Chelcey Skubski: Oh, nice to not like

456
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not like

457
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.190
Chelcey Skubski: Like a week ago.

458
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:57.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good. Just

459
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:05.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, good, good. So that was then okay and so that hospitalization is when it kind of came out.

460
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: But they were like, hey, you know, I think you're dying, we need to

461
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:15.810
Chelcey Skubski: Get them. They knew I had depression. Before that it was actually my therapist, I saw therapist once a week that came to my house.

462
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:31.980
Chelcey Skubski: I'm starting at 15 and a half or so and I, and I've seen her for a year I had had a particularly bad week and I did not promised her that I was not going to harm myself. And so she had me taken off.

463
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, gotcha.

464
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.360
Chelcey Skubski: But I was already diagnosed with depression at that point and was on medication for it.

465
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:47.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: So this time they put you on to drugs that are mainly for bipolar did that who

466
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:48.690
Chelcey Skubski: knows me with this time.

467
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, bipolar disorder. Yeah. Did they say if it's type one or two or

468
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.270
Chelcey Skubski: Not sure where leading towards tag.

469
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:12.780
Chelcey Skubski: Kill, but they didn't tell me specifically the doctor at one point I spoke with two different doctors, the one that I spoke with mainly said he thought it was type two, but I would have to meet with a psychiatrist discuss more in order to be

470
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.230
Chelcey Skubski: Told specifically one or two.

471
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:27.210
Chelcey Skubski: Hospitals. I just know I personally don't have a lot a whole lot of prolonged high media.

472
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.280
Chelcey Skubski: Episodes it's more the depression.

473
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.540
Chelcey Skubski: With short bursts. So, yeah.

474
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:38.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: hypomania maybe

475
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:44.580
Chelcey Skubski: Which is partially why I have had the drug addiction problem because that gave me the for you.

476
00:39:45.660 --> 00:40:00.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. Okay. Yeah, it makes you kind of yes gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Okay. Um, and you were on antidepressants, I suppose, since age 15 then like so.

477
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.990
Chelcey Skubski: Like, on, off and on. I started with Prozac.

478
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:09.900
Chelcey Skubski: I went to select I've been on Wellbutrin I'm fat. Sorry.

479
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.820
Chelcey Skubski: I'm Wellbutrin um

480
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:20.340
Chelcey Skubski: Let's see, I've been on lithium once before.

481
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:28.020
Chelcey Skubski: Okay, that was a few years ago, it was a random doctor that thought I had bipolar disorder as well.

482
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:29.550
Chelcey Skubski: But, um,

483
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did you stay on it. Did you notice

484
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.180
Chelcey Skubski: I stayed on it for a couple months. However, it

485
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.420
Chelcey Skubski: Made me gain 40 pounds.

486
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.670
Chelcey Skubski: Oh, and I was

487
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:50.340
Chelcey Skubski: Young and yeah upset about that and I stopped taking it because I didn't want to gain weight.

488
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.750
Chelcey Skubski: But this last time. I've always been overweight.

489
00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.130
Chelcey Skubski: I've always been

490
00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:07.530
Chelcey Skubski: Between 188 and 200 pounds and I'm Emily, five, six. So I'm always been overweight and the last six months. I have lost 50 pounds.

491
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:15.990
Chelcey Skubski: Just slowly from depression and not eating I at the hospital. I think I weighed in at 150

492
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:28.830
Chelcey Skubski: Oh, wow. So I'm, I'm, I haven't been this low since middle school like I started out in a size 14 is my average size for most of my life. I'm a size eight right now.

493
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:38.280
Chelcey Skubski: I've never, I can't even remember being a sizing effort. So that is just fully from stress and not eating and depression.

494
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.910
Chelcey Skubski: Because normally I would do the opposite. I would overheat.

495
00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:45.300
Chelcey Skubski: So Atlanta tells me this time was different.

496
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.340
Chelcey Skubski: Yes, yeah.

497
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, quite different.

498
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.040
Wow.

499
00:41:51.060 --> 00:42:01.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we'll keep an eye on on that, you know, and hopefully. I mean, it's really not healthy for you to lost all that in that manner.

500
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.850
Chelcey Skubski: No, it's not.

501
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's not good. You're not. Yeah.

502
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.460
Chelcey Skubski: So and so right now I'm trying to just

503
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:15.300
Chelcey Skubski: Exercise and watch what I'm eating because I obviously I don't want to gain the weight back by any means.

504
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.890
Chelcey Skubski: Yes, if I could stay a size 810. That would be wonderful.

505
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.890
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah, I know. I can't

506
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.910
Chelcey Skubski: Stay there. I can't maintain it the way that I have been by not eating.

507
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: No good. Okay, so you're aware, you have that self.

508
00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:31.500
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah yeah

509
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:36.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, this is good in a way like this is really not a sustainable or

510
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: High thing.

511
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:43.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly and your overall health is most important, not the number on the scale, right.

512
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:47.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, that's important to stay, you know, for health reasons as well but

513
00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:47.880
Chelcey Skubski: Right.

514
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know we got to look at the whole picture not just

515
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:57.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I'm glad any legal troubles. I need DUIs or problems like that. No.

516
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.020
Chelcey Skubski: No, no.

517
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: And do you are you working or

518
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.790
Chelcey Skubski: I'm a homemaker right now just here with my daughter.

519
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your daughter. That's a full time job and a half.

520
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.410
Yeah.

521
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. Um, let's see what else, what else I think I covered everything we got your medication and the Narcan in

522
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, but the nicotine and we can work on that.

523
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: As well. Later on, whenever I

524
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Feel like it.

525
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.920
Chelcey Skubski: And how often do I need to be meeting with you.

526
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so our model here is that we do weekly visits.

527
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we get to know each other and we do it in a group format.

528
00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:43.650
Chelcey Skubski: Okay.

529
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:49.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's interesting. You'll it'll be you and I and like maybe six seven other people

530
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:59.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and I'll do I start. So I'm in the group. I will start with everybody. So I'll say, okay, Chelsea. How did it go with your dose, like the half, half, half,

531
00:43:59.460 --> 00:43:59.850
Chelcey Skubski: Right.

532
00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you comfortable do we even need to change anything.

533
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: I just do a check in, like we would normally you and

534
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:05.850
Chelcey Skubski: Okay.

535
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then I do the same with everyone else and

536
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:20.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you need refills. Yes, yes. And it's like a weekly thing we all check in. And then there's a therapist with me who helps kind of guide or facilitate more conversation after that so

537
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.300
Chelcey Skubski: On almost like a check in Flash meeting for the thing

538
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:31.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's great. It's like two in one you get it's an hour long and you get to have the social exposure.

539
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.460
Chelcey Skubski: To like

540
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: If people going through similar style, you know, may be from completely different walks of life.

541
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:37.980
Chelcey Skubski: Right and

542
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:46.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Find this one common thread and it just makes you feel, I think there's a group dynamic that it's really hard to describe. And I

543
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:46.830
I

544
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that's a good thing to have.

545
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.450
Chelcey Skubski: In your lap. Sounds great.

546
00:44:52.020 --> 00:45:00.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. And so if you're, are you able to do. I would love to see you Monday morning. Do you think you can do Monday.

547
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.070
Chelcey Skubski: I cannot do more.

548
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.360
Chelcey Skubski: Because I

561
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: It takes a little bit sometimes depending on the volume of people checking in.

562
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:57.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, you call the virtual clinic through zoom right

563
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:01.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you do a check in, which can take like 20 minutes because they write

564
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:06.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: You a survey like how's your addiction, whatever you gotta do two things. And then they give you

565
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.110
Chelcey Skubski: I call the 408 number first

566
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:12.030
Chelcey Skubski: Exactly. And then

567
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: You check it. You say it.

568
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:28.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: Today. Yeah, just like you did today and you say, Hey, I have a four o'clock group with the doctor Allah DAG and then they say, Okay, great. Please fill the survey out and then come back to us and we'll give you the zoom number and every week. It's a different zoom number

569
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:34.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so we we will go about it that way.

570
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

571
00:46:49.170 --> 00:47:02.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: All right. Um, so, so that'll that'll so then we just do weekly visits like that. So that's that. And then you should also call them and ask for call the virtual clinic and ask them to book you your first therapy appointment.

572
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:03.480
Chelcey Skubski: Okay.

573
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:12.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you you're assigned a therapist with us and you'll you'll do your first visit. It's called a bio psychosocial they just kind of go through your history.

574
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:13.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and then

575
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:21.090
Chelcey Skubski: That's different than the psychiatrist for my mental health. Correct. Okay, so I need to call and make a therapy point

576
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.080
Exactly.

577
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:36.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then the therapist and you decide, okay, should you do weekly visits with them individually or should you do every two weeks. You know, you guys will decide, and that's your talk therapy that's important to have your alone time to do your talk therapy.

578
00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:43.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: What you'll do with me is a medical visit plus a group therapy thing once a week.

579
00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.130
Chelcey Skubski: Got it, okay.

580
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:50.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you've got those two things you got your in the Thursday group. So I'll see you in a week.

581
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:52.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Around this time,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:59.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then we'll go from there. If you come up with questions. You know, please let me know. I'll send you an email.

583
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, shortly.

584
00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.220
Chelcey Skubski: Okay. Sounds good.

585
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.710
Chelcey Skubski: Okay so much Dr.

586
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:10.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hide All right. Well, I have high hopes that this is going to make you feel better and more into

587
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.290
Chelcey Skubski: I

588
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:19.500
Chelcey Skubski: I'm really excited. I'm really, I'm hopeful very hopeful for the first time in my recovery. I feel hopeful so

589
00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:32.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm so glad and you know before I let you go I it's like the elephant in the room. I can't forget to address this. I mean, started the conversation with, Hey, you know, I tried to kill myself and I ended

590
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.330
Chelcey Skubski: Up. Yeah.

591
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:34.230
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah.

592
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:39.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so I we should talk a little bit about that, like, was this the first time you mentioned before.

593
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:47.370
Chelcey Skubski: My first attempt before when I have the self harm that was just more about control in my life.

594
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:59.850
Chelcey Skubski: That wasn't to kill myself. This was my first time and it just, I just reached a low point my addiction had affected my 14 year relationship.

595
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:11.910
Chelcey Skubski: I didn't know if it was salvageable and I just had convinced myself that my husband and my daughter would be better off without me. I genuinely felt that way.

596
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:17.070
Chelcey Skubski: And I know my husband, and that he

597
00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:32.670
Chelcey Skubski: He would he's a fixer so I knew if I was around he would still be trying to to fix things. And I just genuinely felt the two of them would be better off without me.

598
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:48.090
Chelcey Skubski: So I just I planned it out. I actually, I did not even overdose on Norco because I truthfully, I'm I have no idea how much it would take for me to overdose on that because my tolerance is sailing high

599
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:52.920
Chelcey Skubski: So I overdosed on over the counter sleeping medication.

600
00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:15.570
Chelcey Skubski: Yeah, it was a lot cheaper to. I know that sounds horrible. But buying drugs illegally is not cheap. Yes. So, um, and this was not about getting high. It was about killing myself so I wrote a note to my husband to my brother to my mom.

601
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:29.430
Chelcey Skubski: And to my daughter and my husband left to go pick up our daughter, he normally stays on for a few hours sits at his mom's house so he visits.

602
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:41.250
Chelcey Skubski: I think he felt like something was wrong. And so he did not stay in visit he picked her up, he came home and so he found the before I was completely out

603
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:42.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: When

604
00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.710
Chelcey Skubski: He called the ambulance.

605
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:50.640
Chelcey Skubski: Oh my God, yeah, which, thankfully, that happens that way he can be very intuitive. So

606
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Wow.

607
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.610
Chelcey Skubski: I he felt like something was up.

608
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Up. Yeah.

609
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: We just say instead. You guys are very well.

610
00:50:56.670 --> 00:51:07.560
Chelcey Skubski: I mean I had been planning it for a while. So I think after after it happened. He started connecting things like, oh, you know, he we had gotten in a fight.

611
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:23.970
Chelcey Skubski: A few weeks prior about me going to out to see my mom every day to go grocery shopping for her that we couldn't afford the gas for me to do that. And he said, How long are you going to do this, plus you're supposed to be in a quarantine right now. You shouldn't be doing that.

612
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:37.590
Chelcey Skubski: And I said, two weeks and then it'll be done, and he said, what's going to happen in two weeks. Is she going to feel better. And I said, Yes. And I just left it at that. And so after this happened. He started connecting

613
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:38.880
Chelcey Skubski: That's what you meant.

614
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.240
Chelcey Skubski: By two weeks. Okay, you are planning on being here.

615
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: For two

616
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:54.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Weeks. You knew you had that. Yes. So, so, Chelsea. That's very serious. Do you, do you feel you're at risk right now.

617
00:51:55.350 --> 00:52:00.360
Chelcey Skubski: I don't, I genuinely don't. I'm really hopeful right now. I think that

618
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:08.400
Chelcey Skubski: You know the lithium before when I was on it. I didn't feel like it was helping. I feel like it in

619
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:21.540
Chelcey Skubski: Paired with the Geodon it has been noticing a difference, my sleep is still something I'm struggling with. I'll have to talk to the psychiatrist about that but

620
00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:43.800
Chelcey Skubski: I do feel like maybe for the first time this. This medication is helping. I also feel very hopeful about my my recovery for addiction and it's the first time that I have in a long time. And so that was a major aspect as to why I was giving up.

621
00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:58.230
Chelcey Skubski: Yes, because I felt like, well, this is just me now i i don't know if I'll ever find the person I was before or any resemblance of her and this is me now. And I don't want to be this person and that was it.

622
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:07.290
Chelcey Skubski: But now I'm hopeful that obviously this is going to change me no matter what out. I will never be the person that I used to be.

623
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:25.200
Chelcey Skubski: But I might be a better version of what I used to be so and I haven't felt like that in a long time. So I don't feel like I'm at risk. I actually feel pretty okay I won't say, great, but I feel okay okay

624
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:37.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I think like if I had to quantify like low, medium, high, I would say maybe medium. I'm not going to say low because typically you just had an attempt so

625
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:39.180
Chelcey Skubski: Of course,

626
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Of but but i mean you between low and medium, I guess.

627
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:49.800
Chelcey Skubski: And also my husband was watching like a hawk. So up to you he is, he's working from home right now so

628
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.030
Chelcey Skubski: He's lending me his office. This is not my racing chair.

629
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:57.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

630
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:06.960
Chelcey Skubski: This is his office. So he's letting me his office. So he's working from home and he's very attentive. He's making sure he's checking in with me so

631
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.840
Chelcey Skubski: Oh, I'm in good hands with him as well.

632
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.120
Chelcey Skubski: As as taking care of myself.

633
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:20.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: So sounds like it. Okay, good. So yeah, so you're in a safe place you're being answered, you feel your verbalizing very clearly that

634
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:37.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yet feel good and full. These are very key things is what I wanted. Yeah. Hope is everything. You got to have hope. So I'm glad you have that in your you are warranted. I can tell you that I think this is really going to help you. I think I'm glad you're doing this.

635
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:46.680

Chelcey Skubski: This is awesome. Thank you so much.
