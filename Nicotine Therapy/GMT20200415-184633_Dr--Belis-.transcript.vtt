00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.410

Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Okay, she's like my main parole officer and I, you know,

Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good. So you have her

78
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: And how long were you in prison, like you just got out a week or two ago. But what, how long were you

79
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.800
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: There for a year I got two years with half so I served a year and got released nine days early off.

80
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.130
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Because of the coronavirus

81
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.440
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Oh, yeah, yeah.

82
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.310
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: It's good for something

83
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Something I'm okay and and was this a drug related thing like what happened that you ended up in there, man.

84
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:47.940
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: It was definitely drug related I'd made some bad choices due to drugs or whatever. And it was actually a gun charge that they put me in on but it was a family heirloom things. So, but still I shouldn't have had it. You know what I mean. Yeah. And because of that, it was

85
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.830
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Two years.

86
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, well we did you have in now, hopefully you can get

87
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:08.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Get this addiction out of the way so you can clear your, your record and everything and just move on with your life and you know, honestly, it's a good thing because you have

88
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:19.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know you have a strong incentive to do the right thing and be there for your family. I mean, that's a huge incentive, but with the parole thing it's even more like intense

89
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.730
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yes, ma'am.

90
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's kind of a help if you will. Like, hey man, you don't have options that you don't want to go back

91
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.480
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: There absolutely is. But you would be surprised at how many people

92
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.940
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Still kill us. And then just go to jail for 10 days or whatever, you know. It's insane. I do not want to be that guy.

93
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Don't yeah let's not be that guy.

94
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK. And then, and then tell me about alcohol because they said you also mentioned that you have an alcohol issue.

95
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.450
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Very much so. And that I'm struggling with, just like the opiates. I'm struggling with

96
00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:05.670
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Alcohol was a daily thing too. And, and I'm a blackout drunk. So like I think I'm having a good time. But people around me are not, you know,

97
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.350
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yeah yeah

98
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you really need to stay away 100%

99
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.160
Absolutely.

100
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: In prison. Did you have access to alcohol.

101
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.860
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: It was like homemade wine or whatever, but yes. Yes, we did.

102
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:30.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so, yeah, especially with the opiates. I mean, you know, you've probably heard this before. And you've been

103
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:42.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Abusing these substances, your whole life. So I don't know how much this means to you, but I gotta tell you that alcohol, being a sedative and opiates also kind of lowering your respiration.

104
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:54.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Together, they can cause overdose to happen a lot faster. You know, so like alcohol and opiates don't mix well people end up with overdose. So, you know, this

105
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:04.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so the same logic kind of applies when we're prescribing medication for the opioid problem. And there's a medication called

106
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:16.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: buprenorphine or Suboxone is the brand name, and it's a partial opioid, it's not a full opiate but it's still partials technically when you're on the medication, you're not supposed to be drinking. So that's

107
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:29.970
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Absolutely not. Yes, that's part of the reason that this whole program, kind of, you know, mean because you can't drink, you can't use opiates. You can't use heroin. You can't, you know, it's a blocker. Correct.

108
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, yeah.

109
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.510
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: That's exactly what I need.

110
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:45.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so it's not okay. So there is. So to clarify, there is one medication that's a complete blocker called Naltrexone now track sewn is like

111
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:57.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, a complete blocker, you would need to be off of the only problem with it is you need to be off of all opioids for at least 10 to 14 days.

112
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Full range stuffing.

113
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so it's

114
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:10.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Difficult to get people to get that space before they can take it you take it sooner than the 14 day mark or the 10 day mark it will put you into really bad withdrawal.

115
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:17.760
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: So that in the locker medication and that one actually the best form is the injectable once a month injection called

116
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Pivotal will

117
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Be doing that one. We're going to be working on your

118
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:36.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think we should try to do the Suboxone option which is not exactly a blocker. What it is, is it it's stronger on the receptor than heroin or bike it in or any other opioid

119
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:46.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's not as active as them. So when it's on the receptor. It's not giving the high it's giving you some activity. So you don't feel withdrawal, but it's not giving you a high

120
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:58.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like the others, but it's stronger so like if you tried to use while Suboxone is in your system, it would be kind of blocked in a way because it's it's already full with this.

121
00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.820
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: It would be useless.

122
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: It will be

123
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:17.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Useless. Essentially, I mean you really probably wouldn't feel much so it's not worth doing it in that sense. Yeah. So it gives you that knowing that you're like why why bother. I'm on this medication that's kind of blocking my receptors in a way

124
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:26.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: But anyway, so. So yeah, so all of that hopefully put together is going to give you motivation to do the right thing.

125
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.080
Absolutely.

126
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:38.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, and then we will send you monthly tests. So you're going to be tested. Anyway, I think right with your probation officer.

127
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:51.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you'll have those tests going on. And then for our system, we do once a month you'll receive something in the mail. Don't open the envelope until you call us through virtual clinic and then

128
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: We'll open it. You go to the bathroom, you show them the temperature and everything so they do it online.

129
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.210
Okay.

130
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:06.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you'll have your own tests and you can report to me how those are going, you know, like, hopefully we'll have a good honest conversation, you and I, about

131
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:17.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: How your recovery is going because I'm not here to judge. I'm here to help you. So it's like if we need to adjust your dose because you're still having cravings. We can do that. You know what I mean.

132
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.470
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Very cool.

133
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:27.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you tell me you tell me if you're like not doing well or you're getting close to stop or you're getting tempted, or whatever. Right.

134
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so

135
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:39.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: What else do I want to know before I go on with the medication stuff. I want to know, Have you had any surgeries.

Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: No, no.

142
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:59.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: No real surgery. How about any suicide attempts, or suicide history. Are we are you at risk for that.

143
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.380
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: No man, look.

Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Ibuprofen is what I've been taken for the last couple days.

146
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: What's going on. Do you have back pain or

147
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.430
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Something going on up here in my neck or whatever. And it kind of affects my shoulder or whatever little bit. Okay.

148
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:20.760
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: But it's

149
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.700
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: It's I'd be profitable.

150
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: ibuprofen.

151
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Use that hey, remember to eat food with it because it

152
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.380
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Cannot stomach.

153
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, okay. So use that, um,

154
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:41.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Any diagnoses in the past like psychiatric diagnoses or

155
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, no mental stuff that

156
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.920
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: omegle stuff.

157
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:59.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I'm okay. So then let's get back to the medication and how we're going to start it. So tell me your last use of first of all your last use of alcohol was when you think

158
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.780
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Over, over a month ago easily

159
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:13.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, good. So you're sober from the alcohol over a month. That's great. And the opioid. Tell me about that. The pills or that whatever was the last anything's

160
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:20.580
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Been about a month as well, since it was about a couple. I was trying to get clean before I got out that

161
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.240
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Oh,

162
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:27.960
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: So I didn't mess with nothing for like the last I'm gonna give it a month, month and a half or something like that.

163
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:29.310
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: It out.

164
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.840
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Hey, you know what I mean.

165
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:37.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I misunderstood. I thought you've been using for for getting out. So, okay, good.

166
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:45.630
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Go wide use the whole time until the last month and then I'd slowed down considerably and and basically stopped.

167
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:56.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Awesome. Okay, so you did it yourself mentally preparing for this. Okay. And now, so. So do you feel that you have cravings. Do you think

168
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.130
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: About all I've been thinking about

169
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.270
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: And I

170
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.750
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Do not want to fall. I know.

171
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:14.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: We don't want to do that. So I say, so there's two doses that the there's tablets and films and depending on your insurance.

172
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:21.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Some insurances for some reason only covered the film. Let me see if I can try to figure out which one, yours is

173
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:35.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so either way it's going to come in a tablet or a film, it's going to be something you melt under your tongue so drink some water before so its moist.

174
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:49.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Put this thing under your tongue, whether it's tablet or film. It doesn't matter. It's supposed to dissolve and it gets into your bloodstream. That way if you chew it or swallow it skips your bloodstream. You don't feel anything. So you want to really melt it.

175
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Even if it tastes like not so great. Okay.

176
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:55.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

177
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:02.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: And let me see you are medical so I'm assuming it's going to be the film.

178
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: film. The film comes in two

179
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:14.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Doses there's the smaller dose, which is the two milligram. And then there's a bigger dose, which is the eight milligram

180
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:32.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Since you've been sober for one month maybe longer. I'm wondering if we should start small and see, you know, how it affects you and if it's enough to cover creaminess, because it's in your best interest to get to a level that's

181
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:46.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: The lowest tolerable because eventually we want to get you off, you know, eventually, if we can you say Hey Doc, I think I feel pretty stable. Now let's slowly get me off this we can get you off, but

182
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:53.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, it's just why, why, you know. So it's better for you in the long run.

183
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:59.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now at the same time, we don't have to be stingy with it if you're not feeling like, hey man, two milligrams

184
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: I don't know. I'm still getting cravings and stuff. We can go up okay did

185
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.460
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: That work for me.

186
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.020
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: So,

187
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:20.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: I say we start with, let's just start with two milligrams in the morning and then maybe we do it again in the afternoon. So we could do two milligrams twice a day.

188
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:21.600
Okay.

189
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:36.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: That will you see to take it in the morning, you go about your day. You see how cravings are. Does it happen. Are you are you thinking about it, like how many times is it as intense and then you take another one.

190
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, maybe early afternoon like 3pm or something, I don't know.

191
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: And see how that holds you do that.

192
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: Quite clearly,

193
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.740
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: That works for me. That sounds good.

194
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's a way, it's a starting point and then we can discuss like what you want to do.

195
00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, um, any questions about the medication.

196
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:09.810
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Know, I kind of read up on it a little bit. As I was filling the paperwork and stuff out and it sounds like something I I need

197
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.280
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: OK, so

198
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: The way you framed it

199
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:13.980
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Good to

200
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's good. Okay, and no allergies to medications that you know

201
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.220
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Not at all.

202
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:30.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: And okay and you said you're not on anything besides taking ibuprofen over the counter your CVS on Highway 101

203
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.380
Correct.

204
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. That's a good one for you.

205
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:44.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so let's do Suboxone to milligram. So there's. So just so you don't get confused Suboxone is the brand name.

206
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:52.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it's buprenorphine. That's the substance that we're talking about. That's on the receptor that helps you. It's buprenorphine.

207
00:18:52.950 --> 00:19:05.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now that's the active sessions. There's another dash naloxone in there. So you'll see Suboxone box, but it'll have to drugs listed. It's the buprenorphine that's active than the lock zone.

208
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:17.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: naloxone it. You may recognize is Narcan naloxone is like a short rapid reversal agent and said it's a blocker and reverser of the of the opiate

209
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:36.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Receptors. Right. It's in there. Only if somebody tried to inject it like if somebody took the film's melted them and try to inject it IV then theoretically the locks on would take wouldn't be activated and it's supposed to block you from getting high.

210
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:52.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: So the drug company created it that way to prevent people from abusing it in that sense. If you take it like you should, which is under your tongue and you melted the naloxone doesn't become available in your system. So just bypasses you're just like, it's not even there.

211
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.360
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: People get confused and

212
00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: They think that's the blocker and that's why there's nothing to do with that. That's just all you can always ignore that second agent. Okay.

213
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.220
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: I will ignore it and

214
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.350
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Yet, okay.

215
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:10.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because you'll be like, why is there, too, because it says two dash 0.5 milligrams and so

216
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your doses two milligrams, don't worry. The point five does account.

217
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:23.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK. OK. So I just want to explain that because even doctors get confused about that one there. Like what is that why is it in there. Is it, you know.

218
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just pretend us on in their

219
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: Home one film.

220
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:51.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, twice daily. So we're going to just say twice daily for now and see how you do. Today is Wednesday. So the way we we do things here like to, to follow up and get your next refill and check in with me medically we try to do group visits.

221
00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:52.140
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Cool.

222
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:58.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's going to be you and like a bunch of other people that mainly are also on Suboxone some form of it.

223
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.760
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: And we will be people in my town or

224
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.850
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Just around the world or

225
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:12.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Around the state. So, the State of California because that's where I'm licensed so it's

226
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:21.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Throughout the state of California. I will say most of the patients. I've seen so far, coming from up North. Are you in Crescent cities that when I saw

227
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.140
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Right. Yes.

228
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.450
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: North North is it get

229
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.190

230
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:37.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Yeah. So there's what I think, quite a few that I've seen from that, I recognize the name so there might be people from your area.

231
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.690
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: Okay, cool. And it's almost like a therapeutic type thing, like everybody talks. Okay, cool.

232
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:54.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cool. Really cool. It's actually kind of fun like the last group on Monday. There it was all so there's an all guys group that meets on Mondays at 9am

233
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you could choose that.

234
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Mondays at nine.

235
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:06.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: If you can make it. We can do that. Otherwise, there's a Thursday or Friday at 4pm

236
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.630
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: At the Monday night, and that's am correct

237
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.400

240
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:21.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, it's all dudes, which is kind of cool because you know everybody can kind of talk freely about whatever they want.

241
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:35.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: And remember, it's like a doctor's visit. So I say, I'll say this, then, too, but like, it's everything that said in the group is kept in the group. Now this is private, you know, because you're going to hear other people's information because

242
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:46.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm going to check in with you and say, hey, how did that dose go Did it go well should we continue. Yeah, yeah. Okay, great. I'll give you a refill, and then I'll go to the next guy. So you'll hear each other's issues.

243
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:56.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: medical issues. And then, and then be able to share your experiences because some people have been on Suboxone for a long time, and some people are new. I mean, it's good.

244
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.330
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: With me being a new guy be great to hear some, some of the long term.

245
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Exactly.

246
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:15.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: There was some good dialogue. Last, last week, so I liked it. I think you'll enjoy it and then and I ran the group last time. But typically, we have a therapist with me. So I'm the doctor doing med stuff.

247
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:27.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then she usually takes over and says, Okay, guys, let's talk about something recovery related like how do we deal with stress. Instead of using blah, blah, blah. You know, some topic that's relevant to all of us.

248
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.820
Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G: On this will be fun.

249
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: It'll be fun. It's

250
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:39.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: A consolidated group medication and and recovery themed group on nine to 10am so it's one hour.

251
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:48.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Nice. Okay, great. So, so what I'll do is I'll give you medication that you can start today.

252
00:23:48.570 --> 00:24:02.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: And if we continue on the dose and you like it. You think okay yeah one in the morning one later in the afternoon is is good for you. It should last you until Monday. Actually, I'll give it you enough just for an extra day in case something happens.

253
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:09.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I'll see you Monday, and then we'll do more. We'll do a week's worth and stuff like that. That's

254
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:16.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cool. Remember that you don't have to take that second dose. If you feel like, Hey, man. One was enough. I think I'm okay.

Dr. Belis Aladag: Therapy. So, you know, you're assigned a therapist individual if you want to you can meet with that person and do talk therapy like psycho therapy. You can do it weekly or every other week. Whatever you feel like you need

281
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.490

286
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:20.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you'll do weekly groups with me and a therapist in a group setting.

287
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:37.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you can also add individual sessions with a therapist if you wish. And if you do tell virtual clinic so like when we hang up here, you can call virtual clinic and say, hey, the doc says I'm supposed to see a therapist, can I have that setup.

288
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.290

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.230

295
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:16.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. The reason is they have you do a survey about your addiction. Like, how are you doing, you know what, I take some time.

296
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: To check on then. And then they give you a zoom number that changes every week because groups change right

297
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:23.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

298
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:29.310

299
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: And changes so so

300
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:36.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: He goes, go through the virtual one thing that doesn't change this virtual clinic there like the front desk so you go there.

301
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:47.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: There's an 800 number telephone if for some reason the virtual clinic is it does get busy. I will say I had a few guys be like oh my god I was waiting and waiting and waiting and bumped me off and I had

302
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:54.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so just the earlier you can get on 838 45 it's in your best interest to make it on time to the nine
