00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.150
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me.

2
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.100
Galaxy A50: Hey, yes.

3
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.690
Dr Jameson: Good. It takes a minute nowadays.

4
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.300
Galaxy A50: I only know

5
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:37.500
Galaxy A50: And I wish it could make some sort of it because sometimes I just get distracted and then all of a sudden like remember the first time you ever saw me. You actually met my laundry first

6
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.940
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's right.

7
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.020
Galaxy A50: So like I wish there was some sort of like ding dong. There she

8
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:57.600
Dr Jameson: Had there is a I actually have a way to set like an Enter time because that's exactly what happens is I go and I'm going to another screen signing notes and doing, you know, whatever. And I so I turned that on so I know what it's time to come back to check in on

9
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.210
Dr Jameson: Anyway, what's up, what's going on.

10
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.570
Galaxy A50: I'm a lot of things up, but I received a phone, which is findings in order after hearing

11
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.100
Galaxy A50: And my attorneys attorney would like you to read it.

12
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.180
Galaxy A50: Because there there's going to be an she's going to need another letter from you. Please.

13
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.800
Galaxy A50: Okay, and she wants to know exactly what to touch on. So the things that have transpired since the last time you wrote me one.

14
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.810
Galaxy A50: Rather than the Kona virus.

15
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.320
Galaxy A50: Was that we went to mediation.

16
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:54.930
Galaxy A50: Okay. And, like, the family, the family court services and the lady. She was like, first off, she said, this is the weirdest case I've ever ever had in my career. And I know she's been there for a while. I mean, we've seen her since the day we got divorced, which was a while ago.

17
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:08.610
Galaxy A50: He said, This is by far the weirdest situation that she's ever had. And she also said she knows almost nothing about what the judge is asking her to do.

18
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.900
Galaxy A50: Which was

19
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.260
Galaxy A50: Basically talked to Sean

20
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:31.200
Galaxy A50: And assess my own progress on her own, but using Sean as therapists, I guess hints background information, whatever. So she's gonna be the one making the final decision. I have a feeling

21
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.030
Dr Jameson: Who is Sorry Sean or the

22
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.930
Galaxy A50: No, no, no, this ad liana but I have a tiny feeling is that

23
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:53.040
Galaxy A50: So she's very hard to be, I guess the first time we ever went there and because my ex husband appears by phone, not even like this, but literally just over the phone.

24
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.710
Galaxy A50: I can see her facial expressions.

25
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.620
Galaxy A50: And he doesn't. So I could tell that she was extremely annoyed by him. This is the first time.

26
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.430
Galaxy A50: Because he kept lying and she wasn't like rolling her eyes, but she would like turn her head like a mover listening to this.

27
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.970
Galaxy A50: So then she has to of course escort us in and out. She's not just gonna, you know, so after she hung up with him. I got like another minute alone with her, sort of, as he walks me out.

28
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.820
Galaxy A50: Is she sort of like thinking out loud.

29
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:40.680
Galaxy A50: And but still kind of like half talking to me how thinking out loud. And she goes, I think I'm going to decide this way, and she tells me like this kind of a quick synopsis of what she's thinking of doing and it sounded like she was going to go my way

30
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.530
Galaxy A50: Then a year ago.

31
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:54.600
Galaxy A50: Okay, and would like she literally I never asked her work. In fact, I made sure not to speak because I wanted to make sure that she doesn't think I'm like trying to do something she

32
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.410
Galaxy A50: Has done

33
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:15.030
Galaxy A50: Which she herself was like, so I think I'm she's kind of like daydreaming, like I think I'm going to go this way. Yeah, that might be a good way to and then wrote a completely different setup so either she read something after the fact, which probably was the police report.

34
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:22.020
Galaxy A50: Yeah, or or something else. But she literally the way her report came out was like this.

35
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:36.480
Galaxy A50: Data saying this mom is saying this, but mom's backing it up by blah blah blah, and then like she doesn't say, I believe, mom, more, but she is saying like mom is more substantiated in the situation, yada, yada, yada.

36
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:47.190
Galaxy A50: In like several times, it says that, and then in the end, it says God focused. So this is completely unpredictable. I don't even know. And then

37
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.540
Galaxy A50: Last time

38
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.790
Galaxy A50: I did not appear nearly as well as the original time a year ago I had a, I don't know what it was. I was like, knocked myself.

39
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.480
Galaxy A50: And then I had an anxiety attack in the middle of everything. And I actually kind of stopped breathing for a second.

40
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:19.770
Galaxy A50: And I, I think she noticed but I kind of like I now know that I can kind of like look outside of myself and just be like, Dina, this is an anxiety attack just breathe. Just take a breath.

41
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:39.360
Galaxy A50: I used to not be able to do that. So I forced myself to breathe. But I know that she noticed it. So after we hung up with him and she again was walking me out. She kept complimenting me on how far I've come along with my anxiety. But now, anything she says I

42
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.960
Galaxy A50: I like

43
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.580
Dr Jameson: Is the opposite.

44
00:05:42.180 --> 00:06:02.610
Galaxy A50: Then she was supposed to contact Sean and my attorney email Chon exactly like what would be not like what to say. But what subjects to touch on the name. He suggested that that we mention your, your medical director apparently he has a fantastic reputation in the substance abuse.

45
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.210
Galaxy A50: Community.

46
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.850
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you know, I, you know, resident of the American

Dr Jameson: Stuff, whatever it is. I'm Academy of exam, basically. So good.

48
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:23.370
Galaxy A50: Good, yeah. So the thing is my my my my judge just happens to be the main drug court judge

49
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.870
Galaxy A50: He if there's anything that he if anybody's to know anything about substance abuse. It's him.

50
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.450
Galaxy A50: But if anybody is to be a big

51
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.340
Galaxy A50: dick about it. It's also him.

52
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.970
Galaxy A50: And he kind of has that in his personality. I've

53
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:39.480
Dr Jameson: Noticed that

54
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:51.720
Galaxy A50: When, when he has a good day. He is a sweetie, but with like still kind of like a smirk when he has a bad day. He has no problems, telling you the most inappropriate you

55
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:59.670
Galaxy A50: Know, I guess what I'm trying to say is we want to be as prepared as possible.

118
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.900
Dr Jameson: Oh, I don't have to think. But, but here that's still pretty young.

119
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.380
Galaxy A50: So you've been member, how in the airplane. It all started because

120
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.760
Galaxy A50: I all of a sudden

121
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:22.200
Galaxy A50: What. So what happened at that time was, it wasn't really my period of time, but it could be, you know, it wasn't that off from the time that my period was supposed to happen.

122
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:28.590
Galaxy A50: But the amount of blood was ridiculous. It scared the crap out of me, but your cost an entire commotion.

123
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.980
Galaxy A50: Right, right. And, and I only bled for two days.

124
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:32.850
Hmm.

125
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:43.350
Galaxy A50: So all of a sudden I had the same thing on Saturday on Friday would have been on Friday, my period would have been

126
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:50.700
Galaxy A50: About 10 days late. It was last Friday, all of a sudden I started bleeding and

127
00:13:51.750 --> 00:14:02.220
Galaxy A50: Jennifer I bled so much that at one point and I share my restroom. So I can just stay there. At one point I seriously stood in my room over a trash can.

128
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:17.340
Galaxy A50: I did not like it just kept going. I bled for a day and a half I fucked up everything in my room and then it stopped. So I'm thinking it happened again.

129
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.810
Galaxy A50: Yeah, but

130
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.370
Dr Jameson: Have you been to college.

131
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.800
Galaxy A50: I know you know I'm ready right now but

132
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.840
Galaxy A50: Since last summer.

133
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.170
Galaxy A50: Because I would have been due for an exam, but

134
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.700
Galaxy A50: I just, I don't. That might also be causing me some sort of

135
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.590
Dr Jameson: Something there might, it might be a hormone imbalance, but there's also

136
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:52.170
Dr Jameson: You know, sometimes they can either put in a marina or do an ablation, or like do something to make this bleeding things that by I don't know the hormones is about, well, sometimes we put people on the pill to set to regulate things to

137
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.850
Galaxy A50: Show Marina kind of screwed up my uterus, a while ago.

138
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.590
Galaxy A50: And I already had an ablation.

139
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.320
Galaxy A50: I'm really and also you know how I was trying to freeze my eggs right. Did I

140
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.460
Dr Jameson: Tell you, though, but

141
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:25.950
Galaxy A50: Okay, so they didn't get the first time I did it. They said the eggs were. They were barely any they didn't even seem as bad quality. It's just I got like four. Okay. And so I was going to do it again. And I'm not going to do it again. So I'm kind of getting a little bit depressed over that.

142
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.050
Galaxy A50: So,

143
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:42.630
Dr Jameson: Well, that's a lot. There's a lot of different layers. I don't know. I'm not a gynecologist I think sometimes people get a second scraping or ablation. Again, like maybe there's a spot that needs to be retreated, but that's where the gynecologist welcome. I don't know.

144
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.040
Galaxy A50: Yeah, no, I'm just telling

145
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:51.840
Galaxy A50: You everything happening with me. I know that the heat and the bleeding is is making me a little more anxious

146
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:52.530
Dr Jameson: Well, I

147
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:53.910
Galaxy A50: Am at it and basically

148
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.570
Bleeding

149
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.600
Galaxy A50: You know it's stopped and

150
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.340
Galaxy A50: Thank goodness right again.

151
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:05.010
Dr Jameson: Because your luck. I mean, because if it kept like that. That's you would have probably end up in the ER or something. You can't believe

152
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:05.790
Dr Jameson: That for

153
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.570
Dr Jameson: Well, I can

154
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.350
Galaxy A50: Tell when my when my blood pressure goes down and it didn't.

155
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.020
Galaxy A50: I just kept hydrating or I would have

156
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.510
Dr Jameson: Gone. Maybe that's part of why you're thirsty to

157
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.980
Dr Jameson: Your reef. You're very

158
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.130
Galaxy A50: Plentiful rehydrating from them maybe

159
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.780
Dr Jameson: Yeah, cuz you're probably, you know, and you need probably iron to

160
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:36.390
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I don't see anything written in the side effects about heat intolerance or sweating or flushing or thirsty. So I don't know if it's just coincidence.

161
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:49.920
Dr Jameson: I i do you know echo the sentiment, whether it was, you know, some sort of ploy or not, but I think you're doing great with your

162
00:16:50.970 --> 00:17:01.260
Dr Jameson: Anxiety, too. I mean, I think you're definitely making there's a wait. There's a difference between how you were when we first met you and how you are now and how you handle

163
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.650
Dr Jameson: Adversity I think so. I

164
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:14.370
Dr Jameson: I hopefully I'm going to take it at face value that she saw you controlling yourself and that that's a good thing. You know, like you

165
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.850
Galaxy A50: Mentioned, she's like oh you handled it so much better.

166
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.340
Galaxy A50: I just don't trust her because I

167
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:20.730
Dr Jameson: Was

168
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.840
Galaxy A50: Just talking to

169
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:36.990
Dr Jameson: That's fair enough. I get it. And you're right, like, you know, it seems, encouraging, but you know we only we only know it's like the, you know, part of the story, I'm sure. But yeah, I'm happy to write another letter I.

170
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:48.930
Dr Jameson: I also thought it was an unusual wreck recommendation or requirements. So I'm glad to hear that she thought it was weird, too, because I'm like I don't, I don't really understand this, but

171
00:17:50.070 --> 00:18:03.900
Dr Jameson: Hey. Anyway, I think you're making. I think you know it's been a positive I hope on your, from your perspective, too, but I feel like, from my perspective, it seems like you've been able to at least help in some ways. Anyway, so

172
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:14.760
Dr Jameson: Um, anyway. Um, so yeah, just for the just like last time, I think you emailed it to Jamie and then she forward it to me and I said,

173
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.380
Galaxy A50: email it to Jamie. Okay.

174
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:23.250
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and then. So the initial question is what is my recommendation on what we should focus on. Is that what you're

175
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:30.270
Galaxy A50: Well, this same exact letters last time, but take the points that are emphasized in the phone.

176
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.930
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'll read through it and. Okay. Okay.

177
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.160
Dr Jameson: With anybody jack

178
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.590
Dr Jameson: On my last letter. By the way, I never really

179
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:59.100
Galaxy A50: They really liked it. They really really liked it enough for it. There's that's why their specific things because the judge was like, I want to know how often she tests, for example, that was one of them. I want to know what she's doing like in terms of in Lucas, I, I was saying, by then I

180
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:11.040
Galaxy A50: Already had quick part by the time we we went to court and he said, then I want to know what she's doing in lieu of part. So let's do that would be like, things like that, but

181
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:11.910
Galaxy A50: Everything that

182
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:22.710
Dr Jameson: That's well and breathing exercises and I mean there's a lot of things people can do that doesn't have to be on medication anyway but

183
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.570
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well I know

184
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.700
Galaxy A50: Probably

185
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.170
Dr Jameson: By that so much. Probably so. Anyway, I will certainly mentioned the lead to that that's what

186
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:37.650
Galaxy A50: I did right i did confirm it in court that I've been doing meditation, of course.

187
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:38.790
Galaxy A50: Then I did.

188
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:50.130
Galaxy A50: Back then, I was literally going to eat meetings. So I brought my little like DUI sign card. Have you seen those it's like you put down the date.

189
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.790
Galaxy A50: When to meeting you attended and who was the secretary of that.

190
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.670
Galaxy A50: Meeting. Now I just do in the rooms.

191
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.560
Galaxy A50: But I don't turn my face on down, see that there's a screen.

192
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.330
Galaxy A50: Like this. When you turn your face on the call on you and I don't want to be like

193
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.190
Galaxy A50: Yeah.

194
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.840
Galaxy A50: So that's what I've been doing

195
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.480
Galaxy A50: Good, so I can see others but they can't see me okay

196
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:22.800
Dr Jameson: Yeah, however you're comfortable. That's fine. Okay, well I'll watch for the letter, whatever it is, and then

197
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.700
Dr Jameson: hopefully there'll be some resolution here.

198
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.580
Dr Jameson: And I take time, but

199
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:36.180
Galaxy A50: My son is so miserable over there but you know there's nothing he can do. Yeah.

200
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:42.900
Galaxy A50: He doesn't even know necessarily that he's miserable. I just did the things that he says, I'm like, oh god, you poor baby.

201
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.240
Galaxy A50: Hey, yeah.

202
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.380
Dr Jameson: Well, I guess that's good. Then if he doesn't realize

203
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.620
Dr Jameson: Maybe looking back on it, he'll anyway.

204
00:20:54.300 --> 00:21:03.150
Dr Jameson: You know, things would be crazy. Now, wherever he was with all the quarantining anyway. So I guess. And I guess season they haven't had any more earthquakes or anything.

205
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.060
Galaxy A50: everything turned out okay one. Yeah.

206
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:06.870
Galaxy A50: No worries.

207
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.420
Galaxy A50: Yeah, okay.

208
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.040
Dr Jameson: All right, well, I have another patient. Now your phone is buzzing so

209
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:25.650
Dr Jameson: We will have to send our cups to the patient. I will get with john and confirm, who's the patient. Okay. Do you know this is our internal

210
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:35.520
Galaxy A50: Okay, we'll just I'll, I'll see. I'll see how much the cups are and how many on Amazon. Yeah I easily can purchase this

211
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:43.230
Dr Jameson: Well, he saying that it sounds like for us to like certify or whatever the test. It has to be the ones that we send to you so

212
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:43.980
Dr Jameson: Okay.

213
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.220
Dr Jameson: So, don't, don't bother buying anything at least until unless

214
00:21:50.250 --> 00:22:01.080
Dr Jameson: Okay, I don't think that's gonna be helpful. So, all right, well, it's good to see you. So listen, I, I don't think we're allowed by the insurance people to have more than one group.

215
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:14.760
Dr Jameson: Like appointment per day. I know you usually come to group tonight. Yeah. So if you want to discuss group tonight I'll, I'll let them know your excuse because he had another appointment with me today. We

216
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.420
Galaxy A50: Yeah, that's fine.

217
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.580
Dr Jameson: At planning a chance to chat so

218
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.570
Galaxy A50: You got it.

219
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.720
Dr Jameson: All right.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.420
Dr Jameson: We'll see you next weekend. Next week, then I

221
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.800

Galaxy A50: All right.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.380
Galaxy A50: Okay, thank you so much, Dr. James

224
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.000
Dr Jameson: You too.

225
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:30.870
Bye.

226
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.440
Mary’s iPhone: Hello.

227
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.720
Dr Jameson: Hi, my name is Hector Jamison

228
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.890
Dr Jameson: It came in faster than I thought it was saying, it was still connecting that's

229
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.270
Dr Jameson: Why I was sitting here in silence.

230
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.320
Dr Jameson: So, Mr dials right

231
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.400
Mary’s iPhone: Yes.

232
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.450
Dr Jameson: All right. Okay. Um, if you could just confirm your birthday. Awesome.

233
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.820
Mary’s iPhone: It's oh 129 84

234
00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.220
Dr Jameson: You know, highlight, I believe, right.

235
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.180
Yes.

236
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:28.590
Dr Jameson: And they explained to you know that we're recording these so because they make a transcript. Out of all of our visits like keep a record of what was said that sort of thing. Are you comfortable with that you give your

237
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.910
Dr Jameson: Your sent. In other words, okay.

238
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:39.630
Dr Jameson: Yes. All right. So are you are you switching to us from a different program or you're starting treatment kind of from the beginning.

239
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.850
Mary’s iPhone: I'm really

240
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.640
Mary’s iPhone: switching from another program.

241
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.210
Dr Jameson: It's been

242
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.770
Mary’s iPhone: Hard for me to get into another

243
00:24:47.640 --> 00:25:03.750
Dr Jameson: That's fine. I'm asking because I just don't need to go from like the very beginning on how Suboxone works, and I'll you know like it just, it just a little bit of a different conversation from my side. So that's why I like to sort of know at the beginning what where we're at. Exactly.

244
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.720
Mary’s iPhone: We're on almost all of it.

245
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.040
Mary’s iPhone: Taking maybe two milligrams a day at the most.

246
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.660
Mary’s iPhone: Okay, I tried to try to just take a half a one, if I can.

247
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.340
Mary’s iPhone: Sometimes I have to

248
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.370
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, I've been doing with a lot

249
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.440
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I think, um,

250
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:35.790
Dr Jameson: Well, first of all, tapering the closer you get to zero, the harder it gets so so that's that's that's definitely

251
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:49.620
Dr Jameson: A common experience. But second of all, like, sort of the determination that that is even the goal. I don't know. You know, sometimes we meet people at just a very low dose, just because it just kind of an insurance policy.

252
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:56.910
Dr Jameson: Anyway, it's an individual thing, but okay. So you've been, how long have you been taking Suboxone

253
00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.220
Mary’s iPhone: Since

254
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.880
Mary’s iPhone: November of last year.

255
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:19.560
Dr Jameson: 19 so just five or six months. Yes, that's a short time actually okay I'm relatively maybe it seems like one day and then where is this the only time you've been taken, you've taken it in your life, or have you taken it. Other times, too.

256
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:27.750
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, this is really like the first time that I've been serious on it. I mean, I was at 16 milligrams in the beginning.

257
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:35.040
Mary’s iPhone: Mm hmm. Now I'm all the way down to basically one milligram. It just depends on how much I do in a day.

258
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.410
Mary’s iPhone: Because I mean, I've had heart problems I've had all kinds of issues with me and

259
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.140
Dr Jameson: Do you have pain to that I see somewhere.

260
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.820
Mary’s iPhone: Yes, I, I have like full body aches, all the time.

261
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.730
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, I tried to

262
00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:01.530
Mary’s iPhone: Do it. It's just I think it's just as soon as I get into my own place. I think it would be a lot easier for me to just adjust

263
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.940
Mary’s iPhone: Instead of constantly dealing with the chaos over and over again.

264
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:17.220
Dr Jameson: They also difficult especially okay well let's back up for a few minutes. I'm just going to ask some basic things like are you allergic to any medications that you know about any allergies.

265
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.650
Mary’s iPhone: No, and that's it. I know. OK.

266
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.020
Dr Jameson: And then so you take Suboxone now.

267
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.380
Dr Jameson: There are the films or tablets.

268
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.160
Dr Jameson: And use the 10 milligram any take a half, you said usually

269
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:38.700
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, I've been using been taken like really like two grams a day. Typically, I've been taken.

270
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.190
Mary’s iPhone: Away one milligram morning and

271
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.780
Mary’s iPhone: One in the evening.

272
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.160
Mary’s iPhone: About a 12 hour

273
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:45.630
Dr Jameson: Maybe

274
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.680
Mary’s iPhone: 10 to 12 hours.

275
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.120
Mary’s iPhone: But I mean, some days I can get through a day and be okay with just one, but it's like

276
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:02.490
Mary’s iPhone: Just start focusing on other things. It's like my mind starts going to other places and

277
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.300
Dr Jameson: Well, so it sounds like you are discovered what I think is, is a commonly overlooked.

278
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:19.950
Dr Jameson: Component. I guess to this whole problem, which is that there's a medication, physical withdrawal, you know,

279
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:35.820
Dr Jameson: You know, the physical body symptom piece and then there's a whole lot of mindset and coping coping skills or lack thereof and the, you know, dealing with life.

280
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:37.920
Dr Jameson: In a different way.

281
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.070
Mary’s iPhone: Like my enters. I'm sorry to cut you off.

282
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.880
Dr Jameson: Really just

283
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.680
Mary’s iPhone: My, my household area that's really kind of just making me

284
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.210
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, so I think is as long as I was able to just

285
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:59.970
Mary’s iPhone: Stay on for maybe a few more weeks. I mean, I would really like to try to win off within the next month. And that's really what I want to do.

286
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.270
Dr Jameson: Okay. And that's, you know, I always applied that

287
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:22.500
Dr Jameson: That desire i mean i think it's it's it's great looking for, you know, cure or you know resolution, as opposed to just a temporary status here so we'll come back to it. I think, I think there's, there are also some

288
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:39.120
Dr Jameson: There are some concerns or risks that needs to be, you know, at least considered and you know the the entire equation should before we make before final decisions are made on that will come back to it, but

289
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.560
Dr Jameson: I'm

290
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.910
Dr Jameson: I understand what you mean coated duly noted that that's your goal. And I think that's

291
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.120
Dr Jameson: I think that's very good. I mean, that's a good goal to have

292
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.100
Dr Jameson: So do you take

293
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.190
Mary’s iPhone: A WALK modest isn't perfect anybody else. I understand.

294
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.860
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm just thinking of it.

295
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:05.280
Dr Jameson: For yours. I mean, for me, I'm focused on you and your long term sobriety and recovery and

296
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:15.540
Dr Jameson: I'm all for tapering. I think this is a pretty short timeframe relative to you know how people do and

297
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:27.030
Dr Jameson: To be frank, the it's the biggest concern is that the the statistics like when they look in studies of how many you know who takes it for how long. And what happens after they stop taking Suboxone

298
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:35.040
Dr Jameson: It's not very encouraging about you know how people end up end up doing at the end. You know, when they stopped Suboxone so

299
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.260
Mary’s iPhone: That's what I keep wearing a bonds.

300
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:51.060
Dr Jameson: Yeah so i i i 100% applied and and I'm happy that that's your goal, and I will always support it. But I also want to make sure that you're safe.

301
00:30:51.780 --> 00:31:06.180
Dr Jameson: You know, first return to use after a period of sobriety can be fatal. There's very high rates of fatal overdose in that setting because he was tolerance and you know the dope has changed in the interim potentially

302
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.500
Mary’s iPhone: So it's not something to be. It's not something. It's not a decision if we're not going to make a decision about it today anyway.

303
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:21.600
Dr Jameson: I encourage like extensive individual counseling and lots of discussion and conversation and sort of testing.

304
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:32.490
Dr Jameson: What happens if this, you know, going through scenarios in your mind, making sure we have a very good support system and backup and trip, you know, double backup plans and

305
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:40.980
Dr Jameson: You know, all that kind of thing before we decide to, you know, really actually pull the shopping it you know i just i would

306
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.390
Dr Jameson: I would encourage you not

307
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:49.020
Dr Jameson: To be in a giant rush about it. And I'm not saying that because I get paid to see you and prescribe the medication.

308
00:31:49.170 --> 00:32:05.520
Dr Jameson: It's funny that I hear myself even saying this because when I first learned about the medication started treating I was always like, why are people taking it for so long, or we're not making any progress and as I've done it longer and seeing, seeing how people do. I've become much less

309
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.590
Dr Jameson: cavalier about having people taper off. I guess just because

310
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:24.180
Dr Jameson: There are people that do it successfully and it can be done for sure if it's what you want. It will be done. I'm sure but I just want I just encourage you to be, be patient and deliberate and

311
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:34.020
Dr Jameson: You know, be careful about about it. And, you know, get the get the input from the experts and the counselors and the you know the

312
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:44.250
Dr Jameson: The people you're working with through your through your recovery and treatment to make sure that everyone is feeling confident on your behalf to not just you know what I'm saying.

313
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:45.330
Yes.

314
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.270
Dr Jameson: So anyway, so we'll come back to it.

315
00:32:49.890 --> 00:33:00.810
Dr Jameson: I think it's great. You've, you've tapered a lot in a short period of time. So obviously you have a lot of determination and that's a really good thing. That's a really good thing.

316
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:06.030
Dr Jameson: Do you take any other prescription medications human part

317
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:06.570

334
00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.780

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.440
Dr Jameson: Do part. Do you have heart valve problems.

336

Mary’s iPhone: Once, but sometimes I have to take its place, and

385
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.670
Dr Jameson: Anything else there's a box on

386
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.490

Mary’s iPhone: Oh my. Oh.

389
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:02.940
Dr Jameson: Yeah, because of the mechanical valve. So you have a blood thinner. Okay, I think. Unless, did you have a

390
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.160
Mary’s iPhone: Of. It's not a chemical valve.

391
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:06.990
Mary’s iPhone: It's actually

392
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.480
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah. Did they do a marijuana or a pic one

393
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.470
Mary’s iPhone: I've truly think of the pig one

394
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.820
Dr Jameson: The metal ones. You have to be on blood thinners because they definitely form clots, the pig. Yeah, not so much.

395
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.970
Dr Jameson: But maybe then you have this event. Do you have a stent you think

396
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.440
Mary’s iPhone: I'm not sure but I think I had

397
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.440
Dr Jameson: Did you have blockages like

398
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.640
Mary’s iPhone: I had some blockages, but I don't know if they got it out or they had

399
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.390
Mary’s iPhone: A tissue Stan and I can't remember. Okay.

400
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.380
Dr Jameson: That's all right. Do you know if your eloquent is 2.5 or five, it doesn't

401
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:49.260
Mary’s iPhone: Really matters what

402
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.190
Dr Jameson: matters to you, but for our purposes, which doesn't really matter.

403
00:37:53.670 --> 00:38:00.990
Dr Jameson: And then any other aspirin or you're not on where you ever on Coumadin warfarin. At one point, maybe

404
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.100
No.

405
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.440
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, they might have had, you know, 2 million or so on that one time, but I don't think

406
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.570
Dr Jameson: About anything for cholesterol.

407
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.540
Mary’s iPhone: Cholesterol. No.

408
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:13.770

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.070
Dr Jameson: Okay.

411
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:30.780
Dr Jameson: All right, so we take a look. Listen, if you think of any other son. Okay. But that's a pretty a pretty good lesson. You remember them out, which is more than many

412
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:36.030
Mary’s iPhone: I was actually taking way more than that with that's

413
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.860
Mary’s iPhone: That's just after

414
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.990
Dr Jameson: I like yeah

415
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.320
Mary’s iPhone: I gave up on the doctors to try

416
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.820
Mary’s iPhone: This try this, try that.

417
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:48.600
Mary’s iPhone: Oh, because I felt like I was just being an elaborate

418
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.570
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, I mean, I don't know.

419
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.110
Dr Jameson: What else were you being treated for

420
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.900
Dr Jameson: Or is it all from the heart. Doctor, so

421
00:38:59.490 --> 00:38:59.880
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah.

422
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.450
Mary’s iPhone: I don't know. I mean, I just

423
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.690
Mary’s iPhone: It's just, I've been struggling to understand things because of the household that I live in

424
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.260
Dr Jameson: Okay.

425
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.030
Mary’s iPhone: So it's like I've been trying to just

426
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:23.160
Dr Jameson: Yeah okay well so you had your. When did you have your surgery.

427
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.880

428
00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.400
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's been that's been fixed a while. Okay.

429
00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:36.300

Dr Jameson: Okay, but that okay so

433
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:51.030
Dr Jameson: I don't need to tell you before the surgery and after the surgery when they get things working better. Again, a lot of times you can get off the medication because

434
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.690
Dr Jameson: And I guess I guess I'm

435
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:07.650
Dr Jameson: The science, the scientist in the medicine, medical field like we depth. We definitely do like, you know, try this. Make sure it's okay, try that, you know, or you know sometimes we have to

436
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.650
Dr Jameson: I guess that comes more naturally to us and from your perspective, you're like, You don't seem like you know what you're doing.

437
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:26.910
Dr Jameson: But, you know, the sad truth even though people don't like it, to hear it. Sometimes you know every person's body is different. And so what works in one person doesn't always

438
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:41.490
Dr Jameson: You know, does terrible things to somebody else, but you can't always know that until you there are some things we should be able to predict, hopefully, lots of things, but every so often just weird things happen when you put somebody on on a regular, normal medication. So

439
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:48.210
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I'm still i can i can tell that's been disconcerting for you, maybe

440

Mary’s iPhone: Mean I just, I've been through all yeah

441
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:53.460

Mary’s iPhone: Yes.

448
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.780
Dr Jameson: I don't want to assume anything but I

449
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.050
Dr Jameson: That's what I figured. Okay so history.

450
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.430

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:42.480
Mary’s iPhone: Like this big plastic case over

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.710
Oh,

458
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:55.680
Dr Jameson: Well, so sometimes there's inflammation and swelling and you can't, if you if you try to close it up right away, things get squished so much that they don't get blood flow. So sometimes you have to leave.

459
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:13.110
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there's like a certain tense sort of thing that they use to kind of keep it clear of infection and in closed, but let the swelling kind of gradually or if your heart was enlarged and it was going to get smaller. I don't know, but

460
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.480
Dr Jameson: I'm not a heart surgeon. So I only know so much about that stuff.

461
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.970

Mary’s iPhone: It was this maybe a social thing.

591
00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.410

592
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.350

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:38.670
Mary’s iPhone: 2007

603
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.710

611
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:21.900
Dr Jameson: Have you ever been shut down. So what. So what happened.

612
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.670
Mary’s iPhone: I just stopped going

613
00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.260
Dr Jameson: And started

614
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.210
Dr Jameson: Did you go straight from that to Suboxone or you were injecting at some point. No.

615
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:32.550
Mary’s iPhone: No, I went to

616
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.130
Mary’s iPhone: Us knowing him.

617
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.910
Dr Jameson: And then did you shoot it to

618
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.660
Mary’s iPhone: For short period of time.

619
00:52:45.990 --> 00:53:03.240
Dr Jameson: Okay, well I I presumed that again, I should like I said, I shouldn't make any assumptions, but that's almost always how these hard infections happen. So that's why I'm eventually. Okay. And so that was you said you had your heart surgery in 2007 or 18

620
00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:05.520
Dr Jameson: So you

621
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.330
Know,

622
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.850
Dr Jameson: Okay.

623
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:13.470
Mary’s iPhone: Before

624
00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.300
Mary’s iPhone: It was it was

625
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.420
Mary’s iPhone: 15 and then 17

626
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.140
Dr Jameson: Okay. And were you using in between there or

627
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:26.730
Mary’s iPhone: No.

628
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.830
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you stop.

629
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:30.960
Mary’s iPhone: And Dan dan fraction came back.

630
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.550
Mary’s iPhone: Okay.

631
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.520
Mary’s iPhone: Get it all. I guess is what the doctor.

632
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.570
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well,

633
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:44.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it can be very difficult. That's why we start with six weeks of antibiotics in the first place. But, but it can be very difficult to

634
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:49.860
Dr Jameson: You know, like when you get an abscess, and we have to drain it because

635
00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:02.550
Dr Jameson: You can only get antibiotics to go where blood flows and I know that sounds weird if we're talking about a heart valve that obviously is bathed in blood. But if there's like a inside. It's like

636
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:15.510
Dr Jameson: gristle kind of, I don't know how to explain what the valves are made out of there isn't like a blood vessel inside that. And so sometimes there can be little pockets that just

637
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.840
Dr Jameson: Hide in there. We can't get Adam

638
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.820
Dr Jameson: Without going in, you know, for the surgery, an operation.

639
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:35.640
Dr Jameson: And then sometimes they're resistant to antibiotics, don't kill them as well as they we expect them to. So sometimes that happens to

640
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.880
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you stopped using heroin back in 2015 then

641
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:43.410
Mary’s iPhone: I

642
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.530
Mary’s iPhone: Know, it was probably for the for 1413

643
00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.510
Dr Jameson: And you just stopped on your own.

644
00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:04.530
Mary’s iPhone: Know, I mean, I went through withdrawals after with Charles and then relapsed and I mean there was times I was withdrawn for 30 days.

645
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:13.830
Dr Jameson: I know it's very, it's a very difficult thing, but you didn't. I mean, like we didn't do methadone or in any other kind of detox or programs or anything like that.

646
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:18.600
Mary’s iPhone: No, I tried to just by streets of vaccines and

647
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:20.790
Dr Jameson: Okay.

648
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:27.120
Mary’s iPhone: And that they would just make me sick at the time. I even more stickers

649
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:35.010
Dr Jameson: Horrible. Well, if you don't time it right. I guess you've learned how that how that goes. It can, yeah.

650
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.880
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then you realize you so you

651
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.630
Dr Jameson: Sorry.

652
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:50.460
Mary’s iPhone: No. No, go ahead. I was, I think I had tried several texts or something.

653
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.090
Dr Jameson: Uh huh.

654
00:55:51.450 --> 00:56:07.890
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's very closely related. Yeah, okay. But so it was never in a formal treatment program and then you had more surgery. So you relapsed OFF and ON UP UNTIL WHENEVER November when you started the Suboxone or

655
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:09.840
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay.

656
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.900
Dr Jameson: Okay, and that's a local treatment.

657
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:18.270
Dr Jameson: That's a local treatment facility.

658
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:22.230
Dr Jameson: What kind of how is their

Dr Jameson: Like do you go for

661
00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:36.510
Dr Jameson: I mean, I know now, you're not going because it's probably everything's closed, but were they like weekly groups or did you see a counselor. It was just go see the doctor and get a prescription and that's it.

662
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:42.930
Mary’s iPhone: Wants to see a counselor once a week. And then I was doing group every other

Dr Jameson: I see last transportation. Yeah. Yes. Okay, okay, okay. So, well, let me ask you this. So have you tapered because you didn't have enough medicine or because that was

670
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:22.380
Dr Jameson: A little bit of both.

671
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.720
Mary’s iPhone: Obviously, probably because I didn't have it on medicine and

672
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:32.130
Mary’s iPhone: I got kicked out of my head. I had to prescriptions left

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.170
Dr Jameson: He was

734
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.190
Dr Jameson: very laid back

735
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.320
Dr Jameson: Okay, but he's he's he's

736
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:34.380
Dr Jameson: He's involved in your life.

737
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:36.510
Mary’s iPhone: Joe

738
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.210
Mary’s iPhone: Yes, it is. Chills

739
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.900
Dr Jameson: Okay.

740
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.240
Mary’s iPhone: Camp or something.

741
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:53.220
Okay.

742
01:02:55.590 --> 01:03:00.810
Dr Jameson: All right. And then are there other people besides your parents living in where you're there now.

743
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.080
Dr Jameson: Your brother.

744
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.680
Dr Jameson: I don't know what happened to the connection, it's like really not coming in. Well, I guess.

745
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:17.190
Dr Jameson: Are you there.

746
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.260
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah.

747
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.370
Dr Jameson: Yeah, the connections.

748
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.380
Dr Jameson: Really bad. I don't. Did you move as maybe the new spot, you're sitting in

749
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.800
Mary’s iPhone: One like this and it just went out.

750
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:39.990
Dr Jameson: Oh, I know. I mean, like where you're in, we're in the car, like it was really good. When we first started the appointment and now it's not so good.

751
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.460
Dr Jameson: Is it possible to go back where you started.

752
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.220
Mary’s iPhone: Or my car.

753
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:57.060
Dr Jameson: I'm just having a very hard time hearing

754
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:59.280
Dr Jameson: I'm getting like every third word right now.

755
01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.020
Dr Jameson: But then again, mine looks like it's

756
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.660
Dr Jameson: Freezing here on the sun too. So maybe it's not

757
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.280
Dr Jameson: You may not all you

758
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:22.830
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me.

759
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.200
Mary’s iPhone: Better now. Yes.

760
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.300
Dr Jameson: For now, yes, I think.

761
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:28.920
Dr Jameson: Okay.

762
01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.670
Mary’s iPhone: I might do. Oh.

763
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.680
Dr Jameson: Thank you. Thank you for trying. Okay, so how

764
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.190
Dr Jameson: Have you been diagnosed with any like anxiety or depression or PTSD or anything like that.

765
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.630
Yes.

766
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.960
Mary’s iPhone: Anxiety and okay

767
01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.530
Dr Jameson: But you're not on any medication for that. Right. Well, have you been in the past.

768
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:54.870
Mary’s iPhone: But just

769
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.430
Dr Jameson: Did not work well, or what happened.

770
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:01.860
Mary’s iPhone: I just stopped taking it.

771
01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.410
Dr Jameson: How long ago.

772
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:12.120
Dr Jameson: Approximately. Okay. Have you noticed any change since you've been back off of it.

773
01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:14.550
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah.

774
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.550
Dr Jameson: Who was prescribing it

775
01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.810
Mary’s iPhone: Um, my OSU doctor

776
01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:30.270
Dr Jameson: Is that you have to fill me in which one is that your primary care or the heart doctor or the Suboxone play

777
01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.180
Mary’s iPhone: I think it is my primary care doctor

778
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.920
Dr Jameson: Okay that's often who it is. I you don't see a psychiatrist.

779
01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.470
Mary’s iPhone: No. Okay.

780
01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:43.980
Dr Jameson: That's the only other person. I would think it might be okay.

781
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:52.200
Dr Jameson: Are you just overdue for an appointment or you didn't think you need to take it anymore. Don't think you need to take it anymore. What, what, just

782
01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.450
Mary’s iPhone: Feel like I didn't need to take it anymore.

783
01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.220
Dr Jameson: Okay. Do you still feel that way.

784
01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:03.360
Dr Jameson: Okay. So, but, you know, you notice a little bit more anxiety, since you stopped it. But it's not that bad.

785
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.660
Mary’s iPhone: I'm sure I'm getting my idea on

786
01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:08.490
Dr Jameson: OK.

787
01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:15.210
Dr Jameson: So maybe I didn't hear. Did you say you have noticed a difference. Since you stopped it.

788
01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:19.890
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, I really not good like that heart flutter. Boom.

789
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:25.050
Dr Jameson: Oh, so it was giving you side effects. I see. Okay, so you feel better. Since you stopped it.

790
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.130
Mary’s iPhone: Yes.

791
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:30.600
Dr Jameson: Here, see I here I am making assumptions, again, sorry. Okay, good. Okay.

792
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:37.140
Dr Jameson: But in your anxieties is status quo. It hasn't you haven't had any trouble with that recently set right

793
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:40.890
Dr Jameson: No good. Okay, and how about the depression.

794
01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.320
Mary’s iPhone: It's been getting better.

795
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:44.640
Dr Jameson: Okay, good.

796
01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:54.600
Dr Jameson: So you mentioned a couple times that things were kind of, I don't know, chaotic is always, I think that's the word you used in where you're staying at his with what's that about

797
01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.560
Mary’s iPhone: They were just

798
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:06.540
Mary’s iPhone: Going through transition and they didn't understand that I was changing for the better.

799
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.650
Mary’s iPhone: And are

800
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:11.250
Mary’s iPhone: Fighting to prove myself to my mother.

801
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.210
Okay.

802
01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:26.760
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. So there were some just disagreements and not and lack of trust. Does that sound like kind of okay okay so but it's been getting. Did you just say it's been getting better.

803
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:44.430
Dr Jameson: Well, you know, I think. Well, one thing I we talked about this in our groups like when there's disagreement between whoever it is like

804
01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:50.340
Dr Jameson: It often helps, even if you don't have to agree with the other person but it often helps to like

805
01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:57.210
Dr Jameson: Try to at least see it from their side for a minute. Where are they coming from. Why would they be saying what they're saying.

806
01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:06.210
Dr Jameson: And again he doesn't mean you have to agree with what they're saying. But at least if you can understand why they believe what they're believing sometimes that can help you like

807
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.850
Dr Jameson: Kind of get to some sort of resolution, a little bit easier. Does that

808
01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:21.540
Dr Jameson: Make sense. Like for me, I would say, well, when you've written, you know, been around someone who's an addict. I don't know. I don't want to, again, I shouldn't assume, but a lot of times

809
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:31.020
Dr Jameson: Things keep going missing people aren't showing up when they say they're going to show up. There's a lot of disappointment and frustration and that kind of stuff that comes with that and

810
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.320
Dr Jameson: Fear, because it's scary watching somebody

811
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.830
Dr Jameson: Right, and so people take some time to

812
01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.170
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me.

813
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.890
Dr Jameson: Reading again.

814
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:51.600
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me.

815
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:00.990
Dr Jameson: Sort of

816
01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:02.970
Mary’s iPhone: Do you hear me.

817
01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.980
Dr Jameson: Yes. Can you hear me now.

818
01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:18.870
Mary’s iPhone: Yes, I was saying that that's what I'm struggling with is my brother was always stolen stuff. So they were always paranoid that I was going to do the same thing and

819
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.810
Mary’s iPhone: It is I guess they understand now that I don't steal and I don't lie.

820
01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:33.540
Dr Jameson: But you had to sort of you had to sort of prove yourself right yeah just sort of established that you're trustworthy. Right. You have to earn that sometimes. Yeah.

821
01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:35.970
Dr Jameson: Um,

822
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.500
Dr Jameson: WELL, GOOD, I'M GLAD THAT

823
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:42.330
Dr Jameson: I'm glad it's it's it making headway progressing forward.

824
01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:50.940
Dr Jameson: But yeah, it's, it's hard. This is so hard. There's so many on so many levels. That's one of the reasons why at the beginning I was saying, Wow, this you've

825
01:09:51.360 --> 01:10:01.320
Dr Jameson: You've tapered really quickly because there's a lot of different pieces to this and figuring out interpersonal relations repairing previous relationships that have been

826
01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:13.920
Dr Jameson: You know negatively affected by what's happened and that all of that takes you know that is a long process and slow and it you know there's a lot of components. So to all of this. So,

827
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:17.850
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um,

828
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.970
Dr Jameson: As far as medication goes

829
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.940
Dr Jameson: Are you having cravings. Now, like what on the dose. You're at

830
01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:39.210
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, it's not that I get cravings. It's just I get headaches and I get frustrated because I can't do things. It's like, lack of energy.

831
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:46.170
Dr Jameson: Yeah. So yeah, because you mentioned you're having body pain and I was thinking in my head. I wonder if that's just withdrawal symptom.

832
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.710
Dr Jameson: Because your dose has gone down kind of quickly.

833
01:10:52.200 --> 01:11:00.240
Mary’s iPhone: That's what I was wondering. Because I mean, truthfully I am I can do a lot of activity and I can function a lot better if I start out with two milligrams in the morning.

834
01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:01.200
Yeah.

835
01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.570
Dr Jameson: Very low dose, you know,

836
01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:05.520
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

837
01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.110
Mary’s iPhone: Well, I mean, it's just what I I'm trying to get off it completely.

838
01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:12.060
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

839
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:20.430
Dr Jameson: WHAT'S YOUR MOM IN THE CAR WHEN WE FIRST were talking and I was talking about being very deliberate about stopping all together.

840
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:23.160
Mary’s iPhone: A

841
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:25.020
Dr Jameson: Sheet now.

842
01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:29.640
Dr Jameson: Yes. Yeah. Because, so I just want. I think it's worth, because I think a lot

843
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:45.540
Dr Jameson: Again, I don't want to make any sense. But often, other people are encouraging, you know, get off that stuff and you're just replacing one thing with another, and there's there's often there's some kind of ambivalence about, is this really this is really better than where we were at but

844
01:11:46.890 --> 01:12:02.370
Dr Jameson: And I was what I was saying was just a recap, I applaud and I encourage the, the goal of getting off or the Suboxone at some point I have concern about doing it too quickly. And in my mind quickly is like

845
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:21.420
Dr Jameson: Less than a few years, to be frank and part of that is because what I was just talking about a second ago, we need to help re train coping skills. What do we do when something terrible happens in our life. What do we do when there's fear anxious anxiety pain. There's just a lot of

846
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:27.210
Dr Jameson: Additional coping skills. We want to help build and

847
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:34.230
Dr Jameson: You know, dealing with the reasons why we ended up where we ended up if we don't kind of

848
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.200
Dr Jameson: Evaluate all that and and

849
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.680
Dr Jameson: You know, work on some other all those sorts of underlying issues were

850
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:56.130
Dr Jameson: It's kind of unrealistic to think that, you know, the next time something bad happens, you're not going to turn to the thing that's always been the thing that at least for a moment, makes you feel better.

851
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:09.090
Dr Jameson: So, um, that takes a long time. It's very doable but it usually involves counseling one on one work for some significant amount of time. Sometimes family counseling or part you know relationship counseling, sometimes not.

852
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:22.740
Dr Jameson: But it's it's a process. And if we rush it unfortunately what the statistics are very discouraging about how people do after they stopped Suboxone or methadone either one.

853
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:33.840
Dr Jameson: There's a very, very high rate of relapse. And since that can be fatal. We don't really want to mess around. We'd rather be very deliberate and make sure that

854
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:49.890
Dr Jameson: Counselors agree mindset is very strong. We have a backup plan and a second second backup plan and a contingency plan for that yet. We have a lot. We've thought very hard long and hard about how we're going to manage going forward.

855
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:54.810
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

856
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:55.620
Dr Jameson: That's what

857
01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:59.700
Mary’s iPhone: I need to stay on. It's not something wrong.

858
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:13.230
Mary’s iPhone: I just know people music that's my problem. That's, that's, you tell me no you snore you do this you do that. That's not how we communicate

859
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:27.510
Mary’s iPhone: And she that's what she sounded to you and tell you that it's okay that we need to work together as a team, instead of you that can you know what's right all the time. I do, too.

860
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.710
Mary’s iPhone: I didn't know if

861
01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:32.550
Dr Jameson: I say that maybe she does know what's right. Oh.

862
01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:36.420
Dr Jameson: No.

863
01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.170
Dr Jameson: I think

864
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:37.560
I

865
01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.050
Dr Jameson: I think that

866
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:41.490
Dr Jameson: Maybe

867
01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:51.900
Dr Jameson: Maybe we should explain a little bit about how the Suboxone like the way that the the medication is packaged it comes with a built in.

868
01:14:52.740 --> 01:15:04.050
Dr Jameson: Determined to being well Suboxone comes with a built into turn to being snorted or shot or melted in and taken different ways because it contains in our can

869
01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:18.660
Dr Jameson: Sub you text, which is without the knowledge zone, that's a different story, which is why we almost never prescribed that unless someone's pregnant or they, you know, had anaphylaxis reactions to the to the Suboxone so there should be very little.

870
01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:28.110
Dr Jameson: I'm not saying people don't do it, but it's much, much less likely to be misused, because it's got that in our can built in, um,

871
01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:36.630
Dr Jameson: I think the bigger concern, frankly, is people selling you know not taking it and selling it to other people, right, which

872
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.780
Dr Jameson: We all know that happens. So that's our

873
01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:41.940
Mary’s iPhone: Right.

874
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:42.780
Yeah.

875
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:44.280
Mary’s iPhone: Obviously,

876
01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:47.280
Dr Jameson: Right. I mean, it's out there and and you know

877
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.570
If

878
01:15:50.520 --> 01:16:00.210
Dr Jameson: I say this not to say that I would be comfortable knowing that you were doing that with my prescription. I know I would not because that's

879
01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.300
Mary’s iPhone: Illegal she would say I was out buying

880
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:04.890
Dr Jameson: People, but what

881
01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:06.570
Dr Jameson: I understand that.

882
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:19.080
Dr Jameson: But what what I was gonna say was, it is a very Safe Medication. I mean it. It's very difficult to overdose on it. I mean, you can if you melt a bunch of sub sub you text and shoot it, you can. But if you're taking it.

883
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.180
Dr Jameson: It's very safe and it really works. So

884
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:35.430
Dr Jameson: I have very mixed feelings about the fact that it's available on the street because it also gets people into treatment when they try it and realize, oh, this, this works. I can just take this from

885
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:41.550
Dr Jameson: In and not so i'm not saying I am okay with you selling your medicine, but at the same time.

886
01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:48.510
Dr Jameson: You know it's rarely that it's harmful. It's just anyway it is my job, our job to

887
01:16:48.900 --> 01:17:03.630
Dr Jameson: Be sure that you are taking your medicine and not selling it. So we do that's part of why we do pill counts and we do drug screens and you're not supposed to have it in your system. When we test you. And you know, that kind of stuff. So we do monitor that.

888
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:05.040
For sure.

889
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:19.830
Dr Jameson: So, so I think the concern about miss us, I mean, I'm not there. So I can't see what's going on. But I think if it's just based on previous behavior that that that fear is there.

890
01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:29.070
Dr Jameson: I would try to reassure you, mom, that it's pretty hard to abuse this particular drug because it has that built in arcane in there.

891
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.910
Dr Jameson: And then, you know,

892
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.510
Dr Jameson: Again, the first return to use

893
01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.780
Dr Jameson: Unfortunately, especially people that are using IV.

894
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:53.370
Dr Jameson: There's a very high rate of fatal overdose. And so, you know, that's just it's a fact. So we, I just, I'm always very

895
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:59.010
Dr Jameson: Careful about recommending that somebody stopped completely the Suboxone

896
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:09.870
Dr Jameson: And I, you know, even actually. Well, I've only been working with bright hearts since June, so I it's almost a year, but we haven't gotten anybody completely off as of yet under my care.

897
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:22.920
Dr Jameson: But I would probably still recommend that you have a bottle locked up somewhere that you could always turn to, if you had a really bad day, you know, that might be part of that contingency plan that we were talking about because

898
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.520
Dr Jameson: You know, it's, it's so much safer than any of the other

899
01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:27.420
Alternatives.

900
01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:31.290
Dr Jameson: But anyway, so for now, I would say.

901
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:36.600
Dr Jameson: You did say your. Are you still seeing that counselor that you were working with before.

902
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:43.980
Mary’s iPhone: Um no I guess like this. Dude, my group meetings on here now and individual

903
01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:52.140
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay, so I wasn't sure if it was. Yeah, it was through that program. So sometimes people are seeing a therapist through their primary care anyway. And it was kind of a

904
01:18:52.440 --> 01:19:03.720
Dr Jameson: Separate from the group from the substance abuse treatment program so we wouldn't necessarily try to rip you away from your, your current counselor if you have one that you're that you're working with. But if

905
01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.130
Mary’s iPhone: Thank you.

906
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:05.820
Yeah.

907
01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.850
Dr Jameson: Okay, then yes, we will we will

908
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:23.550
Dr Jameson: Pretty much insist that you meet with one of our counselors for a good good while until, until they say, Yeah, you know, he's he's he's everything all the screws are are lined up right now.

909
01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:27.900
Dr Jameson: And then

910
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:39.210
Dr Jameson: And then, yeah, you'll do weekly groups and it's online, so like, just like this, so it's it's hopefully much more I think it's much more convenient than trying to having to schlep somebody somewhere.

911
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:42.900
Dr Jameson: As far as your dose goes

912
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:56.400
Dr Jameson: We can start with to the twos twice a day and see, see how you feel. With that, I think the goal is to be physically comfortable

913
01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:06.510
Dr Jameson: Ideally, like, not just comfortable. Like, I feel good and then not having cravings and then, you know, we work with counseling and

914
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:08.490
Mary’s iPhone: Don't

915
01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:11.400
Mary’s iPhone: Like I don't get creating

916
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.830
Dr Jameson: It's amazing. It's

917
01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:16.020
Mary’s iPhone: Like

918
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:16.560
Yeah.

919
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:20.070
Mary’s iPhone: Like really corrected my mind.

920
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:20.370
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah.

921
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:21.630
Dr Jameson: And you started

922
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:33.060
Dr Jameson: Surely, yeah it's it to the way that it works. And I'm some of this you may know, but I'm saying it out loud, partly for the benefit of your mom to maybe she knows do, but it's a selective

923
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:42.210
Dr Jameson: opiate partial they call it a partial agonist and a partial antagonist and you probably understand the word antagonist.

924
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:48.930
Dr Jameson: Already agonist is the opposite. So one is when it's turning on a receptor and one is one, it's blocking a receptor.

925
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:56.850
Dr Jameson: There are different kinds of receptors in our brains there they give them Greek names, but like kappa lambda I'm you.

926
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:13.980
Dr Jameson: Anyway, it doesn't really matter. The details of it. But the point is that some of the opioid receptors that we have make us when they're activated make us sleepy and relaxed and eventually stopped breathing. Others will do things like thank you constipated, and

927
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:25.020
Dr Jameson: I guess it must affect your temperature regulation, right, because when we take the take the opiates away. Everyone starts getting all this hot and cold and all this other stuff so

928
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:25.680
I'm

929
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:29.010
Dr Jameson: Basically obviously set

930
01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:35.100
Dr Jameson: Up all the opiate the other effects that opiates have in our system. When you suddenly take them out.

931
01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:48.570
Dr Jameson: You get like the opposite response, you know, because you've just suddenly taken the brakes away and your body's been compensating for having breaks in place like pushing the gas pedal really far down because there's this you know your

932
01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:58.050
Dr Jameson: emergency brake has been on and all of a sudden you you take the lift emergency brake now all of a sudden you're going 80 miles an hour, you can't sleep right

933
01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:07.200
Dr Jameson: And you get anxious and restless and all the opposite effects happen. So what the Suboxone is able to do is sort of satisfy those receptors.

934
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:23.640
Dr Jameson: But it blocks the receptors that cause you for you and it blocks the receptors that deal with sedation and respiratory depression, which is where people get their overdoses from is that particular receptor. So, which is why it's quite safe.

935
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.360
Dr Jameson: As long as it's taken the way it's designed to be taken.

936
01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:45.090
Dr Jameson: So your people are able to think clearly their physical withdrawal symptoms are gone. And it's, you know, it just allows. It's kind of like a like a timeout from the chase and the you know the the trying not to feel sick thing that people end up in

937
01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:50.580
Dr Jameson: And we use that time, like I said, a couple times now to sort of also

938
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:59.880
Dr Jameson: Back up a minute and Let's peel back some of the other layers here of what what was, what were you getting out of using and what what were you trying to, you know, where was

939
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:09.930
Dr Jameson: Where was the pain that you were trying to self medicate or what are the things you're trying to escape from in your life or what are you using this to cope with.

940
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:21.450
Dr Jameson: For and let's let's figure out how we can help you learn other ways of handling those same things that are going to continue because we can't, we can't magically erase every

941
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:32.070
Dr Jameson: Every you know problem in the world. So that's kind of where the, you know, the harder job is, I think, is is dealing with all that and then your mindset and

942
01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:46.650
Dr Jameson: Not everyone is like that open to hearing different ways or to try different ways of thinking about things are going about things are okay I'm gonna try meditating. I'm gonna try journaling or I'm gonna, you know, not everybody says

943
01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:55.200
Dr Jameson: open minded and they tend to have a harder time because they don't you know if you don't try different things you're going to find a new thing that works.

944
01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.330
Dr Jameson: That works for you. Yeah.

945
01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.140
Mary’s iPhone: Yes, yeah.

946
01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:02.190
Dr Jameson: So, um,

947
01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.420
So anyway, that's kind of

948
01:24:04.890 --> 01:24:15.600
Dr Jameson: I think that that's what takes a lot longer than just tapering down physical withdrawal symptoms like that's a fairly easy thing, the harder thing is is to

949
01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:21.900
Dr Jameson: Reset your, your, your thought processes doesn't make sense.

950
01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:38.850
Dr Jameson: But anyway, I think I'm I think that to twice a day is a reasonable place to start. And then we can adjust if we need to. I mean, the goal is to be successful. And we use the medication to maximize your

951
01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.090
Dr Jameson: Your, your odds basically

952
01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:47.610
Dr Jameson: So you haven't had it refilled and quite some time. I take it right

953
01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:50.250
No.

954
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:55.050
Dr Jameson: I just by law have to look you up in the little database. So I'm just do a quick

955
01:24:56.310 --> 01:25:01.080
Dr Jameson: And then they explain. They did explain to you about how we do weekly groups. It sounds like

956
01:25:02.190 --> 01:25:02.610
Dr Jameson: And

957
01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.010
Mary’s iPhone: They'll send me an email and I just log in with the group number, whatever they get

958
01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:10.680
Mary’s iPhone: Is what I was told I

959
01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:25.530
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, yes, I know so so you check in with the virtual clinic, like you did today, and then assuming you've, you know, done your drug screen for the month and you filled out the surveys that they asked people to fill out every week and you whatever met the different

960
01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:34.710
Dr Jameson: The different criteria, then they give you. Yeah, they email you the meeting ID for that week, and it does change every week.

961
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:40.650
Dr Jameson: So that we make sure everybody gets checked through the check in process.

962
01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:48.180
Dr Jameson: Okay, so Robert da le s and it's want 0129 what you're really wanting

963
01:25:51.090 --> 01:25:53.430
Mary’s iPhone: Oh, it's 129 84

964
01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:09.990
Dr Jameson: We do a monthly search to just make sure somebody isn't getting medicine from two different people, which is much harder to do these days, I think, than it used to be.

965
01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.350
Mary’s iPhone: Yes I my

966
01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:15.150
Mary’s iPhone: Pharmacy.

967
01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:16.320
Fine. Okay.

968
01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:27.150
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it looks like it hasn't been since February and back then you were on the twice a day. Okay. Um, so we do a similar thing where we start with

969
01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:43.230
Dr Jameson: Well, sort prescriptions until we see that you're fulfilling your the requirements of the program and then you kind of earn progressively longer Prescription refills as as you you know progress through the different

970
01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.140
Dr Jameson: Stages basically

971
01:26:48.060 --> 01:27:04.200
Dr Jameson: As far as so they'll schedule you a meeting with one of the counselors to do kind of an initial evaluation from their side of the house if they haven't already, but you'll get an appointment for that. And then they talk to you about getting labs done, I think. Yeah.

972
01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.230
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, I needed to complete my

973
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:10.350
Mary’s iPhone: My

974
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:13.890
Mary’s iPhone: Release of inflammation.

975
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:18.000
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we're going to have copies of labs that you've had done recently.

976
01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.610
Dr Jameson: Sorry. Okay.

977
01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.930
Mary’s iPhone: Perfect, yeah.

978
01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:25.770
Dr Jameson: Otherwise you get poked again. So it's one of the other

979
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.960
Dr Jameson: And then

980
01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:37.530
Dr Jameson: My Ohio groups are on actually on Tuesdays, like I just finished finished them up before I meeting with you today. So that would

981
01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:40.680
Dr Jameson: Mean that we

982
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.180
Dr Jameson: Sorry.

983
01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:57.930
Dr Jameson: That would mean that we start you out with enough medicine to get either to your counselor appointment. If that happens later this week, which I doubt it will because I think they're kind of booked or two are your first group, which would be a week from today.

984
01:28:00.090 --> 01:28:07.260
Dr Jameson: I could meet with you, Friday, just to sort of do a dose check if you would like, if that would be more since we're

985
01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:10.410
Dr Jameson: Playing playing with the dose right now.

986
01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:16.620
Dr Jameson: That's fine. So maybe that's what I'll do, I'll do a three day

987
01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:21.240
Mary’s iPhone: Four day do you just go do you want me to

988
01:28:23.610 --> 01:28:25.590
Mary’s iPhone: Do in the morning and two in the afternoon.

989
01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:30.690
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, I felt really great when I was taking for today.

990
01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:34.500
Mary’s iPhone: I got was really active

991
01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.820
Dr Jameson: Yeah yeah two milligrams in the morning into it and the in the evenings. I already said.

992
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:40.680
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah.

993
01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.100
Yeah.

994
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.160
Mary’s iPhone: Are you want me to do it.

995
01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:45.480
Dr Jameson: No, I mean, I think.

996
01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:51.450
Dr Jameson: I think we should say to into. And then if you're feeling really good like that. Normally when I

997
01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.550
Dr Jameson: When I type when we're tapering people. And since, you know, since you're moving into a new program or like

998
01:28:56.970 --> 01:29:05.760
Dr Jameson: There's a lot of flex, I would not necessarily be recommending or doing any tapering right now. I would be until you get adjusted meet everybody kind of get into the into the swing of things.

999
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:16.140
Dr Jameson: And then if we were going to taper I'm usually making a change like every month, maybe like very very slow. So I wouldn't. I'm not an I really am not in a rush.

1000
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:17.640
Dr Jameson: At all.

1001
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:24.330
Dr Jameson: Okay. Wanna I want to make sure I'm not normally like I said, even the very most sort of

1002
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:37.770
Dr Jameson: well adjusted. I don't know how to say, you know, professionals who who who just, you know, gotten you know pain medicine that got out of control or something. We still do a very slow.

1003
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:50.010
Dr Jameson: Slow, slow, slow to taper. So yeah, so that's what I'll send, and I'll send enough to get you through Friday. Do you have any any particular scheduling.

1004
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:52.800
Dr Jameson: Limitations.

1005
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.300
Mary’s iPhone: I'm just she'll be she'll be out, can you meet with me after 430

1006
01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:03.330
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, at 430 that's totally fine should be on it's not

1007
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.410
Dr Jameson: Do you want five

1008
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.790
Mary’s iPhone: Years. Okay. Yes, that's cool.

1009
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.230
Mary’s iPhone: There's no

Dr Jameson: On Tuesdays.

1027
01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:30.360
Mary’s iPhone: 1030 is fine.

1028
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:35.130
Dr Jameson: Okay, but we have to confirm. I'm going to pencil you in because

1029
01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:36.510
Mary’s iPhone: You have to confirm that you have

1030
01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.920
Dr Jameson: You have a technology.

1031
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:41.040
Dr Jameson: Available for that time but

1032
01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:44.610
Dr Jameson: Will technical tentatively pick that time or

1033
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:49.500
Dr Jameson: Sorry.

1034
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:54.450
Mary’s iPhone: What about, you know, Friday. Okay.

1035
01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.720
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, that's my

1036
01:31:58.890 --> 01:32:06.540
Dr Jameson: So did you have any like prior offs or issues like that with the pharmacy when you first started Suboxone. Do you remember

1037
01:32:08.850 --> 01:32:10.350
Mary’s iPhone: Like getting them.

1038
01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:11.280
Yeah.

1039
01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:20.730
Dr Jameson: Did they have to. There was, was there any delay, like from the day you went to see the doctor did it take a day or something for them to get the prescription sorted out for you.

1040
01:32:23.010 --> 01:32:24.480
Mary’s iPhone: No, not really. Okay.

1041
01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.920
Mary’s iPhone: All actually well I

1042
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.650
Mary’s iPhone: Don't know because I was gonna rest home.

1043
01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:43.650
Mary’s iPhone: Okay. So really I came out of the rest home with I had to go pick up a prescription from the worst one. Okay.

1044
01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:49.980
Dr Jameson: Well, so what sometimes happens is the farm. I mean, well, sometimes the pharmacy has to order.

1045
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:59.310
Dr Jameson: That they don't have it in stock, especially the two milligram size which we can work around, we can call in and eat and have you split it into pieces, that's not the end of the world.

1046
01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:07.080
Dr Jameson: But insurance sometimes has to make it you know wants us to fill out a form about why you're taking this which it's just busy work.

1047
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:16.500
Dr Jameson: And then at the end of the month. Sometimes the pharmacies are actually, you know, they get our monthly allotment and by the end of the month, they don't have it.

1048
01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:23.820
Dr Jameson: Sometimes you have to try different pharmacies to find one. Anyway, there can be a variety of obstacles. I'm just

1049
01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:35.910
Dr Jameson: You know, hopefully it will be fine. But I don't want, you know, just bear that in mind at sometimes they're just as can be very annoying, but sometimes we have to do some work before we get the medicine in your hand, actually.

1050
01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:38.310
Dr Jameson: So I just want just

1051
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:51.240
Dr Jameson: Give you the heads up. What I would suggest as soon as I'm going to send it right now. And then as soon as we're done. Give them you know 10 minutes or something but call the pharmacy a make sure they received the medication and

1052
01:33:51.600 --> 01:34:00.360
Dr Jameson: See if there's any you know will, when will I be able to pick it up and that's a good way to find out. Oh, well, there's a form that needs to be filler, we don't have it in stock or

1053
01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:06.330
Dr Jameson: They sometimes get upset because my prescription has the bright heart health.

1054
01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:12.990
Dr Jameson: Header on it. And that's a California address and they get all some of them get very upset by that.

1055
01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:29.520
Dr Jameson: So I'm going to hand write my address in here. I already put the D and number, but I'll put that on there too. Because sometimes that's part of their initial one until they, you know, sometimes they want a phone call to confirm, everything's on the up and up basically

1056
01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:48.750
Dr Jameson: So I will will will and we will do whatever we can to help if it's a if it's a prior off form or calling into somewhere else or replace, you know, substituting for tablet instead of film, they don't have the film or whatever will do what I

1057
01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:51.540
Dr Jameson: Mean, okay.

1058
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:56.640
Dr Jameson: Well hopefully it'll be all fine. And all this is just, you know,

1059
01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:05.250
Dr Jameson: It's like bringing an umbrella when it doesn't ring, but just from prior experience. I, I didn't. I think it's

1060
01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.070
Dr Jameson: It's worth mentioning.

1061
01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:09.960
Dr Jameson: Um,

1062
01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:11.850
Dr Jameson: Would

1063
01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:19.110
Dr Jameson: I usually offer a prescription for an AR can would that be something you'd like to have in the house.

1064
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:23.880
Mary’s iPhone: I mean,

1065
01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:30.510
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, truthfully. I mean, I don't think I'm eating, but I mean if you feel that I should keep it around.

1066
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:33.270
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm not necessarily saying for you, but

1067
01:35:33.330 --> 01:35:33.480
I

1068
01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:35.730
Mary’s iPhone: Haven't relapse.

1069
01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.490
Dr Jameson: Or friends or family members. Yeah.

1070
01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:43.650
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, I would.

1071
01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:58.500
Dr Jameson: Yeah okay i think it's it's a seat. Again, it's a safety thing. And I'm not saying that I think you're going to relapse. I just, I'm fact I'm pretty sure you're not because you're taking medicine, but it's just a good thing to have available.

1072
01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:00.540
Thank you.

1073
01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:07.050
Dr Jameson: I've had patients that you know didn't use it for themselves but their friend or sibling or

1074
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.730
Dr Jameson: You know,

1075
01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:16.260
Mary’s iPhone: All the knocking. I know.

1076
01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:20.820
Mary’s iPhone: Yes, nor can they can choose one night. No.

1077
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:21.780
Dr Jameson: No, no, no, no.

1078
01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:26.880
Dr Jameson: That's not my department. No.

1079
01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:29.400
Dr Jameson: No.

1080
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:32.130
Mary’s iPhone: No.

1081
01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:41.820
Dr Jameson: That's the thing, too, is like you have, you know, you're likely to know other people that

1082
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:45.990
Dr Jameson: Use the same substances and

1083
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:49.290
Mary’s iPhone: Well, I'm I know everybody they use

1084
01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:54.690
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, so it's like, No, I wouldn't. Yeah.

1085
01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.300
Mary’s iPhone: I don't want people to run

1086
01:36:57.930 --> 01:36:58.440
Dr Jameson: Well, I should

1087
01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:04.440
Mary’s iPhone: Be probably realized that my recovery was successful by Suboxone

1088
01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:10.590
Mary’s iPhone: Mm hmm. Oh, it's a just trying to get other people to understand that. Yeah.

1089
01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:21.900
Dr Jameson: Well, again, I think. All you can do is, is sometimes the less you say, the better. But if your life starts flourishing because you

1090
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:26.910
Dr Jameson: You know, get your, you know, you know what together. And now, okay, maybe you're going to

1091
01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:32.490
Dr Jameson: I don't know, whatever it is that you want to do part time jobs go back to school. I don't know. But, you know,

1092
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:44.580
Dr Jameson: New relationship. Anyway, if your life suddenly starts flourishing and they're seeing it without you even saying see luck, you know, giving them lectures, like, a lot of times they're like, what do you do, you know, they, you know, they want to know.

1093
01:37:45.450 --> 01:37:46.680
Mary’s iPhone: Something over

1094
01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:53.430
Mary’s iPhone: To my mom understand this boxing is a treatment and you don't get it.

1095
01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:54.510
Dr Jameson: From each other. No, no.

1096
01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:56.640
Dr Jameson: It doesn't cause you for. Yeah.

1097
01:37:58.470 --> 01:38:05.640
Dr Jameson: And actually, well, I shouldn't say that I've had people were kind of depends. Because we we have they needed a much some people metabolize it much slower.

1098
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:13.740
Dr Jameson: And so, you know, what's a low dose for one person is a high dose for somebody else. We were talking about that at the beginning. So I've had, I had one one.

1099
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:28.950
Dr Jameson: Patient who was transitioning from from she was taking vitamin pills, but she wasn't taking very many of them and you know the two milligram dose for for like the normal dose for her. She's like, I feel. Hi, I'm like little get a turn the dose way down. So

1100
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:34.110
Dr Jameson: Generally, it doesn't cause any you for yes we say, or a high

1101
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:40.740
Dr Jameson: So, and it and it doesn't. Well, it can still make you constipated.

1102
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:45.870
Dr Jameson: Mean you can still have a lot of the side effects that opiates any opiate does

1103
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:52.110
Dr Jameson: But I think at this point you're already on it. So I don't think that's probably a big concern.

1104
01:38:54.300 --> 01:39:08.430
Dr Jameson: And if this is probably this is not really relevant to you, right. The second either, but I do want to just explain about the precipitated withdrawal thing we kind of talked about that at the beginning. And do you understand how that works. Now, or do you want me to explain that.

1105
01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:14.700
Mary’s iPhone: Oh, I understand how it works and you understand what trauma. Yes.

1106
01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.570
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah. So, no, I'm sorry, I don't think I didn't

1107
01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:29.100
Dr Jameson: make myself clear. So, what I mean is the Suboxone go we already said that it goes and sits in those same receptors that heroin or oxy or whatever else morphine.

1108
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:39.270
Dr Jameson: Would normally go in and it actually, it's very strongly sticks in there so that if you were to try to use something

1109
01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:56.070
Dr Jameson: You know, even a, you know, the prescription for something the dentist gave you, because it folds your tooth. If you take it when you're on your Suboxone there's nowhere for those other opiates to go so they just don't do anything. I mean, you don't get any effect from them.

1110
01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:16.230
Dr Jameson: The buprenorphine is so is this the box on the people in our field in this box is actually stronger than heroin. It sticks stronger than heroin and all these other things. So if you've recently used like within the last day at your drug of choice. And then you take Suboxone

1111
01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:23.640
Dr Jameson: Before you've already entered into withdrawal. The Suboxone actually goes in there and pushes out

1112
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.830
Dr Jameson: Kind of like Narc can

1113
01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:41.220
Dr Jameson: But it lasts a lot longer than our can so that's when you said you used to take and it would make you feel sicker is probably because you hadn't waited long enough, since you had use whatever else you had been using

1114
01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:58.020
Dr Jameson: And so then it actually makes it, it can create a withdrawal. So it's like I said, it won't really matter for you now because you're already taking Suboxone and I anything else. But I think it's just good to know that about how the medication works that

1115
01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:06.360
Dr Jameson: You know, you have to always wait until if your very first time taking it. If you've never taken it before and you've read and you're transitioning from

1116
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:20.130
Dr Jameson: Abusing whatever you're abusing to this, you have to wait until you've actually entered a significant degree of withdrawal and then start your first dose, you have to like delay that first dose.

1117
01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:26.820
Dr Jameson: So that it doesn't put you into withdrawal. You have to be in withdrawal and then come out of it with the Suboxone

1118
01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.500
Dr Jameson: Does that make sense.

1119
01:41:29.670 --> 01:41:30.090
Mary’s iPhone: Yes.

1120
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:40.470
Dr Jameson: Okay. So we asked people, there's a couple of guidelines for group. Well, I'll go over that on Friday because we've talked for two on here ready

1121
01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.310
Dr Jameson: And we go through that with you on Friday.

1122
01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:48.210
Dr Jameson: Um, do you have any questions for me.

1123
01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:55.410
Mary’s iPhone: No, I'm some are you sending over prescription tonight and I get to get up.

1124
01:41:55.410 --> 01:41:56.940
Dr Jameson: Tomorrow, then did about

1125
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.220
Dr Jameson: 510 minutes ago 121

1126
01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:10.230
Dr Jameson: Or 21 yeah but seven minutes ago. So yeah, I, I'm hoping assuming there are no pickups with prior offs, or the pharmacy doesn't carry it or

1127
01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:17.940
Dr Jameson: They suck. They have quotas, like they only have so many patients. I don't know there's there's a variety of

1128
01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:21.270
Dr Jameson: Obstacles, like I said,

1129
01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:32.580
Dr Jameson: But if you have any like if you call the pharmacy and they either didn't. Well, hopefully they got the prescription. But if you know they went into cyberspace or something they didn't receive it.

1130
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:39.930
Dr Jameson: Or they did but but they have some, but they, you know, then called virtual clinic so that we can

1131
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:46.560
Dr Jameson: Do whatever we want. Whatever we can at least on our end to try to get it so you can pick it up tonight.

1132
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.690

Mary’s iPhone: Right now it's 430

1145
01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:30.180
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you're the same as me. That's Eastern. Okay.

1146
01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:32.280
Dr Jameson: Um,

1147
01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:33.930
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, you are. Yes.

1148
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:41.370
Dr Jameson: Alright, so I'll I just want to make sure we were referring to the same clock.

1149
01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.230
Dr Jameson: Okay. Okay, so

1150
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:52.110
Dr Jameson: All right, so I'll let her know to put you in for five o'clock on Friday.

1151
01:43:54.450 --> 01:43:57.960
Dr Jameson: Is going okay and if for some reason.

1152
01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.960
Dr Jameson: You need to reschedule that

1153
01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:13.140
Dr Jameson: I mean, we are definitely understanding flexible people like I don't think you can work with this population and not be okay with kind of going with the flow. Sometimes

1154
01:44:13.650 --> 01:44:21.360
Dr Jameson: But we do ask that you communicate like so that I'm not sitting here at my computer and on a Friday at five, and you're not coming

1155
01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:22.920
Dr Jameson: To you. I'm saying

1156
01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:35.070
Dr Jameson: So if you you can give us a call the virtual clinic, something came up my mom's got, you know, called to stay late whatever I don't, whatever it is.

1157
01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:50.910
Dr Jameson: If you can just let it go ahead of time so that we can we can not waste resources and then we can reschedule it, but it's really more about the courtesy and and sort of respect of

1158
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:58.950
Dr Jameson: Being communicating. If you're not gonna be able to keep an appointment. Basically, ideally, keeping the appointment is best

1159
01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:01.050
Dr Jameson: But like stuff comes up. I mean, it's

1160
01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:01.950
Dr Jameson: Life is life so

1161
01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:06.810
Mary’s iPhone: Make my appointments and I'm not be like I'm on the phone right now.

1162
01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:09.420
We're done.

1163
01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:24.930
Dr Jameson: So, so, you know, like I'm I think I'm maybe to understanding. Sometimes I think it gets me into trouble forgiving too much and then people start. I'm not saying you but this is my life, this is what I have learned about myself.

1164
01:45:27.090 --> 01:45:41.400
Dr Jameson: So we're understanding for sure. And I will also say, you know, in case you're worried. We don't kick people out if their urine test doesn't show what we want it to show. Well, if you don't have Suboxone and yourself in your system that's a problem.

1165
01:45:43.410 --> 01:46:01.320
Dr Jameson: But, you know, we don't punish people for being addicts who sometimes relapse. Like, that's part of the disease. And I'm not encouraged. I'm not going to be happy to see it. I'm not going to be like, oh, whatever you know i'm i'm gonna care, but I'm not gonna like kick you out because

1166
01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:06.090
Mary’s iPhone: I mean, just to ask this, and for my mom.

1167
01:46:07.170 --> 01:46:10.020
Mary’s iPhone: Heard you guys stand with now.

1168
01:46:12.150 --> 01:46:21.150
Mary’s iPhone: So that I could transfer from the Suboxone to marijuana but it's like I've been struggling with what is right and what's wrong for so long. It's like

1169
01:46:21.150 --> 01:46:21.990
Mary’s iPhone: I don't know.

1170
01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:28.590
Dr Jameson: What. Yeah, no, that's a good. That's a really good question and not necessarily a very straightforward answer.

1171
01:46:31.110 --> 01:46:34.410
Dr Jameson: It in Ideally I would I would

1172
01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:44.760
Dr Jameson: If I can you know in in my dream would be that people don't feel they need some sort of mind altering substance in order to deal with.

1173
01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:46.140
Dr Jameson: Their life, life.

1174
01:46:46.290 --> 01:46:46.860
Mary’s iPhone: From them.

1175
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.610
Um,

1176
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:59.310
Dr Jameson: It's legal. In some places, so what can I mean we can't really and we we practice across the country. So I take care of people in California.

1177
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:08.820
Dr Jameson: It's not illegal. You know what I mean, like, so it becomes so we do not have like a policy that you can't use marijuana. I don't

1178
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:21.870
Dr Jameson: I'm not a fan. I think its associated with delusions and paranoia and I think we're going to see as it's being legalized that we actually have more adverse effects from this stuff and then people want to

1179
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:33.000
Dr Jameson: Admit. It's also bad for you to smoke anything whether whether, whatever it is. So I'm not, you know, I don't, I'm not going to advocate for, that's for sure.

1180
01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:43.080
Dr Jameson: If we're going to pick between you smoke taking a couple hits from a joint or shooting a needle in your arm. I'm going to pick the joint, but I don't

1181
01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.720
Mary’s iPhone: But I'm not trying

1182
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:50.760
Mary’s iPhone: I've cut it out already. So I mean I'm few days or two days.

1183
01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.690
Mary’s iPhone: Yeah, cool from that. So I'm the

1184
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:56.670
Mary’s iPhone: One.

1185
01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:10.740
Dr Jameson: That I know I can tell, and you cut back on so you you've been very hard at work, getting rid of a lot of things. So that's, that's very impressive. What I would ask from you is that if you're finding

1186
01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:16.980
Dr Jameson: I think this whole thing is like identifying what is it that is making me

1187
01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:24.960
Dr Jameson: Think about doing X, Y, or Z or what am I, why am I wanting that, what am I trying to rectify

1188
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:38.250
Dr Jameson: Am I bored. Am I scared. Am I anxious, am I like I don't know the answer to that only you can. But what I would ask for you is that if you're finding that you're feeling

1189
01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:44.010
Dr Jameson: Say more anxious because you came off your boost bar, maybe it's not boost bar that you need. Maybe it's something else. But

1190
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:57.870
Dr Jameson: Just be in touch with yourself about what's what's happening and what you're feeling. And if you're wanting to smoke weed why. Let's talk about that. So keep keep thinking, you know, from kind of

1191
01:48:59.610 --> 01:49:07.500
Dr Jameson: Root cause analysis. So we would say, like, where is this really coming from at the at the core of and that sometimes we don't know.

1192
01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:12.240
Dr Jameson: Sometimes it takes a while to figure that out. That's what part of the counseling is about

1193
01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:16.800
Dr Jameson: But a lot of times people have spent so much time.

1194
01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:33.060
Dr Jameson: numbing any feelings that they don't want to have. They don't even know how to what the name like they're not even sure what the feeling is anymore. It's just kind of, you know, so part of it is identifying what what what you're trying to escape from in the first place.

1195
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:40.620
Dr Jameson: So anyway, I just would keep it just keep in touch with yourself if you're feeling like your anxiety or depression are

1196
01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:58.170
Dr Jameson: Getting worse as as you're taking away some of these some of these things be in touch, let us know. Because we can definitely help try to, you know, manage that help help with other other ways if we, if we can, so

1197
01:49:58.770 --> 01:49:59.100
Mary’s iPhone: Okay.

1198
01:49:59.520 --> 01:49:59.850
Dr Jameson: All right.

1199
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:01.110
Mary’s iPhone: Well, thank you.

01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:15.390
Mary’s iPhone: Okay.

1203

Dr Jameson: Okay, so this last most recent patient is Robert dials. So he's transferring to our program from a local

1209
01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:39.180
Dr Jameson: Treatment

1210
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:46.110
Dr Jameson: Plan his glasses transportation and missed appointments and was

1211
01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.590
Dr Jameson: Discharged from their practice.

1212
01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.580
Dr Jameson: For the 36 year old gentlemen.

1213
01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.460
Dr Jameson: Okay. I mean, I know you can summarize what we said.

1214
01:51:10.710 --> 01:51:12.000
Dr Jameson: As far as

1215
01:51:13.890 --> 01:51:17.430
Dr Jameson: Criteria for substance use disorder.

1216
01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:22.140
Dr Jameson: According to his a Sam survey.

1217
01:51:26.850 --> 01:51:28.140
Dr Jameson: Like I said Asperger's.

1218
01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.490
Dr Jameson: He basically needs every criteria minus

1219
01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.870
Dr Jameson: Minus the unable to stop using medication dogs. When you want to. But otherwise, he's

1220
01:51:45.570 --> 01:51:45.900
Dr Jameson: And

1221
01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.020
Dr Jameson: He answered yes to all the other

1222
01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:51.180
Dr Jameson: Desk 10

1223
01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:53.460
Dr Jameson: Questions.

1224
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:58.290
Dr Jameson: He's never been in inpatient

1225
01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.740
Dr Jameson: Treatment

1226
01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:11.610
Dr Jameson: I don't, he didn't. He's not had any overdoses.

1227
01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:18.660
Dr Jameson: And then I guess we should add his Ph. Q.

1228
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:21.870
Dr Jameson: Nine score was

1229
01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:25.680
Dr Jameson: 12 and get seven eight.

1230
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:38.490
Dr Jameson: So it's a 36 year old gentleman who's been treated with Suboxone since November 2019 at a local

1231
01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:43.890
Dr Jameson: treatment program period. He started at 16 milligrams a day.

1232
01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:47.010
Dr Jameson: But has

1233
01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:52.380
Dr Jameson: Titles traded himself tapered himself down

1234
01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:59.100
Dr Jameson: To one milligram twice to two milligrams a day. Basically, most recently.

1235
01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:06.180
Dr Jameson: Period, he's used to his previous prescription

1236
01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.810
Dr Jameson: And supplemented that with

1237
01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:13.620
Dr Jameson: Additional supply he's

1238
01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:23.640
Dr Jameson: Purchased on this on the street illicitly and borrowed from a friend. Most recently, he did. He does report. He felt

1239
01:53:25.110 --> 01:53:27.270
Dr Jameson: Much better at four milligrams a day.

1240
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:31.710
Dr Jameson: He does want to taper off completely.

1241
01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:41.220
Dr Jameson: At some point, period. He was attending weekly groups and twice monthly counseling appointments at his previous program.

1242
01:53:42.510 --> 01:54:02.040
Dr Jameson: He was previously taking boost bar for anxiety, but stop that on his own about within the past month he hasn't noticed any change in his anxiety, but he has noticed less palpitations, so he's feeling better off the loose bar, at least from a physical standpoint.

1243
01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.940
Dr Jameson: I updated his asthma history meds and stuff.

1244
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:23.580
Dr Jameson: Review systems. He has body aches, headaches, fatigue, insomnia,

1245
01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:35.880
Dr Jameson: otherwise normal are negative mental status is normal physical exam is normal for you d severe

1246
01:54:40.230 --> 01:54:41.100
Dr Jameson: Plan.

1247
01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.570
Dr Jameson: Number one. Number two, nicotine.

1248
01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:50.790
Dr Jameson: Tobacco use

1249
01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:05.640
Dr Jameson: Plan patient has already had success with

1250
01:55:07.110 --> 01:55:09.210
Dr Jameson: Suboxone through a local clinic.

1251
01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:37.410
Dr Jameson: He does seem to be having some withdrawal symptoms at its current dose. So we agree that a 2.5 film twice a day is a better

1252
01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:43.530
Dr Jameson: Place to start period. I didn't order a random noise report this most recent

1253
01:55:44.970 --> 01:55:46.440
Dr Jameson: Prescription Phil was

1254
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:50.730
Dr Jameson: February 27 of this year.

1255
01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:12.600
Dr Jameson: Number one. Number two will initiate the remainder of our program with a bio psychosocial evaluation. We're going to obtain copies of his more recent lab work.

1256
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:17.160
Dr Jameson: And if not available, then he'll go for a set of labs.

1257
01:56:18.450 --> 01:56:29.640
Dr Jameson: Next number we're going to do a med check in three days to follow up on this dose and patients going to join my Tuesday 10:30am group.

1258
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.210
Dr Jameson: Next number

1259
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:43.110
Dr Jameson: Discussed potential side effects.

1260
01:56:45.930 --> 01:56:49.350
Dr Jameson: Risk of precipitated withdraw mechanism of action.

1261
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:56.280
Dr Jameson: overall philosophy of our program and specifically regarding tapering

1262
01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:06.270
Dr Jameson: Period. In this case, I think this is not a long enough treatment period to

1263
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:09.450
Dr Jameson: Successfully

1264
01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:12.120
Dr Jameson: Address underlying

1265
01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:19.350
Dr Jameson: Mindset coping skills and other factors.

1266
01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:27.990
Dr Jameson: Known to be important for long term recovery and patient seems agreeable to

1267
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:35.910
Dr Jameson: Postpone any further plans for taper for the foreseeable future, for the time being.

1268
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:40.890
Dr Jameson: I did congratulate him on his

1269
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:49.830
Dr Jameson: efforts at smoking cessation, as well as discontinuing where I want to use just the other day.

1270
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.080
Dr Jameson: Hopefully this this

1271
01:57:56.490 --> 01:58:00.690
Dr Jameson: The determination, he has shown to do this will serve him well.

1272
01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.450
Dr Jameson: In general, period.

1273
01:58:10.230 --> 01:58:15.990
Dr Jameson: I did not address the smoking cessation, per se, today, but this is something else, we will

1274
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:23.220
Dr Jameson: Address once we get his Suboxone dose stabilized.

1275
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:29.130
Dr Jameson: I did send a prescription for an AR can to have for safety reasons.

1276
01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:33.750
Dr Jameson: In the household household for safety reasons.

1277
01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.150
Dr Jameson: Discussed the

1278
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:42.870
Dr Jameson: Risk of return to use no risk of death and overdose, they don't

1279
01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:45.300
Dr Jameson: They overdose.

1280
01:58:50.490 --> 01:58:55.920
Dr Jameson: I guess I'm at the top somewhere we should we should note that this this visit was

1281
01:58:59.100 --> 01:58:59.940
Dr Jameson: Accomplished

1282
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:04.110
Dr Jameson: Largely in the, in the presence of the patient's mother.

1283
01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:10.680
Dr Jameson: And that more than 50% of the visit was spent counseling.

1284
01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:13.500
Dr Jameson: Already details regarding

1285
01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.140
Dr Jameson: The details of the subject of that.

1286
01:59:23.370 --> 01:59:25.590
