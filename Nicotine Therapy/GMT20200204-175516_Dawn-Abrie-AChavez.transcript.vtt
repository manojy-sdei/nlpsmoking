00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.040
Galaxy J7 Crown: Went back to Espanola to my own town and

18
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.470
Galaxy J7 Crown: I was on the program over there but I moved back to Farmington and there's not too many doctors around here.

19
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.650
Okay.

24
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.870
Galaxy J7 Crown: Are they

29
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.050
Dawn Abriel: Why do you take the subway text.

30
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.530
Galaxy J7 Crown: Because I had just barely start got off the opiates and wasn't often too long. So my doctor prescribed me those

31
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.990
Dawn Abriel: I mean, said the text is the medicine without in the lock zone so that I don't think you were

32
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.600
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, other than this last script. Every time else you've been on Suboxone

33
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.620
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, working plus in the lock selling so um

34
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.980
Galaxy J7 Crown: Yeah, I don't mind because this last script was the 12 he gave me the 12

35
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.190
Galaxy J7 Crown: Of the of the Suboxone

36
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.490
Galaxy J7 Crown: Which I always find that those just

Galaxy J7 Crown: I just have nothing in today's my last day they discharged me today from that other connect

38
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.750
Okay.

39
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.040
Dawn Abriel: So you had medicine for today.

40
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.440
Galaxy J7 Crown: Know what this morning. I have had mine, but not, I don't have known for this afternoon or tomorrow.

41
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.330
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so

42
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.150
Dawn Abriel: Why are you, why do you take it more than once a day.

43
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.230
Galaxy J7 Crown: I take two to the Monday.

44
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.500
Dawn Abriel: First thing in the morning, you put two strips under your tongue.

45
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.100
Galaxy J7 Crown: No, I take one in the morning, and one that can that three o'clock.

46
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.780
Galaxy J7 Crown: Okay, so

47
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.480
Dawn Abriel: That's nice. How the medicine was made.

48
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.250
Galaxy J7 Crown: No, no.

49
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.510
Galaxy J7 Crown: Medicine.

50
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.310
Galaxy J7 Crown: In the mornings. Right, right.

51
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.690
Dawn Abriel: You take both of them in the morning. Otherwise, you don't get enough medicine in your system for you to know.

52
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:23.910
Dawn Abriel: How long it's gonna last for 24 hours because the medicine was designed to last 36 hours. So most people feel they don't feel a whole maybe a little different. After 24 but they're not in full withdrawal at 24 hours.

53
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.840
Galaxy J7 Crown: So,

54
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.360
Dawn Abriel: If you're taking that much medicine.

55
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.890
Dawn Abriel: But you're spreading it out. You're not getting the full effect of the medicine.

56
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.840
Galaxy J7 Crown: Okay, so I was never, I never knew that I was always told to take in three times a day. The eight

57
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.630
Dawn Abriel: Wow. Yeah, no, that's, that's not how the medicine was designed

58
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.820
Dawn Abriel: So,

59
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.100
Dawn Abriel: So what we don't know is really

60
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.820
Dawn Abriel: How much

61
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.740
Dawn Abriel: So you were going to the Tuesday night group right

62
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.940
Dawn Abriel: Yes. And you were seeing Jessica as your therapist.

63
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.390
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Yeah. Do you want to go back to that.

64
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.030
Galaxy J7 Crown: Arrangement. Yes.

65
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.450
Dawn Abriel: I think we can do that, although

66
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:27.030
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I think, Jessica. Let me look for sure. I'm not sure that Jessica is in the Tuesday night group.

67
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.950
Dawn Abriel: But I can quickly find out

68
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.400
A little

69
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.760
Dawn Abriel: Okay, there's patients group assignment.

70
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.500

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.860
Dawn Abriel: And you're welcome to come be there.

79
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.610
Dawn Abriel: We actually need a few more people in it.

80
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.580
Dawn Abriel: But that way, you could be with her.

81
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.840
Yeah.

82
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.070
Galaxy J7 Crown: Yeah.

83
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.420
Dawn Abriel: That's right. She knows your history. Okay, then let's put you on

84
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:07.290
Dawn Abriel: Monday. Now I gotta tell you when you're with me as the doctor, you will taper. You will not stay on that high dose that is so dangerous.

85
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.660
Dawn Abriel: To be at that high dose for so long.

86
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.460
Galaxy J7 Crown: I know you we have discussed that the last time you were going to start that

87
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:26.610
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, but you you went to a different doctor and and and most doctors don't do what I do. I just want you to have a heads up if you're with me. You will taper.

88
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.870
Galaxy J7 Crown: That's good.

89
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.950
Okay.

90
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:38.280
Dawn Abriel: But first we're going to get you stable and since you've been on 24 I'll probably put you back on that.

91
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.350
Dawn Abriel: For a week.

92
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.110
Dawn Abriel: And then, then we'll start very gently tapering you down.

93
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.820
Galaxy J7 Crown: Okay.

94
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.880

95
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.570

96
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.830
Galaxy J7 Crown: No. Just one second. Yeah. The second time. Yeah.

97
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.660
Dawn Abriel: I thought so. I didn't think

98
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.430
This damn

99
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.350

Galaxy J7 Crown: And I've been in

103
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:29.490
Galaxy J7 Crown: The past. I was getting depressed there for a while too because I lost my house and

104
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.670

Galaxy J7 Crown: I'm getting back to

106
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.680
Galaxy J7 Crown: Where it was

107
00:08:47.610 --> 00:09:12.660
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you know, I, I have seen many hundreds now of people and people like yourself who started using at such a young age. It just takes a long time to get their brain back up to speed. So that life makes sense to you without drugs.

108
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.280
Galaxy J7 Crown: And then I was incarcerated for a long time too. Yeah, yeah.

109
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.810
Galaxy J7 Crown: So that you got

110
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:35.700
Dawn Abriel: held you back. Yeah. So I just hope you're really patient with yourself and really allow the time you know you can be with Jessica and make appointments with her every week because you're going to need it.

111
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.220
Dawn Abriel: To catch up.

112
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.460
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever been hospitalized for a mental illness.

113
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.900
No.

114
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.000
Dawn Abriel: And I'm assuming your stress level right now is pretty high.

115
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:04.020
Dawn Abriel: Yes, and is it economic and health and social and

116
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.560
Galaxy J7 Crown: Yes. Everything I even get like shaky. Sometimes I pick a given my voice.

117
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.320
Dawn Abriel: And your self esteem. Your opinion of yourself.

118
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.190
Galaxy J7 Crown: It's been pretty low.

119
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.080
Dawn Abriel: So,

120
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:42.900
Dawn Abriel: It any new medical problems. What I have listed here from before is anxiety bipolar depression hepatitis C, and you still haven't had the hep C treated

121
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.010
Know,

122
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:53.670
Dawn Abriel: And high blood pressure, do you are you still taking the quantity twice a day for that.

123
00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:10.320
Galaxy J7 Crown: I haven't been taking it. I haven't had my doctor. Like I said, I just barely got this doctor back, but I hope so. He has started giving me stuff forum for because I had something. There's a lot to my my leg got an infection on it.

124
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:21.120
Galaxy J7 Crown: He had given me some Gabby patterns and some other stuff to help me for a while, but I didn't go back to him. I moved so

125
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.710
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so do you plan on staying in Farmington now.

126
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.240

130
00:11:53.850 --> 00:12:03.840
Dawn Abriel: And eventually it will disease, your liver so badly that you'll need a either a liver transplant or you'll die from it.

Galaxy J7 Crown: Oh, just couple times not maybe like just like two, three times. Hmm.

331
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.670
Dawn Abriel: Well, most of the time when

332
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.560
Dawn Abriel: People have been IV drug users they

333
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:34.260
Dawn Abriel: They ruin their veins to the point where the blood doesn't flow back. Normally, and it makes their fingertips go numb. So that's the most common reason you might have some other reason for it, but

334
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.620
Galaxy J7 Crown: No, I still have all my veins on a dangerous. Good.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.690
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I'll give you some more.

352
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.000
Dawn Abriel: And remember the

353
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:08.460
Dawn Abriel: Bright heart health has occurred address for us to send the urine drug screen to

Galaxy J7 Crown: Yes.

355
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:16.470
Dawn Abriel: And you remember how to do that. You don't open it, you go to virtual clinic and you say, Hey, I got this thing. What do I do

356
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.580
Yes.

357
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.470
Dawn Abriel: And

358
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.630
Dawn Abriel: We're going to change this to Monday night.

359
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.100
Dawn Abriel: Wow, I'm really just a great speller here today.

360
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:39.330
Dawn Abriel: Never real good on a good day. So sad. All right, and

361
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.910
Dawn Abriel: And

362
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.890
Dawn Abriel: You told them the pharmacy, you want to use in Farmington right

363
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.540
Galaxy J7 Crown: I don't know if they could use that pharmacy, can they use it. It's called care.

364
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.520
Galaxy J7 Crown: Pharmacy.

365
00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:04.440
Dawn Abriel: If they'll let me. Why don't you stay on the line. Stay on with me and we'll try to do it right now. And that way you will

366
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.030
Know,

367
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.920
Dawn Abriel: So because you haven't been taking it correctly.

368
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.530
Dawn Abriel: I'd like you to start by taking

369
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:34.860
Dawn Abriel: Two and a half strips of the eight mil of ground instead of every because my guess is that that's going to work for you. And if not,

370
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:52.290
Dawn Abriel: You know, I'll see you, you know, on Monday night, and we can adjust it or we can you can let me know, because I'll send you an email and you can email me on Thursday or Friday and say you know it's it's not lasting 24 hours or whatever you need to communicate.

371
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.250
OK.

372
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.820
Dawn Abriel: OK. So I'm going to say

373
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.810
Dawn Abriel: 2.5 milligrams

374
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:10.950
Dawn Abriel: First thing in the morning. And remember, you can't smoke or eat or drink because if you smoke smoking makes all your blood vessels cramp down

375
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:17.940
Dawn Abriel: So then the blood vessels under your tongue that are in that absorb the medicine, they can't do their job.

376
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:26.550
Dawn Abriel: So no smoking before makes it really makes a huge difference for people, they think, Oh, I'm not getting my medicine and it's because

377
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.440
Galaxy J7 Crown: You're smoking.

378
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.960
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah

379
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:38.160
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so two and a half is 20 milligrams. Let's see, how are you doing that.

380
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.110
Dawn Abriel: And

381
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.490
Dawn Abriel: That will 20

382
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.210
Dawn Abriel: Let's give you 18 strips.

383
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:57.360
Dawn Abriel: But checking with me later in the week by email. And if we need to get on the zoom and talk about a difference. We can do that too. Okay.

384
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.400
Dawn Abriel: Oh well. Oh.

385
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:19.440
Dawn Abriel: Oh,

386
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.760
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it's going to the right. Let's see. Let's see if it goes through it's

387
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.360
Dawn Abriel: The care coordinators already put it in there. I thought I was going to have to do it by hand.

388
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.440
Okay.

389
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:41.250
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so if they accept electronic prescriptions.

390
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:45.720
Dawn Abriel: I would recommend as soon as we're off that you call them and ask them if

391
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:52.110
Dawn Abriel: An electronic script came through and if not, go back to the virtual clinic and have them get ahold of me.

392
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.330
Galaxy J7 Crown: Okay, right.

393
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.910
Dawn Abriel: So,

394
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.070
Dawn Abriel: You have any questions.

395
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:03.270
No.

396
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:12.000
Galaxy J7 Crown: We'll see how this works for me this summer that give back. I haven't good because i know i don't have no more for tomorrow or nothing.

And

408
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.470
I think the

409
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:19.830
Dawn Abriel: History of present illness is the same. The only thing that needs to be changed is under medical history, if you'll say, hypertension, not on any medicines at this time.

410
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.140
Dawn Abriel: And

411
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.230

Dawn Abriel: Everything else is the same. So his assessment is

416
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.060
