00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.320

110
00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:02.790

111
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:03.660

112
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:14.790

117
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:47.010

120
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.370

134
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:45.330

135
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:54.030
Michael Flores: I would say like thinking about things around the house or doing yard work but say

136
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.380
Michael Flores: While talking back, you know, he would hit us with the bell.

137
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.360
Michael Flores: Went to normal things, you know,

138
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.770
Michael Flores: But I mean,

139
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:12.330
Michael Flores: As normal we had close. We had food we played sports all played all sports and it's pretty good. I mean, there's nothing I can complain about

Michael Flores: Okay, but they did. They did.

141
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:20.670

145
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.630
Michael Flores: And then once she got the new fiance, she was happy and she treated her right

146
00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:41.010
Michael Flores: I can see the way

147

KayDee Lassle: Hi, how are you

275
01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.540
Lavana Oriley: I'm good, thanks. How are you doing,

276
01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:46.740
KayDee Lassle: It took me a minute to get in because they wanted to update my credit card and all that fun stuff. So it took me a minute.

277
01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.450
Lavana Oriley: Okay.

278
01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.310
KayDee Lassle: Sorry about that.

279
01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.470
Lavana Oriley: No worries. No worries.

280
01:32:01.410 --> 01:32:01.920
Lavana Oriley: Let's go.

281
01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:04.380
Lavana Oriley: What's going on with you.

282
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:10.380
KayDee Lassle: Not much, not much. I just kind of just wanted to have one of these

283
01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:10.800
Lavana Oriley: Because I

284
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:18.330
KayDee Lassle: Had one yet. And I felt like it was kind of needed because the only thing that I get to do is our group once a week.

285
01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:26.160
KayDee Lassle: You know, and sometimes I miss it because of work which rare. It's rare, but sometimes I do have to miss it because I'm you know overtime or something. So I

286
01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:26.580
Lavana Oriley: Just thought

287
01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:40.890
KayDee Lassle: Was good because like lately I've just kind of been thinking about using more or not even like I'm gonna do it, but just thinking about it. So one would be beneficial for me right now.

288
01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:48.870
Lavana Oriley: Okay, so my question is, do you have a strong support group around you.

289
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:54.930
KayDee Lassle: I do, I do. Yes. There's awesome I do, I do. There's also

290
01:32:56.310 --> 01:33:01.890
KayDee Lassle: People that I don't hang out with really much anymore or associate with because of those reasons.

291
01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:03.360
KayDee Lassle: But

292
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:13.320
KayDee Lassle: It's still it's always going to be around. And that's always going to be there. So whether I know someone's doing it or not, or so, you know, that type of thing. I've told

293
01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:22.710
KayDee Lassle: Like my my addiction was pills. You know, it was narcotics. So I that I used to like get them from, you know, don't, don't message me don't write me. I don't want them or

294
01:33:23.610 --> 01:33:39.030
KayDee Lassle: Sometimes I still get these random messages from people or people are talking about it or I know that somebody has them or just anything like that, you know, so that I think it's just with everything else going on all the sudden I just been thinking about it.

295
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:39.900
Lavana Oriley: Mm hmm.

296
01:33:40.410 --> 01:33:49.620
KayDee Lassle: In the beginning, I didn't, I really didn't. I was like, totally fine with it and then all of a sudden within like the last month, I want to say, I just, it's been in the back of my mind a lot more

297
01:33:51.030 --> 01:34:00.660
Lavana Oriley: So as far as the Suboxone goes. Do you feel that that is kind of curbing your urges and fires and

298
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:07.710
KayDee Lassle: I don't necessarily think that I want to take one or you know whatever it

299
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:08.220
Lavana Oriley: Is but I

300
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:20.040
KayDee Lassle: Am at a point where I would say if it wasn't for Suboxone right now I've probably my if I wasn't this. I've been clean since November 20 and I have not once relapsed

301
01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:20.490
So,

302
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:23.160
KayDee Lassle: makes me really happy, you know,

303
01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.390
Lavana Oriley: Yes, yes.

304
01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:41.010
KayDee Lassle: So I'm trying. I think for the longest time I didn't look at it as like an addiction like mess or hair, you know, like all these other drugs like a lot of people in our group or addicted to meth or something different. So yeah, I it took me a long time to realize that my story is not different.

305
01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:44.490
KayDee Lassle: From substance that I was using so

306
01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:45.000
Lavana Oriley: Definitely

307
01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:51.450
KayDee Lassle: I really mean recovery. I really am an addict and it took me a long, long time to actually realize that

308
01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.990
Lavana Oriley: Yeah. Well, and I think that's pretty typical because most

309
01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:55.920
KayDee Lassle: People think

310
01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.530
Lavana Oriley: I don't have a problem. Yeah.

311
01:34:58.830 --> 01:35:16.410
Lavana Oriley: And that the people who are kind of pointing their finger at me saying you have a problem. It's their problem, you know, and you try to deflect it and it's you know it's typical to be in denial until you know. Finally, the drugs out of your system and then you realize

312
01:35:17.130 --> 01:35:18.690
KayDee Lassle: And then seeing other people

313
01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.860
KayDee Lassle: Or you know my other friends that were doing it and still do or

314
01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.540
Lavana Oriley: And then of course you know it's

315
01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.120
Lavana Oriley: It's impossible to hang. Oh, okay.

316
01:35:55.410 --> 01:35:56.130
KayDee Lassle: Hey still there.

317
01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:57.270
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, I'm still here.

318
01:35:58.410 --> 01:36:00.900
KayDee Lassle: I've never gotten a phone call little group that was here.

319
01:36:01.230 --> 01:36:02.550
Lavana Oriley: Yeah. So what yeah yeah

320
01:36:02.610 --> 01:36:06.780
Lavana Oriley: So what happens is you just freeze. You just like that. Yeah.

321
01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:10.680
KayDee Lassle: I agree on either. Yeah, I figured it out.

322
01:36:11.610 --> 01:36:14.280
KayDee Lassle: I was like trying to this to show you that there were so

323
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:24.000
Lavana Oriley: Is there any way that you can like prevent phone calls from coming through on your phone while you're on zoom

324
01:36:24.930 --> 01:36:31.200
KayDee Lassle: I'm gonna look at it. Yeah, I've never everybody usually knows but Wednesday. Everybody knows from six to seven.

325
01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.220
Lavana Oriley: Don't call you.

326
01:36:32.490 --> 01:36:34.620
Lavana Oriley: Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly.

327
01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.980
KayDee Lassle: So I think that's probably what happened, but I'll look into that.

328
01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:40.620
Lavana Oriley: Definitely, yeah. I was just wondering about that, if that's

329
01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:45.930
KayDee Lassle: Possible. I work out of Verizon store. So you think I would know that. Oh, you

330
01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:48.510
Lavana Oriley: You got that smart. You can figure that out.

331
01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:49.650
Lavana Oriley: For sure. Yeah.

332
01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:57.810
Lavana Oriley: So as far as going to meetings before all this coronal lockdown business. Did you and

333
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:59.850
Lavana Oriley: 12 step meetings.

334
01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.230
KayDee Lassle: Know the like What's hard about

335
01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:19.200
KayDee Lassle: My I guess situation is I do work eight to five so that limits a lot. However, there might be an I do live in a really small town, and I know that there's an NA group because I've heard of it. I used to, you know, I've known people that have gone before.

336
01:37:20.670 --> 01:37:24.330
KayDee Lassle: Don't know if they offer any after five because when Marcia was in our group.

337
01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:29.310
KayDee Lassle: She isn't always lives here to she's always telling me, Oh, come with me there at nine in the morning.

338
01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:30.990
Lavana Oriley: I can't do that. No.

339
01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:44.760
KayDee Lassle: Another thing too is with my job, everything that I'm doing with this is so confidential that if I were to go to Na, if I could, in the end, someone was, you know, happened to be a client or I ran into them in the office or

340
01:37:45.150 --> 01:37:49.830
KayDee Lassle: They decided not to honor the confidentiality and told somebody like it should.

341
01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.750
Lavana Oriley: Be an issue, it would be

342
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:53.040
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, it would

343
01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:53.490
KayDee Lassle: Be a

344
01:37:53.670 --> 01:37:57.690
KayDee Lassle: Big issue because my work has

345
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:03.750
KayDee Lassle: Not to me like directly, they don't they don't really know, but I've been told that

346
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:08.340
KayDee Lassle: Even they tell us this. I'm like our new trainings and all that, if you

347
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:21.870
KayDee Lassle: Have a problem, they call it or an addiction or whatever and you seek the help and everything they will send you you know privately and all this and they won't tell anyone. And you won't lose your job and you can come back to work.

348
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:29.280
KayDee Lassle: Like for me, myself, I definitely like I don't need to go anywhere. I don't need to go to rehab and personal

349
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:31.680
KayDee Lassle: I guess.

350
01:38:31.890 --> 01:38:37.470
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, I know, I understand, you'd rather not get out and I get it. It's a small town young

351
01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:48.120
KayDee Lassle: Pianist last year when I was really bad into my addiction. I had a friend. She was one of my best friends and something happened and she hated me and she called my work.

352
01:38:49.170 --> 01:38:57.330
KayDee Lassle: And she told them that I was doing pills and I was a drug addict and that if I call in sick. That means I'm withdrawing and I can't come to work.

353
01:38:57.510 --> 01:39:00.660
Lavana Oriley: Oh my gosh, she was really mad at you.

354
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:01.890
KayDee Lassle: She said,

355
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:14.730
KayDee Lassle: Oh, you know, she shouldn't be able to to control all these people's lives if she's under the influence and just all these things she did so, of course, they got brought up and

356
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:22.050
KayDee Lassle: My supervisor called me, and she didn't believe it and of course I had to lie and tell her it wasn't taking pills. But the thing is,

357
01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:26.490
KayDee Lassle: I was never that out of the network. I was never that, you know, high at work.

358
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:32.250
KayDee Lassle: But that whole thing just scared the living shit out of me.

359
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:34.770
KayDee Lassle: Oh yeah, when you do that.

360
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:41.340
KayDee Lassle: You know, something that also makes me worried about if I did go to a group, but just on this way. I don't even know if there is one.

361
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:42.000
KayDee Lassle: Outside of

362
01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.490
KayDee Lassle: That offering after five o'clock.

363
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:50.820
Lavana Oriley: Well now, everything's online all the NA meetings meetings, everything's online.

364
01:39:51.210 --> 01:40:03.870
KayDee Lassle: And I'm not opposed to doing an NA meeting online. I think that's something that I could you know really benefit from does it do you know like a local. Or if I could just join a random ones.

365
01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:12.780
Lavana Oriley: I think you can join a meeting from anywhere in the in the United States. Actually, I don't think it has to be local.

366
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:23.550
KayDee Lassle: Few people in ours that live in Crescent City. And to be honest, I don't know if she knows this, but Shana and I, we weren't in place and I don't even know.

367
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:27.990
KayDee Lassle: Really, I don't even. She's the yeah she will. Okay, so we both right.

368
01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.210
Lavana Oriley: I thought Shana was a delivery person.

369
01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:33.960
KayDee Lassle: No shin. That's her name right Shana Harris Shanna

370
01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:36.210
Lavana Oriley: Shanna Eric yes she deliver

371
01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:36.870
Lavana Oriley: But she was a

372
01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:42.630
KayDee Lassle: delivery person. He works for the county, but she's the custodian of all the county buildings.

373
01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:53.190
KayDee Lassle: And so she comes to my work. Sometimes we don't work in the same building. Typically, but sometimes we do and like I've seen her at work after I've seen her in group.

374
01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.840
KayDee Lassle: And we don't we don't say that. But it's just even that scares the shit out of me.

375
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:58.560
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, I mean,

376
01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.910
Lavana Oriley: Yeah yeah

377
01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.110
KayDee Lassle: So, and then

378
01:41:01.410 --> 01:41:01.890
Lavana Oriley: We record.

379
01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:04.980
Lavana Oriley: All you tell she recognized you

380
01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.320
KayDee Lassle: I'm not 100% sure I always say hi. I've always said hi to her prior

381
01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:15.540
KayDee Lassle: But, you know, you know, I say, hi, how's your day because what it is. Honestly, too, is

382
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:26.490
KayDee Lassle: I don't want this to come off wrong but it almost makes me feel kind of bad, because what she's doing is taking my trash or what she's doing is you don't. I mean, and her job is just as much as important in mind, but I don't

383
01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:27.030
Lavana Oriley: Ever

384
01:41:27.150 --> 01:41:30.840
KayDee Lassle: Feel like I am like I'm in group to but love

385
01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:31.350
KayDee Lassle: Reading

386
01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.210
Lavana Oriley: Like right like you're superior to her.

387
01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:33.870
KayDee Lassle: I don't

388
01:41:33.930 --> 01:41:38.280
KayDee Lassle: Ever have to have it so I just say hi smile asked her how her day is and

389
01:41:38.490 --> 01:41:41.190
KayDee Lassle: You know, so I don't know if she recognizes me

390
01:41:41.190 --> 01:41:41.760
Lavana Oriley: Rio.

391
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:43.500
KayDee Lassle: I come from here, you know,

392
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:44.820
Lavana Oriley: Wow, okay.

393
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:46.110
KayDee Lassle: Pretty interesting.

394
01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:50.430
KayDee Lassle: Lives in Crescent City so me Kyle Shana Marcia

395
01:41:51.450 --> 01:41:52.020
KayDee Lassle: Um,

396
01:41:52.110 --> 01:41:54.540
Lavana Oriley: I don't know. I think there's more there's other people that are doing

397
01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:57.510
Lavana Oriley: Some of my other groups that are that live in Crescent City.

398
01:41:57.630 --> 01:42:00.660
KayDee Lassle: So it's just like it gets a little scary.

399
01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:02.850
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, no, I, I

400
01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:06.960
Lavana Oriley: Drinking two different drinks a yellow one and a green one.

401
01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:07.650
You know,

402
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:09.750
KayDee Lassle: It's all the same.

403
01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:10.290
Oh,

404
01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.320
KayDee Lassle: No, the cup is green.

405
01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:24.150
Lavana Oriley: Oh, OK. OK. No, yeah, you do have some constraints that you have to kind of stay in, but

406
01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:36.720
Lavana Oriley: In your case, you know, I mean, you would definitely benefit from a sponsor you know somebody that you know, that is, you know, trustworthy and can offer you guidance and

407
01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.620
KayDee Lassle: Being in that's the thing, too, is I've always heard, and I know sponsors, I

408
01:42:40.650 --> 01:42:45.180
KayDee Lassle: Know people that have sponsors. But what exactly does a sponsor you

409
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:53.880
Lavana Oriley: Sponsor is like the trailblazer that has gone ahead before you on the 50 mile trail.

410
01:42:54.300 --> 01:43:02.130
Lavana Oriley: Okay sponsor can guide you along the trail and and you know give you little hints about, okay, if your

411
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:16.110
Lavana Oriley: If your feet are are getting sore, do you put most skin on your feet, those are little hiking secrets. So you get little, little secrets of how to hang in there, little secrets of what to do if you're thinking about relapse.

412
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.480
Lavana Oriley: A sponsor somebody who has, you know, maybe two or three years under

413
01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:31.650
Lavana Oriley: And they have that experience of going before you on the trail and they can help with guidance.

414
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:32.490
KayDee Lassle: Okay.

415
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:34.230
KayDee Lassle: That makes total sense.

416
01:43:34.410 --> 01:43:42.030
Lavana Oriley: Yeah. And so, you know, a lot of times addicts don't trust anybody. They're at a point where they can't trust anybody.

417
01:43:42.600 --> 01:44:04.200
Lavana Oriley: And usually that sponsor is the first person they begin to trust again and if if it's a sponsor that you can relate to that you feel like you kind of maybe have the same story. It's kind of comforting to have somebody that first of all the sponsors saying I volunteered to help you.

418
01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:23.340
Lavana Oriley: Item call me in the middle of the night. I am here to help you. And you know, part of the 12 STEP program is addicts help addicts and even the person that has maybe 2030 years sobriety. It still it's a win win it still helps them to help a newcomer

419
01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:33.780
Lavana Oriley: Mm hmm. Anytime you're talking program, you know, everybody wins. So sponsors are people that volunteer to help the people who are new.

420
01:44:34.890 --> 01:44:39.090
Lavana Oriley: You know, take somebody under their wing help them through the steps.

421
01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:55.050
Lavana Oriley: A lot of sponsors, you know, the they'll kind of say, call me every day or, you know, check in with me at a certain time just, you know, whether you're having a good day or a bad day. And it's that constant contact and

422
01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:04.710
Lavana Oriley: That's kind of the bridge that takes you over the gap. You know when you're, you're telling me you're thinking about, um,

423
01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:16.740
Lavana Oriley: You know, should I or shouldn't I are these thoughts are in my head. What, how does a sponsor handle that situation. What do sponsors do in that you know type of situation so

424
01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:27.750
Lavana Oriley: Really are very beneficial and I always recommend that you know, not only do you have to have a good strong support system.

425
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:45.240
Lavana Oriley: But one particular person that you that knows what you're going through has gone through it themselves. And they are the ones that you really end up depending leaning on because they kind of like I said they've they've gotten there first. So, there

426
01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:51.540
Lavana Oriley: With the masters and the PhD and you're still kind of like in high school, sort of speak.

427
01:45:51.870 --> 01:46:03.540
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, and that's totally that makes sense and it totally like of course I had an idea that was but that makes it all kind of come together and make sense. And I'm just kind of wondering how

428
01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.240
KayDee Lassle: How you go about

429
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:07.620
KayDee Lassle: Finding

430
01:46:07.890 --> 01:46:10.500
KayDee Lassle: You know someone that is going to do that so

431
01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:12.090
Lavana Oriley: I kill and especially

432
01:46:12.090 --> 01:46:15.750
Lavana Oriley: Right now, when there's no kind of in person meeting and

433
01:46:16.230 --> 01:46:19.560
KayDee Lassle: Just a private person or is it through a group like you know

434
01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:32.850
Lavana Oriley: You find them in at 12 step groups. So, you know, any meeting, Amy. To me, addiction is addiction is addiction doesn't really hurt, you know, um, but I know a lot of

435
01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:41.040
Lavana Oriley: You know, like the old timers in a they they don't like anybody in their meetings that you know are addicted to anything other than alcohol but

436
01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:44.940
KayDee Lassle: It's crazy, because no matter what the substances.

437
01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.100
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, still addicted like

438
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:55.950
KayDee Lassle: Saying, in the beginning, is it took me a very long time to say, oh, I was addicted. Oh.

439
01:46:56.070 --> 01:47:02.850
KayDee Lassle: I'm in recovery. I'm in a program like it took me a while to realize it wasn't just going to be, oh hey guess what I stopped taking pills.

440
01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:03.630
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, that's

441
01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:03.990
KayDee Lassle: Not

442
01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:11.310
Lavana Oriley: It does not enough. Yeah. A lot of people, they'll go through seven day detox and they're like, well, I'm done. Okay, but I'm out of here. Yeah.

443
01:47:12.150 --> 01:47:15.240
Lavana Oriley: It's here. This is where the addiction. Yes.

444
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:20.010
KayDee Lassle: And I see I'm starting to really, really, really see that and like understand it, you know.

445
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:27.720
KayDee Lassle: I haven't really been telling anyone I did tell a couple people that like, oh, you know, I kind of been thinking about

446
01:47:28.530 --> 01:47:41.100
KayDee Lassle: You know pills lately, or, oh, this and that. But once I realized I was, you know, really thinking about it, I was like, okay, I need to. And I love group so much but you don't get that one on one.

447
01:47:41.130 --> 01:47:42.210
Lavana Oriley: Yes, yes.

448
01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:43.110
So,

449
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:56.100
KayDee Lassle: And then, yeah, so I was just kind of like, okay, I kind of really, I want to sit myself down and talk to myself, but also talk to you and just kind of, I guess, I don't know, because I'm still so I don't know.

450
01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:56.730
KayDee Lassle: What even

451
01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:02.220
Lavana Oriley: Well, no, and kudos to you to recognize that you needed to talk about this.

452
01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:08.130
Lavana Oriley: Because the worst thing to do is to be having those thoughts and keeping it to yourself.

453
01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:09.150
KayDee Lassle: Yeah.

454
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.510
Lavana Oriley: It's called as a mental relapse. It starts the

455
01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.190
Lavana Oriley: more you think about it, it kind of becomes an obsession.

456
01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:22.020
Lavana Oriley: Exactly. If you don't talk about it. Your views.

457
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:34.200
Lavana Oriley: And it's, it's, it's like a balloon. It's like, you know, if you don't talk about it that balloon just going to keep blowing up and blowing up and then you know you're it's going to be devastation.

458
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.500
KayDee Lassle: Like for a second I thought about it, and I'm like, Okay.

459
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:53.700
KayDee Lassle: I caught myself thinking, what's the worst that's gonna happen. You're gonna, you know, you could take one and you know whatever blah, blah, blah. You already have your soapbox and you'll be fine. You don't, you know, you won't take any more. And then I thought about it. I'm like, I know me.

460
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:54.420
Lavana Oriley: Yeah.

461
01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:57.090
KayDee Lassle: I'm going to take one I'm going to love it.

462
01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.260
Lavana Oriley: It's an ever another

463
01:48:58.260 --> 01:48:59.880
Lavana Oriley: One another one. Right, right.

464
01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:07.620
KayDee Lassle: And I have from November 20 to what almost April 20 that's almost six, six months clean

465
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:11.100
KayDee Lassle: I almost have six months, I've never made it six months.

466
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.230
Lavana Oriley: I've never right, awesome. Wow.

467
01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.460
Lavana Oriley: Okay. So number one, you must be doing something right.

468
01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:33.540
Lavana Oriley: Okay, so obviously you have built up some coping skills that have been working and, you know, kudos to you for putting those in place. So when we're dealing with the mind, it's, it's a matter of distraction.

469
01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.640
Lavana Oriley: beer scene Cesar Milan. The dog whisperer.

470
01:49:40.710 --> 01:49:42.180
KayDee Lassle: I knew

471
01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:45.030
KayDee Lassle: Because I've seen some stuff like that.

472
01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:57.210
Lavana Oriley: Okay, it's a it's a reality. He's and he's not on TV. Now, for some reason, but he was very popular years ago and people who had problematic dogs or dogs at bit

473
01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:57.660
KayDee Lassle: Yeah.

474
01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.520
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, no, I know what you're talking about. I think

475
01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:05.610
Lavana Oriley: Okay. All right, so here's his biggest thing I love Cesar Millan I think he is a dog in his head.

476
01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:08.550
KayDee Lassle: I think I know I think I do. Yeah, I know who you're talking about.

477
01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:22.200
Lavana Oriley: Okay, so he's awesome. I really love them. So what he does is any dog that has bad habits like they just run around in circles or they bark at the front door. When the postman comes and then tear up all the letters, your dog.

478
01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:34.080
Lavana Oriley: Yep. So all these bad behaviors. Here's how he changes. It's so frickin amazing so awesome. First of all, he distracts the dogs.

479
01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:47.040
Lavana Oriley: So when they're, you know, engaging in this behavior, whether dark barking at the post man or running around in circles are biting somebody points their finger in their face. And he goes,

480
01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:58.200
Lavana Oriley: And they stop what they're doing and they look up at him, and in that minute in that distraction. That's when he's able to teach them a new behavior.

481
01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:12.090
Lavana Oriley: And it's all about distraction. So whether you are thinking about, okay, you know, I can just do that one. And the more you allow that thought to overcome your head. The more you give into it.

482
01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.630
KayDee Lassle: Exactly. And that's what I felt like was going to happen.

483
01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:20.040
Lavana Oriley: But I think you're stronger than you.

484
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:22.890
Lavana Oriley: May give yourself credit for and

485
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:29.910
KayDee Lassle: That's always been an issue. I've heard you know that's just me. I'm still figuring that out. I think

486
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:38.520
Lavana Oriley: Yeah. Um, so my, my whole thing is destruction isn't amazing miracle.

487
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:49.410
Lavana Oriley: Because when you're thinking about something that whether it's using or or just doom and gloom. Or, oh my god, what's happening in the world and you know all these

488
01:51:50.130 --> 01:52:06.330
Lavana Oriley: Things it's like hopefully at this point in your recovery warning lights going to go off and say, hey, you're in dangerous territory right now fact yourself go out and take a walk, work on a puzzle.

489
01:52:06.570 --> 01:52:07.620
Lavana Oriley: Write a letter.

490
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:08.910
Lavana Oriley: call somebody

491
01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:21.840
Lavana Oriley: Like 1000 different things that you can do for distraction. And once you're distracted from that thought for about 10 or 15 minutes

492
01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:32.070
Lavana Oriley: pretty much going to dissipate. But the more you give that thought fuel and continue to think about it, it becomes an obsession and like you're blowing bloom.

493
01:52:32.850 --> 01:52:33.570
And man, so

494
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:35.220
KayDee Lassle: Yeah.

495
01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:48.930
Lavana Oriley: And district. It's such a little thing. I'm telling you, think of Caesar Milan and, you know, you go to the dog and the dog stops whatever there. He never punish them. You never hits them. You never

496
01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:57.120
Lavana Oriley: With behavior modification and it's it's pretty amazing. We can do that with our brains.

497
01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:00.570
Lavana Oriley: We have to be able to realize

498
01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:08.550
Lavana Oriley: Territory right now. So what do I need to do. It's not enough just to be yourself.

499
01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:11.430
Lavana Oriley: Okay, Katie. You need to stop thinking like this.

500
01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:20.160
Lavana Oriley: That telling yourself to stop like it's like saying don't look through this whole whatever you do, don't look through this, you're going to look through the whole

501
01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:22.170
KayDee Lassle: Let's. Exactly, yes.

502
01:53:22.710 --> 01:53:34.050
Lavana Oriley: So if distraction is step one, step two is engaged in that distraction go outside, take a walk, whatever watch a movie, read a book.

503
01:53:35.130 --> 01:53:41.940
Lavana Oriley: Cut your nails. I don't care, something that takes your mind off of what you're thinking and

504
01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:52.440
Lavana Oriley: That that thought will dissipate and each time you catch it kind of as you're doing it in the beginning stages, if you can catch it early.

505
01:53:52.980 --> 01:54:02.550
Lavana Oriley: That will become a habit for you and it'll be your go to thing. Okay, I'm thinking about this. I need to go outside, or I need to take a look at. It's going to be

506
01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:06.930
KayDee Lassle: I think that's exactly what I am hoping that it's what

507
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:13.890
KayDee Lassle: Now if that thought pops up or that I think just this conversation are visual and everything is I'm going to think okay

508
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:19.650
KayDee Lassle: You go do something else like you know you thought about that. But, you know, you can think about something else.

509
01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:23.400
KayDee Lassle: Though do exactly exactly the way that you word it and the way that you put it

510
01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.740
KayDee Lassle: Is very, it makes it sink in a lot

511
01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:40.920
Lavana Oriley: Okay. All right. And yeah, don't get down on yourself and you know I'm a loser. And I'm thinking about this, you know. No, because this is very typical especially after you have a few months under your belt. You think you can do one

512
01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:48.780
Lavana Oriley: Mm hmm. It's a recipe for disaster because that just clicks off that addiction in your brain. And it's like, oh,

513
01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:50.220
KayDee Lassle: You're gonna start from square

514
01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:51.180
Lavana Oriley: Yes, and

515
01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.810
KayDee Lassle: Almost for the first time ever, six months in

516
01:54:55.230 --> 01:54:57.090
Lavana Oriley: And that and that's amazing.

517
01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:57.600
KayDee Lassle: Me.

518
01:54:58.050 --> 01:55:02.160
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, I've always I've had friends in the past, who are addicts. I've had family, you know, but

519
01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:06.210
KayDee Lassle: They were bad, they were deep, they were homeless, they were in the swamps, you know, whatever.

520
01:55:06.570 --> 01:55:16.320
KayDee Lassle: And I have a cousin right now. She literally is one of my best friends we grew up together and I lost her for a couple years to the street. She was homeless. She was not. It was really bad and she

521
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:26.670
KayDee Lassle: Finally, she got she went to rehab after she did her rehab or she sat at her jail time. They went to rehab the rehab. She's doing really good and she just got her nine gauge it

522
01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.770
KayDee Lassle: And I was so happy for her and I was celebrating that with her and everyone was celebrating it and then

523
01:55:32.130 --> 01:55:44.880
KayDee Lassle: Part of me kind of couldn't help but think that I don't get to do that and maybe it's not as a big deal because I'm not going to group. I don't have a 90 day chip. I don't have that too. But then again, the other party was like, you don't need the

524
01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:49.680
KayDee Lassle: congratulatory is, you know,

525
01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.540
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, the acclaim. Yeah, yeah.

526
01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:55.650
KayDee Lassle: That you know her struggles were very much known in my family.

527
01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:03.870
KayDee Lassle: They did my family horribly in mind, you know, mine was just kind of kept to myself if I struggled. I was struggling alone.

528
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:07.230
KayDee Lassle: Affected the entire family multiple

529
01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:11.280
KayDee Lassle: So her. I think her recovery and her come back as a lot bigger.

530
01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:17.970
KayDee Lassle: Mm hmm. I had to kind of tell myself. Mine is still relevant. I just don't need it to be so big.

531
01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:26.700
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, my family also knows that I'm planning everything, but I'm not getting 90 day chips. I'm not getting 60 day chips. I'm not going to, you know, all these things and

532
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:27.600
Lavana Oriley: Break when

533
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:34.980
KayDee Lassle: They asked, Well how's. How's it going, but with mine. It was so minimal and so many people didn't know for sure until

534
01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:37.200
Lavana Oriley: We're able to keep it under wraps.

535
01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:40.590
Lavana Oriley: That they were like, Oh my God, oh my God, I hope she doesn't relapse. I

536
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:53.580
KayDee Lassle: Hope you know this is amazing. Like to them. It's just like, you know, if it gets brought up. They're really proud, but to her. She really does deserve that light enough credit because she was in a really dark place. And I never went for, you know,

537
01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:54.090
Lavana Oriley: Over

538
01:56:54.270 --> 01:57:07.230
KayDee Lassle: Boy, I think that's another thing for me is part of me like wants to be able to be like Hey guys, I'm six months clean I'm missing that But mine is very secretive and it can't be publicized so I have a voice with my inner circle and just

539
01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:07.980
Lavana Oriley: Exactly.

540
01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:14.130
KayDee Lassle: And I have to remember that that's okay too. I can share it with group and everyone is so awesome. I can show

541
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:15.390
KayDee Lassle: My friend and my

542
01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:25.830
KayDee Lassle: Parents and my family, you know. So that's one thing that I was realizing, too, is just because mine's different doesn't mean it's not valuable, but also, it doesn't have to be.

543
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:28.140
KayDee Lassle: Such a big thing.

544
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:30.930
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, which is what if I did do a pill.

545
01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:34.290
KayDee Lassle: It would just really waste the entire six months, I just

546
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:45.360
Lavana Oriley: Don't. Yeah. You'd have to just basically start all over. And you know before you even consider that it's like okay let me let me look where I am now.

547
01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:56.130
Lavana Oriley: How far I came what it took for me to withdraw and where I am now and do I want to throw that all away.

548
01:57:56.790 --> 01:58:10.380
Lavana Oriley: And the trust that I've built back up with my family and with my friends and even in myself, do I want to throw that all the way, just for. And you know what, you probably wouldn't even feel the height because you're on Suboxone

549
01:58:10.590 --> 01:58:13.620
Lavana Oriley: Exactly, exactly. Total waste.

550
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:33.060
KayDee Lassle: Exactly and the part I kind of can't help but think it's all of its just still have it because i mean i know that i you know we're honest and stuff. And in my a big huge part of my addiction was I was sorting crushing them up and supporting them. So the habit of chasing the pill.

551
01:58:33.450 --> 01:58:34.860
KayDee Lassle: Going Phil and getting it.

552
01:58:35.010 --> 01:58:38.040
KayDee Lassle: Getting it home, breaking it up, put, you know, putting in a

553
01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:38.820
Lavana Oriley: Ritual

554
01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:39.720
Lavana Oriley: The ritual.

555
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:40.950
KayDee Lassle: It's the habit.

556
01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:43.980
Lavana Oriley: And adding love the ritual even

557
01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:56.700
Lavana Oriley: Just before you even like an addict, that's, you know, Jones and for heroin. The minute he calls his dealer and make that connection and he's on his way over. He's already hyped.

558
01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:57.300
Lavana Oriley: Yeah.

559
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:58.920
KayDee Lassle: Ready garden IS better

560
01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.930
Lavana Oriley: It's all about

561
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:03.150
KayDee Lassle: Ritual cool too.

562
01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:07.350
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, it's so mental. It's amazing. Our minds are so

563
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:08.940
Powerful

564
01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:15.630
Lavana Oriley: Mind over matter. It is a fact of keep reminding yourself.

565
01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:17.580
Lavana Oriley: Recovery.

566
01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:22.260
Lavana Oriley: I am in addiction anymore. I am in recovery.

567
01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:25.770
KayDee Lassle: And I

568
01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:30.480
Lavana Oriley: treat myself like I am in recovery as a healthy person.

569
01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:44.610
Lavana Oriley: And, you know, the fact is that I can you know it's like if somebody told you, or you found out you had diabetes and you just continue to eat cookies and cakes and don't attend you know you're killing yourself.

570
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:49.020
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, and the only person that's going to stop you as you

571
01:59:49.230 --> 01:59:50.880
KayDee Lassle: As you yeah

572
01:59:51.480 --> 02:00:00.300
Lavana Oriley: So you are in charge of the change that you make in yourself in your head in your life, you know, and you have to be your own first priority.

573
02:00:01.050 --> 02:00:15.630
Lavana Oriley: And take care of yourself first. And when you get these thoughts and then you get this awareness, you either need to you know immediately call somebody distract yourself with something. And to me, knowledge is power.

574
02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:28.530
Lavana Oriley: Know, the more powerful you feel and you know just even going online taking courses, whatever learning more about addiction.

575
02:00:28.590 --> 02:00:33.690
KayDee Lassle: You know, one thing that's really crazy right now my best friend. She doesn't live here anymore but

576
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:43.860
KayDee Lassle: before I'd ever fallen into the she was, she went through a period of time where she was addicted to meth and she went to rehab. When we were 19

577
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:53.490
KayDee Lassle: I think 19 or so. And she's been clean ever since. But, um, she decided to take up addictions and she's going to college to be an addiction counselor.

578
02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:57.900
KayDee Lassle: And she's always known about my struggle and everything and then

579
02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:07.350
KayDee Lassle: About a year or two ago she some stuff happened she asked if she can come live with me for a little while. And I said, Yes, of course. Well, that's when she saw how bad it was.

580
02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:22.890
KayDee Lassle: And now that she's in this addiction studies and she suddenly she's going to be an addiction counselor, because she's been through it. And she's like, you know, they say counselors that were addicts and you know in their life before make the best whatever it was, you know, but

581
02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:23.880
KayDee Lassle: Well,

582
02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:35.010
KayDee Lassle: She was just studying opiates and she was constantly like telling me all these things I and it's her because she's so like she wants to share it, and she's excited that she knows it. And she's like,

583
02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:37.980
KayDee Lassle: You know, and it was, it was really interesting.

584
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:39.570
Lavana Oriley: It is interesting. It's pretty

585
02:01:39.570 --> 02:01:40.950
Lavana Oriley: Fascinating. Yeah.

586
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:45.630
KayDee Lassle: Some of the things that she said to me, I was just like, whoa, it makes sense now.

587
02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:51.060
KayDee Lassle: Looking at it was clean. And from this side and then studying the whole neurological mental right

588
02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:54.090
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, there's a high brain yet want

589
02:01:54.150 --> 02:01:55.110
Lavana Oriley: To just take

590
02:01:55.530 --> 02:01:56.130
KayDee Lassle: A drug

591
02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:56.850
It's yes

592
02:01:58.290 --> 02:02:01.350
Lavana Oriley: Oh, it's pretty amazing. Yeah, you got your left brain.

593
02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:09.660
Lavana Oriley: My brain and your low brain is just instant gratification. I want it now. Give it to me now. I can't wait. And that's

594
02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:23.190
Lavana Oriley: Kind of the way the attics have the low brain in gear and once you're in recovery, you kind of get that high brain and gear and more thought becomes involved instead of

595
02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:30.960
Lavana Oriley: I wanted, I get it. I'm using you start thinking about it a little more. You don't just immediately act on it.

596
02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:51.090
Lavana Oriley: So that little moment of hesitation. That's your little sliver of recovery. And the more you resist giving into that that's giving you a bigger and bigger space to think about it, rather than immediately us as because now you're actually you're thinking about it.

597
02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:57.420
Lavana Oriley: So yeah, ready made progress progress because normally the minute you think about it, you use

598
02:02:58.170 --> 02:03:05.730
Lavana Oriley: You know already acknowledge what progress you've made the fact that you have entertained the idea, but you haven't acted on it.

599
02:03:06.570 --> 02:03:20.160
Lavana Oriley: So that's fantastic. That means something's working in your brain is kicking into the hybrid and trying to lose. Use the low brain, which is when an addict is in you know

600
02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:27.600
Lavana Oriley: Active addiction. That's all that works is the low very low brain doesn't care about anybody's feelings doesn't care about

601
02:03:28.590 --> 02:03:43.680
Lavana Oriley: You know, being healthier eating right or anything. It's all about the drug all about the ritual all about, you know, thinking about calling the dealer you drive 100 miles to go pick up a drug, if that's what you had to do.

602
02:03:44.010 --> 02:03:50.220
Lavana Oriley: And tell people put that determination that you had during your drug using time

603
02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:55.740
Lavana Oriley: Because you guys are frickin determined

604
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:57.240
KayDee Lassle: Yep.

605
02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:03.120
Lavana Oriley: That determination is there obviously because nothing stopping you from using drugs when you wanted to use

606
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.570
KayDee Lassle: Exactly. It's so crazy today here at like that.

607
02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:17.820
Lavana Oriley: So you have that determination. It's just a matter of perspective, how am I going to turn that determination into a more positive.

608
02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:21.270
Lavana Oriley: Tool. That's been a benefit me

609
02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:24.690
Lavana Oriley: Acting on my thoughts.

610
02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:38.580
KayDee Lassle: Right, exactly. I'm it was, I think, just for a minute was weird because in the beginning, I was like, Oh, I got this like I can do this. You know, so boxing's I'm not thinking about it at all.

611
02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:47.970
KayDee Lassle: All of a sudden it crept up a little bit. Boom. Gone did think about it crept up a little bit. OK. And then all sudden, it was just like, right here. And I'm like, What the fuck, sorry.

612
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:52.320
KayDee Lassle: No wires are you all of a sudden peeking out why.

613
02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:57.480
KayDee Lassle: So that's pretty typical that's pretty typical and you know it.

614
02:04:57.870 --> 02:05:01.830
Lavana Oriley: Because really it's going to take a good six months to a year.

615
02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:03.780
Lavana Oriley: Just our feelings.

616
02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:10.320
KayDee Lassle: In your full tell me, Oh, you're just going from one addiction to another. Now you're off fills your on Suboxone

617
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:16.980
KayDee Lassle: Oh, when are you going to get off that. Oh, you're going to be on this forever. How you don't need you know just things like that and

618
02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.850
KayDee Lassle: I really listened to you and and when you talk about why

619
02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:33.810
KayDee Lassle: And again, my best friend. That is studying addiction. She used to tell me that Katie, you're going to get addicted this box it a lot. As soon as she started studying addiction. She called me the other day and said, I am so sorry.

620
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:45.810
KayDee Lassle: For making you feel bad about being a box and because she's all what I read, and what I learned. It's going to be at least a year or two inches. Oh, I am so sorry. I'm like, You know what, I appreciate that because

621
02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:57.120
Lavana Oriley: See because people on the outside people outside of the addiction world. They don't understand harm reduction, they don't

622
02:05:58.230 --> 02:05:59.040
Lavana Oriley: So,

623
02:05:59.130 --> 02:06:10.230
Lavana Oriley: That's what, that's what they say you're taking, you know, taking one medication and replacing it with another, whether it's methadone vivid trawl Suboxone but the thing is

624
02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:17.640
Lavana Oriley: You know, if somebody was diagnosed with analogy, and they're taking allergy pills. Is there anything wrong with that.

625
02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:28.320
Lavana Oriley: No. So the point is if you are in discomfort and in order to improve your quality of life.

626
02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:42.360
Lavana Oriley: Again harm reduction is like a bridge. It's not forever. It's a temporary thing. It's to help you get from one place to another, more securely without relapses

627
02:06:42.930 --> 02:06:57.030
Lavana Oriley: And people that don't understand that that talk down about, you know, harm reduction, they don't get it. It's the same people that talk about, oh, god forbid you put condoms in the bathroom at a high school that's going to make everybody wants sex.

628
02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:00.660
Lavana Oriley: Yep. I know it's preventative

629
02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:03.000
KayDee Lassle: Way you just said that was so

630
02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:04.860
KayDee Lassle: On point

631
02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:06.930
Lavana Oriley: Because people

632
02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:14.910
Lavana Oriley: Idiots. I hate when I work at a men's alcohol and drug rehab and I, that's what I do during the day.

633
02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:24.630
Lavana Oriley: And a lot of those guys resent the guys who are on methadone Suboxone or vivid trawl because they're not on anything.

634
02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:40.740
Lavana Oriley: And people who have done math. There is no, there's nothing math. The only thing is eating and sleeping. That's how you get off math, there's no there's no Suboxone for math. There's no vitriol there's no medical

635
02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:47.010
KayDee Lassle: Makes sense, because that's what I was telling my best friend is you did math and you did it when we were teenagers, it's different.

636
02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:51.570
Lavana Oriley: Yes, there's no there's no harm reduction medication for that.

637
02:07:52.410 --> 02:07:58.950
Lavana Oriley: That's one. And the guys are angry about the guys that do get the harm reduction medication. And then on the other hand,

638
02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:06.120
Lavana Oriley: The guys who are complaining that there is no harm reduction medication for math that's not fair. How can we do

639
02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:12.840
KayDee Lassle: And that can't help but make you wonder that means they still want to be taking something they still altered.

640
02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:15.390
Lavana Oriley: They still want to do battling something

641
02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:23.970
Lavana Oriley: Well, and also people want to take the magic pill. I don't want to do this work. I don't want to do all this work this too much work. Just give me the pill. Let me get on with my life.

642
02:08:24.690 --> 02:08:25.740
KayDee Lassle: There isn't one.

643
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:27.090
Lavana Oriley: That's not what we're

644
02:08:28.170 --> 02:08:36.210
KayDee Lassle: Seeing fully understand why group is connected to this boxing program why one on ones are connected because if I

645
02:08:36.210 --> 02:08:39.210
KayDee Lassle: Was just taking the box and every day and not talking about it or talking to

646
02:08:39.210 --> 02:08:41.640
KayDee Lassle: fellow peers are you with

647
02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:42.390
KayDee Lassle: Me there, I think.

648
02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:43.650
KayDee Lassle: we've ever understand it.

649
02:08:43.710 --> 02:08:52.590
Lavana Oriley: You know exactly, and that that is a requirement of each one of those harm reduction medications that it it goes hand in hand with counseling.

650
02:08:53.010 --> 02:08:56.190
Lavana Oriley: They're not just pivotal methadone.

651
02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:58.320
KayDee Lassle: Because then you're just going to get high off of it like

652
02:08:58.320 --> 02:08:58.530
KayDee Lassle: Right.

653
02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:00.660
KayDee Lassle: You know, whatever. Yeah.

654
02:09:00.810 --> 02:09:08.640
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, so, you know, don't even feel like you ever even have to defend yourself for taking Suboxone just, you know,

655
02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.380
Lavana Oriley: But I have. Yeah.

656
02:09:10.410 --> 02:09:12.180
KayDee Lassle: But I'm sorry. You don't understand.

657
02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:13.830
Lavana Oriley: Whatever because

658
02:09:14.070 --> 02:09:19.230
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, oh what you know and you know eventually you're going to taper off of it when you feel strong enough.

659
02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:19.830
KayDee Lassle: Is

660
02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:21.360
Lavana Oriley: A forever thing.

661
02:09:21.570 --> 02:09:27.660
KayDee Lassle: And that's my goal. I don't want to, you know, I don't want to be on it forever. But right now, that's what I need.

662
02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:45.960
Lavana Oriley: Right, and that's what's helping you now. And if we like i i'm always I'm totally into mindfulness. I'm into today. Keep your head where your feet are if this is making your quality of life better, just like glasses, you know,

663
02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:47.670
Lavana Oriley: I

664
02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:53.610
Lavana Oriley: People to, you know, hey, I can sit here without glasses, but I have to squint every

665
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:55.200
KayDee Lassle: Day. Yeah.

666
02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:56.700
Lavana Oriley: A little blurry.

667
02:09:56.820 --> 02:10:03.180
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, improve my quality of life. I think I'll wear glasses and that will help me.

668
02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:16.170
Lavana Oriley: And, you know, anytime you can improve your quality of life. You do it and it doesn't matter what anybody says. A lot of people don't understand that harm reduction, just like I'm up in Seattle. They have a

669
02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:21.690
Lavana Oriley: Place where attics that are you syringe users.

670
02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:23.130
KayDee Lassle: If they're clean needles.

671
02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:25.680
Lavana Oriley: They can come in and get clean needles. So

672
02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.840
Lavana Oriley: You think people have to say about that.

673
02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:28.860
KayDee Lassle: Well, you know what

674
02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:33.000
KayDee Lassle: At least something that won't give them hepatitis right

675
02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:34.440
Lavana Oriley: Hello, or

676
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:35.070
KayDee Lassle: AIDS.

677
02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:35.610
Lavana Oriley: I know

678
02:10:36.150 --> 02:10:37.440
KayDee Lassle: I get it, why not

679
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:43.050
Lavana Oriley: Yes, of course. Anything that's harm reduction that is

680
02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:46.830
Lavana Oriley: You a less serious

681
02:10:47.130 --> 02:10:48.720
KayDee Lassle: Condition or health problem.

682
02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.620
Lavana Oriley: Yes, yes, yes. And to help you bridge from here to here.

683
02:10:53.760 --> 02:11:03.300
Lavana Oriley: You know that if that's what you need to do, then that's what you need to do and don't ever feel like you have to justify that to anybody because you know it's helping you.

684
02:11:04.410 --> 02:11:22.560
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, definitely. I'm so glad that we got to do this or I got to do this for myself because I like I said, I haven't had one and i thought i was sailing through. I thought I didn't need one. And then within the last, you know, month or so I'm like, Okay, I think I need one of these

685
02:11:23.730 --> 02:11:23.910
Lavana Oriley: Are

Lavana Oriley: How good. Awesome.

688
02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:39.270
KayDee Lassle: I'm so thank you so much for what you do.

691
02:11:52.380 --> 02:12:01.020
KayDee Lassle: Obviously, again, speak for everyone, but I do not feel judged. I don't feel scrutinized, I don't feel anything. I feel like I can be open with you and that's why I really wanted to do with you.

692
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:13.680
Lavana Oriley: Oh, good. I'm so glad that's off. Awesome. And, you know, pat yourself on the back. Number one, you sought help you know you you are looking out for your own well being.

693
02:12:14.070 --> 02:12:32.850
Lavana Oriley: And those are all positive things and keep going in that direction. And just, you know, how can I make my life better. And I think you're definitely on the track. And what about your cousin, the one who's, you know, the in recovery. What, what about her first sponsor.

694
02:12:33.870 --> 02:12:46.740
KayDee Lassle: I don't actually know she has one. So she is going through a lot of drug court and stuff to be out. She has new mandatory manned and I mean, like, seven days a week, mandatory na manned

695
02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:55.680
KayDee Lassle: Up test mandatory zoom all of that. And she's doing really well. I just, I don't think she has a sponsor.

696
02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:01.230
KayDee Lassle: And I don't know if it's just because she's constantly going to groups and meetings right now.

697
02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:14.700
KayDee Lassle: For zoom. She's so funny when she came home from group when I, we were all over there for dinner. And she was like, oh my god groups, you know, it's all going to be on my now because of the crowd on. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm like, No, that's when I do it.

698
02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:15.540
Lavana Oriley: Yeah yeah

699
02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:22.980
KayDee Lassle: You know she yeah so she but she does group, at least at least three times a week. I think five

700
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:33.450
KayDee Lassle: And she's you know has to do like some p tests and all that, but she's doing really well. I just, I don't think that she has a sponsor. I'm not quite sure. But I don't think so.

701
02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.860
Lavana Oriley: Um, so, does she live in your same town.

702
02:13:38.070 --> 02:13:42.450
Lavana Oriley: Oh yeah, well, maybe you can go to a meeting with her online together.

703
02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:44.880
KayDee Lassle: I thought about that because

704
02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:54.630
KayDee Lassle: Her and I have talked about it, her group. So usually, you know, different days of mine and sometimes we're over there together where I'm at her house, whatever she's saying with her dad, my uncle.

705
02:13:55.050 --> 02:13:57.180
KayDee Lassle: And we do a lot of family dinners.

706
02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.300
KayDee Lassle: I mean coronavirus is kind of hindering seen that a little bit.

707
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:01.200
Lavana Oriley: Yeah yeah

708
02:14:01.410 --> 02:14:07.410
KayDee Lassle: We do do a lot, and I've been over there multiple times where she's on zoom and she has said, Hey, do you want to join me

709
02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:09.000
Lavana Oriley: That's a great idea that

710
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.200
KayDee Lassle: Fear kicks in of who's in it. Are they in Crescent City. Who's in your group.

711
02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:17.970
KayDee Lassle: But about one of her groups was like global are not global but you know what I mean.

712
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:19.230
Lavana Oriley: And national

713
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:34.710
KayDee Lassle: So talking to her about it too. I mean, she had it so much harder to me and she went through a shit time and but she always does say calm down for math is easier, but the mental you know the addiction is still there.

714
02:14:35.850 --> 02:14:43.770
KayDee Lassle: And I we've always been close we grew up as best cousins, whatever you want to call it. But now we have a whole new thing to connect on and build on.

715
02:14:44.130 --> 02:14:56.040
KayDee Lassle: Uh huh. But, and I really don't want this to sound bad part of me small part can't help but think the only reason she's so successful and clean right now is because she has to be

716
02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:03.030
KayDee Lassle: He's on probation. She's in drug court, she's on pizza. She wears a drug patch, like all these things, you know. Yeah.

717
02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:07.410
KayDee Lassle: Yeah, but I know for her. She wants it so much, and she

718
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:16.560
KayDee Lassle: Do so good right now. I just when all of this is over, like all her parole or probation, whatever. I just hope that she doesn't slip back into, you know,

719
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:22.710
Lavana Oriley: Some people need that very, very severe like you know

Lavana Oriley: Tell people is go to 90 meetings in 90 days.

721
02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:36.480
KayDee Lassle: Literally so happy that she's in it every single day and she has to wear a drug patch and take it off and get it tested every week and then put a new one on and he has three times a week.

722
02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:42.540
KayDee Lassle: Wow. Whoa, yeah. She was in pretty heavy. So all the things that she's doing

725
02:15:49.530 --> 02:16:05.820
Lavana Oriley: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. And if you can join her one of those like global or national meetings where it's not our own. But it's in, you know, just kind of sit over to the side and listen. You don't even have to put your face in front of the camera.
