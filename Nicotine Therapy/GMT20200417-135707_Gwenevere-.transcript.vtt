00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Want a car appointment today.

2
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.010
Magan: Oh no, I'm just sitting out here, I just got home.

3
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How was your work day

4
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.460
Magan: It wasn't very good, actually.

5
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.580
Magan: I just had to have a meeting with a boss, so

6
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you want to sort of start with

7
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: One.

8
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.830
Magan: Yeah, we can

9
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.800
Magan: So there is

10
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.380
Magan: An individual that is very close with Sydney at work. She's a newer employee.

11
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.890
Magan: They're very close, very Buddy, buddy. And it's, it feels very much retaliation by proxy, but that's neither here nor there.

12
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.430
Magan: So this young lady keeps

13
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.590
Magan: Asking very personal questions about me and

14
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:50.010
Magan: Stating inaccurate things to people. And so instead of assuming that that's correct. I asked her a question in the text message. I said, you know, we're not here to. It doesn't matter if we like each other or not. Um, we have a job to do. However, if there is

15
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.160
Magan: If there is issue between us. Perhaps you can bring it to me in the future and just ask me, and I'll be happy to answer it.

16
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.340
Magan: Well, instead of

17
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.120
Magan: doing just that. She went ahead and

18
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.440
Magan: Went to my boss and said that I was being aggressive towards her.

19
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.340
Magan: And

20
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.050
Magan: So my boss asked

21
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Josh

22
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.830
Magan: I know this. Chris, you went way up the chain of command.

23
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.600
Magan: So,

24
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:49.410
Magan: Chris called me into his office and I said, absolutely. Sorry. You know, I don't, I don't like her. I'm not going to sit and pretend like I do, however, I did not mean to make her feel that way, in any way, shape, or form. And I'm happy to apologize about it. So he asked for us to me today.

25
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.430
Magan: Well, yeah. For us meet next Thursday. But yesterday.

26
00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.480
Magan: She came in and I'm tucked in my desk. There's no way at all that she could have made contact with me.

27
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.720
Magan: But as she's walking past me

28
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:12.480
Magan: Just reach her tears up she hits me with her chair and she goes, oops, sorry, and she has like this shit eating grin on her face.

29
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:23.880
Magan: And I just ignored it. I just let it go. Um, but I asked Chris if he could please have bump up the meeting sooner because I feel like things

30
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.330
Magan: Are escalating. And I want to nip this in the bud.

31
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.220
Magan: So we met today. And she was just extremely, extremely aggressive

32
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.470
Magan: She's one of those individuals that she's very manipulative

33
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this person.

34
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.780
Extremely

35
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.880
Magan: Stephanie.

36
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And who was in the meeting, besides you and Stephanie.

37
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.060
Magan: Me Stephanie and Chris

38
00:06:53.010 --> 00:07:00.420
Magan: And it was an informal meeting. It wasn't a mediation or anything like that. He's trying to nip it where it's at.

39
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.220
Magan: So,

40
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:10.440
Magan: She starts off the conversation was saying, I think that you're extremely rude you statements us demons, you, you, you.

41
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.170
Magan: Right, you're extremely rude for

42
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:25.110
Magan: Sending me a message at 12 o'clock at night and saying what you said it's extremely rude and from here on out all communication will be through my supervisor and me through email.

43
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And I said,

44
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.810
Magan: Okay, I said that works for me.

45
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:40.530
Magan: I said, um, well first off message was not intended to be rude, in any way, shape, or form. So I do apologize if it did come up

46
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.450
Magan: Secondly,

47
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:52.350
Magan: 12 o'clock at night is my daytime. So that's when I'm going to send messages and that's when I'll send emails. Whether you choose to read it or not is entirely up to you.

48
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.930
Magan: Um, but

49
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.000
Magan: Then she said, well, my personal phone number is not

50
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:08.130
Magan: I gave you my personal phone number. When I first started as a friendly opening

51
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.840
Magan: I said, well, Stephanie I'm

52
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:22.380
Magan: I'm not here to be your friend. I'm, I'm here to do my job and when your remarks and comments around the our work environment.

53
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:31.920
Magan: Are affecting me at my job. I'm going to bring it to your attention and that's exactly what I did. I said, You know, I can come up to you in person. And it might seem aggressive

54
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:41.130
Magan: And the tone of my text message. I apologize if it came off route. However, it was not intended that way, in any way, shape, or form.

55
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.370
Magan: But, you know,

56
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:53.700
Magan: And then Chris was like, well, who's will then she asked me and she's like, well, who sang all these things. I said, I'm not gonna sit here and give you fuel for the fire.

57
00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:02.730
Magan: I said, the point is is that it doesn't matter if it's true or not, or who saying it or not. I'm bringing it to you. So we can

58
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:14.250
Magan: Leave it at that. I don't want to assume that other people are correct. I'm letting you know that if you have an issue or question she asked me, asked me, that's exactly what the message said

59
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.080
Magan: And

60
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.710
Magan: She just was like,

61
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:28.110
Magan: Well, you've asked me personal questions before I said, and you've asked me personal questions before and I've chosen to answer to what I'm comfortable with.

62
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:45.240
Magan: I was like, this isn't about personal questions. I don't, you know, and the thing is is that she's literally going around content or talking to different people saying things like, I don't understand why making cares if I like her, and

63
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.040
Magan: Things like that.

64
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:48.870
Magan: And I

65
00:09:49.020 --> 00:10:01.230
Magan: And I don't understand why she's saying that, and she sat there and just blatantly just denied it. And that's more than one person, repeated the exact same statement that she said

66
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.280
Magan: So I just, I didn't, I didn't bring that up. I just stated, you know what

67
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:22.530
Magan: I'm not here to be your friend. I'm here to have your back in that room. And that's exactly what I said to her in that room I have your back. Professionally I have your six. I'm a team player, and I will work with you. But beyond that, I have no interest in communicating

68
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you said this same thing last week that part right there. You said that one already. So that's a repeat. Yeah.

69
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.450
Magan: I didn't say to her that I didn't like her.

70
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.710
Magan: I didn't say that.

71
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:43.800
Magan: Because I thought on it and I didn't want to give her ammunition for future just say, well, she said it in the meeting that she doesn't like me.

72
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, yeah. It doesn't belong in the workplace. It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant.

73
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.110
Exactly.

74
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So how about the night

75
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.160
Magan: I hope that my boss saw that she was aggressive

76
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:12.090
Magan: In her mouth out of her mouth was met with aggression, even after I apologize for making her feel like I was rude. It was just met with aggression.

77
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:22.650
Magan: She was just like a cold fish it she's just she's extremely manipulative and it really bothers me. She reminds me of my mother so much

78
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:30.990
Magan: Yeah. Um, but aside from that, I just said well from here on out. We will not communicate through messages.

79
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:43.620
Magan: Um, any communication will be through text or through email with your super with I said I might see seeing your supervisor, because your supervisors Sydney, so I will be seeing Chris and you

80
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.590
Magan: Nice. If I have to communicate with you.

81
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.640
Nice.

82
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And then whenever you can just, just say hold on just a minute. And then when you're going to have a conversation just walk into a room where there's someone else.

83
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:10.920
Magan: And that's what I told Chris, I said I, I didn't approach her in person, because I've had instances where there's not another person there, and it's twisted and turned in something that it's not. And then I'm sitting in a to our investigation.

84
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.780
Magan: And that's what I don't want

85
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.220
That doesn't. I said,

86
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:22.110
Magan: So I said, perhaps you know my message was misinterpreted and for that I did apologize.

87
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:30.840
Magan: But, and I turned her and I said, definitely. I don't have any ill will towards you. I don't know. I'm here to do a job. That's what I'm here to do.

88
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.880
Magan: But she was just angry with her little mask on her face was covered. So all I could see was her eyes.

89
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.060
Magan: And it's just so unprofessional. It's like

90
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.220
Magan: I'm just not even going to do this with you and I told Chris at the end.

91
00:12:47.610 --> 00:13:00.450
Magan: Because he asked me to stay because he's like, I'd like to know who's saying this, I said, nobody's saying anything. That's what I'm trying to tell you it's in passing conversation. So I brought it to her attention because I didn't want it to escalate. But it apparently did just that.

92
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:09.120
Magan: And I said, I'm nobody's bashing. There's no gossiping. Oh, Stephanie said this, I said that's not what's happening.

93
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:18.540
Magan: And it's escalated to this and I'm sitting here in front of you and to be quite honest, I'm flabbergasted that I'm sitting here that it's at this point. And that's what I told him.

94
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.950
Magan: I said, I apologize for the unprofessionalism

95
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:34.170
Magan: You know, like, I didn't mean it like that. I said it like I apologize for it, getting to this point. That is what I apologize if my action caused it.

96
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.400
Magan: To get to this point.

97
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.990
Magan: I apologize for that.

98
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: General

99
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.540
Magan: This was

100
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:47.460
Magan: This was my intention and this is, unfortunately, how it how it came about and that's all I can do.

101
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.780
Wow.

102
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is back to back two weeks with this woman so I'm

103
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You're happy with how you handled it right

104
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Oh, what's, what's wrong with it. What don't you like

105
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:09.360
Magan: I had some anger in me. I was responding with anger at times but I took some deep breaths.

106
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.060
Magan: Um, unfortunately, I have a very bad habit of showing my emotions on my face.

107
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: ANGER YOU THINK IT WAS A That was showing. Oh.

108
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.270
Magan: It was fucking straight up anger. I was stuck on shaking, because I was livid but

109
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think, Chris.

110
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sure, Chris.

111
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:40.800
Magan: I think Chris saw maybe frustration with how it was proceeding. And I told him that at the end. I said, I'm just frustrated because I feel like we got nowhere.

112
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:55.350
Magan: And I was like, I can't communicate with her. If it's just going to be met with aggression. I said, I did and he and then he said, no, I saw that and he said, I, I appreciate that you took the time to apologize. That's what he told me

113
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is that

114
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's like you got the response that you

115
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanted. He could see that you were open and flexible. You weren't rigid you shared you named. What was on your face. You called it frustration. It was kind of a felt unproductive piece and he saw her aggression.

116
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.120
Magan: Oh, he saw it.

117
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:25.980
Magan: And I said it at the end. I was like, it's really hard to feel like we got anywhere. When I'm being met with aggression.

118
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.520
Magan: So, and, and he was like, Yes, I saw that

119
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

120
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So what

121
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.920
Magan: And then he brought up. Thank you for apologizing. So he didn't notice that I tried

122
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

123
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.070
Magan: Man, that's what I was hoping he would be

124
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's a win so walk away from this as a when

125
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: We, you know what I mean we're unlikely. I mean, at this point, maybe six months maybe sometime from now, you'll have these encounters with people and maybe you won't be mad. You'll feel more like

126
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A it'll be labeled like I'm excited. I know exactly what's going on. It'll shift. Maybe the meeting, but that intensity

127
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll transform you. Look how much progress you've made Megan. I remember the first job, you had, you had to go sit in front of that boss, we were working the the tactile of being able to feel a seam on on on on a shirt in order to get through it, you are making profound progress. Okay.

128
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:33.210
Magan: I'm just, I'm disappointed in myself because

129
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.490
Magan: Because it feels like

130
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.990
Magan: I don't, I

131
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:54.030
Magan: I I've always had a problem with getting along with females. Okay.

132
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.050
Magan: I don't trust them.

133
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.570
Magan: And

134
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.660
Magan: It feels like

135
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.710
Magan: I'm hated

136
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.230
Magan: It feels like it felt like fucking third grade in there.

137
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.020
Magan: That's exactly what it felt like. And it felt like

138
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.530
Magan: Bullying. It felt like

139
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.290
Magan: Girl fight it felt like

140
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.200
Magan: Petty

141
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.070
Magan: Bullshit. But it reminded me so much of

142
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.460
Magan: It's like it's a fucking constant repeat for me, Glenn and that's the problem is that

143
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.520
Magan: I can't make friends and I can't

144
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.990
Magan: Even when I tried to be good and I try to

145
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.600
Magan: Be kind.

146
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.010
Magan: It's like people find that attractive or maybe

147
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.450
Magan: Annoying

148
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:08.100
Magan: The, the questions that I asked, they find it annoying that I'm nice they find it annoying perhaps

149
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:15.480
Magan: My intelligence. At times I have noticed that they people find that annoying or maybe arrogant. I don't know.

150
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Complicated third grade behavior. That's what this Stephanie bringing her personal story and just trying to play it out. She's got someone in her life that you

151
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: She's trying to work it out with you. So you're a mother, you're, you're, her mother. Your whatever she's got some okay everybody's doing it. We all are all gets played out at work or in our marriage, or both.

152
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is the part you're you're fortunate. You're in therapy, you've got someone who can see all you gotta do.

153
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is get clearer and clearer and clearer. Ah, you know what, Stephanie.

154
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that I do or say that's getting in the way of of work for you.

155
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You see what I just did.

156
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: See it, I already owned it. I didn't have to apologize. I just straight up may her say so watch Stephanie Oh it

157
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what I'm doing or saying that's getting in the way of your work productivity, because we're here to all do a job.

158
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I know maybe afterwards, I can talk about how some of the things that that are happening between us might be getting in the way of my productivity.

159
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can kind of resolve them in here in this office today and let's move forward. For a start, what am I doing this getting in the way of your productivity.

160
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

161
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you basically just owned it. Well, you did a lot of things without saying sorry you calmly.

162
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: steer the conversation. And guess what you did you put it flatly on her shoulders for her to answer to that you already basically said I must be doing something. Let's name it and it's affecting your work performance brings attention to

163
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Chris who might be thinking, yeah, it is actually perfecting. This is taking a lot of time. This is unproductive. So you've done a lot of things. So then she says what to that if you were to say that to her right in front of Chris

164
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.030
Magan: I don't know, because I wish I really wish that I would have said that

165
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:31.860
Magan: When I listen. Listen, there's gonna be more least Stephanie's. Remember I told you that other than the break room and the other job they're going to more of these Stephanie's it's going to be this third rate experience over and over and over and over and over and over and over, but you

166
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: won't feel like that anymore. It's going to change. These are things to memorize how did, how did I come up with that phrase I learned it. You think I knew this. I didn't know this.

167
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it now and and passing it along.

168
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:53.250
Magan: But that's the thing when it's like nothing that I did was had anything to do with work. It was actually done on

169
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Watch. That's what's about to happen. Guess what she's gonna do

170
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: He's gonna have

171
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be quiet, isn't it, watch.

172
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch it. Watch it one more time.

173
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, Stephanie. We're all meeting here today, and there's something I'm doing her

174
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing.

175
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But in the way of productivity. What are those things that I'm doing and saying that are getting in the way of your work productivity.

176
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're so mean.

177
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

178
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I know my intentions are good. I know that what I've been doing. I know my motivation, what was perceived as mean

179
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You send me tested.

180
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Did that get in the way of your work productivity.

181
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was thinking about it and thinking about thinking about it.

182
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.600
Magan: Well, she said it's 12 o'clock at night and it woke me up.

183
00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on, it woke you up. Ah, I'm so it's the big request. If I could change something, it would be

184
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Is to think about your work schedule. So you would be better if I process. Wait, processed it and and and if I were to send a message, email or text that I thought about and I knew somehow your work schedule and only send it during your work hours.

185
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't normally do that, I guess because of what's going on right now. I can maybe, could you tell me what your work schedule is this coming week

186
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But at this point, it sounds like we already have it resolved with our email plan and and then we have a choice to read an email or we don't

187
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I do apologize for that. Is there anything else, what else is getting in the way. So it was that eat it was the timing of that text I did it on my work schedule kind of thought, you know, most I did.

188
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.910
Magan: Say that

189
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're sleeping, we kind of put it on. Do Not Disturb. I apologize. Sorry about that. Stephanie, what else, what else is getting in the way of your work productivity.

190
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well here's just some nasty.

191
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me about how I come across nasty. Am I doing it right now. Is it is it is it happening right now. Well, yeah. You're just so angry.

192
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:13.500
Okay.

193
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't feel angry. I'm frustrated because I'm trying to understand how my productivity hasn't really been disrupted. I'm working. I'm doing my thing. But we're here. This is interrupting us meeting and I really want to get to the core issue. So, um,

194
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I can change the way I'm talking I'm I'm frustrated. Let me see if I can shift. So I don't know what she's gonna say, but I'm in charge. Do you notice that

195
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.350
Uh huh.

196
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You have that in you you have it, it's there. You've got the same thing that I just role played she

197
00:23:53.970 --> 00:24:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is used to being a bully and what she does is she emotionally hijacks people she goes around. She finds the sensitive ones you're one of them, and she got you. And she's going to bully you with it.

198
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't have to accept it, but she's not expecting is that you are ready and you know how to turn it around. So it's a

199
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's interesting. Stephanie. We're talking a lot about feelings and emotions and assets and things like that. Um, it could very well be that

200
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, you have to know your population right resting bitch face thing like you know i don't know how much humor is in your workplace. A lot of places have lots of humor. And it's like, I have one of those faces. A lot of people misinterpret it

201
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Hahaha. But if that's not actually going on. You're more than welcome to ask me if I'm upset or something. But honestly, from now on, just assume if I don't say anything, we're good. I'm here to do a job and

202
00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Frankly, I mean aside from kind of these meetings kind of take up some time and that have been to my chair didn't quite understand that felt hostile. I'm not saying to bring that up but so yeah it's. See how I'm I'm talking. I'm, I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.

203
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You bring it back to the role of work over and over and over and over. I can kind of get that if you and I were buds and hanging out, we'd be talking about these kind of feelings, but you and I don't have this sort of social space just assume that

204
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a professional relationship with you on enjoying a professional relationship with ship with you and I want to continue it. And if it's about my affect my face.

205
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just you can either ask if you want to but just assume I'm good unless I bring something up.

206
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Using this word professional relationship five times in conversation.

207
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.690
Magan: I used it twice.

208
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Once the testing what happened when you use that phrase with her and and Chris Right.

209
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of silent. Uh huh. Nice.

210
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.200
Magan: And then, Chris.

211
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.510
Magan: Said it he said like Megan said

212
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.610
Magan: Oh, here to do a job.

213
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:09.870
Yeah.

214
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:17.130
Magan: He was like, like making we're here to do a job. We don't need to be friends. Not everybody likes each other, but we are here to do a job.

215
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had done. And you were saying you were maybe it already happened. I think it already happened. But you're giving yourself a hard time I think unduly

216
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you um you know me, I'll give you everything I got all I can think is if you knew in your heart of hearts that you were there basically to as if you are a manager to you and Chris, are there to address Stephanie's concerns, you know, Chris.

217
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you and I were kind of talking about that professional relationship.

218
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Stephanie I'm enjoying my professional relationship with you. I like how we do this and this and this together. Seems like that works pretty well. I want to continue along those lines. Can you see anything kind of looking ahead to see what might get in the way of that.

219
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you wait

220
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When you put it on. This is the same thing we do when we manage up to, we put it on someone's shoulders. You want to get it off of yours is quickly because this has something to do with you. It's not your responsibility. Anyway, so the artists to just

221
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it on to ask her a question. Did you even ask her a question in there.

222
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because you don't say boss, you are the boss. You're it.

223
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't quite gotten there yet.

224
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You can ask her.

225
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We're sitting there with her right so i think probably what happens is that that anger kind of hijack see a little bit. And so it's harder to to keep the chill and to see your own strength.

226
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You can feel the anger instead of turning that into the badass energy. Oh my gosh. Actually, I have nothing to defend

227
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at and this is going to exaggeration, how pathetic. This is let's let's try and help this Poor lamb. Let's just see what we can do here.

228
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Stephanie, obviously this has reached the point because here we are we're including Chris here. So let's make the most out of it. What am I doing, see if you can really tell me what it is.

229
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's something I look like something I say how I stand kind of the way I phrase things that gets in the way of your accomplishing a work task.

230
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay you asking it. You may be the smartest person in the room over and over again. And I'm sorry, that's the burden of being an intelligent person that's the burden.

231
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But he was it Chris is going to be thrilled. You're doing his job for him. He has no clue what to do with with two women that are talking about feelings.

232
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: He just wanted to stop.

233
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.810
Magan: Just please. Essentially what he said. He's like, I just

234
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.560
Magan: Want it

235
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Done. Get your frickin work done. Am I right.

236
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.740
Magan: Right, yes, that's exactly. Essentially what he said.

237
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.270
Magan: Yeah, so

238
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You make it easy when you when you do the work for you or an ally.

239
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: YouTube

240
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know, it's this this this complaining person over

241
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Like working out.

242
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you did great. You're great. Last time and you great this time.

243
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's it's maybe just sort of rehearsing and memorizing some of those lines they apply so broadly to so many situations over and over and over.

244
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I really like our professional relationship and even reinforcing the one with Chris at the end. Boy, I really like how you and I work together to kind of

245
00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Get clear about what we're doing and keeping this a professional place and having it not disrupted by my things that really kind of don't belong in the workplace.

246
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see how your ear aligned with Chris on that you put yourself there.

247
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.110
Yeah.

248
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So once that you're disappointed still in yourself.

249
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.980
Magan: I just

250
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:36.420
Magan: I have a hard time I harp on shit and i i keep replaying it in my brain. And this is what bothers me about me and this is what everything not just this but

251
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:53.550
Magan: You know, like should have could have what is constantly running through my head and I replayed the event in my head and I focus my focus and I hone in on it and it literally consumes me and it's not healthy, in any way, shape, or form. But I do it.

252
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So last night.

253
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

254
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like an analogy, and I won't be able to do it quietly beautifully as this astronaut, but there's some Trevor Noah was interviewing an astronaut.

255
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: A female and so two females go out and they do the crazy like 12 hours or something insane. They're working outside freaking out in space, like what anyway so they're out there, they're doing that. And she's back on Earth and

256
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: He's kind of like

257
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, welcome back to the virus and more isolation, you're out there in space. And now you basically don't talk to anybody either

258
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and so there was this obviously Trevor noise light and it's fluffy and it's playful. But there's also some truth in there. And so this astronaut was she would say, well, I would be up there. And I'd be thinking what I miss about being on Earth and

259
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And she said, I'd stop. I would stop. She used a phrase I don't know what she did.

260
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But basically I would stop repeating that thought. And she would say I would keep repeating man. I'm going to miss the Aurora missing and they showed this beautiful coloring, man. I'm going to miss this. When I'm back on Earth.

261
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's so beautiful to be able to see this and this and what she did was turn her attention to repeating something else.

262
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that is what to do. You just have to put the effort into turning your attention away from shoulda coulda woulda

263
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What is an over here to I'm looking forward to the next opportunity that I can practice, what, what's that phrase I want to practice with when my better repeated 100 times. I'm going to forget it.

264
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you spend your time preparing for the next time and how exciting. I'm looking forward to. It's going to go well.

265
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to go, well, it's going to sound like this is sounding the fields coming to sound design. I'm going to repeat it out loud. How about, well, my shoulders. How am I standing

266
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I have a half smile in my head tilted and I'm nodding like I care and have to actually care because I've been in the position of her. Okay, I gotta show I care. You could spend all of that mental energy over here.

267
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The psychology of it though. Megan is

268
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in the habit of doing this stuff of reflecting about what you could have done differently.

269
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of practicing what you're going to do differently.

270
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:36.510
Magan: Oh yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And I, I let it, eat it. Me.

271
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:42.900
Magan: I I have so many memories in my head of

272
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.690
Magan: Different events.

273
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:59.070
Magan: From my childhood from my adolescence from adulthood, where I'm like, God, I'm embarrassed of that I shouldn't have done that and it just intrusively comes into my brain.

274
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.740
Magan: It just comes out of nowhere like I'm not even actively thinking about that event.

275
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.600
Magan: But it comes into my head.

276
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:18.630
Magan: And it reminds me of shame or it reminds me of embarrassment or reminds me of anger, or sadness, whatever it is. I'm reoccurring that feeling over again. Right.

277
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.500
Magan: And it's like,

278
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to do with it. So what you do is you welcome that guest in

279
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That unexpected guest comes in and you sit there and you talk with it and talk with it and talk with it and talk with it. And listen, listen.

280
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you can decide what the conversation is going to be

281
00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Focused on new skills and what you're going to do in the future. Just it literally is. That's why I thought stopping is a real technique just swatted away. Thanks for sharing. But Shane and punitive threats do not help me learn

282
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: They didn't help me learn

283
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: lessons in the past. I was completely flooded with emotions are not going to help me learn. Now, you won't learn you won't learn from punitive discipline and that's what you're doing inside your head.

284
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We learn by feeling like there's something like a carrot out there. Something good that's going to come our way. It's worth my while to practice this to learn this.

285
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: stop beating yourself up, just stop it as soon as it comes. Thanks for sharing. You got me this far, use that one. Thanks for sharing. I got you.

286
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Skill I need right now that I want to practice in the future is this one.

287
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, do you have any question about how to do that.

288
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.610
Magan: In the moment. Oh, I mean, I totally got

289
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.310
Magan: What you're saying

290
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.450
Magan: I just have to practice it. I have to practice it.

291
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You get something Megan out of it you over the years. We all do this. We don't do things for nothing, you were getting getting something out of the penance, you were putting yourself through all of that. Look what a look how you embarrass yourself. Oh, you, you say,

292
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:23.640
Magan: Yes, and that's exactly what I do. God, you're so pathetic. Oh, you're so weak. Oh, you're so stupid.

293
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.120
Magan: Over and over and over.

294
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

295
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't you wouldn't do that to your kids.

296
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the parent model you have inside your head. It's outdated. It didn't work to begin with.

297
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not saying this is easy. Your it'll take effort.

298
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Will take on that that protective nurturing one

299
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Of those figures just bring them into my awareness. There's a one press that natural intrusive thoughts that comes up.

300
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because it comes natural. Doesn't mean it is the high wish I could remember this phrase right now.

301
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's something like our instinct isn't although it keeps us safe is not mentally healthy. I know those seem like paradoxical things, but the very thing that keeps me alive, doesn't mean it helps my mental health. It just keeps me alive, but when

302
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.400
Magan: It's completely draining actually

303
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's completely drowning.

304
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But yes, this will take effort, and I'm going to tell you, I think you're gonna like the outcome, you're not going to

305
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.540
Magan: Go to

306
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So you spend all that time woulda coulda shutting

307
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.760
Magan: It. I just have to think of something that

308
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.040
Magan: I can replace it with

309
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are you hearing here that could work or your own practice that would work.

310
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:57.900
Magan: Well,

311
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.140
Magan: Like when we did em Dr last week.

312
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.060
Magan: That one took a toll. And that one's been fucking with me.

313
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.230
Magan: I've been constantly thinking about burning myself.

314
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.300
Magan: And

315
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.270
Magan: And instead of doing it.

316
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:26.010
Magan: All start thinking about something else. So I'm doing it with this, but I have to figure out how to do it with the memories.

317
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're

318
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:29.220
Magan: Like

319
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You said you're doing it like with the notes when a note would come up in your awareness.

320
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:35.850
Magan: For well

321
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.640
Magan: I just I got no no no. So like

322
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.690
Magan: I last week. Damn. Dr. It just, it just took a toll and

323
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:52.290
Magan: That word keeps coming up. Okay. And when it comes up, I want to burn

324
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

325
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.520
Magan: I just want to sizzle it away. I just, I want to watch my flesh.

326
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:10.890
Magan: And I want to feel the sting of that rather than pay attention to that word or hear that word or hear that song. And every time it comes up. I'm like,

327
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:29.400
Magan: And I'm thinking of it, but I'm not doing it. I'm trying to stop myself from actually doing the action of burning myself so I'm stopping that but I can't stop the process of these memories that are intruding

328
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.780
Magan: Okay, by stopping by.

329
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do instead of burning

330
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.620
Magan: I'm DISTRACTING MYSELF. WHAT

331
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.210
Magan: Um, I started writing

332
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:43.320
Okay.

333
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.990
Magan: Well, I started writing because you said to just put down a thought.

334
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:58.470
Magan: Or say the thing that you want to say, and just put it on paper and let it go or not let it go. But just put it somewhere else. So I did that.

335
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.080
Magan: But I've been sketching actually

336
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how we don't have to get really complex if this is working. If sketching is working. If we take

337
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I want this psychological distress.

338
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To not be focused on if I focus on physical pain of burning. I won't have to be preoccupied with the psychological distress you see right that's typically what that that burning thinking do and it sizzles. The other piece of ways this is so much more distracting this physical pain.

339
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you did was you did some sketching right and some writing you right wrote some words down do both.

340
00:40:50.700 --> 00:41:00.870
Magan: Yeah, because, but it wasn't to stop the word. It was to stop myself from actually going through the action of burning myself.

341
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:06.210
Magan: Because I have far too many scars on my body and I really don't want my kids to see them and

342
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think this same. This is a skill. This is a distraction. But the writing and sketching is a whole lot more than just distraction.

343
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:22.530
Magan: This is something new for me because i don't i wouldn't just fucking sizzled I would have done it right away.

344
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:30.480
Magan: So then the song. It keeps coming back in my head, and it's it's bothering me.

345
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.890
Magan: A lot and

346
00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:42.390
Magan: I just don't want to burn myself because I don't want my kids to see it and

347
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.930
Magan: I feel, you know, and when Andrew sees it.

348
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.220
Magan: He's Oh, his responses.

349
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.860
Magan: Too much and

350
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.700
Magan: It's just too much and

351
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.490
Magan: It feels good to burn, though, Glenn.

352
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I know does

353
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:15.900
Magan: And it's not cutting it's burning like I hate the fucking piece of metal up and I lay it on my skin and that becomes my focus and I don't want it to be.

354
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:16.710
I know

355
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will tell you. So before we go too far. There's, there's three things in here. There's burning, we have something that works. Let's not forget it, it's writing words down and it's sketching.

356
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And where we started before that was what to how, how do I not ruminate over woulda coulda shoulda and then

357
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not what I was trying to do is get you to say use the same writing and sketching instead of woulda coulda shoulda. Oh, I'm a, I'm a, what do you call it, what's the worst thing you call yourself when you were to go to show that I'm what

358
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:55.770
Magan: I'm pathetic.

359
00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so pathetic. Okay, so empathetic. So that's the one you say

360
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: If I sit here in that label downward spiral. I won't want to feel it. I will feel like I this is intolerable. It literally cannot be an option, you do not continue to give evidence to the word pathetic. Then you just do some writing

361
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you gonna go

362
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to sketch

363
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:19.140
Magan: I've been

364
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:26.010
Magan: I've been doing the writing because I I wrote something to my mom.

365
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

366
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:35.820
Magan: I said, I said I practice. So I'm trying, I'm doing all these little exercises that we're going over. I'm trying to implement them in my life.

367
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:41.250
Magan: So all of this stuff is all happening at one time. That's the thing. So the writing.

368
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:47.070
Magan: Was what I wanted to say to my mom, I told her that part that we discussed, I said.

369
00:43:49.350 --> 00:44:05.310
Magan: I told you on your deathbed that I forgave you. What I really didn't I lie to you and I liked myself and I wrote it down. And that's sitting on a piece of paper in this notebook right next to me but I wrote it down.

370
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.020
Magan: To put it somewhere else, just to try it.

371
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.830
Okay.

372
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:21.960
Magan: So I did start one of the exercises that he said try. So that's what I did for that. But when that word comes up and I want to burn

373
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:41.580
Magan: I pick up a pencil and I, I'm trying to draw that's I'm trying. Right now, or I start fidgeting with piece of fabric or I'll smell my pillow or something. I'm just, I'm actively the word still replaying I'm ruminating but I don't want to burn. That's what I'm focusing on not doing

374
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's

375
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Next time you want to do a sketch. I'm going to show you a little art therapy technique here, see if I can get a piece of paper.

376
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: My sketch stuff in here.

377
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean you don't have any have any paper in there with you now.

378
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:18.900
Magan: Grab a pencil.

379
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Even better with

380
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.150
Magan: A pencil.

381
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Marker like let me show you what I'm going to do.

382
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.050
Magan: Oh, I have a black marker.

383
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm gonna do, I'm going to take my paper make a horizontal landscape. I'm going to put a box and inside that box.

384
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is all

385
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: My trauma.

386
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in here.

387
00:45:54.570 --> 00:46:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to show you mine unless you don't want to. And you want to have your own experience without having it tainted by mine.

388
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.090
Magan: No, no, I want you to show me because I don't know what you mean.

389
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:07.830
Magan: Okay.

390
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This is me this whole piece of papers, me and my trauma, the notes the sound that everything all of the yuck is encapsulated only in this space.

391
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The rest of me is all in here.

392
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see what you put in your

393
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Black box.

394
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.560
Magan: Okay.

395
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

396
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see.

397
00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:40.920
What does it look like when it's

398
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

399
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go.

400
00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And

401
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:50.880
Magan: So then there's word and then I scratched him.

402
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you got a word in there and he scratched it and you've got it looks like a note in there too.

403
00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.980
Magan: Yeah, this stupid and dumb.

404
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.990
Okay.

405
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So what else do you need to put in there what came up. So I'm going to give you a few things put something in there and that represents a part of anger that you don't like, like part you didn't like when you were sitting with Chris and Stephanie, real quick, just put that in there.

406
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:26.340
Magan: Okay.

407
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Then let's put in

408
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Pathetic.

409
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's not already there.

410
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside that space.

411
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Really get a sense of whether the

412
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The structure of the square is exactly enough to keep it contained in there. Make sure it's exactly what you need. I noticed for me I needed to make mine thicker.

413
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I made my really sick to make sure nothing could get our and I noticed I needed to do that for mine was really important to me that it'd be off to the side.

414
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to.

415
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Just that vastness of this negative space that's out there that's that's the rest of you, and that the trauma can be contained just in black box for

416
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you call your something else. What do you call yours.

417
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:47.730
Magan: It it

418
00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

419
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.980
Already

420
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.770
Magan: It. Yeah.

421
00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.660
Magan: Yeah, but it feels, it feels centered

422
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Yeah.

423
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:06.420
Magan: It does it feel centered and it feels big to me. Um,

424
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.270
Magan: And I put these

425
00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:12.570
Magan: Well, they look like

426
00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:18.390
Magan: They're like zigzags around

427
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.060
Magan: THE CORNER Around them, but it's kind of like offense.

428
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.630
Magan: Okay, I got like barbed wire.

429
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:28.530
What

430
00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:34.290
Magan: Is that kid. It feels very centered to me.

431
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it's centered. I see that too. It's a kind of in center your page.

432
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So the barbed wire. Try to catch your first response is that to keep stuff away from going in.

433
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: To the it

434
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it

435
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:52.650
Magan: Look like

436
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.950
Magan: It, it's the barbed wire is

437
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:06.210
Magan: It feels both like I'm trying to protect the stuff on the outside from seeing

438
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but

439
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.310
Magan: But

440
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.860
Magan: But I, but I know it's there.

441
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.660
Magan: It doesn't feel like I'm trying to protect myself from it.

442
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:28.470
Magan: So worth it from myself. It feels like I'm trying to protect myself from it.

443
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So go further out from the barbed wire and see if you

444
00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Have other aspects of yourself, or if you are only your trauma. Notice if you want some other representation of you symbolized in a sketch in that negative space.

445
00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.690
Magan: Right here, I have mom. Okay.

446
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

447
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:24.180
Magan: And I have dispatcher headset.

448
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And mom and then two kids.

449
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:32.490
Magan: And there's a heart.

450
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I see it right there off to the right.

451
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

452
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Dispatch your headset as well.

453
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.090
Magan: And maybe

454
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.460
Magan: paintbrush an artist.

455
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.280
Magan: That's all I have so far.

456
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let your audience gaze between that corner mom heart kids and the and the box and just moving back and forth. Just let your eyes gaze back and forth and sort of

457
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get a sense of presence together.

458
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The distance proximity

459
00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's paying attention to it.

460
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Something comes up, let me know.

461
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.110
Magan: Well, I noticed that

462
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:10.980
Magan: They're all separated actually quite a lot in the open space outside of the bark box.

463
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:16.050
Magan: Outside of it bark box.

464
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is.

465
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, bark box.

466
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:22.590
Magan: Barbed box.

467
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:32.130
Magan: Mom is where I started, because that's where it started.

468
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:35.670
Magan: That's where it started for me.

469
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.650
Magan: I'm

470
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:40.980
Magan: And

471
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:49.650
Magan: It followed with dispatching but dispatching I have it separated from mom. So that's something I want

472
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.160
Magan: spilling out into

473
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:56.190
Magan: My mom place.

474
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:06.870
Magan: And I have my art as my third thing. And I think that's invalid because that's something that I found more recently.

475
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:17.640
Magan: And it is separated from mom and dispatcher because when I'm painting. I actually really want to be left alone.

476
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.090
Magan: Because that

477
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:24.600
Magan: That's my time to just

478
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.640
Magan: Feel

479
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:34.470
Magan: Or not feel, actually it's I don't feel I just paint and I focus on my

480
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:40.650
Magan: Details and I have such control such control when I'm painting.

481
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:42.660
Magan: Um,

482
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:44.550
Magan: I can

483
00:55:45.960 --> 00:56:01.050
Magan: I can put that extra line there, and it doesn't mean anything. I can add this color because I think it's beautiful, but the kids need to stay out of the garage and leave me alone. I know they want to paint with me but

484
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.050
Magan: That's my time.

485
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.440
Magan: But all of it. I noticed is separate.

486
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

487
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.040
Magan: And the art is closest to the BB box.

488
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I wrote that, too. I drew kind of what you drew just to kind of get a feel for it.

489
00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

490
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:30.510
Magan: Bark box.

491
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.420
Magan: Think that because

492
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:38.730
Magan: When I paint.

493
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:43.530
Magan: I tried to escape what's inside of that box.

494
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's as we come to the top of the hour. Megan. Let's use what you have, let's use this. Let's make sure you have the supplies.

495
00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure you're protecting that time that you're doing it on a regular basis. It doesn't have to be in dire straits when you can't take it anymore. You have to escape. It can be a routine part of self.

496
00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Care enjoyment. It doesn't have to just be at that final hour before he may be can't take it anymore. Really just saying I need to have this half hour, even if it's a little bit or whatever the timing is

497
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's also not only on a regular basis. But when you start to have

498
00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Come potion that impulse to want to burn

499
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:37.410
Magan: When you

500
00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Are action.

501
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: sketching and drawing and writing the words was working as a distraction for

502
00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:49.290
Magan: Me.

503
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think

504
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be pretty important to keeping sketch pads in your car, keeping them bedside keeping them in a lot of different places.

505
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe if you keep them out of kids hands apply, then you'll have some that haven't been sort of played with yet. But do you see how you've already got something pretty good in place here.

506
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: She's from

507
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.270
Magan: To sketch on those intrusive thoughts happen.

508
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:20.280
Magan: Focus on that.

509
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.300
Uh huh.

510
00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

511
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But the question kind of comes down to, you can either be getting deeper into that negative thinking

512
00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:37.710
Magan: Or

513
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation is not because that reinforces sort of that. I don't know if maybe you could do.

514
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe the sketch is putting it containing it in a box maybe somehow having it really contained, much like what we did here today.

515
00:58:53.610 --> 00:59:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And the rest of it is, is you and drawing those beautiful things all around it. But this history.

516
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right is smaller and smaller, and it's contained and it's further and further off in a way, or maybe your relationship with it will change. I don't know. I think it'll start to evolve over time, but

517
00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to how your sketches change. Is it always going to be in the center. What, what did the kids think of it being in the center, but uh you as mom thinking to being the center. What are you as dispatcher

518
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it taking up more space than you're sketching and painting then is, is the heart so small and this trauma so big.

519
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at the relationship just paying attention to it. Does it stay that way. In the next drawing and what does it feel like to draw that smaller but maybe what's in there is more specific just really getting into it a little like coming at it from those kind of ways.

520
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now what came up was it central and it's a pretty big. It's the biggest figure in there.

521
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.470
Magan: At it. Yeah.

522
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And how will it feel for you if you sketch it differently box a bark box.

523
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And just play wonder what it would feel like if it was here. What if it was smaller, what happens to the heart. What happens to Mom, what happens to my kids. What happens to dispatch. What happens to painting. There's more room for it. I don't know. Let's see what happens with it, but

524
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really glad you're not burning because obviously I don't want you to to hurt your skin. We're only kind of set with with this one body.

525
01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But this stuff we're talking about this can change. We can change our relationship with that bar to box.

526
01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: See if it needs some more to keep the mom, the kids dispatch painting it being affected, maybe the bar needs to be longer bigger sharper needed it needs more to it.

527
01:00:52.680 --> 01:01:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's about keeping that stuff in there. Maybe it isn't. Maybe it's about a door, you have a key and we can take out each one and we can say, Actually, I don't even want you to hear anymore and you I want gone forever. I don't know. But keep keep with that imagery

528
01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see. Let's see how that evolves, but I love, I love what you already have. You have this this ability to use this painting and and if you can't get to paint right away, flip a piece of paper over and sketch

529
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.420
Magan: Like, I will give it a focus

530
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And and we're out of time, but I have been thinking a lot about

531
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The actual notes.

532
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have been thinking a lot about it and I'm trying my best to come up with some sort of specific technique.

533
01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may evolve from you, you may end up you know may come from these things of, you know, having it sizzle away and we'll come up with a way

534
01:01:55.830 --> 01:02:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Each note will transform or maybe it'll turn into something else. I don't really know. I'm open, but I've certainly been giving it some thought because you've gotta

535
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:05.730
Magan: Go. Bye.

536
01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:06.870
Yeah.

537
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:13.080
Magan: So we can we can delve into that next week. If you're okay with it. Yeah.

538
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool, so eight o'clock on April 24

539
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.800
Magan: I will be there.
