00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.109
Dominique Pozo: Hi Daniel

2
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.890
Hi.

3
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.650
Dominique Pozo: Bo. Sorry, I just

4
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.480
Dominique Pozo: I see your name on the bottom of the screen. And I just say it, but yeah.

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.010
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, no problem.

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.930
Dominique Pozo: How's it going,

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.850
Nathaniel Sims: It's going okay

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.390
Dominique Pozo: Um,

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.470
Dominique Pozo: Well, what would you like to address today.

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.030
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know.

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.040
Nathaniel Sims: I

12
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.580
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I don't know.

13
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.920
Dominique Pozo: What's going on.

14
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.780
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know, I just feel really angry today is the reason

15
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.210
Dominique Pozo: That something triggered.

16
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.810
Nathaniel Sims: I'm not sure.

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.990
Nathaniel Sims: I don't think so. I mean, I just

18
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.610
Nathaniel Sims: I had a fairly normal day I just

19
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.200
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know. I'm just upset or angry, I guess, for some reason.

20
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.030
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

21
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.360
Dominique Pozo: I mean, the first thing that comes to my mind is you're actually choosing recovery which part of that is choosing to feel things that in the past, you would

22
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.490
Dominique Pozo: Probably

23
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.610
Dominique Pozo: You know gloss over by using and then you bury those feelings so it makes sense to me that some of this is coming up.

24
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.840
Right.

25
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.060
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, it's been so long since I've

26
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.240
Nathaniel Sims: Not had any kind of feelings.

27
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.880
Nathaniel Sims: I guess it's just

28
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.710
Nathaniel Sims: It's not even that really significant, but it just feels more significant than it is, you know,

29
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.370
Dominique Pozo: And sometimes when I have waves of anger.

30
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:43.860
Dominique Pozo: There's a couple reasons why that could happen in one oftentimes is that my boundaries have been crossed did anything happen in the last 24 hours where you felt that you know your boundaries were crossed or something, but kind of pass the limit for you.

31
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.150
Nathaniel Sims: I'm

32
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.050
Nathaniel Sims: Not really. I mean,

33
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.720
Nathaniel Sims: I guess my

34
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.160
Nathaniel Sims: Me and my my girlfriend have been fighting, but

35
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.540
Nathaniel Sims: It's not really anything out of the ordinary.

36
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.020
Dominique Pozo: Is that what your fingers connected to

37
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.960
Nathaniel Sims: I don't think so, because, I mean,

38
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.630
Nathaniel Sims: She just walked in the door like a minute before I got on here so I haven't really had a chance to talk to her, but

39
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.570
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know.

40
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:52.830
Dominique Pozo: I'm gonna pull up a feelings, a list of feelings through the nonviolent communication, the work that I just really resonate with and a big part of the work is identifying feelings naming needs and then making requests. And it's really helpful to have

41
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.510
Dominique Pozo: A

42
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.510
Dominique Pozo: Just a guide as to being able to name more feelings that might be present.

43
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.010
Nathaniel Sims: Okay.

44
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.500
Dominique Pozo: So I'm pulling it up right now. Let's see.

45
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.570
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

46
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.690
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

47
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.550
Dominique Pozo: Let's get back to you. So I'm going to share the screen so just if you can get a piece of paper and a pen, that would be great.

48
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.930
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I got one.

49
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.920
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. So just pick, pick

50
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.710
Dominique Pozo: Pick maybe the top

51
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:48.150
Dominique Pozo: Maybe five or so that you're really able to connect with. And there's two parts of this page. So I'll hold this one up for a couple minutes, and then I'll scroll through and if there's more than five. Go for it. But definitely, at least five

52
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.400
Dominique Pozo: Can I move to the lower part of the page.

53
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.100
Nathaniel Sims: Oh yeah, sure. Okay.

54
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.410
There we go.

55
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.430
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, I think I got

56
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.500
Nathaniel Sims: I got six

57
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.430
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Let's, um, so tell me what what you got.

58
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.500
Nathaniel Sims: I got exhausted.

59
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.980
Nathaniel Sims: Ashamed anxious

60
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.970
Nathaniel Sims: Irritable annoyed and depress

61
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.760
Dominique Pozo: Do any of those

62
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.780
Dominique Pozo: Or do you have any like stories connected to any of those or instances that you can relate to them.

63
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.730
Nathaniel Sims: Um,

64
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.230
Nathaniel Sims: I'm just

65
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.870
Nathaniel Sims: I guess I

66
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:05.730
Nathaniel Sims: I'm exhausted, because I work all the time. And I'm and then I'm

67
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.580
Nathaniel Sims: Trying to do

68
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.070
Nathaniel Sims: I'm trying to do too many things at once.

69
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.410
Nathaniel Sims: And

70
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.250
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, I know why I'm exhausted. I just

71
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.050
Nathaniel Sims: Sometimes I feel like I'd rather be busy than

72
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.700
Nathaniel Sims: Than that and and being busy is not

73
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.950
Nathaniel Sims: Is not

74
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.270
Nathaniel Sims: Something that doesn't take energy. You know, I mean, it takes a lot of energy to be busy.

75
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.140
Nathaniel Sims: And

76
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.300
Nathaniel Sims: Ashamed I guess I'm ashamed because I

77
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.630
Nathaniel Sims: Let so many people down around me.

78
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.810
Nathaniel Sims: For so long that

79
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.290
Nathaniel Sims: I don't even think

80
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.100
Nathaniel Sims: A lot of them know how hard. I've been trying the last few weeks.

81
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.350
Nathaniel Sims: And then

82
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:27.450
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's let's let on for a moment. So two things that I'm hearing needs are maybe some acknowledgement. Is that something that would be a am

83
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.770
Dominique Pozo: Or validation. Would that be something that would be important and a value to you.

84
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.790
Yeah.

85
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.310
Dominique Pozo: Okay, can you write those down.

86
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:39.960
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

87
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:49.770
Dominique Pozo: So acknowledgement validation and then know what the first thing that you were saying, do you think some rest and space to be

88
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.890
Dominique Pozo: Are those some needs that are inherent to those feelings. You're having

89
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.240
Yeah.

90
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.600
Dominique Pozo: Okay, some more rest and space.

91
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:06.690
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

92
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.250
Nathaniel Sims: I feel anxious

93
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.350
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, I don't feel anxious right now, but I know that

94
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.890
Nathaniel Sims: I feel I get. I get

95
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.820
Nathaniel Sims: This and this is I think a reason why I have problems sleeping is because

96
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.420
Nathaniel Sims: I will, I will wake up at around like two

97
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.010
Nathaniel Sims: Three o'clock in the morning and I

98
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.930
Nathaniel Sims: I stand right up out of it. It doesn't matter how deep sleep that I've been

99
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.440
Nathaniel Sims: I stand right up and I

100
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.560
Nathaniel Sims: I have to like shake my arms out and then I I feel like I have like this.

101
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.290
Nathaniel Sims: This heart, my heart rate is going and then I'm like,

102
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.620
Nathaniel Sims: I just, I feel like really worried about what's going on.

103
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.710
Nathaniel Sims: And then it takes me about a half an hour to

104
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.930
Nathaniel Sims: Calm down.

105
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.810
Nathaniel Sims: And that, I think that

106
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.840
Nathaniel Sims: interruption of my sleep is

107
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.540
Nathaniel Sims: Not helping you know

108
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:40.230
Dominique Pozo: Hmm. So it sounds like the rest. Again, like that's the neat I'm hearing us for more deep sustained dressed for your whole system.

109
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.030
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

110
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:51.150
Dominique Pozo: Is there anything else you need in these these early hours of the morning when you're up. Can you identify any other needs that are there.

111
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.390
Nathaniel Sims: That I need. I don't know.

112
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.050
Dominique Pozo: Like do you need to be comforted in those times. So

113
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.870
Nathaniel Sims: I'm not sure. I don't know if that would help or not.

114
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.530
Nathaniel Sims: I've never had that

115
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.480
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Well, definitely. The rest is coming up again just

116
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.010
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

117
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.790
Dominique Pozo: What's that

118
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.490
Nathaniel Sims: I just sometimes I'm just so

119
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.320
Nathaniel Sims: Tired.

120
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.950
Nathaniel Sims: When I was on heroin had an excuse, you know, but now I don't. So it's like

121
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.150
Nathaniel Sims: But, but then again, I can't

122
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.190
Nathaniel Sims: Get rest.

123
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.750
Nathaniel Sims: To alleviate that tiredness, you know, it just

124
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.700
Nathaniel Sims: I don't know.

125
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.980
Dominique Pozo: Well, it sounds like you're really being confronted at the moment with

126
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.320
Dominique Pozo: Your yourself is still working towards a place of more balance and

127
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.040
Dominique Pozo: And you're not there yet quite yet.

128
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.390
Yeah.

129
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.350
Dominique Pozo: How about them.

130
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.320
Dominique Pozo: About some of the other ones.

131
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.070
Nathaniel Sims: I put irritable.

132
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.370
Nathaniel Sims: Annoyed and depressed.

133
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.430
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, that's probably all has

134
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.490
Nathaniel Sims: Has to do with the same thing, you know.

135
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.020
Dominique Pozo: We're name that same thing

136
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.770
Nathaniel Sims: Just being tired, I guess.

137
00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.870
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm definitely been tired is huge. I mean impact so much

138
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:02.970
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

139
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.360
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah I don't I don't feel

140
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.100
Nathaniel Sims: Like I have any motivation, you know, to get

141
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.240
Nathaniel Sims: The things that I want to get done.

142
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:23.970
Nathaniel Sims: Done.

143
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:31.470
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

144
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:44.760
Dominique Pozo: How's it going with and it sounds like you're pretty full on with work. So I don't even know if this is a relevant question right now, but I am wondering, did. Were you able to make any time or space.

145
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.750
Dominique Pozo: To play your drums. This week, or

146
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.900
Nathaniel Sims: And now, not, not yet.

147
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.980
Nathaniel Sims: I'm planning on taking

148
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.510
Nathaniel Sims: I'm just gonna go in, maybe for the first half orc tomorrow.

149
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.410
Nathaniel Sims: And then I want to get out.

150
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.080
Nathaniel Sims: And

151
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.710
Nathaniel Sims: Maybe go hiking or something.

152
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.880
Nathaniel Sims: Only because

153
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.190
Nathaniel Sims: I, I worked 312 hour days, Monday, Tuesday, or Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

154
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.900
Nathaniel Sims: So there were three long days.

155
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.660
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

156
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:35.970
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

157
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.350
Nathaniel Sims: So I don't really have to work very long tomorrow.

158
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:55.020
Dominique Pozo: What sounds good. Sounds good to balance out so much work with some pleasure. Some pleasurable activity and being outside and not having to show up in a particular way.

159
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.010
Yeah.

160
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:11.280
Dominique Pozo: Well, what do you think you need today, what would be most helpful. Would it be helpful to you know continue on with the session for another half hour or do you think resting is what you really

161
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.900
Dominique Pozo: would serve you most today.

162
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.000
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I see some rest without

163
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:26.490
Dominique Pozo: I mean, it's good for me to hear what's going on with you and it's a good check in. I am definitely

164
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.520
Dominique Pozo: One question that's coming up for me is, you know, have, have there been any suicidal thoughts, no last week.

165
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:38.580
Dominique Pozo: Okay, good.

166
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:58.470
Dominique Pozo: Well, I'm here, I'm here and I'm happy to be here for another half hour. I just, I really want to check into your what you need. Most today. So I'm hearing rest and and I also want you to know. I'm here if you wanted to keep talking.

167
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.410
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, I think just

168
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.590
Nathaniel Sims: I'm just tired.

169
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:17.820
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

170
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:32.820
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's call it a day. I, I really appreciated that in the past with my therapist when I'm just so worn out that will back in those times. I was able to see them in person and I would just take a nap. I would sleep.

171
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:41.460
Dominique Pozo: In my therapist had all these stuffed animals, and I would go in the corner. And I would just sleep for the rest of the session because I really needed that.

172
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.650
Dominique Pozo: Um,

173
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:52.230
Dominique Pozo: It's awesome. It is awesome and I really appreciate it. It's like, Gosh, I needed to carve out this time for therapy to just get some rest.

174
00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:03.030
Dominique Pozo: So let's, let's just do that today. Let's call it good and I am really recognizing your depletion exhaustion.

175
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.140
Okay.

176
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.180
Dominique Pozo: And then

177
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:13.950
Dominique Pozo: What before we do that, what can you do next week to maybe create a little more balance so that you don't get to this point.

178
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.520
Nathaniel Sims: I'm

179
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:28.440
Nathaniel Sims: Sorry if I get to bed earlier. And if I

180
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.000
Nathaniel Sims: If I

181
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.500
Nathaniel Sims: Don't spend so much time at work. I mean,

182
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:46.500
Nathaniel Sims: Because of this virus thing going on. There's only three of us that work. So we're doing

183
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.970
Nathaniel Sims: We're doing the work of like 25 people three

184
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.040
Nathaniel Sims: Like

185
00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.450
Nathaniel Sims: Maybe I can tell I could I could I could tell my boss that hey,

186
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.830
Nathaniel Sims: I need a little bit more me time

187
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.110
Dominique Pozo: And I

188
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.750
Dominique Pozo: Think he he or she would be receptive to that and meet that need for you.

189
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.190
Nathaniel Sims: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

190
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.270
Dominique Pozo: Oh, good.

191
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.820
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, I've always been

192
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.690
Nathaniel Sims: The go to guy for anything.

193
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.160
Nathaniel Sims: I mean if if he needed me to drive to

194
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.980
Nathaniel Sims: Unreal at five o'clock in the afternoon. I could do it, you know.

195
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.890
Nathaniel Sims: So maybe I just tell them, hey, I need a little bit more

196
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.490
Nathaniel Sims: More of a

197
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.340
Nathaniel Sims: laid back schedule.

198
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.190
Nathaniel Sims: And then

199
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.540
Nathaniel Sims: The other thing is, maybe

200
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.090
Nathaniel Sims: I've just I think I've been Worrying. Worrying about

201
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.410
Nathaniel Sims: Other people around me since I've started the program.

202
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.510
Nathaniel Sims: That

203
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:20.130
Nathaniel Sims: You know, I think they've been I think they've been worried about me. So I've been trying to reassure them that this is something that is good, you know,

204
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.080
Nathaniel Sims: And that kind of got me stressed out a little bit and

205
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.100
Nathaniel Sims: Some so maybe I I think I need to focus on myself a little more

206
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:44.100
Dominique Pozo: That's great. I mean, what comes up for me when I hear that is maybe this tendency to care take others which it's not your responsibility, you know,

207
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.020
Dominique Pozo: Everyone as adults are responsible for their own feelings and communicate them.

208
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.810
Dominique Pozo: And you're you're in a really deep process right now that's that requires a lot of attention.

209
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.860
Yeah.

210
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:07.440
Dominique Pozo: And one thing I'm catching from what you're saying is, you know, maybe I can talk to my boss and ask for more laid back schedule and maybe I can

211
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:23.010
Dominique Pozo: Focus more on myself. I'm just going to invite you to really own it. Like, I'm going to talk to my boss and request a more laid back schedule and I'm going to take this week and really focus on me and not worry about what others are going through in regards to me so much.

212
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.240
Okay.

213
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:31.110
Nathaniel Sims: Because that maybe it kind of leaves a backdoor of, like, Yeah, I could do it. Maybe not. And

214
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:37.380
Dominique Pozo: I just, I really want to support you in committing to these things that I, I believe you know will help you

215
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.370
Yeah.

216
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.290
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, that's a good idea. I, I always I always tend to leave that back door because

217
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.240
Nathaniel Sims: If somebody is in distress or needs my help, and

218
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.740
Nathaniel Sims: I

219
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.920
Nathaniel Sims: I've, I've always

220
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.980
Nathaniel Sims: at the drop of a hat like

221
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.370
Nathaniel Sims: Two o'clock in the morning. If somebody broke down. You know I'm always the guy they thought

222
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.730
Nathaniel Sims: That maybe I need to put my foot down, you know,

223
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:12.930
Maybe

224
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:14.760
Nathaniel Sims: So,

225
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.790
Nathaniel Sims: I mean, yes, I need to put my

226
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:26.460
Dominique Pozo: This is gonna be a good one to keep catching yourself just really pay attention to the amount of times that you say maybe

227
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:27.780
Nathaniel Sims: Right, right.

228
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:28.560
Yeah.

229
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:48.810
Dominique Pozo: And I think I just want to reflect back that with these actions you're taking. It's all in the service of your recovery. It's not to, you know, slack off at work or dismiss people's feelings. It's, it's to make hopefully make yourself a better person for your work and your people.

230
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:50.220
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah.

231
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.410
Dominique Pozo: And namely yourself. Yeah.

232
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:14.640
Dominique Pozo: Alright, Bo. I'm going to just honor your need for rest and and call it good for today. Just going to look at my schedule here. So I have you I have you down for next week, same time. Does that sound good.

233
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.800
Nathaniel Sims: Yeah, that's works.

234
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:17.550
Okay.

235
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.040
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. Well, and I really wish you a restored of the evening.

236
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.810
Nathaniel Sims: Okay, thank you very much.

237
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.040
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Bye bye.
