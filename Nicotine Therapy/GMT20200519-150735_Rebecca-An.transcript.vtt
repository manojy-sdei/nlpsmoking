00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.660
Galaxy Note8: Can you hear me.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, I can hear you. Oh.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.260
Galaxy Note8: Good. I'm Peggy

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi, Peggy. I'M BECCA

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.930
Galaxy Note8: Testing.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's called a bio psychosocial I just have a bunch of questions to ask you.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, just gathering information is all it is.

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The first question on the bio psychosocial is what brings you to bright heart and why now.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.150
Galaxy Note8: Um, well, I've been. I've been here with Brian her for about a month now already and

12
00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:06.930
Galaxy Note8: I had moved from Los Angeles to a very rural community in New Mexico where they don't have any providers at all. Man is there aren't any and

13
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:30.540
Galaxy Note8: I didn't realize that before I moved. I checked in, and there was were listings, but they were no longer valid. And so I was frantically trying to find a provider and I had to start flying to Los Angeles to see my doctor and she's crazy and that's how I found right her

14
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um,

15
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any pain issues.

16
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.010
Galaxy Note8: Yes, I'm chronic pain patient and I have been for

17
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:56.250
Galaxy Note8: Let's see. I had a car accident in 2012 and I already had degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. Prior to that, and

18
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.130
Galaxy Note8: After the accident, it became crying, just really

19
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.770
Galaxy Note8: Nasty lumbar pain and

20
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.410
Galaxy Note8: What happened.

21
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:25.950
Galaxy Note8: For me, I try physical therapy and really didn't help much, and I didn't want to have surgery at the time I was really just paranoid about having surgery so

22
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.180
Galaxy Note8: I had to work and my is transferred to cedar Sinai pain control clinic.

23
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.980
Galaxy Note8: And

24
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.220
Galaxy Note8: There I was put on

25
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.980
Galaxy Note8: What was it, I think it was first it was Viking in

26
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:13.650
Galaxy Note8: And I'm my pain was increasing at that time pretty steadily and it wasn't really doing much of anything after I developed a tolerance. This is like a year and then so I saw another specialist at Cedars, and morphine. And that pretty much

27
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.540
Galaxy Note8: Help. But I was just a

28
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.000
Galaxy Note8: basket case I you know I was falling asleep standing out in the elevator when I would go downstairs from my apartment and

29
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:43.200
Galaxy Note8: It just felt just really out of it. And so I stayed on that for a while and I was complaining about it and to try something else.

30
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:53.760
Galaxy Note8: And then I got the bright idea. I would just take myself off of it and I would, everything would be fine. And it wasn't at all fine.

31
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.220
Galaxy Note8: I had really horrific withdrawals for about three days and then I I was

32
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:16.260
Galaxy Note8: I went back to cedars and spoke with the specialist or his nurse, actually. And she said, well, there's this medication and she told me about the box of

33
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.040
Galaxy Note8: Text and I saw the specialist there.

34
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.660
Galaxy Note8: Were another clinic. He's actually a gastroenterologist. I don't know. Hi. Yeah, doing this that

35
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:46.110
Galaxy Note8: So I went. The first time I when I decided not to do it because I didn't want to be in another long, long term medication and I didn't realize how long term so awesome can be

36
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.310
Galaxy Note8: It's. I mean, I've gone off of it before. It's by far the worst withdrawal. It's horrible.

37
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.610
Galaxy Note8: And so

38
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.220
Galaxy Note8: I didn't go I but then a few days later I just couldn't tolerate what I was feeling like. And so I went on the

39
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:14.940
Galaxy Note8: The sub attacks and I've been on that ever since. And it controls.

40
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:27.420
Galaxy Note8: It controls my pain. You know, I, I've always been pain and I take a lot of aspirin Tylenol as well. But I don't realize it until I

41
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:41.460
Galaxy Note8: Like when I wake up in the morning. I can hardly move so it does help because after I take my medicine that I'm, I'm okay. I'm not great. I'm OK. So the plan is now.

42
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:54.360
Galaxy Note8: I'm going to my primary care provider here in Silver City, where I live, has referred me to a surgeon and I'm going to have it. The surgery done

43
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:06.330
Galaxy Note8: That I need in another state, because it's such a small town here and that kind of put off because of the coven

44
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.080
Galaxy Note8: Thing and so

45
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:21.210
Galaxy Note8: Now I have to make an appointment to go in and it's going to be a while before he can see me because he's backed up with elective surgeries.

46
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:35.190
Galaxy Note8: And I'm just going to have it done as soon as I can feasibly do it because I'll be off work for six weeks is that I don't have short term disability plan. So that's an issue to right now.

47
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.760
Galaxy Note8: So that's kind of in a nutshell. The, the whole story.

48
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, any substance abuse. History

49
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:53.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No. Okay, any past mental health treatment.

50
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.870
Galaxy Note8: Yes I gnosis. I have panic disorder and OCD.

51
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, any

52
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past suicidal thoughts or attempts

53
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.920
Galaxy Note8: Many, many, many years ago.

54
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.080
Galaxy Note8: Before I was properly diagnosed with OCD and panic disorder. This is showing how old I am.

55
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:30.690
Galaxy Note8: It was before they're even terms like OCD and panic disorder, or at least not. It wasn't a common thing anyone heard of. And I really thought I was willing insane.

56
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:40.050
Galaxy Note8: So I, I used to think. If it gets any worse I i'm not going to live like this because I was afraid I was going to do something horrible. I just

57
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:49.650
Galaxy Note8: I'm just going to completely lose my mind and do something just outrageous or you'd like I have these repetitive thoughts of

58
00:07:51.060 --> 00:08:04.020
Galaxy Note8: What if I went crazy. And when into a post office and shot, everybody. And that would just go over and over. Not that I would ever want to do that. But I, you know, it was scary.

59
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.580
Galaxy Note8: So,

60
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.160
Galaxy Note8: I did that was

61
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:24.900
Galaxy Note8: I went undiagnosed for 12 years and in that 12 years that was part of my plan if it got to the point where I was going, you know, in my mind, I thought that I might be

62
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:33.750
Galaxy Note8: You know, sent to the asylum and some god they place and I was really naive. I was 15 you know

63
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.250
Galaxy Note8: And

64
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:43.800
Galaxy Note8: I was in also in therapy for 10 years and during this time was in the 70s.

65
00:08:46.620 --> 00:09:07.530
Galaxy Note8: In the school of thought was that talk therapy, you know, if you dig deep enough then and hit on some moment of brilliant observation that everything will go away. It doesn't work like that. And so

66
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:16.410
Galaxy Note8: Yeah, that's a long answer to a simple question, but not anymore I after I started on antidepressants.

67
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:28.140
Galaxy Note8: In 1985 was six weeks. I had no symptoms at all. It was just gone so

68
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, that was awesome.

69
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. To be relieved to that.

70
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thank you.

71
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:48.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK, the next question is, can you tell me a little bit about your family history, the family that you grew up in

72
00:09:49.950 --> 00:10:00.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where your parents together throughout your whole life. Where did the divorce of so what age were you. How many siblings do you have just tell me about your whole family diet and family dynamics, growing up.

73
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.350
Okay.

74
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.910
Galaxy Note8: Um, well, I was adopted.

75
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.150
Galaxy Note8: My biological mother.

76
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.340
Galaxy Note8: Had

77
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.520
Galaxy Note8: Major substance abuse issues and

78
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.520
Galaxy Note8: Was not

79
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:34.980
Galaxy Note8: Able to to see her way to having a child. She was 21 I think at the time and she basically left the hospital and left me hit the hospital and

80
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:53.430
Galaxy Note8: So I was in institutions for first year of my life. I don't Porsche remember anything. But I was apparently a hard to place. I don't. And I really wonder sometimes why I have my mother, my why anybody ever told me that

81
00:10:53.550 --> 00:11:03.540
Galaxy Note8: So we asked, but I'm because I'm Native American. And back then it was like people wanted white kids in there are adopting

82
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:17.400
Galaxy Note8: Uh huh. And so my adoptive parent refers my foster parents for like a year and then they decided, I guess that I worked out and they

83
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:29.280
Galaxy Note8: Adopted me and then I was everything was was fine. They're all older and

84
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.550
Galaxy Note8: Have been waiting a long time for a child.

85
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:55.440
Galaxy Note8: Didn't know what their fertility issues where it's just very long late for them so they I was their only child. I was very close to my adopted father, and when I was seven. He died suddenly and

86
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.900
Galaxy Note8: That pretty much that threw me for a big loop as a kid.

87
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:20.310
Galaxy Note8: So the life changed rather drastically after he passed away because my mother wasn't prepared to be a single parent my adopted mother financially. She wasn't prepared. It was just not she was only 37 when he died so

88
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.630
Galaxy Note8: It was, you know, I grew up in pretty much in poverty and

89
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:51.540
Galaxy Note8: Was stressed out mom who's very, very kind and very loving and overly indulging in many ways. And I think to show our love it. She was just a really, really lovely person who maybe wasn't prepared to be a single mom, then rely on her own judgment.

90
00:12:52.680 --> 00:13:16.830
Galaxy Note8: And I got back together were reunited with my biological mother and found out I had two younger sisters one who's a year younger than I am just actually under a year and one who is nine years younger when I was there. It was guess I was 18 or 19 when I met them.

91
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:29.520
Galaxy Note8: And had a pretty much ongoing relationship with my sisters. Ever since my mother and I have never been close. She's

92
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:39.300
Galaxy Note8: She's an alcoholic, she doesn't. She no longer drinks, but she doesn't have a program. She doesn't know she just

93
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.630
Galaxy Note8: She's in her 80s. Now, and she just was able to somehow not drink so

94
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:59.280
Galaxy Note8: She was a terrible alcoholic really nasty drunk and I so I don't drink any alcohol at all and I have not in 20 years

95
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:15.000
Galaxy Note8: Because I know I carry the genetic vulnerability for alcoholism out. I never want attempt that date. So she was a drug addict as well. When I was pregnant with me.

96
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:37.650
Galaxy Note8: And see my sister's my younger sister has the same psychiatric disorder. I do. I think my mother does. She's undiagnosed just probably self medicating with alcohol and drugs and I don't really know. And then I have my get my sister was a year younger than I am.

97
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.040
Galaxy Note8: She and I were the closest

98
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.470
Galaxy Note8: And

99
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:51.060
Galaxy Note8: She's she she's done fairly well. So, but they were raised by her

100
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any military background.

101
00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:56.580
Huh.

102
00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.820
Galaxy Note8: My, my biological father

103
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was in the military, you

104
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:05.220
Galaxy Note8: Huh.

105
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He was in the military.

106
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.480
Galaxy Note8: He was

107
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.030
Galaxy Note8: Yo, yeah. He, um,

108
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:19.320
Galaxy Note8: My biological father, my mother at an officer's club.

109
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:29.940
Galaxy Note8: She has been about 20 he was 27 and they only knew met for one night, they never saw each other again after that.

110
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:49.350
Galaxy Note8: And so he was a career air force officer and he kept working into his late 60s, maybe early 70s it with the Air Force in the CIA and

111
00:15:50.700 --> 00:16:00.060
Galaxy Note8: He has children. He has four children from his marriage and from his to have his marriages.

112
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.650
Galaxy Note8: And

113
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.390
Galaxy Note8: So,

114
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.520
Galaxy Note8: He's really a nice person, but he won't acknowledge this. My father

115
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

116
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:19.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, um, do you have any kind of legal background any trouble with the law throughout your life.

117
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you tell me how it was for you in school.

118
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you graduate. Did you have a learning disability. What was your education, like for you.

119
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:37.590
Galaxy Note8: I did really well in school when I was a child.

120
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.150
Galaxy Note8: I had undiagnosed ADHD.

121
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:48.450
Galaxy Note8: I still have it. And, but I had no idea until

122
00:16:49.980 --> 00:17:06.960
Galaxy Note8: You know, five years ago that I that this wasn't even an issue, you know, and, um, but I did really well in school and I had testing done and all sorts of crazy things. For some reason, something

123
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.040
Galaxy Note8: Flag to me and they

124
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:26.910
Galaxy Note8: I was able to skip the grade. And that was tough as a really shy kid and I could have probably done well without that disruption, but I was

125
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:39.090
Galaxy Note8: Doing so I guess I was doing pretty well, but it's hard when you're doing really well in school and then suddenly you're skipped your grade.

126
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:54.180
Galaxy Note8: And you are trying to catch up with a whole year that you missed and you're at the bottom of the heap, you're no longer the best student in the class, you're kind of, you know, trying to navigate

127
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.080
Galaxy Note8: A

128
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.990
Galaxy Note8: Foreign and a challenging situation that I don't think a lot of children.

129
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.170
Galaxy Note8: Are ready for. It's a big deal to a kid to

130
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:27.690
Galaxy Note8: All of a sudden, have to be in another classroom. Everybody's looking at you like you're some sort of Martian or something. I was so shy just incredibly shy so so that was hard. And then in high school, everything just went to hell.

131
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.370
Galaxy Note8: I was bored and

132
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:44.370
Galaxy Note8: Just didn't want to go to school, I would that I would leave the house in the morning and then not go to school and just hang out with my friends and

133
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.210
Galaxy Note8: Yeah, I mean, it was

134
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.380
Galaxy Note8: It wasn't good.

135
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.620
Galaxy Note8: Up until I was

136
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.390
Galaxy Note8: 15 and then I was

137
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.470

Galaxy Note8: High. Hi.

152
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:36.450
Galaxy Note8: job that requires a lot of time and a lot of energy and a lot of commitment.

153
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.470
I'm

154
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.970
Galaxy Note8: Going to that.

155
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:49.800
Galaxy Note8: It's, it's not possible. I'll lose my job if I do if I, you know,

156
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:57.120
Galaxy Note8: succumb to test how I feel sometimes and I do have this job. That's also like just

157
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:08.190
Galaxy Note8: takes up a lot of my thoughts. But yeah, I never been very good at.

158
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.080
Galaxy Note8: I can do one thing at a time, but

159
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.590
Galaxy Note8: When I get overwhelmed overwhelmed. I just

160
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.540
Galaxy Note8: Inside, I just freak out and

161
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:38.880
Galaxy Note8: Fortunately, I know I just start having anxiety attacks not regularly like I used to. But I guess I'll have some sort of weird symptom that will pop up and stick with me and there's no foundation for it idiopathic symptoms and

162
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:54.840
Galaxy Note8: So yeah, I would like to get a handle on things because my life is structured in such a way that with this job that I have. And I've been have had the same the same thing for six years.

163
00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:57.450
Galaxy Note8: But

164
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.380
Galaxy Note8: I need to be able to

165
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:19.170
Galaxy Note8: Me, I'm, I'm, it's a little late, but I need to be able to just finally move forward without feeling like I'm the earth is freezing around my ankles and I can't move.

166
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:38.040
Galaxy Note8: So I literally will become like a paralytic, I'm just stuck. And I think it most of the time, or I have to make a nasty choice if it's like to my family. Each week, and something you know in my own demons and my job. I always have to quit my job because

167
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.750
Galaxy Note8: That's what pays the bills.

168
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:48.240
Galaxy Note8: Yeah, so everything else goes by the wayside and that's not right. That's not right. I don't want to live like that so

169
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.250
Galaxy Note8: That's one thing.

170
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, what do you do for a living. Can I ask

171
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.370
Galaxy Note8: Um, I'm medical regulatory writer for the European Union.

172
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.440
Galaxy Note8: I read safety reports for

173
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.250
Galaxy Note8: Implanted cardiovascular devices.

174
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.270
Wow.

175
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is that I can understand why that is a stressful.

176
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:23.580
Galaxy Note8: And my team is all over the world. You know, so it's a

177
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:30.630
Galaxy Note8: Lot long hours, really, you know, it's really long hours, or should be long hours.

178
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:41.940
Galaxy Note8: That you know i i just have never been able to to like pat my head and rub my stomach. At the same time, we would have been a

179
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.380
Little exercises or yeah

180
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.560
Galaxy Note8: I can do one thing at a time. I can multitask at work.

181
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.630
Galaxy Note8: I can do that really well.

182
00:23:51.840 --> 00:24:05.190
Galaxy Note8: I don't know why it's like a sub sort of a savant idiot savant everything you just crazy. And then I work, I can parse things up. And, you know, get it done.

183
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:13.920
Galaxy Note8: But maybe I just don't think as highly of myself or think I'm worth the effort to

184
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:30.600
Galaxy Note8: To figure out, sit down and really figure out how to move through some rough waters was like I said with my job. I don't have a choice. I do what I did I not in my lifetime. I don't have a choice.

185
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.230
Right.

186
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.110
Galaxy Note8: I don't know.

187
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:40.350
Galaxy Note8: I don't like always, choosing my job, or maybe it's easier, it's very complicated. And then I start

188
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.570
Galaxy Note8: Talking about it and just going up going

189
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.240
Galaxy Note8: bonkers.

190
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that, you know, we

191
00:24:52.230 --> 00:25:00.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We grow up, understanding that in order for us to survive and make it in this world, we have to work. And so, you know, that becomes the forefront of everything.

192
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:04.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because without work, you have no home without the home. Yeah. You know what I mean. And

193
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's there's a piece of that. And you know, it's not that you put work first. But you understand that without work you have nothing else. You can't survive. You can't take care of your family. You can't pay the bills.

194
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do these things. And so we kind of get in this autopilot you know thing that work at. We got to go to work. We got to go to work.

195
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and

196
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that has a lot to do with the way that we were raised, you know, with, you know, with the way that we

197
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the way we view the world as well. You know, that's a piece of it too.

198
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:55.290
Galaxy Note8: I think you're absolutely right. I think that, especially in this country is since I've traveled to other countries and stayed in other countries for the

199
00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:06.480
Galaxy Note8: Longest six months and observed other cultures, like in Israel. They have totally different hierarchy family is really key.

200
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One.

201
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:13.470
Galaxy Note8: Mm hmm. And then work, then they work very hard over there, those

202
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.120
Galaxy Note8: Are hard working people.

203
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.790
Galaxy Note8: But they're not obsessed like we are.

204
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:27.480
Galaxy Note8: And I don't think that a good Israeli citizen would would kind of say, Okay, I can't deal with my family right next. I've got a job, you know,

205
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.830
Galaxy Note8: Yeah, find time to eat together and cook, and it's just different.

206
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. We've moved from a society that we, you know, work to

207
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Live to live to work.

208
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, that's really not.

209
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:53.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's just not what life supposed to be about. But that is exactly what our culture is moved into, you know, without work. You can't have you can't survive and take care of the family, but

210
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the same sense of family gets

211
00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:04.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, pushed aside, I get it. I'm right with you in that way. You know, it's like, you know, we got to pay the bills and

212
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I totally understand that.

213
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.460
Galaxy Note8: No. Okay, so

214
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:17.550
Galaxy Note8: What it up, that the emperor is wearing no clothing. We can't keep doing this. Yeah, there's a generation of kids now that I'm observing

215
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:32.490
Galaxy Note8: Who aren't doing that well teenagers from my generation, my generation parents at these kids who are kind of lost. Yeah, I mean, a lot of my friends have problems with their adult children.

216
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.620
Galaxy Note8: And there's not a lot of pain and that's

217
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.700
Galaxy Note8: You can see the arrow pointing you know

218
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.120
Yeah.

219
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:50.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and it's just the way that society is geared it, you know, and then we wonder why you no wonder why you know they have so many problems. Well, hello.

220
00:27:50.430 --> 00:28:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When the mom and the dad or the mom is working, you know, 5060 hours a week and is not able to emotionally support the child. Yeah, that's exactly what happens.

221
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:02.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it.

222
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I totally get it.

223
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so what I hear is that you want to work on emotion regulation.

224
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Learning how

225
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To regulate anxiety, learning how to

226
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: move past it in a moment's notice.

227
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I hear is that you want to work on some self esteem.

228
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:34.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. And my question is, is, are you willing to meet with me either weekly or bi weekly

229
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: While you're engaged with pain management.

230
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:53.190
Galaxy Note8: I could bi weekly. My job is really, it's hard for me to get to sneak off and okay good to an appointment, but bi weekly I could manage okay um, that would be okay.

231
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what would be your ideal day and time.

232
00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:59.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That would be

233
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:13.710
Galaxy Note8: Any day that's not Monday or Tuesday. Those are the bad days at the beginning of the weekend, everything is falling apart over the weekend. So, and I'm bleeding. The team now. So it's, um,

234
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.640
Galaxy Note8: Yeah, Mondays and Tuesdays are heard.

235
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.510

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.060

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.190

241
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.660
Galaxy Note8: What's that, what's lunch.

242
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:25.140
Galaxy Note8: I have the I usually am pretty free between 1130 and say to anytime within that framework. I don't have any meetings on Thursdays around that time so that you know lunchtime would be a good time.

243
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

244
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.120

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then again,

258
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.020
