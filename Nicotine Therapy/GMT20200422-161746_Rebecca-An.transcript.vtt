Cricket Icon: Oh, your art. Your VIP customer. We just want to get ahold of you or you want to do, taxes, you know, with us again.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:48.150
Cricket Icon: I trusted them because everything when good last year. So I did, I did my taxes with them. And last year, I asked them, you guys.

242
00:28:48.510 --> 00:29:00.060
Cricket Icon: You guys charge anything because if you do, notify me so I know you're going to take out of my taxes they said no we don't charge nothing, you're going to get 100% of your tax refund.

243
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:16.920
Cricket Icon: All is all great last year, it worked out fine. I did. I got 100% of my tax refund back this year they they got me bad they charged me $1,025 to do my taxes.

244
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:27.120
Cricket Icon: Plus they kept my state check. They got my state check deposit it into their account.

245
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god.

246
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.680
Cricket Icon: So it just it's a big old mass and

247
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:43.950
Cricket Icon: Oh, I call this the the State tax and revenue and I inform them about it and they they told me, they're the ones that that deposit the check into their account.

248
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.830
Cricket Icon: And I was like, whoa. Why would you guys do that like

249
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.500
Cricket Icon: I didn't even request. I don't even have

250
00:29:50.940 --> 00:30:13.980
Cricket Icon: A bank account. I don't even have a bank account linked to to to the to the IRS I I requested checks. So why, why would you guys, you know, just give away my check to just some random account number when when you see that that I received my federal check through

251
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:27.240
Cricket Icon: Through a check. So it just it anyways. The whole point is is that they ripped me off of almost $3,000

252
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That was crazy.

253
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:42.570
Cricket Icon: That was, that was more that was almost more than than what then what I received. So all I was able to do this year was buy a new vehicle because I needed one

254
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

255
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:55.050
Cricket Icon: I wasn't expecting this pandemic to happen and you know because I really wanted to take my daughter shopping, like they do every year, take all my kids shopping all that wild and all the

256
00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:09.090
Cricket Icon: You know, feel like things just thought that we need. And then, you know, just put money, you know, in the savings account. I wasn't able to do that this year because I got ripped off. They literally kept almost close to $3,000

257
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:26.340
Cricket Icon: Oh my god, and I only received have a less than half of what I was supposed to. So when I called them. They told me that they sent my state and my federal check together. And so when I called

258
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:35.670
Cricket Icon: The State tax and revenue they told me that they that that's not even possible. You can't stand it, state and federal checking

259
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.030
Me.

260
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:53.340
Cricket Icon: So so so then finally they they told me to call the attorney general's office. So I call the attorney general's office and they told me to make a complaint. So I tried to make the complaint, but when I when I push submit it says on

261
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.030
Cricket Icon: On the bottom of it. It says error.

262
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:14.700
Cricket Icon: I don't know. It says, that's something, but it doesn't let me submit the complaint. So I called back and now I'm waiting on a phone call back from from the, the person from the IRS to to let me know where to go from here because

263
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:23.790
Cricket Icon: They, they literally sold a lot of money for me. I mean, the old ass said themselves that they're literally doing tax fraud.

264
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.680
Cricket Icon: That are not not supposed to charge more than $500

265
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:35.610
Cricket Icon: To do your taxes. But if they do even charge you 500 they need to give you your money right there and then

266
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.070
Cricket Icon: Like the way to block those

267
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:48.870
Cricket Icon: Yeah, so it just it, it just been just such a tough year and I don't know why all this is happening to me but

268
00:32:50.610 --> 00:33:05.460
Cricket Icon: Like I said, ever since I did that, that experiment and how how I saw how much it affected my life to be negative and positive i'm i'm not i'm not trying to be positive. I mean I means I'm sorry I'm not trying to be named

269
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.200
Cricket Icon: So,

270
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.720
Cricket Icon: Kind of going with the flow.

271
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about your stimulus, maybe got

272
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:21.060
Cricket Icon: The stimulus. No, I actually, I was I was worried about that. As a matter of fact, I was worried about that because

273
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.200
Cricket Icon: I had got an email stating

274
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:50.580
Cricket Icon: I had it was an email of a video saying that this. A lot of people are actually going through the same thing. I'm going through because they did there. They, they did their taxes through a third party which which I I wasn't, I wasn't aware that they were considered a third party.

275
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:57.090
Cricket Icon: Like, that's the thing. They, they should tell you they should have where you have that and be like, and be like, you know,

276
00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:03.000
Cricket Icon: We just want to wear you that we are considered a third party. This is how it works.

277
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:13.470
Cricket Icon: And your, your winner your federal check comes to us first and then and then we take out what we charge. And then we send the rest to you they don't explain any of that to you.

278
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:23.040
Cricket Icon: She said it was free. First of all, so I wasn't expecting anything gets it. Now, out of anyways, to go back to the to the US stimulating check

279
00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:35.610
Cricket Icon: So I, I had a watch this video where a lot of people are dealing with third parties, and if they if they used a bank account.

280
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.210
Cricket Icon: The the

281
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:52.080
Cricket Icon: The government is is depositing their check into the third parties account like just, just like the way the state deposited my my state check

282
00:34:52.350 --> 00:35:03.870
Cricket Icon: Into yeah the their, their account so worried I was like oh my gosh, no that's going to happen to me because I went through a third party as wow and

283
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:12.630
Cricket Icon: My father was one of my brothers ended up giving my father this um it's called you go to, you go to

284
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.960
Cricket Icon: tax.gov

285
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:22.140
Cricket Icon: Yeah. And then, and then you just put in your information and then it and then it tells you

286
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:38.130
Cricket Icon: You know, if you're going to get sent out a check or if it's been it's already been deposited into, you know, bank account, etc. So I did it and it said that no, it said that, uh, that checks going to be sent out on the 24th.

287
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:49.200
Cricket Icon: Yeah, so, thank God. I was so relieved when I saw that I was like oh thank god I don't know bank account so

288
00:35:49.650 --> 00:36:05.580
Cricket Icon: So I know for sure it didn't get deposited into their account because there was no bank account linked to a just as a check is going to be sent out on the 24th. So let's see, when that comes in, you know, it's like I said, everything happens for a reason.

289
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:12.090
Cricket Icon: You know that's hopefully I pray that that comes in out of, out of perfect timing.

290
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

291
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.720
Cricket Icon: Like now I really, really need it.

292
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.320
Yeah.

293
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

294
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that

295
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've been working through like Tax Act, and it's considered a third party to and

296
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

297
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They didn't

298
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They didn't go through them.

299
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:47.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For the stimulus. So it went directly into my bank account. So that's a good thing. So if they're going to mail you the check and not and totally bypass that third party.

300
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. It'll go

301
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To your house.

302
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.680
Cricket Icon: It won't go well.

303
00:36:52.950 --> 00:37:10.110
Cricket Icon: Well, the great thing is I, I believe the reason why, if I want to, called the, the State tax and revenue and then call the attorney general's office and aware of them. What these people are up to like their name. They're literally doing tax fraud.

304
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:16.710
Cricket Icon: YEAH, IT'S FRAUD. So if I want to called and aware them of this

305
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.400
Cricket Icon: It would have got deposited into their account.

306
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.450
Cricket Icon: Yeah, so being that I called I saved myself.

307
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.440
Cricket Icon: Yeah, I

308
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:33.120
Cricket Icon: At that time, at that time, I wasn't even like they weren't even talking about this, this, this, this.

309
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:44.370
Cricket Icon: Chat that that they want to give to all of us. They weren't even talking about that at that time at that time. So when I heard about it. I got worried and all like, no.

310
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:57.900
Cricket Icon: Because I'm dealing with the third party and then I watched that video, but no. But everything's good though. In other words, so yeah it's showing that that checks coming in. So everything's everything's going to be good hobby.

311
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, really good. I'm glad.

312
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.010
Cricket Icon: Yeah.

313
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, yes, no cancellation, but

314
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:22.380
Cricket Icon: Yeah, I know. I'm just, I'm just wondering, um, I, I, I don't know where to get this answer from so I was able to claim my son Montez because remember how I told you about the state situation.

315
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:39.690
Cricket Icon: Yeah. So last year I was able to claim him and 2018 because I was seeing him pretty much every day and I was taking him close. So I was pretty much providing for him it would you were just pretty much sleeping with other people.

316
00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:48.570
Cricket Icon: So I was able to claim him and 2000 and 2004 Oh, they are able to create claim him and

317
00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:52.170
Cricket Icon: And

318
00:38:52.260 --> 00:39:08.430
Cricket Icon: So what what I'm wondering because they're going to give $500 to each child, but I wasn't able, I, I didn't claim him this year. So I don't know. I think I'm going to call back

319
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.910
Cricket Icon: The, the gentleman that gave me that that tax.gov website.

320
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.470
Cricket Icon: Yeah, I'm going to pull him back and ask him if I'm still going to get

321
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:25.980
Cricket Icon: A a stimulus check for my son Montez being that I didn't

322
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.470
Cricket Icon: Being that I didn't

323
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.380
Cricket Icon: I didn't. Uh, oh my gosh, my mind is just everywhere.

324
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.750
Cricket Icon: You didn't. Yes. I didn't claim him for for 2019

325
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who claimed it

326
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:46.890
Cricket Icon: But I did came in 2018 so am I still going to get a check for him.

327
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who claimed him.

328
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.190
Cricket Icon: He didn't he, he didn't get claimed

329
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.170
Cricket Icon: By any by me or his father, um,

330
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:02.280
Cricket Icon: The reason why I didn't claim him is because

331
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:09.300
Cricket Icon: Last year of 2019 they they provided a lot more

332
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:19.410
Cricket Icon: For him, and then I then then I was, I tried to provide for him. I will buy him new clothes etc shoes.

333
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:38.100
Cricket Icon: You know, I gave them. I gave them my my food stamps everything and they just, they just didn't want to accept it. They didn't want to accept it. I just think, honestly, I honestly think they wanted to provide for him so that they could claim him.

334
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:39.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, is

335
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.130
Cricket Icon: The, the woman that I was taking care of and pretty.

336
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.390
Cricket Icon: Much another

337
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thought so she was getting she was getting monies from the state to

338
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.300
Cricket Icon: Yes. Yeah, right.

339
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To take care of him.

340
00:40:52.680 --> 00:41:07.320
Cricket Icon: Yes, exactly. And it's like, it's like it's kind of unfair because it's like I it's not it's not like it's not like if I didn't want. It's not like if I didn't want to provide for my son that

341
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:11.340
Cricket Icon: Is wrong to you just didn't accept it.

342
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:22.770
Cricket Icon: Yeah. And I know that's the reason why because she wanted to clean my son. She wanted to say no I provided for him all year I bind pose all year. I

343
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:32.940
Cricket Icon: I bought food all year for him. No, I took care of them all year and and it, it wasn't like that, you know, it's like I said I was with him. Most the time

344
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:42.240
Cricket Icon: But he would go back to her, you know, so I just didn't want to get in trouble with the IRS. I didn't want them to see that two people were claiming

345
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:52.650
Cricket Icon: Yeah i i'm not 100% sure if she claimed if she claimed him, but I'm sure she did just being that that she didn't accept anything for me last year.

346
00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:57.810
Cricket Icon: Yeah, I mean, it's obvious that that she's, she's gonna claim him so I

347
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.240
Cricket Icon: get in trouble with the IRS.

348
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:11.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know if she can claim him if or if the state doesn't hold on to that claim because they're actually the ones that provided her like she would have gotten clothing vouchers for him.

349
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:12.000
Cricket Icon: Or

350
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She would have gotten

351
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:23.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, food stamps, she would have gotten full medical she would have gotten a monthly cash amount for taking care of them.

352
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:24.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

353
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:30.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know how I really don't know how it works in that arena.

354
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As the state actually took care of him more than she did.

355
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:37.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

356
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:45.210
Cricket Icon: She, she was pretty much just a caretaker, but they were they were the providers.

357
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.160
Cricket Icon: Yeah, see, we're providing the state. So yeah, so that's that's exactly what I thought.

358
00:42:52.050 --> 00:43:09.750
Cricket Icon: If it's not her that's going to pay me and then obviously the states and the claim in because they they told her not to accept anything from me, because the day accepted everything in 2018 so I was able to play them 2018 and I don't think they liked it.

359
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.100
Cricket Icon: Yeah, so in 2019 they said don't accept nothing from her.

360
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:20.220
Cricket Icon: So that us to stay or or her or, you know, it sounds right. The state.

361
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:20.910
Cricket Icon: Yeah.

362
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think they say

363
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:29.580
Cricket Icon: To themselves don't accept nothing from her so that we could pay him, you know, because they'll go get a lot more money than then I would

364
00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya know,

365
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:31.680
That

366
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:40.650
Cricket Icon: Terrible. I don't want to end up going back to the IRS and all that. So I didn't claim him. But now I don't know if I'm going to get a check.

367
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.850
Cricket Icon: His $500 which I need

368
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.660
Cricket Icon: Because like I said, I, I haven't back for good now.

369
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.640
Cricket Icon: You know, so

370
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:52.830
Cricket Icon: This

371
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's

372
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.420
Something

373
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:57.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there's a lot

374
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:08.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There is a lot. But you know what, you stay true to your faith you try it. You know, you stay true to your higher power you stay true to you know looking at

375
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:09.990

376
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:14.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The positive stuff and I'm telling you, it will everything's going to work out.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're doing the work. You know what I mean.

379
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:19.920
Cricket Icon: Yeah.

380
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:21.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and I have to

381
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Artist, I have to believe that everything is going to be okay and get better, you know,

382
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:41.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I totally am on board with your positive way of thinking, because that's what keeps us in a sane headspace. You know what I mean.

383
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.220
Cricket Icon: It does, yes.

384
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.630
Cricket Icon: It was

385
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.340

386
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:48.930
Cricket Icon: Yes.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.280
Yeah. Hundred percent

388
00:44:52.350 --> 00:45:16.140
Cricket Icon: I I told myself, why didn't I do this experiment, a long time ago, you know, because they really help the way I'm thinking, you know, just, just the way I'm handling myself, not, not that I wasn't handling myself while before but but I was getting negative thoughts, you know,

389
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:26.880
Cricket Icon: Yeah, from time to time, you know, and I didn't like it because like I said it was affecting my kids, it was affecting everybody around me, and I didn't realize it.

390
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:36.810
Cricket Icon: Until I finally said, you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna, I'm going to be negative one day, like I told you, and and it it really showed a big difference.

391
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:53.100
Cricket Icon: Yeah, so I'm just keeping negative out of my head. And I'm just thinking like everything's gonna be okay. And I'm not, I'm not putting in my mind at all that that's things are gonna go wrong in any way or nothing. Just everything's going to work out.

392
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.420
Cricket Icon: You know, you know, just the way it's meant to be. And that's

393
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.580

464
00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And and so being able to start getting it out and releasing it god that does wonders for your mind for your

479
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:14.520
Michelle Espinoza: I don't know, there's not that much stuff going on over here. I still get scared to go out and stuff. My, my anxiety still the same.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:22.290
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, I don't know why it's the same because I'm always home. It's not like I go anywhere. But I think just knowing that I can't grow now.

Michelle Espinoza: But yeah, getting warmer, it's not so cold. I mean, I'm sleeping without my heater now because that heater was just missing my throat up I would wake up.

492
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:42.870
Michelle Espinoza: stuffy and I would cough and I'm like, I hope I'm not getting sick and then that gets in my head. You know, because I get sick really fast, no matter what. And then now allergy season around. So I'm waiting for that to hit me.

493
00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I just start feeling better now. I got allergies that are coming

494
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:57.810
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, yeah. But it really hits me for a while, it doesn't hit me that bad, but like the winners like me and my daughter were talking yesterday, just

495
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:13.260
Michelle Espinoza: Like all this stuff that's going on. Like, I wonder how it's going to be this coming winter, you know, we're already thinking about winter and we haven't even past summer yet because I get like i said i get sick a lot. So we were just like, well, I know that I have to get my flu shot early

496
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.840

497
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:24.540
Michelle Espinoza: Just give my medicines here, you know, make sure I have my medicines and stuff here at home. And if I'm feeling kind of sick, not just not to go out, you know,

498
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:27.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, or maybe

499
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe with all of the work that you're that you're doing. Maybe this coming winner, you won't get as sick as much

500
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:46.650
Michelle Espinoza: You know. Well, it's because I really don't. I don't. Well, like I was in prison and there really wasn't much to do about, you know, I was going to taking classes as much as I can for my time to go by.

501
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:53.400
Michelle Espinoza: And I did. I think I got. Well, I went to the emergency once this year and I had the flu pretty bad.

502
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:06.210
Michelle Espinoza: And then I would get. I mean, I got a couple. I mean I got sick. A couple times. Like my stomach was, you know, was throwing up and stuff like that, but not as bad as that one time that I had to go to the ER and I usually go to the year like two or three times a year.

503
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:12.240
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, there's times like I'll get walking pneumonia and stuff like that. So, I mean, I was pretty blessed this year.

504
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:13.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

505
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:14.190

531
00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:33.570
Michelle Espinoza: When the difference of her seen her the way she was. And then once she saw the urn, because I think that's the way I was to, you know, you heard so much but once you see the body. It's just like a little relief that comes out of you.

532
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.010
Michelle Espinoza: Like we know

533
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:45.570

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:31.770
Michelle Espinoza: You know my grandma passing away and stuff like that. And then you know me getting abused and just all that stuff to, you know, and I'm just surprised. I'm still here.

553
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:41.460
Michelle Espinoza: With everything that's gone through I've gone through some roads, it's, it's amazing that I'm still here actually just yeah Miley know you right now.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.310
Michelle Espinoza: Right, yeah, that's

555

559
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:05.010
Michelle Espinoza: You know, but you know if I can accomplish that I still I still have a long ways to go in this world.

560
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:07.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right, you got a lot of it's not done.

561
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:20.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and a lot of stuff to do. You know, sometimes we wonder why we go through what we go through and you know it doesn't make sense. While we're going through it. But at the end of it all.

562
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's like we can see a clearer picture of the path and of the stuff you know a lot of stuff still doesn't make sense. You know, definitely, but it definitely allows us to change our focus, you know,

563
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:42.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From the negative stuff that we've gone through to the positive that we still can experience. You know what I mean.

564
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:45.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's a lot of living to be to be had.

565
01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:59.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in every single day and it's about, you know, changing that mindset and to being I am no longer a victim. I am a survivor and I am tough. I can do this and

566
01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god, look at those beautiful flowers.

567
01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:03.000

Michelle Espinoza: Yeah.

570
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:11.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The simple things around us that that we take for granted on a regular basis, you know,

571
01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:18.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's when we face adversity in life. You know, there's this whole story about love. The dandelions.

572
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like you know dandy lines are going in the butt and they grow and they just spread and they're just

573
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:26.730
Michelle Espinoza: Everywhere.

574
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, they just

575
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:37.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And instead of, you know, looking at them like you know they are a pain in the butt and they, you know what I mean.

576
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're a hinderance in life.

577
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:44.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just switch that thinking to thinking, I don't know why they're spreading like they're spreading but

578
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're beautiful in themselves.

579
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:47.580
Michelle Espinoza: You know,

580
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:53.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just really kind of taken that and looking at it in a whole different light, you know,

581
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.620
Michelle Espinoza: You you see one, you're going to see more

582
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.640
Yeah.

583
01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cuz there there there.

584
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:08.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was, it's a big story and I can't remember the whole thing, word for word. But, you know, there it was about

585
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:18.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This guy who was struggling with even as long, the way that he wanted it and you know these dandy lines kept popping up and kept popping up and he did everything he could to

586
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:33.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to get rid of them. And then he noticed that they were all in his neighbors yards to and they're not fighting the dandelions. And they're not, you know, it's a big epidemic of these things that are growing all down history. And so he like

587
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:33.600
Michelle Espinoza: He

588
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:43.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: writes this letter to the mayor and says, We have a huge issue you know we we have this big, you know, big epidemic of these dandelions that I can't get rid of it, you know.

589
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:51.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The mayor's response back to him was pretty much, you know, instead of fighting it. Love that Andy lions.

590
01:03:52.140 --> 01:04:00.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, change your thought process around the dandelions instead of making them, you know, thinking that they're a hindrance. Look at the beauty and you know what you have in your yard.

591
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:15.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And it was kind of funny to me because that's really kind of what we have to we have to do right now you know so much going on and chaos and that outside world. And it's about finding beauty in that one. Not one hour, you know,

592
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, yeah. I just can't imagine

593
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:28.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My head this guy being so frustrated and buying all these chemicals and trying to kill this thing and you know it's a lie. It's a lot bigger than just his yard.

594
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.450
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah.

595
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the moral of the story.

596
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.000
You know,

597
01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:34.620

604
01:04:54.450 --> 01:05:03.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You are making it you're doing more than making it you are healing. You know what I mean, you're walking through this stuff and you're releasing all of that toxic.

605
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know poison that was going through your body. And again, I bet this year you keep going on with the MTR you keep, you know, releasing all of that stuff.

606
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm telling you everything in your life is going to get better, or it's going to feel better.

607
01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're going to continue to feel better. You know what I mean. I bet you, you'll get sick less this year because you think about all of that stuff. All of that toxic in our body. It weighs down our body. It lowers our immune system. You know what I mean.

608
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I bet you're getting better.

609
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.540

01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:43.170
