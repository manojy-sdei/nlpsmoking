36
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.520
Corey’s iPhone: And I just had, I had some court stuff come up and I just was feeling really down about myself in the situation.

37
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.570
ANN MENDENHALL: And

38
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.750
Corey’s iPhone: I started using and just having trouble stopping

39
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.010
Okay.

40
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.410
ANN MENDENHALL: And so when, when did you relapse. When did you just two months ago.

41
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.110
Corey’s iPhone: It's been two months ago, I think yesterday.

42
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.220
Okay.

43
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.260
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, good for kind of getting back on so quickly. I mean that's that's not that's not too long, but

44
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:02.850
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And I noticed in in sort of the, the intake. They did that you had one OD, is that right

45
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.470
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, long time ago I did have one overdose. It's been about

46
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.930
Corey’s iPhone: Seven, eight years ago.

47
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.890
Okay.

48
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.740
ANN MENDENHALL: Did you go to the ER for that.

49
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.150
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, I did, yes.

50
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.760
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

51
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.660
Corey’s iPhone: Just a day.

52
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.280
Corey’s iPhone: One day overnight.

53
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:49.620
ANN MENDENHALL: And also, have you ever had. I didn't see this in your, your screening, but I always like to just double check was that overdose a suicide attempt or

54
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.290
Corey’s iPhone: No, it wasn't. It wasn't even actual from the drug. I tried to

55
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:04.080
Corey’s iPhone: It was like, I went to a clinic and they gave me this this pill and it was supposed to be like an opiate blocker or something but

56
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.540
Corey’s iPhone: I don't know what happened. It just, it put me in like a frickin comatose. It was weird.

57
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.180
ANN MENDENHALL: It wasn't Suboxone

58
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.980
Corey’s iPhone: No, ma'am. That's how I got clean after the five years was from Suboxone

59
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.450
Corey’s iPhone: There was an I don't even remember the name of it. It was like a new trial trial thing.

60
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.180
Corey’s iPhone: And actually my, my father was using at the time, too.

61
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.480
Corey’s iPhone: And he took the same pill and ended up in the hospital, too. So

62
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.990
Corey’s iPhone: It wasn't from the actual drug

63
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.840
ANN MENDENHALL: It was whatever they gave you to

64
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.910
Corey’s iPhone: Do is whatever they gave me. Yes.

65
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.650
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah.

66
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.310
Corey’s iPhone: Still to this day I have tried to research it, but I can't find it, what it is, but

67
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.370
ANN MENDENHALL: If you ever find out you have to let me know.

68
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.850
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, I definitely will. It was like a little blue pill.

69
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.560
ANN MENDENHALL: Great.

70
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.150
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And so when when you withdraw from here and what are your most significant withdrawal symptoms.

71
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.340
Corey’s iPhone: Just like really bad anxiety and I feel like, you know,

72
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.140
Corey’s iPhone: Like kind of my body's just really, really weaken

73
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.850
Corey’s iPhone: Like almost like I just can't relax you know

74
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.870
Sure.

75
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.160
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you, do you get the sort of other kind of fairly normal ones like

76
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.070
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, cheering and runny nose.

77
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.610
Corey’s iPhone: And then like the rest, you know, stomach pain from just not been not using the restroom properly all the time.

78
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.840
Yeah.

79
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.200
ANN MENDENHALL: Hey,

80
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.920
ANN MENDENHALL: Alrighty.

81
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:13.740
ANN MENDENHALL: And have you had any consequences of your opiate use and that would be legal, like, you know, do you wise or RAS or

82
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:21.630
Corey’s iPhone: Not in the past. I did. I had a lot of stuff like transporting and

83
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.190
Corey’s iPhone: I could get some DUIs in the past. Okay.

84
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.720
ANN MENDENHALL: This

85
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.850
Corey’s iPhone: This started use since my relapse. I've had no contact with police or anything like that.

86
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.840
Okay.

87
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.020
ANN MENDENHALL: How long ago where those other ones.

88
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.520
Corey’s iPhone: They were

89
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.680
Corey’s iPhone: Six years ago.

90
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.280
Corey’s iPhone: Seven years

91
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.600
Okay.

92
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.200
ANN MENDENHALL: And how about any other substance use, like alcohol bentos

93
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Now,

94
00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.960
Corey’s iPhone: You know, not, not this time I used to use like everything I could get my hands on, but this time it's just been a

95
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.570
Corey’s iPhone: Battle and tear away.

96
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.100
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

97
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.790
ANN MENDENHALL: And have you ever had any detox treatment. You said you were on Suboxone so I assume you must have

98
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.780
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, I did. Yes. And it actually worked wonderful for me.

99
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Yes. Good stuff.

100
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.060
ANN MENDENHALL: And when, when were you on the Suboxone

101
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.630
Corey’s iPhone: It's been about six years, five years ago. Okay.

102
00:08:46.650 --> 00:09:03.990
Corey’s iPhone: I was on a clean streak. I didn't do anything. And I don't. And then I move was in Texas for four years and moved back to ridgecrest about a year and a half ago, and I had some court case come up from like eight years ago. So I was really worried you know

103
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.370
Corey’s iPhone: Using it as like a numbing

104
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:16.080
Corey’s iPhone: You know, trying to get through it. But, OK, now I'm trying to stop and it's hard to do on my own without, you know,

105
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:26.910
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, no. The Suboxone is really a great way because it's going to, you know, the thing that is wonderful about Suboxone as I'm sure you know is

106
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.860
ANN MENDENHALL: It just makes you feel normal.

107
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.460
ANN MENDENHALL: And so

108
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.750
ANN MENDENHALL: You can get back to the

109
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.200
ANN MENDENHALL: Life without, you know, the intense cravings and you know all the

110
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.280
Corey’s iPhone: Stuff along

111
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:42.690
ANN MENDENHALL: With it. So yeah, I'm a big fan of Suboxone. Did you ever do any residential treatment like

112
00:09:43.890 --> 00:10:01.110
Corey’s iPhone: I did try some rehabs I was court ordered when I was 18 to do a rehab and I actually went to teen challenge and a couple other ones. And it was like everywhere I went, it was like, I don't know how. And I know it's kind of hard to believe.

113
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:07.170
Corey’s iPhone: But I ended up relaxing with my counselors at every place. So I just don't know.

114
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.950
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, so I stopped going because I just realized that if I was going to do it. It had to be on my own.

115
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.330
Corey’s iPhone: Free will, you know, like

116
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:27.690
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, that's, that's, Tara. I actually my main job is working at a couple of residential rehabs one in in Calistoga in Napa County one and we're in County and

117
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:39.540
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, they're pretty strict and I can guarantee you that wouldn't happen there. But that makes me so sad to hear because you were there to, you know, to get sober and then tap counselors, you know,

118
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.510
Corey’s iPhone: Like I was like oh

119
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.320
Corey’s iPhone: But like I said, when I got clean that after the five years that I stay clean after that.

120
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.040
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, I had no relapses, no nothing.

121
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:20.430
ANN MENDENHALL: How about any past medical history. Do you have like anything like asthma or diabetes or

122
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:20.880
No.

123
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:22.890
ANN MENDENHALL: No.

124
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.680
Corey’s iPhone: I'm pretty healthy, I had an ulcer. When I was 11

125
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.640
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

126
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:33.720
Corey’s iPhone: But other than that, I've had no no issues. I am add but that, that's it.

127
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.000
Corey’s iPhone: Okay, yeah.

128
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.360
Yeah.

129
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.600
ANN MENDENHALL: Mark that

130
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.430
ANN MENDENHALL: Treated for ADHD. Did you ever take ADHD meds.

131
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.150
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah I did put the medication, they will give me it just

132
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.040
Corey’s iPhone: Really made me feel weird. So I haven't taken anything for it and probably about eight years.

133
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:32.940
Okay.

134
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.540
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, it's essentially speed.

135
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.760
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah yeah

136
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.070
Corey’s iPhone: But I cope with it really well. Now I just put it in different things.

137
00:12:51.030 --> 00:13:02.400
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, well, that's, that's the thing. I mean, I think you can kind of use that to your advantage because when you have that energy it but it's sort of being able to sort of train yourself to focus when you need to focus

138
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:03.900
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah yeah

139
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:12.330
ANN MENDENHALL: My daughter was diagnosed with that and she took her off for a while until she got to college and started selling it and

140
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:23.130
ANN MENDENHALL: Right. Yeah. And then she quit she quit and and now she's you know she just has to, sort of, you know, make herself focus, but you know just

141
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.810
ANN MENDENHALL: Be able to use it to our advantage.

142
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.950
Nice.

143
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.150
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

144
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.560
ANN MENDENHALL: So let's see any

145
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.290

Corey’s iPhone: Just my tonsils taken out.

147
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:48.510
Corey’s iPhone: Okay, and that that's about it. I haven't had I've had like scope off dummies and stuff like that. Just to check for my author, but

148
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:49.980
Corey’s iPhone: That

149
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.190
ANN MENDENHALL: Like an endoscopy.

150
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.290
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, okay.

151
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:15.960

ANN MENDENHALL: So I'm assuming that if you started too soon after use. It's going to throw you into precipitated withdrawals, which is like, yeah.

313
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:23.880
Corey’s iPhone: You know,

314
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:24.810
ANN MENDENHALL: Going to hell.

315
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:26.160
Yeah.

316
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.820
Corey’s iPhone: I remember they told me I had to wait 24 hours in between. Yeah.

317
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:49.920
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, so, you know, the next 24 hours you know you've been a problem start feeling kind of uncomfortable, but if you can wait that whole 24 hours or you know even wait until you get up in the morning, you know, like at eight or nine or something like that.

318
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:55.170
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, this is going to work really well. It's not gonna that's not going to be a problem for you.

319
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.630
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, so I'm gonna have to

320
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.190
ANN MENDENHALL: give you something that looks

321
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.840
Close. Can you see this

322
00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:04.590
Corey’s iPhone: I haven't gotten any paperwork or anything.

323
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:06.180
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

324
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.990
Corey’s iPhone: Are you meaning.

325
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.130
ANN MENDENHALL: When you have you done bright heart before

326
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.050
ANN MENDENHALL: No. Okay. All right. Well, I'm going to have them send, send this to you.

327
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:17.220
Can

328
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.420
ANN MENDENHALL: You see, it looks kind of like a cartoon, in a way.

329
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:27.060
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. What it is, is the how to start taking the Suboxone

330
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.100
ANN MENDENHALL: And so

331
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:35.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Tomorrow, you can take, you know, what I want you to do, I'll just kind of describe it, but then

332
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:51.420
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, they'll, they'll go ahead and send it. I'm going to send the prescription now so you can pick it up today so you know so anytime after four o'clock you know tomorrow morning, you can start it. But so what I'm going to do is

333
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.170
Corey’s iPhone: I have a one question.

334
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.120
Corey’s iPhone: Right. I told them that I

335
00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:04.260
Corey’s iPhone: Was going to get it from Walmart, but I need to change that because they don't longer discount the medicine.

336
00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.100
Corey’s iPhone: Oh, so

337
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.180
Corey’s iPhone: If I could get you guys to send it to the save on. Okay.

338
00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:13.140
Corey’s iPhone: They actually do the RX discounts and it makes it all cheaper for me.

339
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.000
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh yeah, exactly. Why don't you tell me which save on that is

340
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:23.400
Corey’s iPhone: It's in the Walgreens is the only one we have, I believe, or it's in the Albertsons here.

341
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:24.270
Okay.

342
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:33.720
Corey’s iPhone: I think it's either Albertsons or warm or um I think it'll come up. If you search it, but I'm pretty sure it's the Albertsons

343
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:43.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, well before you go, let me get this prescription ready and double check and make sure we're sending it to the right place.

344
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:49.890
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so what what I'm going to do is, because I think you're gonna need

345
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.250
ANN MENDENHALL: At least you know 12 milligrams a day. Do you remember what you took before

346
00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:58.140
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, I took 12 yeah

347
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:05.730
ANN MENDENHALL: That you probably do it you know if you can do it unless great all the better. But I want you

348
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:14.850
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah, what I did last time is I would take half and see how I felt. And then I'd take the other half later, or you know what I mean as needed.

349
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:19.410
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to describe

350
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.010
ANN MENDENHALL: The it's either going to be

351
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.770
ANN MENDENHALL: Films or tablets.

352
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.260
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you remember if you have the same

353
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:32.670
ANN MENDENHALL: Insurance if they covered the tablets or the films or which you have

354
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:40.260
Corey’s iPhone: I believe it was the film's the ones that go under your tongue and the dissolve. It's the little packages.

355
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:41.910
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, okay.

356
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.020
ANN MENDENHALL: So,

357
00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:54.930
ANN MENDENHALL: How this is going to work is to start this out. I'm going to prescribe you know these eight milligram to milligram thumbs.

358
00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.060
ANN MENDENHALL: Suboxone and so start out by cutting it in half and so

359
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:10.050
ANN MENDENHALL: Taking only four milligrams, or eight milligrams total for the strip. So cut it in half and take that and then wait a couple hours and see how you're doing.

360
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:17.160
ANN MENDENHALL: If you feel like you need some more after you know a couple of hours, you can take the other half of it.

361
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:31.740
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and then you know wait a few more hours. See how you're feeling and then you can take actually another half so it would be a total of a half a half a half which equals 12 milligrams for the day.

362
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:32.610
Corey’s iPhone: Okay.

363
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.730
ANN MENDENHALL: What tomorrow. And then if you feel like

364
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:45.270
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, you're still withdrawing toward the end of the day it's possible. The following day. So today is Wednesday. So you're gonna be doing this tomorrow, Thursday.

365
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:59.430
ANN MENDENHALL: It's possible. On Friday, you know that you'll be just good at 12 but if you feel like you're still really withdrawing and having a difficult time it's okay if you want to take that up to 16. So in other words,

366
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:08.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Or two strips. But, you know, cut them in half and sort of divide them up and then depending on how many you end up taking

367
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:16.680
ANN MENDENHALL: You know that the 12 milligrams. It's kind of easier to take it you know for half a strip three times a day.

368
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:22.050
Corey’s iPhone: If you end up going to go up to 16 milligrams, I'd recommend taking

369
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.340
ANN MENDENHALL: A full strip

370
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.690
ANN MENDENHALL: Twice a day just a little bit.

371
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.200
Easier.

372
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.680
ANN MENDENHALL: The other thing that's really important is to not

373
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.780
ANN MENDENHALL: drink anything like

374
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:41.250
ANN MENDENHALL: 30 minutes before and after you take the strip, particularly after because you want to just to absorb

375
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.190
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah waters. Okay, but others.

376
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.420
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, you just want them to work as fast as possible.

377
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.340
ANN MENDENHALL: And it's gives you sort of some

378
00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:04.140
ANN MENDENHALL: You know things to sort of look at, like, I mean, you've done this before. So you're going to know when we're in heavy withdrawal, you just don't want to take it too soon, so you

379
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:15.480
ANN MENDENHALL: Should be really fidgety should be a lot yawning runny nose, tears in your eyes stomach cramps, nausea, muscle aches, all those things that you probably have experienced before.

380
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.720
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. And so, um,

381
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:24.450
ANN MENDENHALL: Just take 12 milligrams tomorrow and but I'm going to give you enough

382
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.780
ANN MENDENHALL: To be able to take up to 16

383
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And are you are you working right now.

384
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.720
Corey’s iPhone: Yes, ma'am. I work

385
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.630
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, what what hours do you should work.

386
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.240
Corey’s iPhone: I work from eight to four.

387
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.660
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, Monday through Friday.

388
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.730
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, okay.

389
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.520
ANN MENDENHALL: Because we have

390
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:56.220
ANN MENDENHALL: THIS ONE THING, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TOLD YOU, BUT WHEN YOU with bright heart health. The way you get your refills, we only start out giving you a weekly

391
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.580
ANN MENDENHALL: Refill at a time you get your refills.

392
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:01.380
ANN MENDENHALL: Is

393
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:04.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Pardon.

394
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:06.870
Corey’s iPhone: It's based in in the labs.

395
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:17.220

Corey’s iPhone: Okay.

397
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.760
ANN MENDENHALL: So which one of those would work best for you.

398
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.900
Corey’s iPhone: You said Wednesday night would probably be the best

399
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:27.750
Corey’s iPhone: Yeah.

400
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.830
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, I think it probably wouldn't work.

401
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:32.490

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.860

425
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.460
ANN MENDENHALL: I'm going to give you enough prescriptions.

426
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.270
To get you

427
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.700
ANN MENDENHALL: Next Thursday.

428
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.770
ANN MENDENHALL: If you don't go to the group until next Wednesday.

429
00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:08.970
ANN MENDENHALL: Then you'll be able to pick up your prescription. The next day, and still have enough. So let me just convert today's here. They do that will soon be starting it actually will be

430
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.210
ANN MENDENHALL: Nine days worth

431
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.430
Corey’s iPhone: And how long does will the treatment go for

432
00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:31.710
ANN MENDENHALL: Um,

433
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:34.830
ANN MENDENHALL: Because I know the last time they

434
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.290
Corey’s iPhone: Like they said, I would have to be like I would only get the Suboxone for a certain amount of time.

435
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.130
Corey’s iPhone: And then they would

436
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:50.730
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, no, no, no, you're going to be able to get it as long as you need it. And that I have people in my group that have been there.

437
00:50:51.600 --> 00:51:04.140
ANN MENDENHALL: For a year, but we also have other people who've been taking it for years. And so nothing wrong with that. Because we've been finding it used to be, people would do a taper and then

438
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:11.010
ANN MENDENHALL: Exactly. Yeah. No, we don't do tapers here because the research that's come up more recently is that

439
00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:15.960
ANN MENDENHALL: Most people that end up tapering off Suboxone or some

440
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.060
Corey’s iPhone: Relapse and so it's

441
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:27.390
ANN MENDENHALL: Much better. You know, and I do really advise you to just figure out what is the lowest dose, you can take feel normal. So that's 12 milligrams, that's

442
00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:28.710
ANN MENDENHALL: Better than 16

443
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.330
ANN MENDENHALL: But if you like I said, if you have to book to 60 minutes okay but we don't have a kind of

444
00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.070
ANN MENDENHALL: And that's why we need you to keep coming to the group's

445
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.480
ANN MENDENHALL: That's how we prescribe it and then you also have a therapy appointment.

446
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.360
Corey’s iPhone: Okay, thank you.

447
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:56.040

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.310
ANN MENDENHALL: What is that sound.

458
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.020

I'm sorry.

461
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.840
ANN MENDENHALL: It's not bothering me. I was just trying to figure out what what's

462
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:46.320
Corey’s iPhone: Happening with it. Sorry.

463
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.310
ANN MENDENHALL: That's okay.

464
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.490
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, let's see. All right, so your prescription is sent.

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.900
Corey’s iPhone: Okay, and

468
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:25.230
ANN MENDENHALL: I'll send them a little note about that too. So I think, I think it kind of covers it, so I'll be seeing you in the group, but do you have any other questions for me right now.

469
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:28.680
Corey’s iPhone: No, ma'am, the taper question was my only question.

472
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.350
ANN MENDENHALL: People, I think you like it.

473
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:41.460
Corey’s iPhone: Okay, thank you.

474
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.510

ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, bye.

477
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:49.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

478
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.700
ANN MENDENHALL: So I, I lost some of

479
00:54:54.870 --> 00:55:00.240
ANN MENDENHALL: What we you know I had entered in the chart, which, you know, I sometimes do with new patients.

480
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:20.370
ANN MENDENHALL: Thank God for this recording, so you can pick it back up and it was mainly an API. Something always keeps always comes up in that family history of where I'm unable to save. And then if you get out of it, you've lost the whole chart. So you're going to have to bring it up again anyway.

481
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:36.000
ANN MENDENHALL: His pre BAM score his risk or was six, and his protective score was 17 he's had no suicide attempts, and has no current suicidal ideation, it shouldn't hallucinations, etc.

482
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:46.950
ANN MENDENHALL: He had one overdose, about seven or eight years ago is, you know, you'll probably see in that recording, but it doesn't sound like well

483
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:56.370
ANN MENDENHALL: I mean you can attribute it to the heroin that he was taking at the time, but he evidently was giving given some experimental drug, as was his

484
00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:14.100
ANN MENDENHALL: Father, who also was a heroin user. And I don't know if it through them into precipitated withdrawals, or what it was. He doesn't know the name of it. I'm not sure what it was either, but he was in the ER for that. But it was not a suicide attempt. He was actually trying to get sober so

485
00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.000
ANN MENDENHALL: I think that's it. Thank you. Bye.
